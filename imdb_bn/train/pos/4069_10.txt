At the moment listening to the soundtrack, the images come back with a transparency that makes it very strong in dry eyes (so that it is able to type). I have seen it twice, and I'll be ashamed to see it * only * twice. <br /> <br /> I have seen all Miyazaki and studio Ghabali movies, and they are nothing less than superiority. (Which was probably for Nusika, even non-plus-Ultra Mega is too premature in the non-cut-off version). Yet, their power sometimes becomes their weaknesses, because they can get very na√Øve (positive), or more intelligent, somewhat clear / moral (monologue). At least, for example, other Ghabli Master Takhata (Firefighter's Cemetery / Just Yesterday / Rukan War). But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> Laputaya Miyazaki describes all the brilliant tales that the tales of the story have been gathered together for ages and have been completely perfected, mixed with some morale, but not entirely incomplete atmosphere, but as with the humor and joy of Toro Every single character is perfectly illustrated by their doubts and fears and their qualities that help them overcome their difficulties. Panning is so perfect that I do not know anything except a black hole which will be able to apply such a gravitational pressure on your entirety. This story is highlighted in a light of mysteries, but when you see a glimpse of the great secret that you are going to uncover when the girl is floating with the sky, subconscious, rocking, and the main theme goes into it. , But the story stabilizes, and gradually, with some cautionary scenes and timeless beauty creates an unforgettable measure like visible, amazing, hope, beauty, depressing days of downstream days, eventually seeing a clear morning horizon and looking at the distance as well as looking at the distance Laughing laughing laughing laughing and laughing, he said, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <b r /> When you start your credit, your eyes have dried up and you have lost your mind, you have to see a therapist. <br /> <br /> Since technically-image-based some recent Miazakis can be even more vicious, it remains to me its undisputed masterpieces. If you take a fraction of a second to understand by creating it in 1986, you can only conclude that Haibo Miyazaki is a genius who is once displayed once every 200 years. Of course, it has been suggested earlier, but this is the only film that can portray a completely ordinary picture on my own. If you missed it during your lifetime, you would die by a huge gap - which would be unfortunate, like the price of coffins is the same.
