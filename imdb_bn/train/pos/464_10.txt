I fell in love with Emily Watson at Wave Breaking, then Hilary and Jackie were more impressed by their range and comfort. Now there is a stunning screenplay of a rich girl, who apparently breaks the repressive and congressional party's mother's tortured soul in mother tongue for the mother's needs. His eyes are a mirror to his soul - and they are gentle and beautiful eyes. <br /> <br /> Those who take it in the literal sense will greatly disappoint the poetic and metaphorical direction of Marilyn Garris. Those picturized metaphorical poems of romantic romantic who are willing to go with the amazing activity are rewarded well.
