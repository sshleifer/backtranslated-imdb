These are superb - wonderful acting, dresses, clothes, music - but mostly in the story itself. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised this movie does not have much reviews - certainly one of the best ones in the 1980's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br officer is in a hospital near the war, shell shock and full flashes, without any idea of ​​his name, origin, or anywhere, he is proven to be a rich man - when he "restores ", Then he is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Alan Bates, Anne Margaret (What's Wonderful and Wonderful Casting Choice), Glenda Jackson, Julie Christie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This will be with you forever.
