Who voted this rating? "Jackinf" is a beautiful acting, brilliantly working, especially the actor of Ed Harris and Pearl's Robert Dinner (not to mention this guy's Marlon Brando in the same breath - see "taxi driver" for confirmation of this point). It's a 'movie' movie because it does not have sex / meaningless action / nudity. About the complexity of the characters involved in this movie. Ed Harris makes you feel every moment with her and her emotional explosion towards the end is impressive. Where he ordered a young man to take a military garment in a bar, how fashion and movies exploit in a tragic situation, and how frustrating it is to feel frustrated to see the real man watching a young sportsman's uniform. Although we have "casino" out of 10, 7.8 out of this? One of the greatest films of all time, the greatest film actor of all time, has played the greatest film psychologist gangster of all times, more than just the average of all-time greatest directors? Come on !!!!!
