This little praise movie is one of my favorites. I can see over over. Dreyfas and Braga are fantastic, but Raul Julia steals this show! The tongue-in-cheeks, the gentle luminous Gomes Adams, with the perfect tone for this overwhelming wonder of this incomplete story. <br /> <br /> Generally incomplete and unpredictable, paradro over paradro lets you test the reality and the screen is fun to join. Two thumbs up!
