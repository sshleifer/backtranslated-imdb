I saw this movie in Paris a little independent movie a few days ago. It was my last evening French capital and I could choose the best-by-the-way. Through these 20 episodes, I collected the impressions collected in Paris in the heart-warming method, without quitting between kits or sensual skaltz. Each episode is full of surprises, strong emotions and consultative pictures and each small film is guided by a good short story rule. To me, such a movie demands more talent and quality of the writer and quality writer than an epic two hour drama, and all of them are successful in their work! The stories have been carefully selected about their matching Arrondissement and fully express their respective bias. Each episode was seen from a different ankle, a different issue, a different style and still twenty stories turned into a harmonic orchestra of movies. My Opinion With the idea of ​​an episode movie, the most extravagant feature is actually built on the idea that you can switch beyond the danger of overloading the feelings and feelings of additional people, while on the other side: sadness, finesse, pure joy, frustration, anger, anxiety, curiosity or Emotions give the movie a unique innovation and similarity. And do not forget about all the things of love! Love for love for this project for love and love between characters and Paris and the love of actors / actresses. I do not want to go into the details of many people's episodes but world-renowned actresses and actresses around the world have to highlight this range and highlight their views on this project. Some have played with their pictures, some have broken it completely and some have explained the stereotypes associated with their country or country's role, so the interaction was given through the film. All I can absolutely recommend this great collage and DVD will be looking forward to its release.
