Excellent movie with a great soundtrack expanding through 70m and 80's rock landscape. Radiofressesia describes a generation, describing the life of a small village near Koregao (the gate of the city of Ligabu, who inspired the movie), it describes the lives and problems of the world. It reminds Trainspotting, with Italian touch bits.
