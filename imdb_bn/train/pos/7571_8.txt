This game is far above all the places. The graphics were really good so the PS2 was honoring my mines at. Voice acting was above the standard. The difficulty level is correct. According to Wessker, the best character in the RE series. The story makes me amazed and I do not expect that it has taken many different turns. The eligibility of this game is only great rating.
