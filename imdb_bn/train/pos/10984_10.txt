In response to one question, it should be promptly asked: If this film was made, but did not have the aunt and cousin of women, Jackie Lynn, Kennedy, Onassis? Answer: Probably not. <Br <br /> <br /> But, thanks, they (or were) Jackie's cousin and aunt. <br /> <br /> The brothers in this brain (none of which can say life too short) Edith B. Beel, Junior, and her daughter Edith Bouvier's BL (Eddie), the debris of the train has the same application - you do not want to see but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Eddie live in East Hampton, New York, once in a grand palace, which gradually wanders around them. Once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> A fine oily figure (with a cat on the floor behind them) and their beautiful portraits against the wall on the wall over the wall on the wall. Old Magazine Cover. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Edie's favorite dress is a pair of pants hose and pieces into pieces and pieces into pieces and peep around her head and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith said "Eddie 56 is still beautiful." And indeed he is Many times she is almost luminescent and show the beauty of both women that were once there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Strange to be courteous. Ice cream crackers spread over. For the birthday of Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread Sandwich, the dinner party provided fine Chinese plastic containers. <br /> <br /> The time their world is irrelevant. As the ED says, "I have no clock." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He says, "If you can not get a man to offer to you, then you too can die." Edith answers, "I will take the dog sometime. <br /> <br /> It does not see the role of Edith's lack of male music. At the beginning of the film, he said," France has fallen, but Ed does not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's hard to hear what's being said right. Both women talk at the same time and contradict each other. <BR> <br /> There is a strange relationship with animals across the whole movie; Eddie is feeding the undercooked bread and cats with raccoons. There are cats (and many of them there) everywhere. <br /> <br /> At one point, Eddie declared "the responsibility of the nobility." But they seem unable to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> It's a tough movie but worth the effort to see it.
