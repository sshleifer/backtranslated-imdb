Cinderella In my opinion, the greatest love story of all time I have ever liked it as a kid and I now like it a wonderful Disney Masterpiece, it liked 1 Disney of my favorite movies. I could hit Cinderella and Disney throughout the day, but I will not give you a brief outline of the story. When a young father dies, he has to stay with his mother's evil step and sister with her ugly and ugly step sister Drussila and Anastasia. Every day daily for the Radial House Church, poor Cinderella is surrounded by a small mouse and his dog Bruno as a friend. One day a letter was sent to his house where all the available women were presented for the royal ball. Cinderellas try to prevent her presence from stepping sister to step mother and step sister Cinderell finally gets her dream and gets the desire and is able to participate in her captive beauty, generosity and beautiful nature to win her his princess.
