I love it Fred McMurry is amazing, somewhat proud of Skid Johnson, at the same time proud Saxophone player who loves Maggie (Carroll Lomber), who is always there for her. Maggie left the ship and met Anthony Quinn at the bar and met with Panama. When Tony insulted Maggie with his nose, he stooped his hat. The big explosion and the ending of Maggie Panama stuck. Romance. Carol and Arthur together are great. Whenever she needs her, she always has her. She called her to go to New York (see the movie and find out). He had these amazing marvelous scenes together where he sang his instrument playing saxophone. I definitely recommend it
