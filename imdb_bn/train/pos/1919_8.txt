I do not read books that are based on this book / inspiration. The last act of John Ritter (RIP) is its one (the role of others in the film), one hopes that it is a delight. And it is done. Almost every time he presented this, as a matter of fact. Most cast, supportive and regular, play well with each other and the material is going to be great. He is the father of three teenagers: Paul Hennessy: Rory, the ideal man of that age, Kerry, struggles for the cause and awareness of depressed middle class children, and bridget, fashion-loving, popular dazz. Sagal makes a return to be female lead in a sit-com, and his character is moved far away from Peggy Bundy. There has been some change in the side of Mr. Three Company, and for a while they could not remember their mind if they want to laugh or grieve and want to be respected. Someone might think that how long it lasted or why: It could still be quite good, some links were lucky (if you liked David Spad, most of his was doing his schtick) and he had something to say. My favorite favorite is in the last season. Humor is an excellent mix of "fools" Jokes (mainly related to high school), silencer, dark comedy and crude elements. These deal with sex and other adult issues, but not in the graphic manner. Language is light, and, on occasion, medium tough. I recommend this to any fan who made it. 8/10
