I picked it up in the box of Dangar Dark box and saw it completely for Hayd and Gect's performance. I was expecting a scary horror movie that was a huge gore-fest and very bad dialogue. What exactly was it if it had been made in America. Instead I saw myself developing good character, and the show (gacht) was developed by the film. Both star-acting skills were surprisingly good, they thought that they are not professional actors and the director did a great job with it, in the future, it reduced flying cars and holographic billboards. <br /> <br /> Also, Taro Yamamoto's performance was very surprising. I saw him as the only film, the Battle Royale, where he played Shogo Kawada, and in this film he feels the exact opposite of Shogo. Toshi works like a bright, bright and supernatural, comic relief with his antics. The hardest people in Shogo Islands who die without thinking about it. So, look for his performance, if you know the Battle Royale, you will be very surprised by him. <br /> <br /> But the box will never be cast by the essence, because it is not really a vampire movie. It's just a movie with a vampire. The fact that Hyde's character is a wool is really a background true with what's happening in a foreground, and you will love the last scene. It's a really moving picture on some points, photography is really good. There is nothing to pick it next time in Blockbuster.
