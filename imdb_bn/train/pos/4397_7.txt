An incomplete historical drama with some extraordinary battle scenes. Tobey Maguire gives an excellent performance, and gets some pretty good backups. The script is an educated and commendable original, and the film keeps the hero free of charge. That said, pull it a bit, and the last relay is too much like a TV mini series. Nevertheless, Frederick Elmiss's camerawork puts one in the dull bits (and every time you see a shot that reminds you of David Lynch). Worth watching.
