I recently saw this movie due to Jake's recent success with BRACACK Mountain. I think I'll miss that movie I've missed. I had no expectations in the film so I was surprised that I missed this movie. This is an insightful father and son story, and it is an underlying story. I even jumped a tear to end this wonderful story. This movie appeals to all ages. For the only reason I gave it 9 out of 10, it came slowly slowly in the middle but eventually it got stronger again. The performance was great, the story was great, and the film's setting was painted painting. Go see this movie! Rent it, buy it, see it, love it! I know I did!
