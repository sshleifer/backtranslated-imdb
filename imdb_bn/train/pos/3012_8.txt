This is a movie you have not seen before - so you can see it again "for the first time". Van Dine's books still come with great joy - but many of them are very much like flowers. This film is the best film adaptation of his work. William Powell William Powell - Do not say it again. Plot complex The story comes very quickly because you want to end it. Enjoy.
