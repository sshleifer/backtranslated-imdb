I was overwhelmed again by the legendary Balletster Galactica, a show that always guessed me and brought me to tears in more than one occasion. A harsh science-fan fan, I think I can find the best thing from BS, and it was a good thing. So, when I first heard about the prospect of a prick series, a few months ago I got a feeling of grief in my intestine. I was afraid that if the ballotter is so successful then the formula will be successful, it will be used again in the capsule, which will not work. Story of BSG, surviving painful banders, trapped stars hanging on the ship and guided by predictive views and pseudo-miracles, praises perfectly with outstanding music and a good cast of actors. <br /> <br /> Caprica seems different. After the fall of a great civilization, the BSG took place, the capsicika depicts civilization on its cold and frustrating day. The entire Vibinite from Capriarchy was similar to a minority report, too much and retrograde dramatists. In the real BGG form, the first few hours of Capriarchy resolved the problem of religious freedom, racism, God-playing morality and human nature in the program. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's also nice. Each character is unique and deep, offensive and distant from scientist-made-entrepreneur, to his annoying and deliberate daughter, every actor and actress throws herself in their respective roles. <br /> <br /> The use of music is very strong BSG, also plays an important role in Maple. The powerful Rolling Drums of the Battalester and the Shocked Daughters served their themes very well. Caprica uses a more orchestral sound, which gives its own feelings to the show's own predecessor quite distinct. <br /> <br /> The new Mapica must have its own display, as much as needed to pull it from its battles franchise. I look forward to the whole series.
