I've always liked this fantastic baseball movie! It has two great actors and a good cast with my favorite two favorite Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd! Ben Johnson, Brenda Fryker, Big Tony Longo, Tony Danza and Matthew McConnie are also in this movie! Also J. Sanders and Dermot Mullrini! Special effects of the film and all actors of the movie have played! Baseball scene is all realistic! Musician Randy Edelman's music is very good and it fits very well! The actor who reminds me of the real baseball personality. Stony Jackson Ray Mitchell has reminded me of the character of Mymensingh reminding me of Steve Finley and according to my opinion, J. Sanderson commentator Al-Hrabawki is watching today. This is a fantastic movie for non and baseball fans and I firmly recommend this movie!
