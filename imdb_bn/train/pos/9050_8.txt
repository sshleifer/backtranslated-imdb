This is a jewel, the original piece of American which is meant for all this. If you are self-employed to prevent the "living" stories, just stay away and still leave to the rest of our believers. And the cake on cake is considered really interesting that it is based on a true rich story, there is no need to choose which details have been changed to create a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and complicated, complicated with complex parents, the best picture in the bottom line can only successfully draw with his skills and insights. Simple psychological remarks, refusing to accept a father who tries to keep the law forever, that he may possibly close down, express the limitation of the commenter, the writer or the actor. This is not for cynical, or simple mind.
