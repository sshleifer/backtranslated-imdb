This crime thriller is sort of like a movie noir, although changing the context of the Cold War from the war of war, and somewhat modest about humanity. "Pickup in the south street", police are good people, criminals are real people, and only enemies "committee", who eventually split up from good to good, which is their own value driven by genuine care, which firmly stops strong Shown in scenes that splash the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie revolves around characters. The personality of this movie is rather unique and detailed: Avoid pick-pockets capable of reducing any danger and sometimes during their personal wealth; Most informant who is trying to save only for the visual funeral, but who is able to achieve heart and respect for almost all other characters (and listeners); Candy, an innocent innocent girl, who thinks she is doing official work and she does not fully understand the conspiracy involved; And Joey, a former lover of temple goddess who is trying to hide everything from everyone and, maliciously, the worst person to do this. A bunch of colorful supporting letters (such as chopsticks and policemen) and "south road pickups" make you feel superb to the personality when they look for mysterious and accidentally stolen microfilm frames. <Br /> <br /> - POLARIS DIB
