I was going through a list of Oscar winners and saw that this film was defeated by Boch Cassidy and Sandness Kid for the best picture in 1969. After seeing this actually, I'm no longer surprised. It was ahead of his way of using flashbacks to help develop his character, cinematography, and Jack Buck's character. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck's character. Short movie I think Voight offering and excellence-when-excited. The two scenes that really caught me got blowjob in the theater and when the old man urged her. I think when he sees the mirror, he is trying to see if it really is - or something - something terrible. <br /> <br /> I think Hoffman is a great decision to take this role. . Otherwise he might be type cast after graduation. However, this is considered a great reason all the time.
