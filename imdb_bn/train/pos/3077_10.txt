I missed the whole season of the show and in the summer of 2007 it started watching the ABC website. I'm just mad about the show. I think the whole cast is excellent. This is one of my favorite shows ever. I just checked the ABC program line up for this fall and did not see it in schedule. That's really sad I hope they bring it back ... maybe they are waiting for Brigate Mannhan to have her baby? Or is it my wishful thinking? <br /> <br /> I read some comments about the show and saw similar brilliant comments like me. I certainly hope the ABC will reconsider its decision or hope it will pick another station.
