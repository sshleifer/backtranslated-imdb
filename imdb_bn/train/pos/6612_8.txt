The final fantasy brings a whole new level of CGI, it's a rebirth for speed capture. The film does not appear to be a cartoon or a movie, but the motion picture shows tributes to film Nir, Akira, Sina City, Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists. You see Paris almost like it, the letters seem to be real to you and me. They are fascinated, traveled, and never before achieved such real actors. <br /> <br /> Do not look it hoping to find a mind twister. You will probably figure it out half way before you movie. The scene is definitely very simpler than the famous thrillers, but it is definitely fun for the eyes.
