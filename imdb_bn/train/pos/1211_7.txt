I grew up in this movie and I remember when my brother and I used to play behind the house and used to assert that we were care-a-lot. Now, after many years, I see the movie with my daughter and she enjoys it. If you are a parent and you do not see this movie with your children, you must keep them in their arms and they will be happy with care and care! Songs, especially "forever young" are very sweet and memorable. Parents, I recommend this movie to all the kids so that they know how enjoyable care can be taken for others! When it comes to all the trash on TV, you can raise your children's ideas about the right minds of life with such films.
