I saw this image because it was the second feature of a disc containing prohibited video 'Blood Rights' inactive. Blood Wright was completely awkward, I really did not expect much from this film; But in reality, trash director Andy Millington blew himself up at this time because the seeds of sin are above the style of blood in style and the sick 60 taller than the adequate level of sexual intercourse. The plot is exactly like the blood rights, because we must focus on a functional family unit and of course; There is a succession of risks. The film is shot in black and white and its appearance and feeling reminds me of the Crash Classic 'The Curious D'Humpp'. There is just no display in the display and the director thinks about sex, violence and hatred issues. Actor is usually destructive, but most women never get nude and in spite of poor reputation, director Andy Millington actually watches for such things, because most of the order in this movie is really beautiful. The plot paper is thin, and the film is mostly fillers; But the music is interesting, and the director works with an amazingly good sex scene, mostly on some sex. Overall, this is not a great film; However, it can apply to the Western fan and it gets much more recommended than the well known and low-quality 'blood culture'.
