When it comes to building a universe, George Lucas is an incredible master and his final Star War film is very good (and rated more correctly than the original Saga, two previous films). Recently Sith's revenge is really keeping this film. The final battle of knowing that Enakin Skywalker was going with the hand of the emperor was even more climatic. More bitter about the love that he felt for the Padma and his love for his children in the final battle between bin Laden and Bhadra. In fact, new films (especially the second episode) are worse than the original films, but they are only good for one reason. They think old films are even better. <br /> <br /> Hamill did an exceptional job in this film. He has gone through the real feeling of bringing louchers really real. I believe that he was a big actor based on these films because he really did a great job. Harrison Ford is still good. However, you can think that he has done riders and blade runners in the two final chapters of Star Wars, because he seems to have grown quite a bit. He added more humor (obviously motivated by riders) which works wonderfully. Short Han Solo is better than ever. Carey liner was not really a good actress but she does a decent job and is certainly passable. Ian McAidmid appeared in this photo and saw Episode III I can safely say that he was one of the most successful villains. James Earl Jones is still giving voice of Bhadra and he is still very good, very good. <br /> <br /> This film seems to be safe for him that Star Wars universe looks better than any of the previous (two) movies but this is really so expected in Lucas' fort√©. The final war on Endor has been made very well for both common effects and tensile. It was also an excellent touch that Lucas decided to have three wars together, because it involved the overall tension of climax. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> These little creatures are so annoying that they are almost destroyed in all the scenes they are in. Besides, a few small and boged spears like it can withstand the striker's squadron with laser guns and powerful tools, carrying seeds and arrows. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The film also stars George Lucas due to the stupid decision to add the universe to Ewoos Brightness reduces. <br /> <br /> 8/10
