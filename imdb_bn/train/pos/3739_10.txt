I really liked this movie. Bozz is a hugely cool, do not want to fight those who do not fear soldiers. His personality is like the Basilion of Catch-22, Joseph Haleer's male and classic classic novel. This movie, however, is not a war zone set, but a pre-war fighting preparation preparation. This wonderful film is a mistake in the Vietnam War, and this amazing film about those people who were impressive to be encouraged for the lost cause is <br /> <br /> Colin Farel is brilliant like Buzz Who, as a soldier, shows his true love and compassion for his fellow soldier, since he did misconduct and disrespect for trying to kill him. Bozz is completely cool and lazy, examining and tweaking his military advisers, having every opportunity their goats. He is a "Christopher" with a psychology degree, "save" his fellow soldiers and truly, showing the way people are from the army. "<br /> <br /> Acting and action is stunning and credible and as a" slipper ", my opinion of Tigreland is one of the top three Vietnam movies as well as the Apocalypse now and with the full metal jacket. <br /> <br /> Five Stars, a top pick.
