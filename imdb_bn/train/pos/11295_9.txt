In 1962 it was shown in the "late show" of Los Angeles television station when it became my darling after seeing it as a 12-year-old in 1926. The character is very compelling from the beginning of the film, and it is very bad that the film was never released for video tapes and it was never shown on television (apparently because of Mosaic's estate bans, the playwright / producer / director who wrote the story and during the First World War, at the New York Stage It presented - the reason for denying its display is 50 years after it was created It was difficult for a long time). I have not seen the film again for 30 years, when I was actually a movie actor in the movie, I was able to get a "bootleg" copy in VHS (poor video quality, but good audio). It was right in my memory: it was still to watch an engaging and interesting movie. An amazing aspect of this movie is that only Star stars or at least well-known and fully-known actors (eg Judy Holiday), Edmund O'Brien, Jane Karen, Barry Nelson, Don Taylor, Carl Malden, Peter, starring only some stars, starting in his career in 1944 Lyn Hays, George "Superman") Reeves, Red Button, Lee J. Cobb, Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill.) B-24 Liberator's scenes are very scary, especially close shots where the giant details (for that time) can be seen 4-engine bombs (then 18,000+, now almost extinct). A good insight into the different levels of pilot-cadet training that followed the course of hiring a bomber crew (of course, it was very gender-biased: the tendency of the day: only the man became a pilot, only women's role supported them - today's world is less acceptable). I hope today's video will be released on the video to enjoy it for the new generation.
