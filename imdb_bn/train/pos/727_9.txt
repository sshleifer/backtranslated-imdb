One of the best ever Rock'n'roll movies is not ever the best. And it's not just fun of the mind. There was really cute cute joke. Of course I love the Ramones. But with all "anarchy" and "I hate high school" themes, the film does not take it very seriously, which is great about it. <br /> <br /> I first saw the film in the spring of 1980, and I recently saw it again. Since I went to high school in the late 1970's, it made me nostalgic. <br /> <br /> As I said, this picture does not take itself seriously, and seventeen, eighty, and other ninety decades of tragedy do not rush like luck. And to speak, it is not really messy or disgusting. PG rating only. That's rare for this movie in this category. A great religious classic and a really incredible time capsule.
