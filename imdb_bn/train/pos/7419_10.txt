On the basis of the preview I saw, I went to the "shower" to expect a sweet little comedy; What I found was the deepest sensitive drama of family life that I have ever seen in most photographic images of the film. In addition, the next reflection has realized the sudden scenes of past scenes (visible in rural areas of northern China and visible in Tibetan highlands): How does memory often work? One moment I am here, the next day I am from the past, just like that ... <br /> <br /> I will not strongly recommend this with a firmness, I will put it between the two or in my 60 years I have three best Saw the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Japanese). Just as "the shower," the preview did not give a slightest indication of the depth of that film, which is a fine psychological study (though the fun moments are full of shiny). Are partners in the division afraid that the films are becoming "important" or "deep" to appeal to the US viewers?
