This 1947 film star and writer was written and written by (including a terrible Irish accent) and also features Rita Hareuth with the striking little blonde hair. So, before the Orland and Citizen Cans and Third Man, I lost to Osson but this was my first Rita Hayther interaction. It was good in our first meeting, he did a great job, a horrible / crazy Elsa played, married a wicked millionaire lawyer. Mike (Wells) and Elsa fall for each other. He wants to escape with him, he does not know how he can live without money. Elsa, her husband, and her partner's bicker and bite, just like a shark, Mike describes an attack on each other and his prediction proves to be true. As we get to the final stage in the fun room, there are several twists and turn around in this murder mystery. (Think of the last shot with the golden song in The Mann, which borrowed heavily in this scene). I was not sure what the killer was up to. <br /> <br /> This movie is like garlic and lemon shrimp. The dish is centered on the sea, it is fine, freak and intense, all the great effects. It can not be the best, fresh shrimp, but can be good quality frozen shrimp from the Costco. With the delicious sauce you add the naturality of the pink shrimp, when you become healthy, you can fill the option of more general, general rental. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
