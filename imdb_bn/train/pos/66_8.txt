"Home Room" came as a total surprise. Because it does not have any formula about what it was, it gives great time because it does not do any punches and what we see is that an unhappy young man who decided to beat his classmate, <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Alice Browning is a big girl who is trying to graduate high school. He has been a few years away and the other students do not seem to be the same wave length. For one, he will be cut off with a shy look, a rebellious lot of makeup and a face that comes near his room. Alicia was among the students at home, where nine students died, probably her boyfriend's death. Alicia, we realize, an injured girl who has gone through a terrible accident in her life, but we do not have any source of this effect. <br /> <br /> What happened after this tragedy, such as focusing on a young girl who has survived it. Dinner cartite is a wealthy teenager who was not in school. When a resident bullet hit him, he was admitted to hospital more than a wound. He is trying to get on his mind this dark time, but do not forget him in the nightmare. <br /> <br /> The school's principal is going to the hospital to Alicia. Since he does not cooperate with the police, the school principal wants to see the wing in his horrible state and he will probably become mild and tell the authorities what he knows. Alicia dislike the debt, but in a couple of days, both girls would wish for peace. We did not understand the feeling that the horrible day in school really happened. <br /> <br /> Busy Philips makes excellent aliceas and Erica Christians equally good like Diana. Victor Garber, James Pinkines, Taylor Holland, and other actors play as a shoe. <br /> <br /> The picture is intense because it is not clear how to fire, which helps the voice. Ryan wanted to give this movie.
