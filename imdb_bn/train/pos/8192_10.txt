These two pots were excellent - the series is good from the back. Confirming bits of the story were pinned from the previous movies, but how these TV shows do these days. What we got here is a slipping good sci-fi story. A great big (really horrible) giant has been kept inside the deep hole, some of the supernatural aliens in The Odd - the best "new" aliens in the resurrected series are basically a set of sympathetic and trustworthy human characters (with some unnamed "costly" security in complete true star trek fashion Person), some big philosophical themes (love, loyalty, faith etc) and Some top drawers have special effects. <br /> <br /> Like this every minute.
