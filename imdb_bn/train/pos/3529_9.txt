Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) is unjustly accused of murdering his unbelieving wife. The night she was murdered was with a mysterious woman who refused to give her name. After being accused in the murder case, the police visited the places she went with, but people simply think of him alone. He was sentenced to death and his secretary (Ela Reynies) got himself out to find a murderer because he loves her. <br /> <br /> It was made as a B-Film Universal (see cast side - all character actors and one star - Franchot Tone - on fall). The budget was small and cast was mostly unknown, but one of the best movies of the decade of the 1940s was what happened. It is nicely managed by Kart Sydmak and has a great script from William Irish's excellent book (Column name for Colonel Ulrich). It moves fast and just looks fantastic. And there is an infamous Jam Session with Rainees and Elisha Cook Jr. that closes the screen with incredible sexual energy. (I'm surprised to see that the sensors do not cut) <br /> <br /> <br /> This error of resistance is being perfected. Tone gives a terrific performance. She looks terrible and she's just awesome. Also Curtis Henderson is as tough and soft. You really wonder why the rain loves him - he is so indifferent. But the main role of the rain is quite good. She is beautiful and full of life. Also the last scene is when the murderer is after the truth of his true ring. He rarely physically threatens and his reactions seem to be overwhelming. <br /> <br /> I'm still 9. Really a great movie - flaws aside
