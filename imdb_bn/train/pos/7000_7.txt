When I first saw the title, I've already reduced the theme of the movie - it was not obviously a reference to British currency, so it was Shakespeare and almost pounds of meat - to accept them or give them. Smith was a feeling actor, so serial killers were out. It can only be given to a person, so in no way will be about crime. By watching this and watching it before I see it, I have ruined the whole thing for myself, because the build up beauty is part of the background of the main character, is it that the viewer is slowly drops to illuminate the audience and who is he? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, you know it's going to be unpleasant. I do not say that the movie is suicide! It becomes the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyr <br /> <br /> It is swimming with symbolism everywhere, it is a sure statement that is written professionally with skill and is driving a lot of money and a deep reflective nature. The most deadly theme that hit me was that she was not only giving the girl her heart which she loved emotionally and figuratively, but she physically donated her as the greatest gift. Death is determined, but his plan is broken by the fall in love - what is the complexity of a second law Absolutely skilled. <br /> <br /> Yes it's too slow, but I'm uncertain whether it has slotted well within a short time frame. I did not feel satisfied as much as I could, and its terrible inner turmoil, but maybe I destroyed myself already. Although it's all saying, it's a deeply moving and original movie that is incredibly powerful and thought provoking tragedy that it must inevitably get.
