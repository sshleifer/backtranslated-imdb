I thought that the Ice Age was a wonderful movie! Although there is no 30-year-old girl, I still enjoy this ridiculous, malicious animated movie. Sid, I'm a better character than Anastasia, better than Bartoke (though he was really funny and I do not think his character can be mixed or even beaten) and more ridiculous than the Melman in Madagascar. I have watched the film at least 15 times (I'm definitely the owner) and I quoted the work in movies (in many cases ... yes, still). My favorite scene is the part where Sid says "Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!" And how are Sid and Moni trying to tell them about "Tigers"? "Wolf packs, beer packs, lungs packs, whistle packs, nose packs, dirt packs, false packs, trouble packs , A wallpaper pack, birds pack, flying fish pack ... "or whatever! This is the most interesting part of the whole film, though I enjoyed the humor behind "putting slips on the map" and many other parts. The only animated film that can remotely compare to the Ice Age "Brother Bear".
