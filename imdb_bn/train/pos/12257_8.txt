It's a better adaptation to Paltrow than the book (though I like it too). It's not so much that Bacinsel is good - they're both pretty good - but it's good to play well. Davis is a master for adaptation of Austen for filming, and the production values ​​here are very good. It's not as shiny as Hollywood treatment, but it's off, and I think locations and clothing really work well.
