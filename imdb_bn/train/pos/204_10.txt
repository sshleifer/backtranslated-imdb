First off, I dislike almost all the blue Simon movies. But there is something unique about it that attracts me and I say it is one of my most modest comedies. The second time I saw it, the connection was clear. When did blue cemetery meet my grandmother? <br /> <br /> They feared they could file a lawsuit, so he changed them into men. And if they were only a housewife, how dull it would be, the power stars would be more fun. Well this is a personal review, and my still living grandmother at the age of 97 (she has even carried out her incredible reflections of Walter Matao!) - but you have to find resonance in some of these characters. Second, I have a little tolerance for George Burns, but the role of a wonderful support (and my late grandmother even enjoyed it) in the way I can remember, though she failed to recognize the extraordinary similarity with the character of the film) . <<br /> <br /> There is too much ethnicity in the smell, and at the top, you laugh and do not smile. For me, pleasure lingers.
