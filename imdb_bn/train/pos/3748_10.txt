I've seen it so many times and I'm planning to buy the full feature. I love Jason Steele's comedy all. It is very different and unique and very enjoyable. I love the indie film and this one is just great. The plot is strange but very funny. This short film is a special name for Edward. The sequence of events is a bit different, this movie is very interesting to watch. First you see Edward kiss, but then his focus has changed in the previous life. This is a stupid movie, but of course, it's still great. I highly recommend that you see this image at www.spatulamadness.com or www.filmcow.com It's very fun. Humor does not match everyone's taste but watch anyhow. It will take you only 16 minutes and it's free. Sleeping Spotlight Madness!
