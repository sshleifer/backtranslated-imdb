This episode is absolutely brilliant, I saw the only car at the end of my career which allowed him to do physical (and silent!) Comedy which made him famous. It's still a shock to hear his voice in the continuity of the talkie - his voice is only about the thing that I do not care about, as far as the booster is concerned - but his ability to take the preset is still disproportionate. He also repeated the gag used in his first two relayers with Rosko Arravakal. <br /> <br /> I am deeply grateful to Rod Serringning for our presentation with this episode, and to give full opportunity to Booster's talent. It did not have much time to do (one episode), but it is a respected tribute to Hollywood's greatest genius.
