I own this movie and after watching it it has been seen several times throughout the year. The prince does not keep us in our wonderful acting style or anything, he is a musician and I think that what he has shown here is the best one to tell only through this story. Most of the film is straightforward and a teenager but it blames the director / writer, yet it's a great movie with better music. Principal and moral conviction are strong in violet rain, and if more movies rely on fundamental factors, it will be taught like our little kids, we would love to be surrounded by the environment that reflects the industry reflecting the life.
