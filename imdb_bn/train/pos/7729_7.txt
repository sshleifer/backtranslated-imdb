Just: See something else. <br /> <br /> This photo was highly resented by Gene Seychelle, but I do not understand why I see it. The film is definitely original and diverse. It even has interesting conversations at times, some cool moments, and a vague "silent" feel. But this is not just entertainment. It does not make sense in the plot, but in particular the motivation of the character. I do not know anyone who behaves like this character. <br /> <br /> This is a tough movie - I do not accept the challenge for you.
