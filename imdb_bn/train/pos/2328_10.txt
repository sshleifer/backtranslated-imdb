Perfect movies are rare. Even my favorite movies have errors - the rear window sometimes shows little pillars, the character of Chris Eliot does not work on Groundhog Day, the music score of Best Years of a Live is very impressive, a bit slow at the beginning of the Cuberean knights - but this picture Completely starting from the end. <br /> <br /> This script is brilliant, beautiful around acting (although Ridge Witherspoon and Sam Waterton amazing, full cast shining), instructions and photography are inspired and touched without music score. Being confusing (some maramax score which is very user friendly). Every sad moment is really moving, every light moment makes me smile. It's really one of the best movies I've seen and I want more movies like this. <br /> <br /> I'm glad that Ridge Witherspoon has gone to Starred after this film, but I'm sorry that his recent films are more mad and stupid than this serious film, which is about real people, real feelings and real problems. Bright! A must see.
