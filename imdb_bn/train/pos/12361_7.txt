Belocho has mentioned it as a major political film, describing Italy's revolutionary movement, but it is more metaphorical than reality. Well, almost all of the film is metaphorical. Revolutionaries, whom we see and those we learn about, can also be Mafiosi. With old and new <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A revolutionary girlfriend, Giulia, represents that which can happen to someone who is very badly There are reasons to support but are unable to fulfill the promise of such promise. (I'm guessing here.) Teenager Andrea, who seems to be the only person in the film, is "negligent". He is respectful to his father but disobedient He loves Giulia, or so we guess, even though he is not fully old, he has learned how best to manage his feelings, but he will leave him to appear in school and participate in his final exam. In this conflicting way, her course can be described as "media". He is the man among those who can gradually cool down slowly and slowly, who knows the meaning of his fascination. Most of the <br /> <br /> is said to be in the verbal part of his final, when he is asked to translate and comment an excerpt from "antigon", in contrast to the traditional authority of the god with the concept of secularism and free will. <br /> <br /> It brings us - I'm aware of any special course - Murshu Determs He thinks cartoon in New York a few years ago. Two hippo deep in the river, looking at a shiny water from the bank, and one hippo said to another, "I hate him." She is a good actress. (Let me get out of the way.) But the movie's everyone else is so. He carries with him in his lecture and manner, rich in lunacy exotic lunacy. And it comes from all actresses, not from guidance help. Detarars Catherine DeNeuve was the way "dishonest" nuts were not the nuts in the way. Turn on the wall rubber and do not extend the hand. Instead, we see her animated - sometimes animated. And when she suddenly changes her mood and threatens flashing threats, she is threatened. <br /> <br /> One critic described him as proud, but it is probably not the word that is being searched for. She is compulsory with her fluffy brown hair, her ample white ready grin, her impulsive giggles. And his eyes like eyes in the ancient Egyptian Tomb painted on the wall. Sexy parts are quite lover, because not a clear among them, but because we've gotten to know the characters involved. (The next door is more interesting to spy on a cheerful couple than to shine on the skin.) Actually there is no sex. Simulated sex is the only scene but the director feels real time. At least eighteen-year-old boy's real time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, they have to carry it and they do not. If this is not for their performance, I'm not sure it will be interesting or pretty flick like this. It has easily become a slow, annoying romance. <br /> <br /> It's worth it.
