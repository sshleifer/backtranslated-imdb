Everything will be a musical comedy. Jean Kelly (as Joe Brady) does not miss a step, and Frank Sinitra (as Clarence Dulitle) does not miss a note. The scenes together with them are very good, how much talent can add a little disrespectful plots. Sinatra's "I Fop In Love Too Easy" is its variation and the best indication of the future. Kelly "Mexican Hat Dance" with a young Mexican girl is delightful. Kelly definitely deserves nomination as the best actor. And there really is a kitchen in the funny line, as: "Do you think navy takes dopes?"; "Do you think someone sings to a sailor to sleep?"; And, "We got a little bit of trouble, we picked up a little boy." A thoroughly enjoyable movie, the only thing to shake the dust of the last world war recently.
