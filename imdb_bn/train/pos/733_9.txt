How can you go wrong with the amazing Ramones? What two of them are already dead? Dennis Leary reminds me of the great musicians who died in the kitchen fire when this extraordinary person lives forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea. <br /> <br /> Rock and Roll High School tell the story of a group of children forbidden to fight against their abusive high school administration. This is a very silly stuff, but it is expected that it is refreshing (even if they take refuge in the building). Who knew that there would be really concern for the students across the globe? Rock and Roll High School is a time capsule of an era when people still believe that the music has been fit and that it can make a difference in larger society. It's not the right kids to know the authorities. Rather, rock and roll are the only things they can believe. But most importantly, it is pure absorption. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not take any seriously. Just go and have a good time. It should have been done if the high school life was not in seventy years.
