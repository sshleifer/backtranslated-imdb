I really enjoyed this movie and it was very difficult when your brother stuttered comments in 30 seconds. But I have enjoyed this movie, in most cases I am using normal HK action films. Most movies like this are not watching for the story line, see it for stupid steps. And stupid actions are correct. You'll see Jat Lee jumping, spin, kick, punch, shoot, impossible jumps and countless round bullets. This film was released to the wider audience after Lithal Weapon 4a Lee. The reason for rating ratings in this movie is one of the reasons for reducing. Most people were probably hoping to see a movie polished as a North American film. But you must remember that most of the H. H. Film budgets are not as high as the North American film, and the style of the HK action film is usually very different, usually requiring wiring work in them. If you want to see a good action film then you try to ignore it in dubbing. <br /> <br /> My rating was 8.
