One of the best musical instruments ever made, one of the timeless and often worth seeing. Delicious! Acting, especially as Ron Moody Fagin, is fantastic. Costume is excellent ... even barbarians <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Have done a great job where you can not help but hope that he comes to the end of the terrible .... which he does. <br /> <br /> Dance is fascinating dancer and gentleman. Oliver Mais likes the Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma, etc. This is a movie for the whole family.
