I've enjoyed this picture. It was light, delightful, and very colorful. You can see that MGM technician is watching. There is no color that does not exist in this picture. Each view is full packed. Danceography was great. Gene Kelly is a wonderful. She is so gifted. The dance number in this movie is perfectly executed, and is perfectly designed. He realized that the dancing stories could say anything else. The last part of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. Does Garcewin's song make this film special? A few American musicians had a good gift for tunes. I enjoy the music of Gershwin. It's ridiculous. Ira Garsuin must be the greatest songwriter author. He is so economical and charming. It was a very entertaining film.
