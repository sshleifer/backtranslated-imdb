I was thinking that the censine is going to be a middle-class movie. When I finally saw it, I was astonished. The movie is not great, but it is very fun and action scenes are very well done. This movie reminds me of the TV series like 24 or Elias. It's very similar to the series and it reminds me, Wolfgang Petersen's thriller on fire line If you expect one of the most original and most exciting thrillers. Film history, you'll be disappointed. But if you take a little expectation, you will enjoy the sensation. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 7
