This is an extraordinary movie, the West's self-concerned person (Jimmy Stewart) going to Clonic for Gold. On the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in Alaska (John McIntire, providing an amazing evil performance), to whom he hassles back. McIntenant threatens that he will be a dead man if he ever returns to his town, which, unfortunately, is the only way for the United States. The main part of the story is pushing the inhabitants of McIntire to the new residents peacefully in the chalcic town of Dosne opposite. For example, Ruth has created a salon (a Hollywood front for a prostitute) and tried to run the city's restaurant and business out hung out place, with Roman Stewart and her two companions (J. C. Flippan and Walter Barren, who plays Stewart's best friends) . He pays the way to come for Macintar and his gangsters. In 1953, Jimmy Stewart and director Anthony Mann was at the top of the western color, The Necked Spur. The far-off country is only shortest bit and 99.9% in which the film is so specially made, like a cheap copy. Like a nude spar, the country is proud of the beautiful, location cinematography. Landscape fantastic. Stuart gives one of his best performances (his biggest success in 1954, Rear Window). I think it may be considered as a clich√©, because he starts a selfish salaried and learns how this kind of existence ends up in the end. Still, Stewart plays it very well, he makes this character very human. And supporter performance is universally gorgeous. In addition to the mention I have, the adorable French actress Corinne Calvet is very good. And I also have to put Walter Brenen out singly. He seems to have the best friends playing special. His relationship with Stewart is very sensitive, because he is the first, the only character who can bring any humanity into the dreaded human. The plaque has been written very well, and Man's direction is insignificant. A Best Composition 10/10.
