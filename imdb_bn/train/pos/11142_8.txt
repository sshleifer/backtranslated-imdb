Just having fun <br /> <br /> The young optimistic cowboy in Joe Bauce (almost like Forrest Gump) in Texas, John Voight in Texas, looking for deer cultivation in the form of hosting in New York City. Big Apple does not take a long time to utterly and completely undermine him and his ambitions, and very soon the aim of Joe New York's coolness and refrain from his street chills. Given her pure heart, she seemed sad on Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), one of these thugs, and later moved into her apartment with her relics and survived two literal struggles. <br /> <br /> Midnight comedy is labeled as a play, it is described as a sad story or a ridiculous tragedy in my opinion. By the end of the 1960s, it was a beautiful film by connecting contemporary Happie-Vib with its compulsory running wall-party cinematography and connecting it with the city of New York City. This image is reduced by cowboy Joe chest, which makes him out of his position. We feel for his fitness, but get enough money to feed Roso Rizzo. <br /> <br /> Midnight cowboy brought tears in my eyes because it is rich in material and many heart projects. I imagine that this film must be inspired by the role of Forest Gump with its pure heart and out-lead lead character, and in some cases, crocodile Dandy films are related to almost similar humor - it is the country-cobbler and slick New York cosmopolitans. I highly recommend that highly compulsory and exciting creative film. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
