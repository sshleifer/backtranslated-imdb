This picture is recommended to me by a friend. I did not see any advertising or trailer, so I did not know I was in Clonit and his role was not so small that he was not worried. I thought the whole cast was perfect and the film was quite enjoyable, all of them. In the opening scene with the little crew standing on the side of the street, looking at the whip and the huggard immediately noticed my attention. It was a way of telling you, "Do not go away; it will not be annoying", and it was not really. It has turned into an interesting, light-hearted comedy so that you can keep your seat to the very end, but after the end I feel a little bit cheated ... just a few. The incidents continue to increase so that you can continue their continuation, but at the time I can not define it, its layers are arranged, to end a little frustration. I expected a big bang on a climax, but it sorted down to what kind of key. If you think the movie looks with the mind and you can live without the high dosage of George Clooney, but you can see this flicky, very entertaining and good value. Now I want to see the real (Big Deal on Madonna Street), but it's probably a rare find in the United States.
