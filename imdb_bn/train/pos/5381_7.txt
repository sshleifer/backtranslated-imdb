This was really good for a low budget movie. I keep this good on top of your average B-movie action. San and Karine have been released in this movie, and they do not seem to shy camera. Check out Jeanne and Jared's adolescents. I do not think the producers will even consider it, but runner-ups are more deserving than that. <br /> <br /> I look forward to being more involved with Sun and Kareen in the movie entertainment industry. Shawn's character looked very genuine, and the character of Sexy Correa was quite difficult and at the point. She is well connected with the order of action and executed with confidence. Billy Jane was a great idea to cast as smart and malicious villains. Her karimma on the screen is always a pleasure to see Chemistry was very good in Jane and Shan's character. Action sequence is not known and connects throughout the movie. Of course there were errors, but that area comes with. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a good movie that was budget and it was made for TV. San and Karine have done a good job that they are new players in the game. I hope Jain, Jared, and the rest of the Next Action star will also have the opportunity to join their co-stars entertainment entertainment. <br /> <br /> final judgment: *** / ****
