'What I like about you' is definitely a show that I could not wait to see every day. Amanda Bains is such a nice actress and I grew up seeing her show: 'Amanda show.' She seems to be a very funny person and down on earth. "Holly" is such an individual and has an "out-of-the-way" personality. I always enjoyed how he looked around and turned upside down, so he repeatedly messed himself up. But this program has made such a big difference. <br /> <br /> When I came up with the character of 'Vince' in particular, I liked this event. Nick knows very hot and fun, as well as 'Gary', Wesley Jonathan. The entire cast was great, each character had their own personality and charm. Jenny Garth, Alison Munn, and Leslie Grossman were all very funny. I especially love 'Loren'; He is the best! He helped make Shoke extra fun and you do not know what he will do next or say! Overall the show is really nice but I did not give it a 10 because it does not have any new episodes and episodes can be longer and deeper.
