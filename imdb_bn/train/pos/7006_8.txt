Ben Thomas (Will Smith) has transformed the lives of seven people in search of the secret because of secret secrets. Once his plan is set, nothing can stop him. At least that he thinks that. But Ben did not plan to fall in love with these people and he was able to transform him. After the life-inspiring movie "The Search for Happiness", Smith will again come back with director Gabriel Mukino. "Seven Pounds" is yet another life-changing film experience, which not only reminds of their previous cooperation, turmoil, but ultimately motivates you with joy. Smith, is again a producer with others. These movies are very realistic, which illustrate their struggle through the life of a common man and life. It can take some time to achieve its true speed in seven pounds, but the movie can control your heart after half an hour of the film. Also, there are some cyclones in this movie, which allow visitors to guess. Director Gabriel Mukino again won, his emotional but inspirational message. He makes all the characters in the film very real, actually people find themselves anywhere in the movie. Along with the director, Will Smith is still another winner, with his most acting abilities. Again, both the director and the actor act as a charm. Also, other talented actors who have made their part quite well in the film. Rosario Dawson, beauty with the brain, that's what he could be called. She looks beautiful and is extremely well her part. Barry Paper gave great support to the film, and OD Harrelson did the same, although the Woody did not have too much screen timing (more than was well but better). You never forget this movie easily. Watch this movie and change your life. Top class movies!
