I recently bought this movie and I'm really sorry for it that I please add this movie to my collection. Filmmaker Matt Manfredi and Phil Hey took less than a month to produce the film, and spent about 10 million euros to produce this great movie. This proves that only big productions do not make big movies. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie completely fits. In computer language, BEG is a program error that creates feedback on computer functions. Our reaction to this negative side effect, but beauty can be a great moment. The death of a BGB at the beginning of the euphoria in this movie. A man is "crime" witness on the other side of the street ... everything becomes complicated from there ... <br /> <br /> I have shown to John Carole Lynch ("Fargo"), Walleis who can not fix everything.
