I found almost suspenseful to go around this movie. When Miss Stannyck started his description, then you realize that the problem is coming. The desert area, the lonely gas station closed the door, everything you set up to wait ... comes here. At first you think it will be about a little boy, but soon you start to breathe while you watch the tide. I saw this movie really intense, although I have seen it before and ready to deny. Now a movie that you can keep in sensation, even if you have seen it, even deserves a special rating, maybe a white counterfeit prize?
