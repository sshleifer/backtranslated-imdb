I want to say, no matter how low the budget is, the films need to be shown across the globe. We do not read anymore, instead people want to see movies. As the series came out of DVD, I would like to read the whole series and do more. Make all 8 movies. Please do not change any of the letters, it will destroy the effect. Since I have been grown to love the actor who played the character. Make all 8 movies. I would like to see the message and would like to see the message of these books and present films depicted here. We're not enough that anymore. Excellent work !!!
