Again greetings from darkness. This will be compared to "Princess Bride" and although it is not measurable until the classic, it is very entertaining and made well in its own right. The story line is a little odd and the whole wall is not really explained, but execution of execution, even strong mysteries. <br /> <br /> Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and convinces him to get a missing star ... who will be starring with a great Clare Dancer. There is not much doubt about what's happening to these two people, but the mysterious part is the evil sorcerer Michael Peeffer and the son of King Peter O'Howel's son is looking to recover Ruby Nealas wearing our "star". Chasing Bad Bad Bad <br /> <br /> With the way, you will see a face with strange pirate (with any of the carbine). Robert Dennio plays Captain Shakespeare - is very tough inside, and we will contact him on behalf of the woman. Another face-to-face with Ricky Garvis is a great conversation business and it's good for some laughs. <br /> <br /> Your audience is not an ordinary chase, age or fantasy film, but an audience of director Matthew Vaughn's ("Layer Cake") effort. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess is that it will get great success in the video.
