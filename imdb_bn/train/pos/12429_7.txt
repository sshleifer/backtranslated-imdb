David Duchovi plays the main role in this film. Now many people will not be disturbed to find this phenomenon. It is very wrong to say at least. David has made his name in the X-file and is an appropriate actor. Dr. Eugene Sands (Duchovni) is a drug addict, who is subjected to ill-treatment. He accidentally became a personal doctor for Criminal Millionaire Raymond Blossom. However, the FBI is eager to use Eusen to trap blossom. Angelina Jolie Claire is throwing the role of supporter- gangsters moll.She puts a solid performance. Thomas Hootton plays blasms and is dubbed deep into his character. Dukovi does not think of herself as very bad and in the end I will rate her credibility in her performance. Her familiar tone and straight face is present, but she can not reduce much of the film
