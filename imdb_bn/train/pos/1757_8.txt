The key to a 40-year-old virgin is not that Andy Steecer's 40-year-old virgin, but Steve Carroll has presented him as one. A continuation of "humor" which is made by the lack of humorous and compelling characters, the 40-year-old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, heartwarming script that does not use her hero as a lasting rugged cruel joke. Andy still a virgin at the age of forty, yet it is not a joke, it's a curiosity to actually do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An intermediary and former daily show Custommaker of the Team Team Team, using an idea of ​​expanded film concept in its character ?? We understand why Andy came in the same way. This is the small work that makes this movie. When Andy's colleague in the electronics store asked him about what he did on weekends, and failed attempt to cook Andy. When Andy bikes her bike to work, she's her turn signal She just does not decorate her home with the job ?? He painted them, and discussed with them, and revealed that something really old belonged to him from his childhood. A less comedy will not even begin to focus on all these things. <br /> <br /> Plot is fairly simple ?? Andy's fellow friends find that she has never been sexually and they do their personal search for a woman with a bed. It is not a child concept and the film does not try to keep its kids secret. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Still obsessed with it, J (Romany Malko) is a woman and a man of woman and a cal (Seth Rosen) Tattooed sex Andy goes back several times in an effort to get Andy, and each time Andy feels less and less optimistic. <br /> <br /> Finally, Andy meets the single mother trim (played by Catherine Keiner) and claims her mother is not her valued friend, she loves him. Do they agree to start a relationship and stay close to having sex for twenty days ?? Thirty knew that Andy is still a virgin. <br /> <br /> The 40-year-old Old Man Director, Jadad Athos, was directed by Ancharman and The Cable Guy and started a short-lived culture TV show. Freaks and Geeks Apatow Humor is famous for its unique knowledge, and scripts ?? Written by Carell ?? <br /> <br /> Finally, the 40-year-old Virgin's most attractive and amazing (surprising) aspect of his maturity is his maturity. Up until now you probably know that the film has received brilliant reviews from critics and even I was amazed by its warm reception. But after seeing the film, I understand why. We like Andy. We care about her. Is not she just cliché somebody to do the bedboard cutout sex comedy ?? He is a real, living, breathing man. Her neurotic features combine Woody Allen's best with pillow dinner. Her friends flutter impossible and her romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. <br /> <br /> This is far more than a perfect movie and obviously there is a little bit of ominous exploration and sexual humor, but it does not mind the extent that it can not be one of the continuity because we have affection for people on the screen. The best sex comedies work this way ?? American pie from risky business ?? And some big differences like 40-year-old Virgin and 40 days and 40 nights.
