Really a big box office draw, but I was pleasantly surprised <br /> <br /> with this movie. James "I've done something to Froh Fosset" or <br /> <br /> This movie has written and operated with the average, average <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Larry has received his intention, yet he soon realizes his new life <br /> <br /> Just as he expected not exactly. <br /> <br /> I would say, this movie really influenced me. Critics <br /> <br /> mix it, and I must say that this idea is really interesting and <br /> <br /> well dragged. Yes, this is a little value, but enough pack <br /> <br /> Interesting moments, drama and excellent acting it really <br /> <br /> Good. James Belushi (I think) was eligible for his role in Oscars. John <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a good movie with a good lesson. If you ever meet, I would recommend you to <br /> <br />
