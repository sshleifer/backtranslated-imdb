This movie is fun and suitable for any ages. This is definitely family-type entertainment. Illustro's Illinois-based West-West Big Bianan City does great work for the public. We must not miss anything after the new (and only) exit ramp from the revival (pre-aggression) interstate of the decade. Appeal as annoying and completely unlikely to be appropriate for the attacks of the earth by Martians of the position. But despite these Martins fully equipped with helpless, appropriately deadly and severe weapon surgery ... with a set of Martian's demolition! Martians have eaten their lines and pronounced the words to make us visitors and the locals want to help them ... leave the world. J. J. Anderson is just a great line of very young Halloween beef duck game. Watch this movie for ridiculous and entertaining; It is not thought-provoking. But it is subtle and enjoyable.
