I saw the movie today and it blew away my mind. It's a genuine piece of art and I do not understand why most people think it's trash. The main idea of ​​the film - take your ego away and then you will have the true power! This movie was the main battle to end and Guy Ritchie showed in a great way. "The greatest enemy of all time you will be hiding where you are hiding" - What do you think of this movie? Because our true enemy is among us - it is our pride ... the voice always tells us that we are important, which gives us pride, which does not let us, which only allows us to take, which creates our aggression. Wants to be in control, which creates all the negative feelings and thoughts. GR has published this concept in a surprising way and showed that the only way to gain true control is when you stop the control and you give up your personal importance. A superb movie!
