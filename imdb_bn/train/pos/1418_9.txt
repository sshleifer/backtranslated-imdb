I almost did not see this movie, because remember that the Penguin March was not very exciting. I went mainly because Disney promised to plant a plant if I could see it on the first weekend, but later I could see it, it was simply amazing; The photographer can capture the impossible images that are actually worth your money. You will see different habitats, different plants, animals and natural phenomena which will not only disappoint you - just because you do not expect to become so witch and dynamic of nature - but touch your soul and increase the question of humanity. The world, our life has deviated from the nature of which we are natural beauty and miracles which are impressive in our bioosphere. You do not have to be a world lover or a stylish environmentalist to over-glorify this documentary. You will simply be a curious soul who questions the value of life and miracles. Enjoy!
