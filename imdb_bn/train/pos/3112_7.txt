Before watching it in the theater I saw both BOVEN identities and Bourne in DVD. Before filming I had to wait for this. I was not frustrated <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> During this movie felt sticky. Plot-building down-bars were slightly too drawn out. As a result, the following steps seem very terrible. <br /> <br /> Camera: At the time of talking about frenzy, the trademark Gregorous Shaky Cam was present and was very annoying to me. I know it's talked about embarrassment on the message board / but it does not mean that it is not relevant. All martial arts training went through the actors completely wasted. The ridiculous camera cuts and wing cameras have spoiled most of the war. This is a cheaper, student learning strategy that makes the film vague. I hope those techniques used in some horrific flick made for high school kids, but this classy, ​​adult, is not a series of action. Too close to the extreme. Make some structures. Get some interesting shots. Constant close up looks like lazy instructions to me. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was very confusing at first. They get new names and faces on you to get them. When you're late in a movie you feel me and know that you missed some important information. Afraid or contracted for due time. But you get caught but the story is pretty good. It's enjoyable to follow Lean along with Bourne. However, I was not careful about the whole scene of domination (Landy / Bourne on the phone), it was in the middle of the ultimatum thing. It essentially makes the film half a prickle. I thought it was weird. <br /> <br /> Cast / Characters: Star performances in the movie. There are obviously two main ones. Bourne and Nicky Person. Their teaming up was weird like me. I think they just wanted to protect and trust someone in Bourne. Why do not they tell you why they will not tell you why I miss something completely. Other killers in the movie were quite calm. This is the Gilroy / Gregoras / anyone who wants to leave the open end. Understanding but frustrating. Seriously, Daemon with Demon Clive Owe and Martin Siskus in Identity. These scenes were awesome. These murderers are unpredictable in the Castle (in the first Phla Bourne identity card fight). Commonly dropped as the series went down has dropped. Clive Ow was actually functional. That's a measure of strength for the first cast. Second, they're mostly trading with Chris Cooper for Joan Allen .... not exactly the same. The actress Brian Cox and Frank Patent have been named after three actors. There is nothing against David Strathreen, Scott Glen, or Albert Finney, but they are not the first names nominated for this type of series. Apart from a couple breaks, it seemed as if acting was okay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They felt better than to get the series though. If they pruning or rearranging the slow parts, then Scott completely eliminates the part of glen, zooms out and takes away the camera from hostage, it can be perfect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was my understanding of this conclusion. They definitely made reference to the very beginning of the series with its silhouette floating speedless. I thought that's going to be it. The end is a circle type. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, what they give you. "He killed the first killer, I liked that the final scene was great. (Bourne was shot to death), why would he do so? Did he die for revenge? If he is angry enough to kill why he Do not shoot Pamela Landy after faxing his secret file?
