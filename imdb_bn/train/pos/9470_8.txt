I'm not a fan of Steve Carroll but I like this movie about Dan, the Advisor Callist, who goes to his parents' house to stay with his kids and ends up loving his brother's girlfriend. It has been told before a story, but not like this. There are a lot of small bits to make the film even better than the movie. Cast is nice, and if Carroll does not have tea in my cup, he is as good as a widow who knows everything but feels that life is different from that and sometimes life makes you wonder. Sometimes there may be an annoying hallmark card that is malicious and intelligent, how can you still grow a bit more and the film could be more than a mill film? See the value of a look
