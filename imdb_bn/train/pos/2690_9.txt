La Teta I was obsessed with nipple breasts in Catalan who describes the life of a 9-10 year old son named La Luna (breast and moon) Tete. I love this movie because the characters are very honest and very human, like all the characters in the film of Bigus Luna (Jamn, Zaman's director too). Tete reminds me of how that might be an incentive and exciting life at that age. It also brought me many memories from Catalonia (northeast of Spain). How beautiful this movie is, beautiful, beautiful people, beautiful life, and especially to idle people, how beautiful!
