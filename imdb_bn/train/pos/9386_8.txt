Here's what we have, the very best 90s thriller, which is probably a lack of substance, it gives great entertainment throughout running time and overall you do everything you want to do in this nature. I mainly saw this movie because it was directed by John Dahl - a very under-construction manager behind the great thrillers like The Last Seduction, Rounders and Roadkill. I think that if this movie was already on its benchmark before the director, it would be good to see - and Red Rock West is definitely a movie that can be proud of Dahl. Plot focuses on the extreme moral Michael; A man across America is looking for work. When it stumbles on a bar in Red Rock County it ends up ending it one day - that work is only caught in the murder of a man's wife. He has been wrongly made for Lail, but instead of working; He plays both sides against each other and plans to finally make a farewell. However, his escape attempt fails and he finds himself in a bad state when he is active in the real lil ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He shot it three years ago I again did it again and again with Radkill this film was about a decade. Why Dahl likes this kind of position is not difficult to see, because it provides a fantastic environment for a thriller. Dahl also provided the film as film 'Film Nir', because the plot mainly focuses on central character and the word is filled with bold and mysterious characters. Acting is very good, Nicholas plays a great role in the leadership of the cage and Lara Flein Boell, J. Walsh and of course, Dennis Hooper; Who again curtains the screen with its top performance. It is necessary to say that the second half of the film is not chic like the first, but the Red Rock West is certainly not boring and the central character is very nice in the way that it is orchestrated in a dark finish. Overall, the Red Rock West is a movie that you're unlikely to regret to see. It's exciting all the time, and you can not ask for much more than that!
