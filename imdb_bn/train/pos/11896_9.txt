I stumbled across the syndication of this show several years ago, and fell in love with it. It highlights Tia Leononi and Holland Taylor, and later makes me a cheerleader. I think it was not so big, and was canceled after a few seasons, but I believe it was a good move and it would be suggested to show ... if the opportunity arises.
