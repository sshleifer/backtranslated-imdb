Level adaptation is often a major fault. They are often put out on a stage like a film camera, (eg "Night Mother"). The Sydney Lloyt directive keeps the film alive, which is particularly difficult for the image to give it a real challenge. Still, it's good to watch for what it is. Chemistry in Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve is quite brilliant. Their relationship dynamism is astonishing. Ken is always fantastic, and Reeve really gets one of his few prospects to work. <br /> <br /> I accept that I have never seen Era Levin's game, but I have heard that J. Pollan Allen's adaptation is faithful. The script is incredibly convoluted, and you keep the guess. "DeathTrap" is an incredible entertainment film, and it is recommended for almost all fans of stage and screen. <br /> <br /> 7.4 out of 10
