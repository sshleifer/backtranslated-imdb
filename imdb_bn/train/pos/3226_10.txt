I do not think here to release a movie in this movie. It was only when it saw onto the cable. The film deals with the inhalation of children in killing equipment Especially a person who fails to cope with the way he is replaced and terrified (in a literal sense), in a community where he realizes himself and what he thinks of. <br /> <br /> It appears that many people were expected to be Rambo in this place, and it would have been nice if I was happy. <br /> <br /> I'm absolutely glad that it was not - cart painting did a good job of mental illness. The scene shows where it is sitting outside, although at this moment two slow-mom replacementes are decided. <br /> <br /> This is not a classic SF movie like BlackDur ner, Alien, Silent Running. Logan's run or THX1138 was, but unfortunately I've seen it for a long time. <br /> <br /> He changed the film to a credible degree, he did not crack a liner with Arne, he did not become snake-free and there was no definite happy ending. <br /> <br /> This image did not look good. It has followed the formula, and in an American audience of 18-25 years old, it was not so empowered because it was expected to see it. <br /> <br /> Fear and discipline <br /> <br /> Always
