I recently went to film screening at Guinajuato, Mexico, during a small film festival, Express N corto. One of the producers was there and gave a brief introduction The film is rolling and I was surprised by the first shot: a long series of glorious black and white future a Paris series. <br /> <br /> I do not want to go in detail because I think it's worth a film. Science-fiction stories can be found on average for many ... I was really good to me. The action is great, the camera is free to fly everywhere and I mean everywhere. Things you are not able to see or see are beautifully done. Cast performances are good, I do not waste a wrong mistake in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Now the thing I got is animation. 3D graphics look 2D Bring life to a BW comic book. The background detail gives more texture as if it was done by hand (I'm sure it was but angle when you see depth). <br /> <br /> The screening producer said of hard work behind the movie: 7 years! She said the director was bright, but she was quite inexperienced because she probably had a small film on her CV. So, many people had the true faith among them. They start from their own studio startups and after facing the challenges they face on them, <br /> <br /> do not miss it. I think you will not regret it ... maybe Richard Lincolt is the best one for this film's final look.
