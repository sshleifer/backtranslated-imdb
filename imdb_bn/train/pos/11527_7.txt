In this 1940 biopics by Mrs. Leslie Carter, Mary Hopkins plays a fine cast of "Red Hair Lady", which includes players like David Belasco, Cloud Renaissance, Richard Lawyer as Louie Paine, and Laura Hope Crows and Victor Lace. <br /> <br /> Mary Hopkins and Cloud Rains make an excellent performance. Hopkins is a beautiful actress who really feels for us Mrs. Carter. Rain is a great, boastful, boasting producer / writer / actor / actress David Belasco, one of the great names of the theater. <br /> <br /> Although Mrs. Carter's second husband, Lou Paiin, worked as an advisor, it is a bad representation of the real events in Mrs. Carter's life. Indeed, there was a lot of publicity and bitter divorce, and undoubtedly she was undoubtedly seen to be an acting character and actress for that. However, his son Doodle was kept in custody, so there was no custody war. Once he broke up with Belasco, he did not return to him and, indeed, started work in Vaudville and actually made some pictures at the end of his life. He was actually married in Lauk, and he became his leading figure in many productions. <br /> <br /> Mrs Carter's driver's power at the beginning of this movie is getting custody of his son, but eventually he realized that his time was far away, he thoroughly tied his father. In the film (and I'm not sure whether to be true in real life) he traveled with his mother and used to live in the Theater Boarding House, which gives the film some interesting fun atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A bad movie, probably not an illustration of Carter or the magnificence of Belca. One of Mrs. Carter's most famous moments is the Heart of Maryland, where she was wearing a wig with a six-foot trace. During the closure, the devotees blown his hair, because he stuck to the center of the bell to keep it tied up 35 feet above the stage. Quite a visual.
