This picture was extraordinary - Tom Hulce and Ray Leota's acting power brought tears and joy to my eyes - this movie shows us that the world still has the hope lighting. When the film was released in late 1988, Hollus must have been nominated at least for Best Actor Oscar instead of Rain Man. Of course one must see!
