** Warning! Hill Spiders Edward! (Yes, I think it is difficult to destroy a historical documentary, but I publish something backstory and method.) <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary documentary not only due to extraordinary footage. Because of the story behind it. Because Newadet was not ready to tell the 9/11 story, rather than a ruckus firefighter, the emotions of men and the connection between them are more real and stronger than their standards. <br /> <br /> In the sense of creating a film, "9/11" textbook. If the event is an actual script, then the characters will be fantastic after they are established, then they throw a curve that they need to respond. Considering the pain and emotions of raw footage, it is more surprising that the directors were forced to cut the story in pieces. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film gives a glimpse of life within a fire station; In particular, how a rook assimilates itself into a crew of veterans. The only part that is very good, and the documentary has been allowed to run its intended courses, it may have been difficult. The brothers actually appear to portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter. <br /> <br /> Of course, all the hell breaks are broken. After the WTC attack, the chaos is completely seen, because the different letters we have learned are in dire circumstances. Not just attacks, but the first reaction is very simple emotional emotional picture. After the <br /> <br />, which is found and found in search of fire, human drama on its peak. Hanging in balance between life and death. Unlike many movies, viewers simply do not know who will live and die, but actually think about them. <br /> <br /> I want to tell about the only negative thing that Robert DeNiro (whom I like) blueboxes are obsolete, unnecessary, and the story does not make advance progress. They were probably added to attract more television viewers. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: The best documentary I've ever seen. Nonpareil illustrations of raw people emotion and drama. 10 out of 9.5
