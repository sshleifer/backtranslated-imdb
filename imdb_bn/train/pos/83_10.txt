A few years ago I added a comment to IMDB in the "Real McCain" TV series. I then said and repeat it was a charming, fun, and entertaining show, played well with wonderful characters. <br /> <br /> I recently saw four older episodes plus reviews from the 2000 release of DVD with Kregana, Cathy. Nolan, and Tony Martinez. Another author here mentions that Lydia Reid (Laughter) and Michael Winkelman (Little Look) have not been returned, but they may be tracked via SAG or later. <br /> <br /> The reunion show is well done and the show gave us many unknown insights. We did not find a part of the internal information that Kathy Nolan expressed regret over whether she left the show due to an unnecessary agreement, which kept Luke a "widow" last year, which was not very good. Nalan went on to throw a comedy bomb named "Broadside" about the women nurse in the Pacific World War II. Take it? As well? No, not funny. <br /> <br /> Now our values ​​are diminishing against the lazy, salicyl and violent TRASH on TV, "Real Maccase" has been entertained with beautiful standards and beautiful people. And I thank all of the creators, including Irving Pincus, bring it to my family. We do not miss it.
