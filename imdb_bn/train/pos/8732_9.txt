Recently, I've seen many Tom Hans films and old Chaplin films and even some of the primary bioanics of Rowan Atkinson and it seems that each one of them has their own unique job that enters their work, which lets them identify all ages of audience members, a way Makes you feel good Life of a bug has the same charm, it is a connection to the real life that allows us to easily suspend the unbelief and accept many worms, because they speak, they still act like a bug, ACT. It's like a team that the film has found a way to bring us into a child's mind and thinks about how a bug can be imagined in a young brain. <br /> <br /> Honey, when I was a dreaded childhood, one of my favorite movies, and to me, a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie, if only the animation is so exciting and this story of storytelling is only open to many More details chances. I do not try to compare something as Toy Story (which I still maintain best computer animated film), because the story of a Bags Life is not as good as Toy Story, but there is almost nothing again. The important thing is still wonderful fun. <br /> <br /> The story expresses the concern of a colony of hard-working festivals, which has a dominant advanced society, which is often made for the production of food crops, most of which goes to weaker grasses, which is much more than energy and general intermediation , And hopefully it will turn left enough for bugs to create it through winter. We have met some grassroots inspections, who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unhealthy amount of food, the results will be terrible. And officially, similar to the unfinished level of food extraction, collectively, the "Great Leap Forward ??" similar to the Maosetu-Tung's harmful for food from its own people; <br /> <br /> <br /> Setting fun and excitement to start when Flickr, the main character, to come back to find a gang of appropriate combat bugs and help protect the colony against the grasshoppers. You see, he has eaten all the food he has eaten and everyone is in danger, so he thinks this is his responsibility, but he has unknowingly finished hiring a struggling group of insect circus performance. Great for the audience, is not so great for hereditary security. <br /> <br /> The movie was released at the end of 90th-20th Century, when many films appear to be coming in two, such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antza etc. The comparison between a bug's life and an interconnection is inevitable, although it seems to me that a Bags Life is by higher film, and it only disappoints Woody Allen and does not play the key role of leadership. This great family fun!
