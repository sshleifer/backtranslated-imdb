Let's get frustrated: If you are a childbirth, then in 1976 McCartney's population drops to the City of Harmat Life and was somewhat surprised to spend the day with him. You obviously wondered how things went. I've heard exactly the same report that the author of this photo has heard from Johns and Paul's perspective, and I admit that I have reconstructed the meeting in the same way as this movie. But none of my imagination could buy tears like this strange piece and acting system in my eyes. I found it amazingly lifelike, perfectly pretty and 100% saccharin-free. Now, can anyone explain why I did not hear this masterpiece before showing the CBC yesterday? I mean, it's three years old, for Tuesday! And yes, if you're a Beatles fan, it must certainly see! Even the fine paraphrasing of the Beatles' tunes in the background is even inspired.
