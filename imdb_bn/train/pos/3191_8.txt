Visual Comedian's old hand director Edward Sedgewich successfully handled this Hell Roach Road show, which is a large number of employers of Roch's reliable actors, fast-moving and adventurous scenario and excellent casting. Although the film was originally identified as a vehicle for Passei Kelly, Jack Haley was a young Kansan by Joe Joe Jenins, who sold his own auto repair business and Hollywood tours, where he loves to play a screen role for the girl who loves to stroke Seychelia (Rosina Lawrence). Sidgwick likes to use full MGM studio as her set, so here it is ready for audition, as Sequilia, it is treated by a paramour, movie star Reynoldo Lopez (mischief earn), for retreating steps off, naturally, a musical comedy, Broadway Headlines featuring Lyda Ruby. Laurel and Hardy provide some fun interviews with their well-known skit involving a little Harmonica, and we look at the good aspects of Jos√© Compton, Russell Hicks and Walter Long. On the basis of balance, one must have Mastie Oure hand-in-hand, who is clearly an emotional film star, a role that he has made mainly, and directing director Barry Barkley to shine up his shiny glass of filming.
