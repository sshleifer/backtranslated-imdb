This film seems to be sponsored by the kids as the driving force behind the movie, which parents can most regret most of the entertainment kids. The movie seems and it is mostly interested in children, but it does not stop at this level. I first saw this movie as a small child and it seemed fun, entertaining and heartwarming and did not see it again for many years. I saw it again recently at the age of 18 and it is found almost as fun but joyful and entertaining. This movie contains many implicit and real life messages. This movie is an inspirational exploration story created for children to epitomize their own rights. I recommend this movie of any age.
