I agree with the previous commentary about the "everyday insanity" of the content of the film, but want to specify: "Dog day" about how it is treated to women (male) society. The episodes we see here show some variations in the discrimination towards women, which are classified as the category of most age groups. A senior man who looks and behaves his new partner to his new partner, behaves like a doll who will work to "dress up" the former dress. There is a middle-aged couple in which in relationship he is almost a slave and he is a (violent) master. Then we find a small person who does not contact his friend / wife, and instead of being jealous of his work, he even makes friends with his rival. A young adult makes it clear to his friend - a girl who is really bored enough to be rude to him - must have her jewelry and follow her narrow rules of etiquette. Finally, in the late fifties, a man summarizes a serious clinging woman who calculates his own advantage to a serious client, who naturally kills him in order to convince his car. To meet the examples, we have found a man's follower of "master-slave" - ​​jointly after his misuse - after his former threat and humiliation "for him" he will be rid of his partner and will accept himself freshly. "Master". All of the time, the activities of recently-built residents are performed under the hot sun-burning fire - absolutely no speed (Seek!). Unfortunately I have not seen the last minute of this disgusting and authentic image of the archive structure which still governs the relationship between men and men, but we strongly analyzed the report of discrimination. Due to good visualization, helpful tools for teaching a less sensitive audience.
