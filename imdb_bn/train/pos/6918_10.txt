A very enjoyable movie that performs bad things and coordinates the features that resemble the bubbles of anger and retaliation. Cast is very good, there are lots of actions, and Stuart finally gets the girl and her revenge (with a twist). I saw this image several times, and it always watch when AMC or cable. Highly recommended ...
