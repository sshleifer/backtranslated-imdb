Responding to the reply of a person who did not have the purpose of Jess's brother's role, my response was: <br /> <br /> The introduction of Jesse's brother is the dramatic tale of the story. Seeing how Craig Chefar / Norman Jess had become a brother, could predict the problems related to a full-fledged life. There are many instances where Brad Pitt and his life are running parallel, for example, when Jess's brother took Craig Shefar to a discrete bar and then he found Brad Pitt a few days later. The dramatic mockery was there so that the character of Craig Shefar took a major psychological disturbance in the death of his brother, because he could do more to prevent it, and later created more attractive mood in the film.
