This movie is amazing. Writing, directing, acting is all superb. Very diverse and clever script. The quality performance by the actor, Alie Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightful quirky. Truly original and heart warmly unpredicable. The scene is alive with fresh energy and really talented production.
