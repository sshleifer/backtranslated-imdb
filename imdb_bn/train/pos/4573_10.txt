Daniel Day Lewis is our time and one of my favorite actors of choice. I think, there were a party in our house many years ago - friends came, we were sitting around the table, eating, drinking, talking, smiling - having a good time. The TV was - there was a movie that we did not pay too much attention Then, suddenly, stop talking to us and smile. The glasses did not tear, the fork did not move, the food plates became cold. We could not stop the eyes from the screen where the young reckless man whose entire body was against him and his left foot was in control, his feet were broken into chocolate and one word on the floor which he wanted to write eternally. When he wrote a word, we all knew that we saw three triumphs - not only the desire of man and soul, but also the moment of the film's ability to capture the moment of the movie. Actor who did not act, but who turned his character into. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " Who was an artist and writer and who got the love of his life. <br /> <br /> I like everyday performance of Luis (I feel mixed about his performance in GONY) but I believe his best role was Cristi Brown "my left foot"
