I'm not a big fan in most animosity, but thug wing is really something else. There is a lack of stereotypical melody in the gang wing, which you can think of in anime, because the number of jokes created for 17 hours can be doubled, the gangster wing came straight into the business. <br /> <br /> It's a verb series, as a political thriller. Large parts focus on the diplomatic behavior of the war, not just war. Although there is no extreme description in the field of war animation, where it can be only painful pain, but different parts of the gang are considered to be almost part of the industry considering complex mechanics and animated uses of fast movements. <br /> <br /> In my knowledge, this 42 episode plus movie series was selected in 2000 on Cartoon Network, and still was professionally dubbed by them. Dubbing is simply flawless. Not only does each word say the match up, but the use of the voice really make the character a lot more credible. Many believe that it is good to subscribe to English anime, but I just do not have the courage to do it. <br /> <br /> Just the voice is not good, but the score used on the series is quite impressive. I would just say a soundtrack left it scouring the net in vain. <br /> <br /> The plot of this series will hook the real viewer, and not, the main time of the drama will not be hacked, which was created for hooking you. Explaining the plot deeply can lead to many spoilers, because there are not many names in a series of many letters, even names. There is a rough idea in this series that there is a problem in maintaining peace in the world and its free space colonies. So a war begins, a military coup and a wide range of diplomatic situations. I think that will start providing any detailed information, which is very important for the plot. <br /> <br /> I would say here that this series is great for someone who likes anime, anyone who thinks anime is fool too (they have a good reason to think), and anyone who wants to go to animate is a serious tone.
