A short anime based on the CAT SOUP legend Manga Knockoffs. It won the "Best Short Film" award at the 6th Fantasia Film Festival and won the "Excellence Prize" at Japan's Media Arts Festival. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When the little baby was stolen by death, he and his brother Nyatta started a bizarre journey to get it back. On the other side of the supernatural dream scenes, they are facing many amazing characters and extraordinary, often annoying events. <br /> <br /> CAT SOUP is an animation you have never seen. Hello Kitty Acid! It possesses a great sense of very original, stunning, beautiful and curiosity and lyric. CAT SOUP is very spiritual (no conversations) and sometimes cruel and great. So it's an anime for adults (they just can not understand!). This is a great journey for those who get the opportunity to see absolute masterpieces. Must be seen!
