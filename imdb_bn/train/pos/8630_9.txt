"Necromantic" writer, Zurg Butterridge's second feature film, "Der Toading" is a powerful masterpiece. Centered around a chain letter originating from a group called "Brotherhood of the Seventh Day", the film shows 7 episodes, each one in a week, within one week, where suicide is committed by using letters and situations during the letter formation. Round it. If you love Hollywood movies or musical instruments, enjoy happy or even "remote" movies, or enjoy the movie only if it is played on stage. <br /> <br /> The best way of explaining the opinion-guard of Der Toading was that, in the 80's and 90's, in Germany, the original country was banned, why the budgetary films were generally banned. Dr Toading is not really focused on the characters displayed on screen, but the meaningless feeling or depression most commonly consists of the lives of people. The reasons for the budget being alive, there are no just reasons to stop and you can not choose how and when you die, you can be the King of Death, Dar Todesing. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Featuring almost the same cast as the same crew and all his other films, the "art film" will probably be the earliest description. Der Todesking features an original method to shoot, create moods and handle the central object of almost every view. During a scene, the camera gradually pans in the 360 ​​° circle, when a person lives in a small one-room apartment for a day. On the other hand, using the word budgetary uses words and film corruption to describe a man's falling mental condition, when he resides in his depression. In one third, the seemingly beautiful scenes are shown on the screen of genuine people for name, age and suicide, which probably ban Germany for this special movie. <br /> <br /> episodes (and especially this one, the scenes are simply abnormally connected) usually suffer from inconsistency, and Dr Toading is no exception. Although there is a single focus of death penalty in all episodes and its consequences or consequences of all its diversity, there are very strong episodes, but one episode or two may even be thought of as an element of filer, which in part eliminates the overall strength of the film - still jaw dropping, isolated Very strong interviews that depict the body can keep the movie together By releasing and clearing it from a more unclear moment of magnificence. The general atmosphere is annoying, frightening, extremely depressing and sometimes even boring - much like the rest of the middle of a theater shown in a film festival in the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that gives a lasting impression and I strongly recommend that anyone looking for a special experience and something that they will remember in the coming years. The heart is not recommended for vague or timing fans, it is a small, different movie that enhances the feeling among the audience. Whether it is confusion, surprise or even hatred, you can not be cold by achieving the achievement of this small Indie Kruti in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The original theme of the movie, "Die Fahrt ins Reich der Menschentrümmer part I-III" was released in the limited 666-piece 8 "vinyl version which is now much more sought." You still get the "Nicomantic" soundtrack CD, High-resolution, low-fictitious synthesized music makes the film dark and playful, almost helpless, making an essential part of the atmosphere of the film and everything you do Want to hear it very rarely.
