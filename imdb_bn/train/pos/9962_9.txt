I was a little afraid to see this movie due to its rate. But living in these titles in Italy has never come and I love that I tried to try. How surprised! This story is seen separately from any other dance-movie, which is a deeper sense than just "victory". Touch it and well written and well guided. Roy is such a powerful character, I do not love myself that she loves herself, she is so mature and attentive and aware of her list (and Ratin Wesley has a talent, my jaw has fallen into the final dance scene). The way he follows his dream and refuses to stop any of his, honestly, inspires. Also, he is not usually a super-hot cock (see Jessica Alla, Brianna Evigon, Zenna Dewan, Joe Silda ...) makes her really interesting and real. Seriously, why is this movie so low? You can understand that it is a good job in the first 5 minutes. Actually really good I even cried at the end of the movie And dance routines are just sick.
