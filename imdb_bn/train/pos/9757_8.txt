Richard Williams is an animation god. The producer was disturbed to manage this film. The final product is very unfinished with a very strong story, but some extraordinary moments of animation (such as Emory Hawkins's "greedy"). Joe Raposo's repetitive music is not helped. It was made on a wide screen so that VHS does not show it at all its greatness, let's hope we sometimes get a letterboxed DVD. Still it is valuable to see some eye-popping animations.
