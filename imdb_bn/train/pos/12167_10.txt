When someone thinks so socially that they stop functioning? How can one person get alone? When we have to be part of the society, what will we have to do, what will happen? Frownland explores this question Certainly an impressive original debut from Broncott. As weird and clustrophobic tones, we enter into the mind of a person named Keith, which is so annoying that he can rarely make the right sentences. He has to communicate with people day and day functions as we follow him around. Many of us tell such acquaintances - there is nothing to appreciate those who feel too "grateful" or "grateful". So we know there are people here, but why would anyone want to make a movie about them? Well, because of its interesting and bronstein and the main actor, Door Standard, do a great job. This movie, which can be found in the film, is almost non-commercial. Some friends paint pictures of money for a few years. It was a pretty low budget of 16mm shots and rough-looking film appearance. With no distributer, it might be a hard one to find, I think it has been rendering randomly for last year or so. Hope this will be a DVD at some time. I have seen in Silent Movie Theater here at the LA. Out of the audience, there were 10 people, among them Crespen Glover, if it tells you this movie is strange. Highly recommended.
