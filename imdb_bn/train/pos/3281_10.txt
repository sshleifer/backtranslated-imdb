Who is such a shadowy little picture so much hunting and touching? I really impressed. It's a shame that more people did not see it. I always liked the score of Hans Zimmer, as always. And what a director of Bernard Rose consecrated! But I would be surprised if I wanted to tell this horror film. It is easily advisable that it is a fantasy or drama. Well, whatever, I love it explanatory chances. Anna (played by Charlotte Beck), everything and dreams of everyone represents a real contradiction in her life ... the house itself, the tree, the mark, the lighthouse etc. This is a lot of detail that makes this movie so good to watch the repetition. I hope I will come across a short film such as emotion and psychological money are being loaded soon.
