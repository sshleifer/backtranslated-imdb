Two years ago I saw "The Matador" in the movie and I liked everything about this movie. Obviously, I absolutely feel the great role of Pierce Brosnan. Yesterday, I grabbed this movie again on TV so I looked a little deeper. Now, I can definitely say that this movie is not special but you just love it for a person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said that soon Julian met Danny Wright (Greg Buyer) of Mexico City, who was unfortunate: his son has died in the accident, his job is not good, and he is not sure he is his wife Ben (Hope Davis) Could keep <br /> I always like this type of movie; Crime movie with big touch of laughter Most of the humor comes from the brochure because he is talking big about the dwarfs ... or one of my favorite lines on this movie: "I see the left bank of the Navy on Sunday morning, like Bangkok hookah." Brosnan said with his elegance when he was usually drinking his margarine. I've lost Greg's 'American American face' Kinna, which has become very lively because there are lots of people like Danny Wright. <br /> <br /> I suggest you probably visit the best role. Never broson He will smile to you and praise him at the same time. Not equally big movie Great Brosnan
