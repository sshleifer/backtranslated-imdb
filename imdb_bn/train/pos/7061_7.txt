Of course, the real is good, but they are not all bad! Yes, it's made in 3 stories, but hey, so what? I was quite good to be honest in it. I like how Anastasia loved a little change in love when I actually love, it shows what love can do. The stories were not so bad. <br /> <br /> I like Cinderella's voice too. I have nothing original against her voice, but I think it seems more beautiful here, more fantastic. I also liked his personality, he was mostly baitan, yet he was still in love. <br /> <br /> So, I'll give Cinderella II: Dreams Ace True A 7/10.
