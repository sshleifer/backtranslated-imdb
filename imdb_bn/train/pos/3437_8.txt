Some style films need to be clothed. This was one exception. To take its own talent, it's a dressed version of horror genre film. With minimal special effects, it leads to a psychological study, which hit a co-bus with a simple but existent theme, and why? This is not a great movie, because it's a little compressed, the story works. All about subtle, and character interaction. In fact, the initial scene has a significance, but it is only set to set the tone for what it is going to be. I greatly appreciate the balance of male and female energy and will not recommend this story to a more interested person than to respond to physical and emotional challenges. If you see some sympathy, consider your life's need for some courage and wonder, "What should I do in this situation?"
