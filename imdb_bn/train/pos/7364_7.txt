It's not always easy to explain what the movie is like, but at the moment I think I found it. It reminds me of two films: Transposing (small time criminals playing some drugs and some stupid things in Scotland) and The Blair Witch project (due to filming style). <br /> <br /> There are two friends about loyalty among them, one of them is coming out of jail, nobody has been caught. They were driven out of the gasoline despite stolen cars in Scotland They try to find some fuel, they find a farm somewhere in the middle. Farmers think that they want to loot him and point out a gun among them. It all goes wrong. One friend mistakenly shot the farmer's daughter. A man is hunted through the Schotland field and wood. Two friends will literally have to run for their life. <br /> <br /> This movie was apparently shot only in 12 days. Well, this is not entirely unbelievable because its largest part is similar in the same place: in the Scottish countryside, but I still find it amazing. Especially because it's not actually a bad movie. This is probably not the greatest movie of all time, but they can be proud of what they have achieved. I had a wonderful time to see it and overall I enjoyed the movie. I give it 7/10.
