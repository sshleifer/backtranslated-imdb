OK. You can see if you like favorites as one of my favorites. This is a character drama that is absolutely sunny. The main character is a businessman who is stuck in the "same thing, different day" mentality. He is seeing a window from his train every day and he is wondering about it and agree to know more about him. He decided to join the dancers class to find not only the trainer. From there, he bonded four dancers and enjoyed dance, as well as learning about the mysterious woman. <br /> <br /> No small (or any) sexual relationship is involved, just how a small group will learn how friendships are formed and developed. <br /> <br /> This image was rebuilt with Richard Care and Jennifer Lopez and the new one was not as enjoyable as it was during the application. This movie was never bigger in America because it was not eligible for Oscars after it was broadcasted on Japanese television (movies can not be released on TV or they are ineligible for Oscar nominations). Japan won numerous awards for their "Oscars" award for best film, cast, director, and so on.
