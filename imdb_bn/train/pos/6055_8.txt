I was not expecting much from this movie, but I was very happy, because it was light and fun and very well performed. The Central Triangle of Death Cats was surprisingly enjoyable because they went to Wales through their drug-centered travel and blocked their way. Humor was mild and delicate, actually there were three characters (a sympathetic treat to younger old female shopkeepers). The atmosphere of rural Wales is fully captured, and the soundtrack is very well selected. Impressively and carefully recorded, with detailed attention - I have never seen a realistic screenplay of traditional culture - I felt that I was with them. Tight and full of light is full of fun - what you can not expect from a movie about bikers and medicines. Joy in all comments, and it is difficult to criticize, though I think the last two scenes were a bit taller - when they left Wales, the film should end. But overall, a film is an unexpected treasure.
