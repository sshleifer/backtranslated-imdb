It has been created in a low budget, most of the days have ended, and some of the budgets have some surprisingly good effects to manage. <br /> <br /> The story involves a family that is powered by its solar system in an isolated part of the Mugvez desert in southern Western California, only it is found in trash - they think of motorcycle stores. But their little girl (Natasha Ryan) has started to see the mysterious things - a green pyramid, weird humanoid figures, etc. And recently, the light from a triangle star explosion has been the reason to show extremely unusual auroras in the desert sky. Thus, the family headed by Jim Davis and Dorothy Mallon encounters them with strange indirect forces, who keep them in their place-of-place wars. Containing elements of 2001: Closing a Space Odesi and the Third Kind of Encounter, despite the obvious flaws and disrespectful, during the last time of the day, David Allen's superb special effects remained interesting due to his work. Desert setting is very suitable for close encounters of this film; And the movie can not be compared with Kubricks or Spielberg's movies, but after the end of the day, it is much better than 2001 / closed envoys. I give credits to Director John 'Bode' Cardos, whose 1977 Thriller Kingdom of the Spidars were made to try at least for an interesting development in Arakanapoobia - and on that basis, I finished the day with 7 out of 10.
