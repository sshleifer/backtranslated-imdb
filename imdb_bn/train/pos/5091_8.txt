I saw both parts twice. Enjoyed the story and saw the old Patrick Soze as the hero. He was very credible as Hunter Alan Quartermain and certainly the best of Richard Chamberlain's performance. I admit that I liked to see someone else as "the miserable lady". Alison Doody should not be modern and not with piece pieces. She was not the face of 1800's women. The rest of the cast was terrific and followed very well in the Platinum. I am glad to see that these generations are not afraid to try different characters in actors and are afraid to be seen as old. The age is inevitable, but let's not hide from it. A man in 50+ can be a lot of sex workers (and, Patrick is really sexy) then a green young man, no matter how nice. Hoorah for the character line to go along with a great smile.
