George Cooker is a brooding and cynical classic directive. In this part of Noor, Ronald Coleman is his best actor who lost himself in his own role. Praiseworthy Ethnie John (Callman) took away his wife Brita (Sign Hasho) by her extremely fueled mood and uncertain behavior. But the two managed to keep working together to please their listeners. John began to change things as becoming bored with his carrier; He unwittingly agreed to play Othello. She gets deep in character as an ealous and killer person. He started walking a thin line in delusion and reality and ended up misleading his role with his own life and finally killed his ownership (shell winters), but there are no memories dastardly deed. <br /> <br /> This role seems to be Colombo faultless. Winter is very impressive as the young girl is determined to get away from her intense life. Also Cast: Edmond O'Brien, Ray Collins, Joe Sawar and Whit Bissell
