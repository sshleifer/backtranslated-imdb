I watched this movie at the age of 13 and I really liked the Dana Plato who later played the role of Kimberly Drumond in different strokes. I do not think it's garbage. It is not meant to be a sequel to the documentary. It's just a cute kids movie after 3 men who try to find the bogie straw monster. People are injured and the children rescue them with the help of animals. Swimming and visible scenes of Arkansas were clear. This is a good movie for kids, no real violence, but it's a good fun for young children.
