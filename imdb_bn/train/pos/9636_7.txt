In summer, alone, the lonely French boy Methu (Jeremy Elkim), who is in love with Cedric (Pretty Stephen Rideau). Cool and slow this is a very frustrating movie. On one hand, I was absorbed by it and really felt for two boys. On the other hand, I was annoying - the film shines from the past to the present without any rhythm or reason. It is very confusing and unmatched. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " What is it - we never said! Then he breaks with Cedric and he tells everyone else living with him. Why? We did not say then he finally hooks up with other people. Why? There is no explanation. It is clear that Cedric loves Matthew and Matthew is living in the same city ... but it's a tribute to the film that you really care about these characters. If only things are explained! <br /> <br /> Elkaim as Matthew is not good. She has tall, handsome and a beautiful body - but she can not work. Her idea of ​​acting is sitting around a blank look in her face - all the time. Ruday, on the other hand, is great. She is very handsome, has a very nice body and is one of the actors hell. He also has an incredible sexual magnet about him. Full frontal male nudity, a lot of kissing and a fairly clear sex scene in the film - Most movies stay away from showing male and female love scenes. This is one and it helps to see how the characters care and feelings for each other. So, a frustrating movie but somewhat valuable - especially for the naked scene of Rideau - if you want to nude young men looking beautiful! <br /> <br />
