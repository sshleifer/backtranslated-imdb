So, what's the reason? Is there any kind of vendetta against this lady show or anyone involved in her? Why I've seen the best show years will be canceled? I am addicted I randomly saw this show last fall, and immediately liked it, and saw it every week. Then it went away, and I tried Tevo, but it was not promoted. So I forgot it for a while, until I found an episode of ABC's website. Now I want more. I agree with everyone else - the rest of the junk on the TV was refreshed to see something like today and improve it. I see Boston's legal for my intelligent-comedic fix, and the house for my intellectual-mystery-jackass fix. My wife likes Gray's Anatomy for her "realism", and I love to love / hate, but it can not be more real than me. Many dramatic ways Everything could be wrong, that is. But for once, a drama that is really real. Real people, real problems. Sure, some former gangster has been better, the girl has escaped from the crowd, etc. But these people (especially NYC) are really out there, and I am related to each of them. I do not seem to get enough. I hope that ABC get their heads from their Bee Count boots and continue this show. Get some respect for having a quality drama there. It can be the best show all the time. If someone would just do it.
