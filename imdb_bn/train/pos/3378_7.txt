This movie is highly recommended by Matt Groening to me. Well actually I saw both Simpsons and Phatrum and it got a reference both of them so I figured "What the Hack". This picture comes with some "what will", which you can understand about how lucky and age we are on this day, where we allow easy things like soap and water. Although 2022 men are still shaving with single blood safety razors! Those responsible are not loaded with unnecessary special effects, ray guns, etc responsible for the film. Some are looking pretty 'furniture' once you know what you mean. Remember, "Tuesday Swallow Green Day"
