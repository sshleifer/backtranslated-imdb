After watching his two silent shorts, 'Allen and Hear Men's (1956)' was my first feature-length French director Jean Reynor's film, and I enjoyed it a lot. However, I did not see the movie for Rano, but who is for Star Incredible Bergman? 41 years old ?? Still extraordinary beauty, elegance and charm radiated. After his playful marriage to Italian Roberto Rosellini in the early 1950s, Bergman temporarily came out of public opinion. Her next five films, managed by her husband, failed in the United States, and I suspect that the latest version of Ranio did little to boost Bergman's popularity with English-speaking viewers [however, he did achieve his earlier success with the Oscars at the same time. The year's 'Anstasia (1956)'}. He is a Polish princess, who has seen himself as a Polish angel, acted as Elena Sokorowska, who immediately promised to give the man's commitment and recognition before leaving them. While working on his lucky characters to help the political desires of General Fran√ßois Rolan (Jean Marais), he has fallen in love with himself that he can not escape. This vague political movie works well as a mockery or romantic comedy, unless you take it very seriously; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Burgman's Polish Princess is a dreamer and not a self-absorbed, unlucky way, but a woman of high policy and firmness. He was persuaded by a group to fool a government conspiracy in order to make General Rollan a coup to make the government conspirator, who, knowingly exploit his love wisely as a "Guardian angel" to satisfy his own illusion. Probably the only legitimate character of the film, Henry de Chevaincourt (the mail returning to Audrey Hepburn's husband), who ignores others' selfish secondary goals and follows Allen to love and loves alone. This, Renoir offers proudly, what is really good in French Even with medieval success, 'Allen and his men' are trying to express through the heyday of Eugene (Jack Juanu) for the far-reaching of the Upper Ley French French Liaison, who does not love his maid except his servant. For these sequences, Renoir Max Brothers is trying to have fun scenes of drugs available in the film, but the film was very relaxed and refined that the power was not there only.
