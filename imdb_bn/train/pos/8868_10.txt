I have to say one of the top education that top 3 movies I've ever seen. It's a brilliant throw, and an equally bright director. Singlton shows how life can be in the university. 3 original story lines, leather, African-American and lesbian I was excited by all the stories, but that got me the most tale about Kristen, fighting her feelings towards another girl. The end was great. After seeing Plus 25 times, I'm still crying. I could give this movie 11, but I have to sit for 10/10.
