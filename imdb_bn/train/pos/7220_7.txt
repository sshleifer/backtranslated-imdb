Which thing is not enjoyable for me, it's a story or suspense story that guesses the whole thing will end. And based on a cool game of Era Levin ("Rosemary Baby"), what happened in Deathhrap is just right. <br /> <br /> And Mikhail Cain and Christopher Riv are going to do stunts like kayne and style. Lawrence dragged Olivier Slayt - as much skill and many puzzles ever existed in that extraordinary clever character. <br /> <br /> But it's hard to write a review about the plot, to surprise you, to surprise you and to guess you. Let's say at the beginning that what we know at the beginning is for you to present about the film. Michael Cain is a frenzied playwright whose latest game has failed miserably. When a young aspiring writer, Crispher Riv sent him his manuscript, Kane realized that it would solve all his problems passed on his own and would bring his fame back. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it's an Era Levin story that is fun for the audience and ignores the issue of the game, to guide the curious Christ. <br /> <br /> Cain and River play together with each other, each comes with a certain dynamic tension. There is some ridiculous touch with the story that comes from a script that enjoys drama with humor. <br /> <br /> Swimming: It looks good - but ultimately everyone is not satisfied.
