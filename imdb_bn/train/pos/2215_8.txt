I bought, "All Children's Festivals," and this is not really a horror movie, but many things could have been better. It had many historical values, it was played by very talented actresses / actors, and it is not a daily event that actors can play such roles and it can be a little credible. There were some parts that were a bit medium and confusing, but I did not say that the whole film was horrific. After grabbing New Orleans 1800 and thinking about it after finding something out of it, it is very difficult, and hard work with partners who can firmly signal those parts. But my only major problem with the movie was that those who play free colored people were mostly skinny African, who were not very public at throwing others who are not light-skinned; One of the ancient Creole stereotypes that still exists. Although many Creoles were aware of color, they could choose the extensiveness of castings, but in some sense white painters could have thought more. The actors had a great job, the script was. Well written, and overall I found the performance very credible.
