After forced to sit through some real stinkers (Racing Stripes, Shark Boy and Lava Girl) - I really enjoyed watching "Fried Worms". Once, I did not guess the end! It was fun and entertaining and despite the title, a fairly sunny ton did not adopt a ton. My boys (6 and 10) love it both - oh and my 45-year-old "son" had a smile on her face all the time. This is a family movie that is not only suitable for parents. The relationship with the younger brother is closer to real life. "She does not stop singing to disturb me!" Also, kids try to make friends with new friends and actually behave in a way that makes the kids behave. Of course, parents have to work a little stupid - but in my favorite scene Baba was involved in his new job. Have fun!
