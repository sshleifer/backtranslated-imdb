The film was chipsy from the beginning and its B / W photography in American Heartland is stunning. We think that we are fine with them when they are back in the big sky country and then in Mexico and again in America. At the end of the film, Robert Blake reflects the rain as the tiny river of sweat and tears tearing his face. In the end, we followed them to the stairs of their final moments. <br /> <br /> Two criminals, like Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, Perry Smith and Dick Hick, are seen on the street in any street. Hick is a sunny boy next door and Smith, big guy in his eyes from the wrong side of the city. This point has been made in the movie and it always surprises us that the criminals are not different from the look of anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, is part of human condition. These two confusing men kill an entire family, there is no safe search. Once running, they start by writing bad checks, find a way out for the authorities. <br /> <br /> A lot of good supporters I like Jon Forsouth as the detective of the case, Alvin Davy. Also, Will Gear shines in a brief but fantastic view as a prosecuting attorney. <br /> <br /> I often wanted to see this movie everywhere; it was caught only by small touch; I finally get it after buying the DVD. The best classic crime film I ever saw was the result. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this awesome movie. To me, what's all about making this great movie?
