Elephants were dressed in Egypt some 6000 years ago. It is not enough to stretch it often in the 12th century. I did not realize the series flopped. Is there a second season air now? This is amazing to me when commentators are made up of those who are ill-wise or do not see a show. It waste the board and other time space. The first display of the series might have been somewhat painful before the series started consistently, but it could be expected from any show. The rest of the first season is excellent. I can not wait for the second episode in the US
