We do not come across cinema related to brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema, or any other language or medium. There are various aspects of this relationship that are not absorbed in movies or novels. Generally, a sister is portrayed as a pill-on, who can be used ultimately for the release of the ransom. This movie deals entirely with the light in the light of different light. It is inspired by George Eliot's novel "The Mill on the Floss". Brother is very uncivilized, all good, son of blue eye father who is traditionally preferred by good boy and his mother. Sisters romantic, wild and unwitting rules of society defiant. Despite this, the love of brother-sister's love is won. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is about the love of two siblings, who separated from childhood and the same feeling is resuscitated when they years later . This barbarous brother has also tried to reconcile his sister, who chose to be wild to insult the world. <br /> <br /> While film and novel in two remote countries, except for about 3 centuries, still the feeling is the same and still remains true.
