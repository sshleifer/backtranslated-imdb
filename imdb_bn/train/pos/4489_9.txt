As mentioned in another comment this picture is not about a cat and mouse fight. It is a cat that has survived more than 8 out of 9 and now fears losing its last. The cat dies suddenly and dies all the time, so the name 'Friedie cat'. Freddy's cat's previous life called him as a ghost of various ages and tried to kill him continuously, but he was afraid of the ninth life which represented and formed as a cloud in shape 9. Bolt Now it's too old but you still have fun for kids holding a copy. <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie as a child almost every day: o)
