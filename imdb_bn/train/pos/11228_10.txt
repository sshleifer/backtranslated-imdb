This is short and dots. Storytelling used for Star Trek: hidden Frontier is surprisingly good. Acting on all the maps, but for years the main characters seem to have worked to improve their skills. It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and it is coming to the end of May 2007. <br /> <br /> I will not reshare what I have already said about set and graphics. All this is considered volunteer, for no profit, it is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> If it is moved as a professional production, I would give it a good story but for a terrible set it would be a 5. However, as a fan based production I will give it a nice rating with an exception with another attempt, it is a league of itself. For sheer volume, I do not think this has matched. Cast and crew congratulations for an effort that greatly appreciates.
