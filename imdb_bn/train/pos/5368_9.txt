It's a terrific action film with great one liners from Arnie! It has been made stylishly, to keep a satisfied for a lot of intense action. The characters were terrific, and Richard Dawson, very boring like the main villain. Yes it's a ponytail, but it's extremely entertaining with a very late ending. It was a great story, too, and Arnie and Maria Kancha Alonso had great chemistry together. The development of the character was pretty good, with quite fantastic, too. Directing is great! Paul Michael Glazer, works well here, awesome use of colors, it covers stylish, awesome camera corners, and plays the movie at a fast pace! Savash. Gore has a little bit. We have some bloody gunfire wounds, tearing head, tearing throat, bloody chain tile, skinless body, blood, and a harmful. Acting is great! Arnold Schwarzenegger is always amazed, he is extraordinary in the acting section, he has a few sunny fishing boats, kicked the ass, and always had a big physical presence! And there was so much fun to see! (Arne Rules!). Maria Kanchita Alonso, good at here, she was really cute, and had good chemistry with Arnie! Yaphet Kotto, modest here, does not do much, which he has to do. Marvin J. McIntyre is just as good as a gay person, he was calm! Richard Dawson was as awesome as the main villain, and was very shocked and he had fun to see. Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, Areld Van Lath, Gus Rothiech and Professor Tora Tanaka, they are all doing what they are doing. Overall a must see! **** 1/2 out 5
