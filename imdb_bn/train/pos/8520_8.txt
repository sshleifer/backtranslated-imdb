I was actually quite good in the movie. I enjoyed playing and moved along it. The director really wanted to say that he tried to understand the story. To see the big budget coming out today, perhaps they had a lot of money, but it was very much watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget, you will need to take it into account while viewing it. There were some things that might be good but most of the budget related. The acting was quite good at the F / X and Stunts are working well. The man in the camp had some standouts. And the boy who played the child. Such films have worked in LA and this is one that is fine.
