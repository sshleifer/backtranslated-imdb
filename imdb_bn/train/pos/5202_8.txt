Just saw this version of "Samen", and although I still like it, it's nothing like my "rough cut" version. If you check the message board, you will apologize to the director for this cut-down version of the 79-minute. And he said that he has nothing to do with editing this R rated editor with a complete new screw finish. The Christian does not really have to overcome a lot of himself, the basic ingredient material is still up until the extreme pruning down. This is a shameful shame, because in these years there is a possibility of being one of the best and best movies in the world. It is still pornographic star, and intestines, and some can be seen at least some of them. I'm happy that I have "rough cut", because it's a jewelry for a Gorehound library for me. Christian Vell certainly has the expertise and attitude of the product, and hopefully the next project will be produced more well. They were the closest classic to the idiots, and they all became crazy for it. "Samhain" can sometimes be one of the most controversial and confusing horror films, and the very poor Gorehound director has not been able to see what. <br /> <br /> *********** ************************************************************************* *** Just so you know what you missed, this is my review "<br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image will last for more than 90 minutes and no section will be closed. There is no music soundtrack and there are no audio in some scenes dialogue, because I think they are loaded later. However, most of the movies have sound effects audio and when there is no impact or view A message is displayed as a coup for inserting the movie when it is finished, as it says, "rough cut", but the only Oscar version of "Sameen" that you probably see, because Gore is very impressive, even an NC -17 is even more permissible.Yes there are some porn stars, but they are there to kill, and to add a little sugar and spice. A measure of pati, American tourists in Ireland over the weekend and end up having a house in the middle of the wood. The ancient part of the celebration of the ancient duyeda and samahina lokalokera involved in an area, or as we call it Halloween. (Wonderful) <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a huge dose of Gore, because the camping couple is attacked by local internal mutants. This is a great cowboy scene, because the man is trembling to help his daughter cry. He sees that his head hangs in front of him in front of his arms and shoulders, and when he drags him, he is completely cut off. On this place I will call Extreme Gore with the entrance, blood, and scattered organs. We here in the Herschell Gordon Lewis region, without the effect except for a more realistic look. I'm just avoiding the story because it kills your mental ropes and plots. <br /> <br /> The next guru's view is to see some, like the first killer boyfriend, was taken to a cave (TCM-2 stuff), and a table tied. This gaik then closes all its organs (outside the camera, with a cue to insert a scene), and then we see his bar on a barbecue, slowly looking at the fire, and washing hard-on (if you can believe that ). Yes, very bad taste, roughly, terrible, you find the right word, and probably also fit it. <br /> <br /> Then her beautiful body and finally Zenna James, cut from throat to crotch, and all her entrails are drawn in the graphic gly, and her blood drains into a pot. Well, is that really true? <br /> <br /> But the most beautiful grape scenes happen inside the house, and I have to admit, I saw one of the best Gore scenes. This guy (no matter) is caught from behind from a geek, and cut the ass hole open. Then the gaik puts his hands in his hands and all the boys have entrance, intestines, and whatever else there is, just from his asshole. This goes back, the guy is screaming and more and inn innards are all pulled over laying on the bathroom floor. This is so extreme, so at the top, I find myself smiling at all. Obviously, you will never see this scene with DVDs, IMOs and most other extreme cow's scenes. <br /> <br /> So think of all this. Well, first of all, even though I want to publish this movie in this totally unauthorized presentation, it's a rare jewel for the "rough cut" Gourhounds. Yes, it's a bit harder, a soundtrack, still inserting few views and the places where the credits are lost. But this makes it unique and I do not trade it for anything. Extremely proud, yes yes, extreme extreme. It shows a "Hewitt tension" like a Disney movie.
