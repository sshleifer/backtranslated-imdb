I gave this picture 7/10 which is for screenplay, direction and production value of 1944 and 6/10 average of 8/10 My performance rating was counted on 4/10 for all screen characters except for the change. Carroll Richman was excellent at 8/10, like Carroll Richman. I also commend Thomas Gomesz as Inspector Burgess, whose character ensures that he does not personally feel that the conviction of Scott Henderson (Allan Curtis) is a mere coalition formed by his stupid sister-in-law, then Scott's Albie. <br /> <br /> This image of "Suvivia Film Silent Scene Negro" is a true soundtrack "Ingl√©s" as the Spanish "La Dama Desconsida" as the DVD, I still can not find the full version of English version. I was also concerned about another performance of Ela Reynes after being impressed by her performance as the heroine in "Impact" to play the only female garage proprietor. Believer played another heroic role here, refusing his engineer's mastery and some suggestions that he would return to his home in Kansas prior to solving the missing alivi (his boss's pet name) for him. It was difficult to secretly secretly love her boss, she officially had a formal business relationship with him. Although he designed children's playground and playground, I think the "family man" is burning in the carolas brain. <br /> <br /> In the "film code" operation in the 1940s, producers can only portray sex through metaphors and here it is a furious drumming directed by Elisa Cook General. Carroll drummers herself as an easy-to-use daughter to try to attract drummers. "The Phantom Lady" provides information about Alii. Another major character, Jack Marlow (collaborated with Scott Henderson), played by French Tone, whose acting I was very dramatic and wondered why Carroll constantly did not notice him and was astonished. Strong complimentary congratulations to her. Here the script should be improved and more should be given because the dramatic movement telegraphs very quickly to the audience.
