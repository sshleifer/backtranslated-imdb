I think it's five or six years old in 1962 seeing its original ventilation and really enjoying it. It was the first time it has been seen for the first time since the Disney Channel's "Walt Disney Presentation" has been broadcasted. I mostly forgot it, and it was made up of some children, but it was still enjoyable. I can not wait to show it to my nephew and nephew.
