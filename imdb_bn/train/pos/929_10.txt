The Girlfriends Family Guy was the best new show to hit television. This was another great piece of inspiration from DreamWorks Animation. Like Simpsons, the show centers around a nuclear family (white lions, in this case). There are many memorable supporting characters, including Roger the Sarlangi, Arangutan, Vincent-Italian American Fleming, Blake and Victoria, the gentle patriotic Snout Brothers and Chatney Elephants. The show's other stars, Sigfred and Ray. They are incredibly bright and do everything in a grandiose way, making the most human activities entertaining. The source of the brightness of the program is the combination of attractive animal characters with very adult dialogues and controversial topics (drugs, bias, etc.). <br /> <br /> The blame for the failure of this show is with NBC. They did not like to broadcast these episodes in a particular sequence rather than more logical production orders (perhaps being influenced by the guest stars they could promote). Several times, the event was abandoned for an additional half an hour, such as the worst hit (not like 60 minutes was enough)! This is indeed an unhappy industry for the future of television, if a genuine and bold program like this fails, fear factor and American Idol dominate. Luckily, the whole series is released on DVD and shows. Now there is a great opportunity to make the following. 10/10
