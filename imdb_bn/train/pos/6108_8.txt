I enjoyed this film very much. Most Korean people will feel familiar with this film because many of them are teachers while going to school. Cinematography was average. The movie was better if the angel or camera movement was more irregular. The performance, however, was very clear and unusual. <br /> <br /> The acting was very good. Kim has acted in an innocent, weak girl in Korean Korean soap opera. But this time, he is very nice to play a beautiful tomboy. Kwon Sang Woo also plays a very credible role in his role. <br /> <br /> What I like about this picture is that the characters' emotions are not very unpleasant. There are many Korean romance movies that the audience is crying in front of the audience and I always thought it was too old. <br /> <br /> <br /> is very funny and works well.
