I just thought it was nice and I still remember. I am thankful that we are still able to see different stuff from our flood around Hollywood. Save Grace is smart and enjoyable - those who are offended by the marijuana thing go to see America's bride type movies. <br /> <br /> Grace also shows that a fun movie does not have to be stupid. I was laughing my ass most of the time but thinking about what was the role of female leadership to pay for her late husband's debt. <br /> <br /> briefly - a diverse story of common English laugh and good acting and direction. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
