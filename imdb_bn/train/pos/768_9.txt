Painters, this film stinks. So acting plays a lot. But I do not care <br /> <br />. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The dance was really good. Great music, great <br /> <br /> dance! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see new ones. <br /> <br /> Nergical attack in New York sounds like a zero. Some viewers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course, <br /> <br /> 80's all bad TV shows and <br /> <br /> seem to have fun with the film, but those of us who live in it will always remember. <br /> <Brazil, music , Dance, and graffiti was fresh when it was for a fondly, Yo!
