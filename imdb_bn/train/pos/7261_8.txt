Regarding the genius of Jim Bellucci, I strongly disagree with "Seetomvelu". I like Balu too. Confession, when I appeared apparently, he expressed doubt, because I was so dear to his late brother. But Jim has an on-screen commonman who has got him far away - and has improved it for years. <br /> <br /> One of her previous movies - a gift of her weight - is not it the most true of us?) - and I like this movie. Yes, it is touching and heartwarming, so if you have car movement, explosion and unwanted sex, you can pass it - it's a warm film to get lost in three to find each other. Do not make me wrong, I'm for a movie about three of the above, but I also like the beautiful, difficult stories like this. <br /> <br /> And although Balu≈üi and Kelly Lynch give excellent performances, the real star of this movie is Alison Porter - absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened in his career, but someone responsible for taking the ball? (Agent? What should you do? You could not get a better role to achieve fame than this movie, and even then some notes were not heard from him. <br /> <br /> Another tragic Hollywood story ...
