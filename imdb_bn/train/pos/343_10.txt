Catherine Higgel, Marley Shelton, Dennis Richards, David Boris Even before I knew about this picture, these names were enough to draw me up. Excellent, gifted and popular, to see these performers. <br /> <br /> Okay, where do I start? We already know about what the film is about. Five beautiful girls are being targeted by a 'romantic' series slash, 13 years ago they all started dancing at school. In his trademarks, there are delicate death incidents such as Valentine's Card, Magog-installed chocolate, and bloody nose. His favorite weapon: well, pick up - knife, knife, electric powerdill, bow and arrow, hot iron, etc. OK, so basically it's a horror movie with a pretty twisted sense of sex. <br /> <br /> Horror movies are not supposed to be Shakespeare, but I'm not going there. I love horror movies, but not all of them. This one, I worship. It's with some of my other choices. It's funny, sexy and scary. The child's mask of the killer's best is unclear, and the crew of a bow and arrows at a predator is really unclear to see. Acting Leading: Dennis Richards, Marley Shelton and David Boreanaz are so much fun. I really wanted to see a lot, much more of Catherine Higheel. I'm one of her biggest fans and soon she likes to see some leading work. Jessica Capaso is a highly capable actress, and Jessica Kaifil plays a perfect blonde role in urban legend 2. Small parts were also good; Hadie Buress was a hot ('bleedmedry.com') and that little version of Dennis Richards looked terrible like her. <br /> <br /> Highlight: Each death scene was a special difference to it. The opening scene of the morgue is the crystallist. Hot scene, when ridiculous, is doing well. And audiovisual brow was sinister. The soundtrack is great with extraordinary music and some fine alternate tunes. <br /> <br /> I think, as the killer featured enough, we just saw the mask, and it was not all featured at the time of Climax. I thought that the ultimate measure was actually unconditional, but fun <br /> <br /> The thick wonder was not so great at the end, but I'm really glad that the filmmakers decided to give up our whole <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, which movies will look, do not want to tell people, but if someone tells me to choose a scary film, which I thought was really valuable, then Valentine would be it <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 / 10 (in the bullets!)
