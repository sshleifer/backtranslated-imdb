I just can not understand the negative comments about this picture. Yes, this is a simple boy-romance romance but it's done with flash and polish that just flies. Henstriz (talk about winning the Gene-Pool lottery!) Magnetically and forever lucrative (who says that the golden age of the movie is dead?) And Bharatan is his own <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Two Lead; The movie is the most alive when they share a scene! It is so good that you are searching for them to unite yourself ... <br /> <br /> Ignore negative comments - If you feel a little blue, look at this flick, you will feel better. If you are already happy, you will be happy. <br /> <br /> (PS: 33 years old male, from UK and still disappointed romantic looking for his prince ...)
