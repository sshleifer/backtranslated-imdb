This film was nominated for Best Picture, but was defeated in Casablanca, but Paul Lucas defeated Humphre Bogart as the best actor. I did not see why Lucille Watson was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, I do not think he did a very good job. Bate Davis and Paul Lucas and their three children are leaving Mexico and coming to the United States for the first time in the film. They are going to Davis's relatives home with the train. Davis and Lucas were in underground to stop the Nazis, so they needed a lot of rest. But when they reach home, one of their Nazis lives there and they can not do anything about them. It shows that Nazi only takes care of the money and is willing to deal with Lucas. Their plot is more but you can find it for yourself.
