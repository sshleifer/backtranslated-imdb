This is a wonderful movie. As it grew older with rural lifestyle, it is known as the Canadian, winter, canoeing, trap, hunting and similar. It's easy to recognize, but after watching this movie it has increased over me several times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its first big role is Annie Galipeau lovely. Cast is difficult to rest.
