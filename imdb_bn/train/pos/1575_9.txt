I watched the Van Trota film Rosenthorridge film of the year. I am not really interested in films in the historical background, but with that he won my interest for that time !! <br /> <br /> The only annoying thing in this movie has been visible in New York and the imprint is "trying as much as possible American" ... which I think has completely failed <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> <br /> <br /> German actress Kazaa Remand is perfectly eligible for her prize. She is one of the most influential actress she has ever seen. In the future I will see more of his movie. Best wishes for me that I speak a native German language) and only for one year for us, so soon as I'm back I'll buy some Rimon DVDs. <br /> <br /> So everyone has not seen this movie yet: see it !!! I think it is too long to describe what it has been described, especially all the flash back and time switches are difficult to explain, but just check it out, you'll be awesome !!!!!!!
