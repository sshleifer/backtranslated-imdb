In 1958 Clarksburg was in the famous Speed ​​Trap town. Most of the revenue of Sheriff's office was made. Who tried to kidnap Sheriff? Well, that gave Sheriff the chance to push Clumssburg Curve with their Plimouth Cruiser. For example, at the beginning of the film, some civilians try to return to their holidays, pushing them towards death, if I think correctly. Then one day, a stranger went to the city. Perhaps the world's coolest hot hole in the world. Michael McCord Even on Maccard Gates, his name is a car name. Probably the final hot rod. A black flamed '34 Ford coupe. Death color, evil and hell. She gets picked up for speeding by Sheriff on purpose. Check out the land he has to see. He is the brother of one of the victims of Sheriff. He knows how his brother died. The Clarksberg government is all for the sheriff There is only one way to arrange justice for the assassination of his brother and "it will never happen again to anyone": to repeat and to set the competition's hot-roller style to death. He moves from curve and practice. Sheriff McClord knows about that. The nation begins ... This is a movie that can be remembered by a person, who never tried to interfere in certain parts of the road.
