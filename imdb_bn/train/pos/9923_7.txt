I've read several mixed reviews and many of them trashed the movie. I was really interested in this project because it was directed by Tony Scott and after having so deep impact on me and on Fire, I became interested in his work. Before starting my review, let me tell it first ... It is very surprising that this movie can be called annoying and generally, but the author and Scott have chosen a different method. <br /> <br /> Plot: <br /> <br /> I just said it is not annoying. Most Hollywood films offer 'effort and truth' plots that they know they will be in contact with people, often taking viewers' movies and making high profits. I've seen this plot a bit more interesting. For reference, I recently saw 'Weatherman' and 'Lord of War' and when I say these movies are excellent, and I've enjoyed both, plots in these movies are annoying and hope you will be told them exactly how they are told. They do not take any chances and you've seen a rough American film after they are highly anticipated. Dominion's plot is both interesting and it has been said in a way that makes you think, "Hey, they're now drunk". And I think there are plenty of recent movies. It gives me a lot of depth, my opinion, and lots of things to ask you when looking at it. Overall, this has kept me so much interested in the movie. <br /> <br /> Letter: <br /> <br /> I felt that the letters were correct. In Knight, did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who had something else inside and wanted to see what she had. It is clear that he wanted to prove himself and he wanted to achieve it in any way. <br /> <br /> Choko was very credible, used Spanish in inappropriate situations, reaction to the lack of affection of Domino, as well as his jealousy in the party ... all of them were true to me, which I thought was that his character was more realistic. . <br /> <br /> The character of Rouacak was the least interesting to me, but it is still true to me. He looks like a common man, trying to finish. I hope filmmakers try to work with him because I have come out of it. He did a very good job of showing Ed, which made his mistake, still trying to live his life. <br /> <br /> Clermont / Women: I believe they have supplied a lot of 'heart'. In the story. They were not the only people who got the money to buy a bentley, this was the real person who had the real problem and they meant the meaning of achieving the goal of others. You can express sympathy with them because they did not have problems without the solution of this child's illness. These characters wanted to show the real people who were less fortunate who came to this zodiac because they needed help. <br /> <br /> Mumbai: They pretend the story in such a way that only the people can do it. And I really like that part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are infinite references to 90210 people from Wade's painful statements. It has become more enjoyable because of their involvement in the movie. <br /> <br /> Cinematography .... Yes .... cinematography This movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. But in my opinion I thought it was gifted, the use of camera to translate the mood of the current state was very effective in my opinion. I could consider using it as a method to properly understand but always improve, like something else. I congratulate and congratulate Scott, Editor, Artist and Director of photography with some real potential in this movie. They did not go too far with his presentation, they did much more. Using a very light and very dark color colors, the film's appearance is made with a terrible and radioactive look that accurately reflects the lives of people, the monsters, the hunter-gatherers, and the less fortunate life that their life is' peachy or 'clean' as anyone else. If you notice low pressure or conflict, then there are very few if you have a camera tricks. It shows that Scott and his crew are trying to achieve something with this look and not just doing it for the hack. I understand that most people do not expect this movie and it lets many of them turn into this film, but I think Scott has adopted this method. Hollywood movies have grown predictable and soft. Most of them are shot in the same way as the same twist and turn. And I'm glad Scott tried something different. Undoubtedly, this movie is not for everyone, but there is nothing to say about it as a trash and to offer it which is missing the absolute point. I've enjoyed this picture perfectly and I am glad that I spent money for it. I would recommend this to everyone, but I'm sure it will hurt only a few words. I should agree with a poster before when he said that those who refuse to watch MTV's "out of the arena" will not realize this movie, but I think many people do it. We should try to enjoy it all that Scott and including. Some take the possibility and try to provide something that is unique and unique. And with that mind, I think he's tremendously successful.
