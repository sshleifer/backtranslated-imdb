The film started again in 1976 when it was combined with the legends of the tongue and misconduct --- it speaks widely failure. I obviously reminded Ebert to give a star and it was supposed to be in Cannes. <br /> <br /> These people apparently did not understand the film, which is still very hard, dark and layered, that still surprised me. I'm reading most of the reviews here (even after about 7-8 views in years), many elements of the movie that I've seen before. কিন্তু গল্পটির মনস্তাত্ত্বিক ভিত্তি ছাড়াও, এটি এখনও একটি ক্র্যাকিং সাসপেন্সার ছাড়াও ... আপনি যদি কেবল মাত্র দুই ঘন্টা চলমান সময়টিতে সুনামির তরঙ্গের মতো পোলানস্কির শিরোনাম চরিত্রটিকে অতিক্রম করে যাচ্ছিলেন এবং অত্যাচারের শিকার হন তবেও তাড়াহুড়ো করে। <<Br /> Source material only in the modern novel, the author Roland toporera a remarkable novel --- - --- more playful unveiled levels. Polanski's Trekovsky's highest order is a milquetoast. যদিও তিনি প্রথমবারের মতো আরও হালকা দৈনন্দিন আত্মা বলে মনে করেন, তবুও ধীরে ধীরে তিনি উপলব্ধি করেন যে তিনি সেই ব্যক্তিদের মধ্যে একজন, যিনি লক্ষ্যহীনভাবে জীবনের মধ্য দিয়ে সরে যাচ্ছেন বলে মনে করেন এবং তাকে নির্দেশ দেন। He saw some strong feelings about his likes and dislikes.
