With the advent of IMDB, this neglected movie can now find interested audiences. Why? Because here users are searching for two-time academy award winning Glenda Jackson, among them her credits find 'The Return of the Siler'. So those who can check out Oscar winner Julie Christie. Supporters of Anne Margaret can give a click on the title, as they look at the great Alan Bethes carrier. Heavyweights added a movie with support from Ian Holm and Frank Finlay, not to mention bonus. Any such movie is rewarded by IMDB, which is given here in cross-referencing. So, why is this movie out of the DVD? Producers do not understand the Internet Movie Databases marketing gift for a movie? And 'The Return of the Cillier' is clearly waiting for a gem to be discovered. Get it, get it with people.
