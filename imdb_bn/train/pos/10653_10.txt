I know now fashionable hated this movie. In 1963 I saw hundreds of spook movies, including most of the films of Hunting and Hammer. This movie is not restrictive and does not hold them in such a way that perhaps most modern viewers do not like it. Still many viewers can take scrum-free control films because knife killers are more easy to believe in people than ghosts or ghosts. Actually this movie had a lot of great scenes and acting and special effects were great. I have seen it 15 times and it gets better every time. The director of this movie has produced many interesting and stylish movies and is not trying to make the realization of the 6th genre. Hunting lets go and certainly not annoying. Perhaps this film can appeal to the fans of John Carpenter, but more of a traditional plot structure can be made. The old hunting was also a fine film since 1963. It was more scary. See both The Innocentes and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin.
