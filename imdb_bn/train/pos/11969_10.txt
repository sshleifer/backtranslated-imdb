I like to make this shot bigger and at the age of 19, I still see the DVD of the first season. Can i say I grew up in many homes, like the whole house. There were my parents, two sisters and a dog. I was just the difference that I did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend. Also, I grew up with my mother at home. I do not know what I will do without the flower house on television. I think Stephanie (played by Jody Sweets), D. J. (Acting by Kirk Cameron's sister Kandes), and Michelle (played by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen) is my favorite character. I can be related to each of them because I'm a middle class child of my family like Stef, I'm a small sister like Michelle, and I'm D. D. I really like how the show always moral values ​​because I really do not like any program like today. I also like the comedy of the flower house. Aunt Jesse (John Stamens), Joey (Dave Coolier), and Danny (Bob Saguet) are gradually ridiculous as the girls' uncle, father, friend, and father. The story is that after the daughters' mother died, Dani's best friend Joey and her father-in-law, Jesse, proceeded to help the kids in the children. Three youths trying to nurture a young girl = ridiculous Every character in the flower house is full of heart, fun, and true credible. Joey is an aspiring comedian with a child's heart and spirit. Jesse is driving a motorcycle, riding a motorcycle, a tough guy's uncle, who is soft by his three brothers and later his wife Beckie (from Samarville to Laurie Laughlin). Both kids and adults will love this show. Sure
