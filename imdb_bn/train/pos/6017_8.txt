There is no way to deal with 'jabbersky points' from a reasonable point of view or you are trying to describe it using words and conventions used for other movies. This is because it is not a movie. It is an idea and a feeling that filmmakers have become an object in any way as a movie dome. What we see is not the manifestation of a plot, but a sequence of events that we do not see in movies every day, but imagine only the background that we will provide when we hear some tragic events or hear from friends. We see that our fantasies are unrealistic to us-we do not know, but we have not heard of them in any book or TV or elsewhere. So what do we see? Events. We argue with people to argue, drive, and inevitably run away. Exemptions are somewhat invaluable - it is a collective situation and cruelty that allows the existence of human civilization, or the absence of a civilization, or human nature. Los Angeles, set in the late 1960's, acts as a response to our players and self-inflicted miseries of modern existence. These creatures can clearly show the features that we can imagine in the blank blank slates. Although the steps taken can be seen as criminal or unlawful, the letters are not themselves criminal They are beyond the recognition of a known, unseen existence, which is beyond everyday nature. They are never happy or sad, but they have achieved their own realization when they move away from modern living. They achieve real life only in the natural world, even though it is the next victim of modern existence. Finally, 'Jaborky Point' is a compliment to the humanitarian attachments in the natural world. Even the most fragmented piece of the world has leaned towards the idea of ​​our progress, we lose our soul on the death of human soul.
