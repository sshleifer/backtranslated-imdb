A very intelligent movie with a great background provided by Boston and Fenway Park. As a addicted to baseball fan and light movie, it hit me homer for me. Lots of past Bosoxers and the actual Bosox failure with laughs and the lots of authentic baseball scenes with real references. And how enjoyable it was to see the movie with a baseball theme, in addition to facing any criticism, did confident Kevin Coster try to expel believers from any critics? Jimmy and Drummer Jimmy Bose has done a good job like a young boyfriend who suffers from "Jones". It was a distraught and left outside of the field, but in reality Sox fans are playful and save their lives through the fate of their favorite team. The film was at a rapid pace and in the coastal coastal coastal coastal coastal coast of the coastal coast, in the coastal region, the coastal coastal region was buried and sensitized. <br /> <br /> It was also enjoyable that Wiley Gerson returned to the screen. I miss the most popular "Stanford Blatch" from Sex and the City. She is always funny, even when she says very little or too much. <br /> <br /> So buy yourself two box seats, buy some popcorn and be ready to have fun. Winner of "Fever Pitch"
