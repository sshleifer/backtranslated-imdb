I, like many horrific fans, have emphasized the same big budget Hollywood remix and MTV High School slasher trip over the last 20 years. Here, in the end, a real horror movie that checks all the right boxes. <br /> <br /> If you want a hot Seed actress, you want vampire, you want quiet arms, if you want quiet vehicles and you want blood, lot of it by loading the bucket - you've got it. <br /> <br /> Queen Stephenie Beecham herself is a supporter of the classic warring comedy and Hammer Horror, this is a wonderful thing. <br /> <br /> Despite the low budget, using 35 mm stock and quality CGG effects in quality, director James Eve has created something that is too big to think. <br /> <br /> There is definitely a fan of old school horror.
