The more intimate film than the rosemanstrous epic proportion, which could keep many movie passengers away from Pianovir's plot. Fortunately, a good photographer, Van Trotta, has chosen feminist pipes of an era depicted in many parts of its alphabet, but has given very little analysis from the point of view of interim and from the perspective of the general Aryan Germany. Rosentrasse found out of his strength in this unsung burden who stuck in historical circumstances, as they emerged as victims. The motion of the film is spontaneous, relentlessly slow, meditative. Alongside, the characters are so vivid, when the changes between periods between the generations and the narrative are made relatively impressively. Rosenstrasse is not a great composition, and some narrative errors are well discerned. False lies on a trivial cinematography, unable to capture intrinsic intrinsic drama living by another fault letter. Yet, this image is valuable. Finally, Rastensea is a part of Germany's last trend that deals with past past ghosts, among these trends, such as unforgettable films in Africa and recently controversial downfall I would recommend this picture to anyone who knows this photo.
