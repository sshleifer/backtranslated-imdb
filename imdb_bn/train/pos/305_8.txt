The sculble comedy about romantic conflict in New York City. Peter Bogdanovich has fallen in love with all the women in his film - he respects them - yet Audrey Hepburn (naturally) has placed a groove on others because, finally, he had read Princess Bogdananovich in love with movies 30 years ago. She gets into the sheets of loving off-ups, gets in her sheet and she's in a nicely stiff / lice / soft-high Ben Gazzara, and can dazzle her home all the time. Love-making films are fast and fun, although I watched John Rutter's fatigue of TV-style clutujin. Colin camps, Dorothy Stratane, and landed sensual Patty Hansen are all eager to see. But it's really Hepburn's Valentine and he absolutely glows. *** *** to ***
