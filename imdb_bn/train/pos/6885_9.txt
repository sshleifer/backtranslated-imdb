It was a surprise. . Impact and Solution This movie was on my way to being responsive to the people and the reactionaries in my own way. Most definitely the stirring passion was stirring. The response to not get their way when a spoiled child will be way much better. . If you like. The most ridiculous furce I had thought I had had to conceal this anger from others What was my expense on this? So much love . lots of best wishes. Now I feel as unbelievably cruel as myself and present with the ongoing attitude of gratitude for life. . What is happening at the moment, because of the wild expectations of my life, there is no special way, life or people should be "definitely". This film has contributed to freedom, now I feel comfortable communicating with others without expectation and expectation. . And connecting with real love. . In addition to fear of losses . First love, and love has given what is offered.
