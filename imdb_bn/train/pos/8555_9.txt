* First of all, although many say it is the worst thing in the series, but I do not think it is true, this ideology reflects the 21st century's crazy mentality. It gives you the right opportunity to laugh and remind a good teen. <br /> <br /> * Do I really agree with a teenage movie, but do comedy movies seem to be not for teenagers? ... most of the movie is a place to hang out for teenagers; Plus, it's great to have such a movie during sleep or to have some nice time like that. <br /> <br /> * A lot of comments about the nudity of this movie. Well ... let's get it ... do not these guys think the opinion of the boys as a movie? What do you want to see ... smart books, romantic stuff? Finally, I think that if you are a teen, you must see the film and even if you are a real adult man or woman, if you still remember a young person, You can see or how often you have been a teenager, or think of something like that. Thanks for reading!
