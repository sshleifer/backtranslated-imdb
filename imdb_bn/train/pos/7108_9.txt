Do you want to solve the mystery? Do you like complex narrations? This is for you. Courtesy of Francis Leclark (who is the son of a legendary French Canadian sinner Felix Leclak), cute film Flash photos and clever educators have helped lekker's words, Roy DuPoos, who have been bipartisan in leadership roles. <br /> <br /> This plot is about Alexander Tornur, 40 of veterinary veterans, who later woke up from the quota. Being unplugged by someone unknown. TURUNU struggles to remember who hit him because of the end of the deer in the round. During the struggle, he has a strange attitude and seems to have something on him. <br /> <br /> Not surprisingly, very mysterious and well-played. At the end I had the idea (I think Indian accidents happened) but this closing was open in some explanation. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend 9 .5 / 10
