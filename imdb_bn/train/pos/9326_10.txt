I have to be honest and say that I bought this movie because not because of the content, because David Kabit is in it; I know ... shallow, is it? - But, come, Mr. Kubit is an excellent actor to act neutrally. <br /> <br /> I do not wait to watch this movie, I really do not know, I want to write another, and those on other sites but I have to say that the brothers have almost been drawn in the world. As Theo David Kubit and Ryan as Colin Fior is so credible as two big brothers, the film goes through their relationship, because they begin to tell each other again after the death of their fathers. Theo, who finds the judgment, plays the role of glory, she literally walks through a scene and Ryan tries to go without an attitude - which of course has her. <br /> <br /> The image is very well researched and so incredibly sad, moving, lifting and part is to celebrate a life. I came away from this feeling, how did Ryan go away, but gave the knowledge that he was given helpless love for his brother-in-law brother Theodore. I agree with other critics, who told Theo that he would become a father, and I would say more that I really said my thoughts on Rayan's voice when he brutally said to Theo, 'Do you think you can be a father,' and said theo Only you ' 'Theo was leaving then, but this small exchange of dialogue seems to be about the decision of Rayon's self-dismal view, which is easily raised and distorted intensely. <br /> <br /> All brilliant films, acting, direction, writing, etc. are all brilliant. I can not say anything else about this movie, except that it is very difficult to deal with the death of a loved one, but it is done wildly in infinite degrees. The spirit of respect and love for the subject (without conflict and hazard) we call volume in today's selfish world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And are not sad about things. I did not, but in this movie, it was incredibly raising considering considering the subject.
