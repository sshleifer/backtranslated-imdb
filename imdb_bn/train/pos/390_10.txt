When I saw these films, I thought: This is not a movie, at least it does not automatically spell when we hear the word "movie". It is completely symbolic, everything in it has a metaphor meaning. So if you are not used to express symbolically, you will see strange, if you are not familiar with philosophy, religion, spiritual life, then you think it's just a fairy-tale ... and even a weird, chaotic. For me, "Zoo's legend" is perfectly transparent. And I like it. This is about the fight between light and dark in our film, the story of the old war like humanity, and it encounters everyone who is looking for sensors in this life. The picture is certainly made by Buddhists. I'm not Buddhist. The vision and vision of my religion and the world are different. But as far as we have all humans and the same human nature we have essentially experienced common experiences and can understand each other. This is a really nice film! And I had more films like us - movies that have a meaning. There are many empty stories that are good for just passing time faster.
