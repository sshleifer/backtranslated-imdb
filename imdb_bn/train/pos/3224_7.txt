I saw what I found in this movie: Good science-foe cowboy stuff. What really surprised me was that Kurt Russell had done so great work with a very limited role. <br /> <br /> Try to work under these two controls: You have no dialogue, and you are working hard, military robots, you are not allowed to display emotions using facial expressions! Howzat? Kinda like asking a diva for the execution of a great aria during knot and tube-tape. Despite being handpicked verbally and evidently, Russell pulls off an incredible characteristic. Despite the limitations, his robots became human. Great job! <br /> <br /> As usual, Jason Isaacs has confirmed that he will get down in history, such as a great painting from Consulate Villen - which you want to see and quadruple. Connie Nelsen was sweet, soft, drunk, and fantastic. I was not sure of what I played on her performance and how much her physical beauty was, but her eyes were not difficult to take her off. Unfortunately, Gary Busey's role was very small and limited. Most conspiracies are fairly vulnerable, but it is a fiction comic book feeling, I do not see what is wrong with some weaknesses. The good guy at the end of the story won, and the grateful audience gets a great deal of mental satisfaction. Yes! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
