All right, this is not a perfect movie in any way, but I do not agree with the overall IMDb opinion that it's really bad. I have seen many of Hong Kong Flicks in the 1990's and have been in love. I've never seen a 'black mask' and it's only seen in the first week. Embarrassingly, with the exception of poor dubbing, my DVD copy did not even give me the option to stop, at this time the film has raw power and barbarity in Hong Kong movies. I still hold my guns, when it comes to action, these guys, no matter what their budget, do not add magic elements to the screen, Bourne Supressesi, Casino Royale or Mission Impossible (I'm not spoiling these movies - I guess that They feel their spontaneity and feel very controlled) will never acquire. what is this? As filmmakers have shot and edited, it looks like they are not afraid to read a bit of frustration to learn later. For me, this movie shows, all fun and dangerous.
