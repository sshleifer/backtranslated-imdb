This is rare as it comes across a movie as a rare one. It's really one of the most difficult structured films I've seen, the best acting. Each line of dialogue can be interpreted in different ways, related to each of the three letters in different ways. The film is an intrinsic web of inspiration and a double cross that tricks you and does not allow you to go. Add that the slow-flowing romance between Kevin and Faye is going on for anything as celluloid and you have the perfect film material. It releases the romance of movies as "Titanic", which they are frustrating. If you are looking for a movie to watch the laundry fold, this is not the case. You have to make yourself in this film yourself. You can not make a conversation during and inside the room. These movies claim your attention. Use it with the respect you deserve and you will find it a lot. Until you think "Titanic" is the best movie of all time.
