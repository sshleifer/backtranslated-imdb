It took us two episodes to "enter" as a dark angel story and as a series, since we were transferred from The Sopernos, it is a different mental structure. However, once we were winning the series we were very quick. Soon after the series ended, the series ended in a wonderful section: Dark Angelwell is far more shameful than your average TV series. As far as the steps are gone, the donkey and the stone throw away, but the social reactions of the characters' interactions and "mutants" remind us of our everyday face (and made). The fact that the story that was set in the past is too heavy and prevents discriminatory messages from obstructing our faces (hence, those who do not like to "do not" spoil for those who prefer to lecture at leisure), but each event and people / social interactions are currently relevant Relevant. We all face trial, face to our ancestors, but ultimately, the question to whom you lie is: Do you sit again and stop your mind, or do you wake up and do something about it? For those who do not have any other means to fight, for survival or justice, this series empowers them. For those who did not have to face the question, the "Access" series in this series is based on authentic entertainment, entertainment entertainment. It is much better and better written than most TV series; I'm really frustrated at the end before I could jump in really high gear.
