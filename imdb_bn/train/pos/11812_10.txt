This movie is the best movie to watch the comic book feeling. Set, costume and color just so vivid it's like stepping into a comic book. When I think of this movie, then Mba is mentioned, case, hat and attitude. <br /> <br /> Huffman gives comic relief as a mumbler and you can not help but can apologize for Madonna, and win over the trace, fails. This movie has all the classic view clich√©s - concrete is trying to fool people, blow people, drag the good guy and make his girlfriend home. <br /> <br /> This movie is always a classic sound, even the camera screams the angels comic book. Knowing how to make a comic in a movie that was able to go back to the old movie and see mistakes such as spawn and hulking. <br /> <br /> !!! You will see this movie !!!!
