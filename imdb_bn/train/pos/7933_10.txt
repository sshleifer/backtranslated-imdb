Good time to work with Quiroz Brothers, and as a whole cast of this project "Sing on the bench." I was surprised that they captured all the identifiable features of the real "B" horror movie. Hopefully there will be a chance to work with Pampin Patch Pictures team again in the future. I went to Detroit shortly after I got it and was publicly recognized several times since its release. One time the video was in the store and the girl lost her mind. It was quite funny and I had my first original signature moment as I signed her receipt. One day I asked Blockbuster's daughter, if the movie is often rented, she is sure to see it on a computer. At that time it was more than the ring 2, which was still a new liberation war ... The title really highlights immediate interest in the city market. He often thinks that the movie has not been sent back to the customer, believing that the movie does not want to return to such a good man .... look for ZoMbIeS when it gets before the Hood!
