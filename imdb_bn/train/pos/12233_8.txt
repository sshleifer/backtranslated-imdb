Astronaut Steve West (Alex Ribber) and his colleagues conducted a spaceship that saw them fly with Saturday's rings. His colleagues are killed immediately, but they will think that they are actually lucky. Steve is a continual oozing mass of humanoid decorations back to Earth; He became a barbarian killer, while he was melting every step of the road, his friend said. Tracked by Ted Nelson (Boar Darjeeling). <br /> <br /> It's often funny funny - with enough irrational lines and go around the situation - it's hard on my side that the smiles are all strangers. It seems that in the attempt of the budget below the 60s of the 50's, I feel confused and thus it is a wonderful entertainment movie. That sequence with nurses is simply delightful. We've even treated a split screen sequence that does not really add anything, but it's still a gas to see. <br /> <br /> Author / Director William Sacks is eligible for credit with this impressive idea; His ultra-thin character is indeed a memorable one. I think his pacing is a little off; Some scenes (like an adult couple) last for a little longer, but eventually he provides a strong, impressive, B-movie material with degrees. Climax is especially fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This brings me the impressive and strong makeup effect of Rick Boxers, which creates a highly respected centerpiece for the film, which directly dissolves the final final. <br /> <br /> The big makeup rubber for the whole film (Sakso is praised for the film's hit on the ground) and he continues to do a lot of good work. DeBenning is rather good for the support of a strange and stupid hero, and Ann Sweeney is not too hot as his wife, but the support of Mayan Healey, Michael Allen, and Liesel Wilson. Cheryl's "Ranbix" Smith (doing a pretty flattering shot), Jonas Bleet (Tween Hooper's "Eaten Alive" and Wes Craven's "The Hills is Aij") and even director Jonathan Demem <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 8/10
