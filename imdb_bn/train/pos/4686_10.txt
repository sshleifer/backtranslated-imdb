This is by far all my favorite film. This is primarily because it is not afraid to enter into some very politically incorrect things (such as superb and female modesty) that it is very awesome to touch other mainstream movies. The director does not seem to be off-limits on this film because the viewer may develop the story in a shameless way without worrying because of insulting the viewer. However, I am not here to do anything here for the shock value or deliberately humiliate someone here. Shan Young turns a nice and brave performance. The most established mainstream actress has not played this role or asked to change some big scripts before accepting it. Other cast members work well. <br /> <br /> Do you notice that after the compulsory short run one year after the movie hit the theater, the salary did not appear in the cable? Why wonder you ever wondered? The obvious reason is that it does not fit today's political environment. It seems pretty interesting to me that some premium channels now carry the softcover screen (which is moving closer and closer to the hardcore screen) but will not carry a mainstream movie like "love crime". Sadly, although this film is 11 years old, it can not possibly be made today. <br /> <br />
