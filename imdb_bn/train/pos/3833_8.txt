I do not believe that others have taken such a serious view. God, it was a lot of fun for Hop-A-Long Cassidy. It was a great tribute to western cereals many years ago. It is not meant to be a great movie experience, it was not. So if a big special effect was not bonanza. It's a funny, tongue in the cheek, look at the old west. People, relax and enjoy.
