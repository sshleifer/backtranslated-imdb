"Men in White" is definitely the fun movie, unless I have ever seen the most fun, comedy movie! (And I've seen a lot!) It is about two trashmen who become "white men" and then stop the attack from the place. It is a parody of classic movies, such as "Men in Black", "Star Wars" or "Dr. Strangovov". Anyone who talks about this movie, there is something wrong in his head. There are lots of fun and funny jokes, and you may get very laughing hard (it happened to me!). If you can see this movie on TV, then watch it now - you must not be sorry!
