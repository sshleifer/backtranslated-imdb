Invisible people will love everyone! This reminds me of the old school 80 series (A-Team, AirAuffle, Nietrader), special effects small but very effective !! But the most important thing they were shooting in this series is the fun. It really looks! The role of the whole cast there is the perfect fit and they seem whatever they want !! Especially Paul Ben Victor and Vincent Ventreccha. Ventresca really shines this one! Unbelievably for me, an actor with his acting style does not get a shot in a big movie (Mr. Tarantino should have guided you to this exhibition! Instead of getting that big annoying serious danger (CSI) you can see it if you can It's a good price !!!
