After failing to produce weakly, they all split up in different ways. I love letters and chemosh. The songs of the film "Tegart Egan", "Look at me, look at me, here I am", "Swing Goodbye", "I'm going to tollways gain you", "Rath Jazz" and "He'll Shu Me" ". Directed the film and acted like a muppet, and all actors did a great job, see it !, 91 minutes. Retit G. My rating: A
