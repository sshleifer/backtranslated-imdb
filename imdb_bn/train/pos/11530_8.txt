A group of friends decides to take a camping trip in the desert and kill themselves and kill a mysterious killer in a black pickup truck. "Miraz" is probably inspired by Spielberg's "Duel" and Craven's "The Hills Eyes". This slash yarn offers lots of nasty violence and gore. The glory highlight of the film is a sequence that combines a man around a tree in his hands and feet, and then when his chain is pulled by a truck, his organs are broken. This is a small mystery and some exciting stock-and-slash sequences. The performance is quite long and the script is quite weak, but the film is quick and frustrating. BGSTs who are playing famous are threatening. Desert locations provide some atmosphere and Gotti is rather strong. After all, if you like the low budget horror movie, out of 10 out of 10
