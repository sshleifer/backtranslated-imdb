Since the death of "AvivBeed Love Raymond", it will be the most fun TV sitikom coming out of the state. Warburton is always delightful, and this complement is the perfect throw across the rest. David Spad continues to tickle my funny bone widely with its unique unique delivery to its line. After engaging in the British series, "Coupling" I can see where the creator of "Engagement of Rules" has received their original idea, but it is not considered as "etabat" - absolutely brilliant dialogue and the way it is fully conveyed which sets this specific series apart. But for a new successive success, it takes more than a suitable cast, especially in Comedy's most difficult case. I am especially grateful as part of the professional TV comedy writing team in Australia's 7-year-long part, thanks to the sensitivity and creative talent of the camera and camera crew. One of the few of my complaints with the series is probably the "canned" smile. Of course, a live audience can be used in series shooting.
