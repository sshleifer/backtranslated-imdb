When I was 6 or 7 years old, I saw this movie in the theater. I liked it then, and recently came in a VHS version owner. <br /> <br /> My 4-6 year old children love this movie and ask again and again to see it. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching it again. Although I would like to admit that this is not good on a small TV <br /> <br /> I do not have big kids, so I do not know what they think. <br /> <br /> The songs are very beautiful. My daughter kept singing over them. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
