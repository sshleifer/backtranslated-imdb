I first liked this movie since coming to this movie. I was about nine years old, and now I'm 27 years old. I think playing in the Sega Geniosis is playing the video game. I was very excited, I loved to show this movie to my son. He also liked Michael Jackson and I know he loves this movie just as I was a child. Although I was much younger than I saw it. I can not wait to get out of the DVD! I hope it will come out of the DVD! Please let it come out to DVD !! I'm dying to see it again !!! Well that's my comment I hope one day soon I'll see this movie again. I love all the videos in this movie. My favorite mini-video Badder!
