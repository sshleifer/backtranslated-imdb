The film and its successor Barry McKenzie are in his own view, these two are the greatest comedies of all time. A young Australian inventor travels to England to claim her succession and meets his friends, who are as loving and innocent as they are. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a big block, where you can find someone who needs a drink So that he dies like a dead body? Great characters, played top, and it got great Sheilas and cost more fosters then put together three other films. Top notch <br /> <br /> and some funny songs you'll never hear, and it's full of great celebrities. Definitely my two favorite movies, I see them at least once a fifteen times.
