At the age of 17, my high school was by Baid Bird's Stage - this is not a wonderful thing, since it is known as the perfect high school material and the most stunning music in the world. <br /> <br /> I was a music student and neglected the production and memory of his songs as well as the version of Dick Van Dyke which (deliberately) hid elvis references and made it camp for the 60 audience. <br /> <br /> So, when the 1995 version of Jason Alexander acted, I just hit the TV screen, I was delighted with what I saw. Alexander performs an exceptional job like Albert, a performance from a particular TV series on a firm contrast to his known person. The rest of the cast is entertaining and convincing in their roles (known Phillips is probably the only person who does not see his part, probably a naive and innocent schoolgirl). <br /> <br /> Best of all, the numbers known from the music stage shows should be stored in this movie and stage musical tracks (should be allowed for absence at one stage). So, if you know the musical (and not a few), then check out this telemovie. This stage shows justice in such a way that might not be refined, which is good enough for me. What is better than an author's work reliably and to render color and style?
