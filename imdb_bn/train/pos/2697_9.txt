There is nothing revolutionary here; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The view at the Garden is almost exclusively in the Debab police station and often in one interrogation room, but Director Claude Miller (who created this wonderful film in this voluntary film) other) External locale scenography intercalates extra glimpses of exterior tableaux. Miller's regulation, especially primarily, is sensational, and his subtle management of the ultimately-animated internal MySa-N-Scene is designed to draw attention. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura is superb as usual, a character that is successful for legalizing, paper, cliche is: lionic, hard nose, world-tiring detective detective Ventura plays the role, making it completely believable, though the script gives us little access to our internal activities. At the moment, the film seems to have ended, she will be forced to face her first failure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Exchanges between two people are often not pregnant for drug fight and not a cross-border landscape. The character of Serrault is deplorably hateful and intelligent, and is activated by pitiable; Then afterwards .... <br /> <br /> A message of VUE "Message" to the Guard, if anyone has to do a search, condemn the police system, and such pressure that force the police force, if necessary, Please. The length of this movie is mostly nothing but an example of how a possible chaos of a movie can be transformed into a skeptical drama of most cinema's economics. <br /> <br /> <br />
