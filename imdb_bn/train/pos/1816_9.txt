Many reviews on this page mention that this film is a little dark for kids. That depends on the child. This is not a 2-6 year old movie; It's geared towards 8 years old and older crowds. When I watched this movie at the age of 10, I loved it all. Most of the animated movies were too small for my taste. This film is related to more serious problems, and therefore has a much more psychological effect. This movie can be sent to DIE characters, and HELL! These scenes give a little more emotional weight where the letters are risky to their lives. Good guys are not always perfectly sweet and beautiful (like other cartoons). They are "real" like motivation, revenge, and greed, but have compassion and friendship; The thing that shows is not always black and white. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie
