Being a countdown as Satan is the best experience of all my time in the movie before. I planned a mixed reaction to the film - and for me, the minimalistic picture of the views touched the hug or uncomfortable by ordinary audiences. This is one of those movies with me, and I think and think about it. <br /> <br /> Surely the DVD will illuminate some themes and filmmaking elements? Including: Returning to Sidney Lumeet, an amazing combination of story time-shifted strategies, Lumet and Mesterson, and why it works so well, great direction, rarely focused Hollywood films, men's letters and an open check book for their basically destroyed women. Struggle for being, presented under, but still Messi plays Tomie, and, ostensibly As such, with the central solidarity of the superb Hoffman about the sum of his portions - the heart of the movie for me. <br /> <br /> <br />! Of course, a skilled film. So imagine my frustration to watch the fantastic DVD - just do not find any comments, is not out of sight, no interview, no extra. <br /> <br /> Hey - Deliver - Sort it!
