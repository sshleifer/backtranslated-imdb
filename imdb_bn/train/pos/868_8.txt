This film is about the time to put two leading characters in French. This may require some patience, especially since this type of general Hollywood definition is not "attractive". However, once "heist" kicks, the film is fast forward very fast, probably at times very fast. But it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you look not very closely it is quite quite credible. The type of movie that you know about Hollywood will be bundled up.
