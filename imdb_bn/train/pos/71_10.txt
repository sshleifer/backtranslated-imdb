I could not comment on the movie. <br /> <br /> I really miss the movie's horror, so I'm really surprised if you've actually seen the same movie. <br /> <br /> I saw what was incredible! I think actress and director has done a fantastic job in the movie. <br /> <br /> I was not happy to see the actress before and I could not have been set more by the incredible work that they did what I saw most of what I call her most credible movies for a long time. <br /> <br /> I do not see why everyone has had this kind of problem with the choice of Dinner in drug to try suicide, comments have congratulated you that it likes actresses and his stupid choices. I do not understand, this is a movie written by someone else and managed by someone else so actresses might have errors how I fail to see. I thought it was a real credible movie that I see again and recommend. What is the opinion and it is very bad that many intend so close. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
