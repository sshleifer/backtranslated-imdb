I think from 80s I have seen any of these old movies at any time, it gives me back to the simplest time, even though how they can remember today. This movie is a good one. I think it looks like a little child, it's the best movie of all time. It has all the heroic characters that want to be a young cowboy. Now as an adult, I can smile and still feel sad, but at this time I know what is happening. I found a weird thing. How many people can go to CISC in Houston, get married, get married, get into the trailer, run away, cheat, uncles die, go back together after a month? Only America
