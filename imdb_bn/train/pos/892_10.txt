For this movie, Samoos should have 10 out of 10 because they have everything. Great stories, great fights, great characters and great cayos. <br /> <br /> This picture is taken by Dick View Billy Chow and Chong Fat. sammo takes on leunging lau cars in a casino, losing sammo fighting but is full of a fight it is thrown into high tempo action and comedy elements. <br /> <br /> Some great and touching moments in the film, lam Ching Ying popped up in a Kyomo and died - wasted. <br /> <br /> The last sequence you will reach for the rewind button, one of the best ending combat I've seen it. The sammo boys load and finish until the squaring up to Billy Cha.
