Great and unforgettable, stunningly atmospheric, and brilliantly acting in everyone. <br /> <br /> I do not understand how the best writing of this type is panning and 8 people (and nine!) <Br /> <br /> This is the Great Off the Rath, John Ford's greatest film. I would say the long voice house is next to the line, though it is quite lagging behind. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 10. This is a 12 eligible.
