The story supports the best image of the temple versus the better brother's fight against brother. The original character, directed by James Stewart, Lin McDam, represents justice and justice. Under the personality of Dutch Henry Brown, led by Stephen McNally, his brother, standing behind the pursuing classical class coaching chasing his brother to kill his father. The story of the world is the classic Destopian West where the only way to prevent its residents from killing one another is to remove their sidemers as soon as they enter the city, and the person responsible for this law and order will be responsible for the classic Western Law Minister Wyatt Yarp. <br /> <br /> As well as Western, such killer Indian warriors, surrounded army forces, and in trouble, Bonnet-Claude, the virgin, such plain letters are present. <br /> <br /> Another important work in this film, which gives the film its name, it creates a custom Winchester Rifle. Arms for rewarding those who work respectfully may be seen as a metaphor. Once it is stolen from its original owner, it brings tragedy to everyone who comes to contact him. In this sense, it is similar to other icons like Holbrooks of Lost Ark riders and blood stains to protect the private blood of blood. This film gives an element of supernatural elements that is not usually absent from the West, a style that is not known for secondary themes and symbols. <br /> <br /> Originally a revenge film, it shares this element with other styles, such as Jack Arnold's bullet number and the undiscovered Clint Eastwood. <br /> <br /> Winchester has a theme theme for the brutality of 73. Dan Duriya played extremely well after being kidnapped by a villain in the movie, Waco Johnny Dean, after killing her husband. TenderFoot sends a pistol with a pistol, as if it were a troubled cowboy toy, and like a cat's joke. After finally contacting the unhappy Winchester Rifle, Waco Johnny Dean is finally coming to her. <br /> <br /> The original story of Winchester '73 is a reminder of Jason's myth and the search for the golden fleece, which is said in Apollonius's Argonautica. Both stories have some inappropriate quality that are compatible with the acquisition of a sacred object. Like Jason, the character of Stewart finds a courage from an adventure. Another theme at Winchester '73, which is like a mythological story, is the struggle between the brothers. A number of ancient stories discuss this issue, such as the Hebrew Bible story Kain and the Hubble and the Volgate stories of Romulus and Ramas. <br /> <br /> For the kidnapping and rape theme in Anthony Mann's film, it is in many mythological works, such as the rape of Europe, Ovid said in his Metamorphoses. <br /> <br /> Winchester '73 is a fine example of Western style, and works as a motive for many classic American Western and ancient mythological themes.
