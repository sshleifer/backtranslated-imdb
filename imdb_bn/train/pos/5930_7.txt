Psychological mother-son-duo (Alice Cr√®ge and Brian Cruise) discourage the life of virginity and their new goals are beautiful but Ekla Tania (Maden Amic). However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratch. I have never been a fan of the lazy Betellera vendors like King, Quintz or Barker, but Mr. Dong himself wrote this B-movie, actually it was as bad as it was. Yes, it is sometimes awkwardly pessimistic, but in fact there are some amazingly influential touches: good old cemetery, eerie soundtrack and candlelit-Gothic-house-scene, showing the monstrous form of mirror villains etc. Of course, the film is corrupted by all the toilet-toilet-seat induction of Mr. Dong's Potti-Muthed dialogue and weakening of lean people, which makes the rapist a totally vain concubine of the teacher, but there are roses in the fertilizer.
