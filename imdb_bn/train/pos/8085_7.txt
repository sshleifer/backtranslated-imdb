What I can say about this movie is quite long, very long! I recently purchased this movie a few months ago that a new version is coming out. I was happy to create it in 1978 because 70's (although I never lived among them) is actually one of my favorite decades, especially for music! The story was really good at the time I watched this movie, but after about 50 minutes it started to be very annoying and repetitive. I accept the animation will affect me! It was nothing I had ever seen before and was quite good to see. But this picture could really be a little better, it had more conversations and stories than just 15 to 20 minutes. Then after taking the film for the last 5 or 10 minutes and again it gets better, but it ends unexpectedly. In my opinion I was too long. I know for about 13 minutes for 2 hours and it's still long for the cartoon, but it was boring for most movies, it seems to be 4 hours long! But overall this is a true movie that I guess and I will not see them again "for doing anything to sleep". I would see the new one and I hope it's good!
