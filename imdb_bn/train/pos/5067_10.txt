Here, I read an opinion on IMDb.com that the Gray owl is sometimes the best character of Pierce Bryson. I do not know if he did not have a good or bad role, I'm not his fan, but it was really awesome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another thing - the dominant hand of the movie director. I give my respect. The soul of solitude, beauty and the desert was truly wonderful, I have never met such a close-up in a movie before. <br /> <br /> There is another thing left in my mind after the picture - this film is the earliest original book, and it is the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> And a little more I give my honor to the original Gray owl.
