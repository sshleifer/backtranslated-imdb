When I was flipping through a movie channel on my parent's direct TV, I saw this movie. It was on the Sundance channel and is just starting. I love music, especially in the late 60's and this word like BJM (Dandis is OK). Everything about Brian Jonestown genocide, I have planned to use illegal drugs, from music, to Anton and Joel's personality. It was fun because when I was watching the first party scene, everybody was making a line, my parents started walking and their faces were invaluable. However, this is certainly one of my favorite films because it introduced me to the Bryan Johnston massacre, which is now my favorite band. <br /> <br /> Just look at it ...
