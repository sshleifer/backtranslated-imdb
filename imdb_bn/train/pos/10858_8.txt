The movie and the skilled Confucian crime drama enjoyed, the old order was threatened by a terrible young greedy man, no doubt represented modern society. I thought the final scene was weird and we did not realize that it was a long-term plan, or if it was being punished for being a greedy person. I love this movie and once in a Chinese movie, this violence was not a dancer martial arts source. H. Who Always my opinion about the movies is that the British think that the main effect is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' in the local language and we are happy to have it long after it's gone, they are still there.
