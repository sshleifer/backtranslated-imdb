I like horses and appreciate handmade animation, so I do not expect surprising things from the new animated images of DreamWorks: Simron Stallion. I guess you could say you were a little frustrated. You have wonderful animations and think like a perfect story at first. A story about absolutely nothing without a horse in nature. Animals do not have beautiful songs or even talk - a major plus. Sadly, this film is uncertain for Matt Dammon's description! Brian Adams is a sappy soundtrack; And enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production. If the filmmaker was simply with ease, then we had a wonderful work here. This is not a great movie, but it is a great entertainment for young children. I would recommend this movie to the family because it has its heart in the right place and it is the only thing that is not objectionable to small children. Not bad, but it's been a lot better. Although very beautiful visual.
