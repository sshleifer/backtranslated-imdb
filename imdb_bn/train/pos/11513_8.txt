My favorite one looks back at '70s. I think it went on air in the Nine Network (?) In Australia on Friday (or possibly Saturday) night. Darren McGuin and Simon Oakland were great together. <br /> <br /> Each episode generally combines with Kolkak to fight with some of the supernatural opponents. For their achievements, the authors made a collective effort to move away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible. <br /> <br /> I remember an episode where the enemy was the soul of an ancient Indian chief. 'Who has returned' as an electric power station, which started killing people in a city hospital. The final showdown shows colchak trying to make short circuit 'power beast' in the spark and blast fire explosion. Oh well ... you had to stay there, but it was a fun idea. <br /> <br /> McGenen always maintained great power and enthusiasm in his role and it was his best. <<br /> <br /> Definitely claim a place on TV's "Hall of Fame". To quote Tony Vinceeno ... 'Coachchac you're turning it on ...' or, in the case of Hall of Fame, 'In'!
