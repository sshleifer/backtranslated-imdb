It's a road movie, a killer-on-board. Brian Kesler (David Dvoovi), a sophisticated, fertile writer, wants to conduct field research in case of American serial killers. However, he or his girlfriend, Kerry (Michelle Forbes), have no money to travel to cross-cunt sites, so they advertise for advertising to share travel costs. They are finally two good examples of a young couple, Early Grace (Brad Pitt) and his girlfriend Adele (Juliet Lewis), "poor white trash", you will not find all the movies. Actually, Early and Adele are making this movie so entertaining because they have not seen since the resurrection of "The Beverly Hillsbis", like they are fools, caccal, confused, music, speculation, droll and otherwise Treats.

But my choice for the best performance goes to Juliet Lewis.

This plot was broken by unnecessary and unhealthy violence, which was somewhat frustrating. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Overall,
