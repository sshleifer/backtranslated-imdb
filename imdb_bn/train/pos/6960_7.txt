A guy desperate for action on a bus to hit on a fantastic girl. He refused him, but when he went after a person who tried to steal his purse, whatever he was going to do. And it starts there - a relationship that is jealous and a little stained by the neurotics superhero. It can not be concealed that the problems in them are going to be problematic. <br /> <br /> In short, a story that promises to grow in a cool movie. And IMO, this is a great movie being successful. This is not a wonderful work, but it was for me to laugh at more than one occasion - the two main characters are roaming around each other in a crazy love festival, even the superhero thing is also credible. <br /> <br /> So, Slim stories, but really fun works and thus deserve time during the movie. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 heart broken heart
