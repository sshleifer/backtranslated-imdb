I had no problem with the film, which I was pretty good. This is the original LAPD crime scene video that disturbed me. I think the lion gate really is thinking that ordinary visitors would like to see the audience that there was severely beaten death and blood all over the place. Sorry lion's gate, this was an INCREDIBLY BAD IDEA !!! <br /> <br /> Return to the film: Cast was nice, especially as Will Kilmer delayed John Holmes. John Holz was a handy, mistreating women in his life (as his girlfriend Kate Bosworth as his girlfriend), and he deeply deep in despair drug. His relationship with Eddie Nassh (Eric Bogosian) has created a spiral that occurs due to the notorious Wanderel killings. How much was involved in the killings? We do not know the complete truth of the story (destruction is still alive and free people), but the film does a great job.
