Eddie Morphy's first film from "The Golden Child" from his MEGHIT "Beverly Hills Cop". And although it's not as good as "cop", it's a fun comic adventure. Murphy has been assigned the most unusual cases as a discovery of a missing children. Her appointment: Finding a child with title character, mysterious powers. The title of this movie may be titled "Beverly Hills Cop and the Temple of Duaam", because some parts of this film play spielbergs like courage, such as the Indiana Jones Comedy. It got a comedy with laughter, and adventure with special effects. A lot of fun <br /> <br /> *** (four out)
