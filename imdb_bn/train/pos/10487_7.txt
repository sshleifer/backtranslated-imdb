Grace is a good film with its heart in the right place. Grace recently realized that her widow and her late husband left her with a lot of debt. He could lose his lovely room and see no other solution of his misfortune than growing Marussana. She is living in a beautiful village where most of the visitors love to live and villagers love all the wonderful people who are the most visitors to be neighbors. In this picture, only one thing is wrong and the effect on its user reflects Marijuana. Apparently, no actor or writer of this film has ever smoked the staff. The way villagers work after a joint smoker is ridiculous and only supposedly fun. This is correct in the view that intelligence is replaced by an English sloppy and it is unfortunate that it is not very enjoyable in a movie.
