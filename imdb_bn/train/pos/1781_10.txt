... here the Romeo Division came to change paradism. <br /> <br /> I just said this little film that I was blinded. When I was at a movie festival in Boston, I randomly saw and thank God for every day. I really believe that I was part of the event, before reading the Tarantino script before any other or before showing the first screen on the street <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Or creative team tapping for future products, but I hope I can stay there for it. <br /> <br /> Again, an incredible piece of filmmaking.
