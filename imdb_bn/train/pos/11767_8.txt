What a good picture! A great action movie with lots of twisted men and watches to watch. James Balushi is very good like a former hood, who stole 12 million rupees from the gangster, his wife and local Sheriff (Timothy Dalton), the mountains' brokers. Do not be frustrated, jump on the board and enjoy the journey. 10 out 8
