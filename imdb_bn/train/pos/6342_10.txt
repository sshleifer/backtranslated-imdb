A word - nice This is the movie. Go and see it. Director Ron Howard ... I mean, director Ron Howard did a wonderful job, as he did. An incredible attention to detail, vivid colors and decorations, breathtaking Whoville environment, wonderful variety of dresses. Wait, there's more than that - the story is very good. A message can be clearly expressed by the thoughtful audience. Jim Carey Top Notch He is probably the best Grinch possible Girl, Taylor Momsen, real good. I'm sure he has some great future. Dog cool Above all, it's a very high-quality Christmas fairy tale. If you like fairy stories, it's for you. If you like Christmas, it's for you. <br /> <br /> To read some other reviews here ... get a life. It shows me repeatedly that people see ... well ... their hearts are very small in size.
