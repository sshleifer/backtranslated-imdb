I like it because of my recent personal experience. Especially the ideas that each is free and everything is limited. Strong characters did not actually enjoy their "real" life, but they enjoyed themselves as they did. This simple day did a good job by creating a good memory. A good memory includes romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful European city, but certainly includes about deep discussion about the quality of their lives. Definition of life or love relationship or any kind of problem in life or current problems, there are many movies on this condition. Sunrise is a beautiful way before dealing with it, which pauses the viewer and thinks and adjusts his breath and goes towards watching the film. Do not try to raise a specific thought of your head before sunrise. It encourages you to think about some things in everyday life and gives you some alternative possibilities. Conversations in these characters make attractive, not just generating common sense allegations or fools. You will still be thinking about those topics and stories interested in the next line for yourself. The end was not quite important after all. You can get something out of it and feel good or positive about yourself after the movie. The movie is supposed to be enjoyable. It's an enjoyable movie and it's worth your time to visit. I'm on a journey too much. The film represents a part of me and answers my questions.
