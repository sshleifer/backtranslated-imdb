German private TV is notorious for copying Dutch? Naturally US format. All right, in the case of Adel and Starc, Xeroxing was basically gone: Scrubb. <br /> <br /> Can not you stand in the sculble comedy? Do not see Edel and Star. Seriously If you do not want any other lawyer's laws like laws and orders, then go somewhere good. (Or look at the law and order as it works quite bright, but I'm in a hurry.) E & S addresses funny, often thought-provoking themes, it's fun, romantic, fun, funny and malicious. <br /> <br /> In truth, the author did not get a good deal after the serial final. And need to reform my self-destructive nature itself: Personal German Television Productions. German residents will understand what I'm saying. <br /> <br /> Short: See it. The English synchronization is not what I have the most foggist, but hey, the German language is worth learning four seasons. Includes the pseudo-happy end.
