Bottom line - the best romantic comedy ever. What this film accomplishes for all the great movies: A world and time that we want to visit again and make it happy to be part of the human race. When I'm not blue, this movie highlights my soul and makes me laugh (and it's still true after many views - always fresh). <br /> <br /> All actors are in the top form. The characters are so dead and the characters mix so well that you forget the actor (usually difficult to do with mathau, robins and royan). Supporting cast is consistently brilliant: Fry ("Aug", "full pygmy package"!), Jacob and Sax and Maher (three theoretical physicists "Greek chorus" - "but there is no time"), learning ("We can start from NJ Some "), Salahb and Haley (Robbins' BOs and colleagues at the service station), and the quotes (Eisenhower - how many comedy Eisenhwar ??) <br /> Do not miss this neglected treasure.
