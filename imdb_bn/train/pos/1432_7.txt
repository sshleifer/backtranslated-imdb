I was really looking forward to watching this movie because it is definitely a film for people who love nature films. The film shows various clomates and animals associated with them starting from the North Pole and as a movie progress progressed southwards. The footage of this movie is often exciting and I used to think many times how they can take some shots down the water or in the sky on earth. But beautiful, I have already mentioned a large part of the footage seen on TV series 'Planet Earth', by David Attenborough. I think the asteroid on earth is better than the description of Earth, and the description of Attenborough's world is better. 'Earth' is a simple movie. Attenborough avoids many scientific details covering his 'Planet Earth' chain. For example, the earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a small animal iceberg wholesome nursery, because there are some predators. Planet Earth will tell you that a tropical sea is a good nursery, because there is not enough nutrition to support water in the oxygen and the large number of large animals such as large sharks. This is an important difference to me. That, many of the higher voice planes in Atanborough made Earth a much better documentary than the Earth. Yet, I think the world is watching for the beautiful footage and it is easy to understand that it makes it attractive for children too.
