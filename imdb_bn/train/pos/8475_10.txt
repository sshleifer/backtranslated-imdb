This is a fantasy film for kids based on the Bugi Crick Legend. Although I do not know why they are returning to it as a sequel at the compartment creek. There is nothing to do with this film's documentary and its fabulous quote fares. Don Wells comes as 3 mothers of 3 kids who are swimming around Boggy Creek with the giant and the giant they come to help him. Yes it is very stupid and the plot is pure, but this type of film is suitable for groups of 8-12 y / o, which is targeted at it. This is a hazardous G-rated Kiddie rental and at least you do not have to worry about leaving your kids alone while watching it. For the 8-12 y / o set, strictly old children will get bored and it will feel hair.
