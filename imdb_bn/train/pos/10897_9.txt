What do you expect from a movie entitled 'Surviving Christmas' and will be presented as a 'Festival Fun', something like an aroment or English patient? I like a lot about this movie, it's funny, it's a great cast and it's wildly written. I came to the film as Kaplan / Elfort fan but when I read the plot, it was suspicious, it seemed ridiculous. But the film does not come in such a way that Duffy Duffy plays his part in full-time, one-minute child-adult, next mature person who understands that he has achieved everything in life except what he wants. Actually, we see the big picture in this film, when he encounters problems envies them and realize that their life is not so good, he sees that many of his own things are not bad. <br /> <br /> I saw other less comedy movies than are less weaker or ugly scenes. Comedy is much more difficult than any other type of drama, it does not work or it does and very few comedy writers make it right every time. I especially like the scenes of drama, where the family read the written parts of Latam. Reactions to Tom Wolkco's reactions (James Gandalfini) and Brian Wallco's comments (Josh Zuckerman) It's greedy Tom Wallco's conflict, which is to bite his tongue, to wear a fool hat or to sing in Christmas trim, so that the film can earn well-earned prize money. <br /> <br /> The daughter Alicia (Christina Applegate) brings a lovely romantic angle in the story, why not in the Christmas movie? Of course his corny and conrived; She is rich and handsome, she is beautiful and single, and so inevitably ending together in her and the snow together fall and face to face reflected. Great! One thing I liked was the use of enthusiastic music to make the atmosphere even more dynamic, but I can not really complain. I got what I wanted.
