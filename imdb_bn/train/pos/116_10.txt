Oh man ... I was stupid foolish (not the right word, there is a long list!) To see this movie and finally there was an opportunity to do this. And "news" is: Wonderful laboratory philosophy! <br /> <br /> "Followers" of a Von Trier: Both Riggs, Criminal elements, Dogville, Darker in the Dark, The Structures, etc. ... Europa is perhaps the difference in visual terms for its greatness. All beautiful and clustrophobic! You really get the feeling of having this "fictitious" wonderful time inside the battle. The 40-year-old films from owners of filmmakers such as Baguel, Bergman, showcase art-film scenes of Agent-keeper Von Tiar's acetic drops, as the "proletariat for good works" nowadays. His authoritative way to deal with the most complex problems, without irrationality, has hit the viewer's nervous heat to cure the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world. <br /> <br /> It seems like ostrich, I believe people like Van Triair can help society in many ways in many ways. The day-time filmmakers and filmmakers do not feel the need for this kind of power, as a tool of reflection, perhaps it may be the beginning of a new era: "The age of mental control about our fears". This work he continually offers through our work. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bravo!
