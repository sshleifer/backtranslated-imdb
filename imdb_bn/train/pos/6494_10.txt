Since the war in Poland in 1932, since the war ended in 1945, the best documentary was never questioned for the correct and epic paintings of World War II. <br /> <br /> In both honest and point of view, the documentary shows the face of a very human face from both sides of the conflict. At the same time, the importance of tactics and war is not ignored, a lot of work has been done to give a detailed picture of the war, and especially the bending points between high, low and mortgage fate. As a British-produced documentary, these 26 series focus mainly on Britain, but Russia and America do not have such a contribution, but a similar advantage in this kind of length series. <br /> <br /> Another appropriate reference is the complete sense of score, music and documentary frustration, struggle and diligence. This series leaves the viewer without any doubt about the series that it faced the hardships and mortgages faced by the war during the war, making it a mountain at the end of each episode, which served the thickest layer of World War II. 25 viewers leave all the knowledge about the war, and how much do we owe to the members of the previous generation?
