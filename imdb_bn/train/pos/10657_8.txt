Jopardi has a feeling of being a stock movie - studios are among the big budget / box office films. It's a mere 70 minutes and there's not much set, and Barbara Stanwick is the only star. But of course, what is a star <br /> <br /> Once again, Stanyck is a tough woman who ran away as a fleeing criminal to help her trapped husband in the Mexican desert. Focusing on how much of the film deals with its captives, who wants to submit to him for his help. There are some mental battles. <br /> <br /> This is an amazingly functional little movie - its short length pulls it down and Stanwick should be considered superb (but I still appreciate it).
