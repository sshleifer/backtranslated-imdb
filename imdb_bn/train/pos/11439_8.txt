OK - up to 2 versions of this movie. There were 2 people involved - John Cotty and Bill Kutteri (George was the producer - he really did not say anything in this movie - helped with money) - 'Adult' version can be made by Bill Quitteri John Cotty does not like or approve this version (it was behind him). Thanks to Lad films, they did not advertise the film and threw all their advertising cash for "Right Stuff", hoping it would drag them through; ... and it did not. So, this movie was not really a chance. When "double" it creates the cable (HBO) - they show the railway with the version of the bill and if the public is shown it threatens to sue (have you noticed how long the adult version was not?). Showtime got 'clean' version. Videotape and laser-disc version are publicly approved versions (containing more power than bill). It's really sad, since the 'adult' version is really good and gives more knowledge. However, it is very doubtful that it will be released on DVD (or some other formatted format in any format). Sorry for everyone to disappoint. I know this information, as I used to be the president of Twins Upon A Time Fan Club (There are still numerous items from the movie - the version 'Adult' was used to contain a character-box version, but it was stolen - just now it's a There is partial HBO copy). In the 'Adult' version 8 stars - 5 'clean' versions Just ask any other questions.
