This cartoon was weird, but the story was more deep and emotional than the other cartoon movies. Apart from a husband and sister of our husbands, we have a daughter while there are fewer relatives and rarely have any other friends except for a less tragic one camp. When he reached the final low point and when the opportunity comes he literally makes a deal with a devil like a devil. I think this picture is the truth of life, and when something does not get worse, the girl shows what she has seen, she feels remorse and then changes and she helps this dark, mysterious creature to learn the human quality of love. Twins help small small bears very advanced, and then they get a sense of self-worth too. Very positive message for children, although some of the elements in the film were weird, it was and still a usable movie. Stephen Bishop's song (Tousi's song) makes this picture even better
