This movie trailers can show scenes of violence or non-mainstream sex, but these scenes are rare pieces selected to attract viewers. They must have shown the main message of the film: <br /> <br /> Those who kick their heads in their jobs and lives, their power, which can be elsewhere, they can ugly oppress others. And in the lower section of the persecution discipline, most women. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to face a film showing such cruelty as Hundstage, but it is difficult to endure such a life, even difficult. <br /> <br /> The technically film is like short cotes, but there are documentary style episodes that show people like your neighbors, just as they are. Without any glitter, and most annoying, without any hope. Its documentary style makes the movie even more difficult, because you realize that such people are there and many of them are there, even though our society focuses on beautiful exotic looks. Wherever pornography is to be done, its neglected domestic violence will have to happen, somewhere to lose hope. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> melodramatic, go watch this movie. However, when you are focusing on subtitles, I lose it, I fear that subtitles can not transmit accentuation.
