Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play against the players at the age of 30, who beat Russians with a bad decision to reassign their heartfelt tie to Belarusian Ballersfield. Williams is okay, but Russell legend Taft Quarterback Remo Hightower is great out of the plane as well. Hello Palance Williams has a nice and interesting turnaround like a bride, who can live without this reunion. The movie is valuable only for watching the famous Ramo. Highly recommended.
