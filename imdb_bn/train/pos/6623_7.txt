First thing first, this movie is achingly beautiful. One who acts as a highlight / composer in 3D Cgi film, the scenes blow me up. I was surprised to see what was on the screen every second for the story, all right, okay. It's not going to fire the world, but if you like your future Blade Runner-Esquiera stories (and who do not?) Then you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I am Voice acting was particularly fascinated and completely felt frustrating from the movie. I saw this movie in English, but I hope there is a floating version almost anywhere. <br /> <br /> must be seen.
