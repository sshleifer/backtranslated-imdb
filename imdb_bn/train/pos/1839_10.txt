A nice movie about two police deals with the same police love. One policeman killed him, but all the evidence seems to be guilty of other Montand. Montand unexpectedly knows that another boyfriend can kill him, and Pierreia does not know that there was a relationship with Montand Girl. Mustang must find out absolutely the killer ... and what's the end! Highly recommended.
