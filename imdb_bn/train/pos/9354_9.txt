Like Adam Sandler, who has not been accused of being a talent, like many comedians with him and many others, I hope to see only a great movie about the presence of the film rather than the presence of the film. It looked very well overall that. Even Sandler could provide an effective dramatic performance who did not think that he was surprised how excited it was. He will cry to you, especially his intentionally and suddenly unexpected unity. Surprising about its role it is a character that has been said earlier that it is difficult We saw many mentally harmful characters, many mentally challenged people, many people, many enthusiastic self-centric artists, but none of Sandler's Charlie Feynman. He may have a taste of each of them in some ways, but his character is really unpredictable and complete personal. The audience is emotionally drawn by it and it is completely different from many letters like this, whose issue, mentality, and excitement are what they are happy anyway. <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle is a fun distribution of a completely different level performance. He is every man He is the most natural person in the world, so you rarely find many letters like him, or at least the name of Allen Johnson played, the name of which he played will be reduced, whose name is found in rally rally. Chadle is staggering that he is funny, jolting, smart, and stupid many ordinary people. <br /> <br /> The rest of the acting is populated by actors and actors who rarely have done a small but quite colorful role. Jada Pinkett-Smith is a highly reputed high middle-class wife, Donald Suucharland, helpless but wonderful judge, Robert Klein Sandler's helpless father-in-law. <br /> <br /> Mike Bander's script is quite bright because it says that its guises are quite deep about all communication wonders. It is far more subtle than bubble, and it is ideal for a very close-home. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br This picture has been decorated for sending me to the kitchen style of the 1970s. Cinematography was grainy and unfastened, but that was his charm. It attracts us in the camera and is shiny that can not immerse its story in such a way. <br /> <br /> This music plays a big role in the film and its title is very powerful. At the beginning you think that you are for something like Schmidt or the Little Miss Sunshine soundtrack, but you soon understand that you are even more than that. In fact, this movie is packed with lots of music which stimulates a more emotional scene. <br /> <br /> The kingdom over me is not only for the society, but also for the film a big statement. It shows that Blackman's director is even capable of surprising.
