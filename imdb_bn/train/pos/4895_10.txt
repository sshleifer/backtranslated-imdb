Especially for a special event, I am very rare to sit in front of the TV. I actually enjoy the show till the end, even this is rare, but in the end, one of the best movies I've ever seen in The Bloom Bombshells. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary cast led by Dame Judy Danks, Ian Holm, and an excellent, malicious and shocking script combined to make it truly a rewarding experience. I can not really express how good it was, so I will not try, I would say, if you get the opportunity please see it !!!! I hope only the video comes in it.
