I already knew that Bradley did not see the GRAHA GARDEN before I saw the same musical instrument. Friends warned me that if I do not see the movie, then the musical will not understand. It did, but it also inspired me to renovate the movie. At first, I thought it was the ruins of a train, weird, screamed letters were full and it was very difficult to see. But it's able to stop, digest it and go back to it, I understand why the Grey Garden is considered a memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> Both the Big Ed and Little Eddie are unforgettable and the complete lack of confidence is worth the test. Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. They have a relation that scoffs to any woman (and of course some men) and re-examines your own behavior with your mother. In an era when reality television and movie genre, it is fascinating to watch Miles's work three decades ago and understand how much the impact of this movie can have on the impact. <br /> <br /> I am echoing what other posters have said. : How are they allowed to slip into such squalor by their families? But even more, how can two people escape from reality in this entire fashion in the 1970s? Or do they seem to be just crazy to help? I would recommend watching this with the highly commented track, which gave me extra insight into the film.
