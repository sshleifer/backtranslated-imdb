It is a collection of documentaries, 11 minutes, 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists around the world. Documentaries deal with different types of different concepts, the only thing about sharing is 9/11, a theme (very small in some cases). Some limitations are weak and others are very strong; Some are political, nothing happens; Some are just about anything 9/11, 9/11 commonly use themes as a theme to touch human feelings, emotions and tragedies; Some mainstream and others abstract and artistic). This picture has not been censored in any way, so the views you see are very raw and strong. <br /> <br /> This is a very controversial film, especially for Conservative Americans. I think the two parts can really hold the right wings (one from Egypt, where an American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomb return as a spirit; from another UK, which reminds America's overthrow of Chile's suppressed Chile on September 11, 1973. 50,000 deaths And terrible torture). The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, which led to the collapse of the towers, and consequently the death caused by the death of fashionable fashion (you have to believe it). <br /> <br /> Although the final product is incapable, some parts are almost "vain", I still recommend this. This movie is very difficult to rank because they change everywhere (some weak, some very strong;). I'm giving it 9 out of 10 ratings because some parts are nice and covered topics that are usually censored (Mexico Segment, UK Segment, Japan Segment, Egypt Segment)
