I was forced to see it because a) I have 11 years old daughter and b) we showed her the Bonana Granville Nation Drew in 1930, which she enjoyed quite a lot. Personally, I was not laughable like the Flickr of the 1930s, but on the other hand, it was not an annoying part of the intelligence-insulting flop, I feared it would be. It was an illogical, gentle entertainment movie. Although I am satisfied, they did not try to "upgrade" Nancy in 21st Century "Hipnes". (Veronica Mars retains the title as the Modern Nancy Drew), I think they make her look very nice, they are not enough to develop Nancy Drew - the film's title "Jane Do, Girl Detective". I would blame this script: I think every actor has done a good job to work with them. I like Emma Roberts in this role, but they did not give him a made TV, dramatic release, script ...
