Still, "Feastoff of Dollar", Kurosawa "Yazimbo" (proposed by novel 'Red Harvest') is the restoration of Sergio Leon. <br /> <br /> This is strictly a B-movie; Taken as that, it's rather enjoyable. The direction is shiny, fancy acting, its 'direct-to-video' photography capabilities are well-managed. <br /> <br /> The film's weaknesses' serious decision 'in great marriages "/' Yazipbo '' plot of a sub-plot from Leon's' Win Upon a Time in the West '. Although Leone indicates both 'fish' and 'west', his motivation behind the two films can not be different. 'Man with no name' (Eastwood) is a social platform with a soft spot for broken family. Harmonica (Chaeles Bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family, and is obsessed with revenge. These two characters do not do much with each other. To combine them, the plot of 'Crazy Crazy' has to be dragged and follow until we follow what we are following. <br /> <br /> But it is a B-movie, and filled with action and silliness; It is entertaining at that stage, do not expect anything more.
