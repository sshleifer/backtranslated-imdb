Unfortunately for myself - I delayed this event late. Before I was rejected by ABC, I caught some episodes (about three). I like the characters, and storylines - but most of all great actors! I was a fan of Sex and City, so I saw two letters recognized (Bridgette was a posthumous and the character "Todd" was "Smith Jared"), as well as J Hern√°ndez (Carlito Way: Rise to Power) and Arica Christensen (Swimon). I enjoy watching the young actors get their deserve, and felt like this show led their career further forward. I hope it will come out of the DVD at least, and maybe WBLL will choose it for a second season for a little while? Meanwhile, I started looking at ABC's website from the beginning.
