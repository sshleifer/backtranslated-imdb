One night I saw this movie on TV, but it was an annoying experience for me, which is with me today. <br /> <br /> The secret may seem a bit irrational because of the earthquake. On a small town the underground store of the toxic nerve agent of the mountain is violated, and a microscopic amount of substance finds the way to supply them. City residents begin to lose their ability to control every intelligence and basic desires floating through our minds on time, and generally we know that we will not be able to work only. The pace of film is slow, but for me, which only adds gradually to separatism, because the behavior of the urban people gradually starts to get energized. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm not sure the 'enjoy' is the correct word. Does this make me think? Clearly. I'm still thinking about it. Scary stuff.
