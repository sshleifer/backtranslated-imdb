Being one of Austria, it hit me directly. Thankfully, I do not live anywhere near the place where I place this movie, but unfortunately it hates all the things in Austria that are Vienna nationals (or people in that region). And it can easily read that it's just the motives of the directors: drown your head in your hands and say, "Oh God, how can it be possible!". No, not with me (my opinion) The complete unrecognized censored swing club scene is not necessary, I see porn, sure, but in this context I was rather hateful in the context. <br /> <br /> A story about those who teach this film or those who survive the bad company is that they try to survive and survive the extraordinary horoscope and survive. A girl who is treated as a prostitute by her super-enthusiastic boyfriend (and still coming back), a female teacher who has discovered her Mashayibism by keeping her extremely cruel "lover" on the line, who has an old couple, almost a mathematical daily cycle (He is the "official transferee" of his ex-wife), the couple has only made a divorce and the former husband Raktana has been suffering under his wife's actions, possibly including his message, and finally a crazy hitahikara relationship with his driver and very annoying most unusual question extends her nervous. <br /> <br /> After seeing this you almost do not mind. You do not even feel frustrated, depressed, depressed or doing something ... Perhaps that is why I gave it 7 points, it responded to me that I had never responded before. If it's good or bad you are on!
