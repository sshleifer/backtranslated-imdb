Those who say that this movie is shown below the disrespectful grace, I disagree. This is an extraordinary documentary about a wonderful day. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ask IMDB to rate us this movie. I consider you to consider the fact that the documentary was created. The courage that was taken to shoot this image is most notable. Two brothers are divided when we happened that moment. They continue to enroll themselves and each other with intelligent intelligence without knowing about security. To test whether tragedy videos are great or stylish to save life in that amazing, amazing firefighters are not interested in answering. I know that for 30 years, a whole class of children will not know one with another. <br /> <br /> I submitted a sincere heart of 10. That is why the filming industry was created! Capture the natural passion that offers real-life. You can keep your kung fu junk. Romance is beautiful. The action will not reach this level. 9/11, this movie will be ruthless as it does not glorify itself. It was not a sneak strap. There were not many cute vans that had a lion's share of many movies on many screens. It was class, composer, material, and it was a record that changed the face of America and even the world's modern face. It's worth mentioning that the camera is not worth looking into the eyes. Please consider this movie, it declares itself, an enthusiastic tribute to everyone who had fallen for the free, beautiful name of America. <br /> <br /> How can you give something in a movie, not the miracle real man embellishes natural courage, acting. I love "The Godfather", but "9/11" is a different kind of movie forever, because it's a different kind of world now. It is industry without question or question <br /> <br /> JF
