After watching this picture at the SF Independent Film Festival, I could not wait to hear how I got a copy. Jim McCack gave a talk about the film, which presented his malicious situation: How to distribute a film depicting the minorities (women, non-white) working to solve controversial issues (Teenage pregnancy, teen motherhood, racial identity , Single mother's family), and how to write a trusted script on all these things is about thirty-four white ones Oh Most of the adult-adults, multi-ethnic, multi-gender observers are disturbed by the great storytelling of the film, detailed characters and excellent screenplay of "real sadness". But most of the teiras have left this building - I think it is a film considered by adults as the best film by many adults, which many adults remember, instead of being an initial initiative for discussion, "A movie should be seen thirteen because it is about them. "Therefore, the distribution question - how can we get our hands on it? Internet (retail) will be a great way - a film that will be buried, such as "puppy" or other basic modern teen movies - and Mac seems to be responsive. For his achievements as a writer / director, Mac was very sensitive and detailed in his work - _extremeley- establishing the film, adding himself to the surroundings of Crown Heights, acting with actors who work to portray their own views in their own perspective - The result is neutral, realistic.
