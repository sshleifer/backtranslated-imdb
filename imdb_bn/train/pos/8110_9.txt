This time the amazing effect for a movie. The futility of war and how the war itself is becoming a child born of its prime minister. <br /> <br /> A nice thing in this movie is now available at the public domain and archive.org. No charge, no sign up required. See it in one spring and you'll be driven. <br /> <br /> I have planned to share this flick with as many people as possible because I have never heard of it before and I am a hard core scientist. <<br> <br /> I would like to see how others will react in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you think we have.
