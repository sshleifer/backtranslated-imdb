Although I have not seen this mini series in more than 20 years, I can still remember how the balance between character, plot and wonderful literature has been successful. The use of special effects is made literally more literary than literary but rather poetic. The two versions I saw were dubbed (English and French), but there is a synchronization problem because the actors are not just Italian in their own language. It does not spoil the story to tell. Irene Pappus as Penelope is the most well known of North America. All followers of Odysseus' expected never return.
