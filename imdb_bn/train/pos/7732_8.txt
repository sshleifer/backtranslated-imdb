The performance of this movie was fantastic. The dialogue was great. Jason Patrick distributed outstanding performance as "Kid" Collins in this wonderful adaptation of Jim Thompson's novel. Very good from "The Grititors", which was a good film, this film was true to the fiction / film Nur's roots, from which the story came. I recommend this movie to silent fans all the movies.
