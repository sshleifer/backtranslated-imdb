OK. There are people who can not see this movie. <br /> <br /> 1) If you do not like cats or black humor, do not see it. 2) If you are offended by _ Watchmen_ then do not like it. 3) If you want a serious superhero movie but can not see it. <br /> <br /> The rest of you, go, do not walk, see _ mystery male_ It's funny, it's quirky, it's a delightful send to every bad superhero cliche familiar to humans. In junior-high humor, sometimes Jihan Garfalo, Ben Stiler and Han Azaria, and Geoffrey Rush and some small parts of Greg Kinninger do not waste less original junk-in-cheek fun. (Lewis Lashar is also good at work.) I laughed all the way. Somewhat weird, somewhat weird, but -Good-
