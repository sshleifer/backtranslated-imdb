The Tony Hawk Underground came at a stage where the series really did not lose its brightness, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 did not live up to the expectation and the series really kept in air, which could do with the NevadaSoft and the Activation Series, to be different and interesting. <br /> <br /> launched Undergraduate Storymode, which was quite cool because it created a whole new world for Tony Hawk Pro Skater fans. Another feature was mostly for some fans, and it was able to shut down Scatterboard, which is beautiful, because now you can actually climb up, run and do something new. <br /> <br /> Well, the Naversoft Pro Scatter 3 has developed a problem that started with 3 and it was the length of the level designs. The first two games of PS1, N64 and Dreamcast were great because it had beautiful and long levels and some hidden features. Pro Skater 3 and 4 were small due to some features added and really pushed the system to their limitations. In this version, they have minimized these features, many people are not thinking in the streets, in fact there is almost no one at all, and graphics and skating physics are small but not much. <Br /> <br /> This game is a con, the story is a little small, of course, it is understood to be Neverfus with Tech Haque Pro Skater. However, that's saying that you will certainly end this game in a day. <br /> <br /> Overall, there was a great addition that was very refreshing.
