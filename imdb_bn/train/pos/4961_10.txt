Morgan Freeman and Puja are two pairs of twins who come in the car and shop according to the needs of one or the other. Morgan Freeman exclusively human, one and all related, and Paz Vega check out "10 items or less" lines, fearing customers and bothered to his mind. Together they explore, discover, and learn from each other. Of course they must be weak, interested to be interested, and may have the sense of humor, which they both have. I was realistic in this movie, I want to get this story more often, I hope not to go to movies, we understand that we can connect with each other even if we come from different backgrounds. The film's message is based on an open heart and makes us wonder about the other world's possibilities where we can meet each other from there - in a world where peace is possible.
