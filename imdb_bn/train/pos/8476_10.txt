*** Spoilers * <br /> <br /> My dad tapped this picture for me when I was 3 years old. At the age of 5, I saw 400 times. I just saw it and saw it. And today I do! It's a deadly story, a lamb's mother is killed by a wolf - a very emotional scene - and wants to be like a wolf like her. After years of training, the lamb is really making things looking really bad. He and the wolf travel to his old barn, but he can not kill lambs, no matter how much he wishes. He kills the wolf till the end, but he is no longer seen as a lamb by his predecessors, and can not return to his previous life. <br /> <br /> The art is beautiful, the tracks .. well, okay, and the voice acting is better than anything today. <br /> <br /> Everyone, there is only * for this movie, this is a great composition. Although, it is very difficult to find today. <br /> <br />
