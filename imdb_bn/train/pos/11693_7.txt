This movie was a remake of two movies which was a lot better. The last one, heaven can wait, was great, I recommend you see that one. This one is not so great. The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock has started to play some fun fun, where he got today. However, I do not know what happened in the first two episodes of this movie. It's playing like a bad "B" movie where some bad TV sit-coms like people. The situation is compulsory and they are just trying to get the story so that they can start the real movie. It seems all real fake and editing is just bad. I do not know how they can publish this movie. However, the last part is not bad, so wait for the video to watch.
