This is the second animatrix short, and the first of them could say 'artistic'. There are plenty of references, metaphors and symbols in dense quantities, especially the 9-minute running time. I have heard some accusations that it tries to "hate against humanity", or to show hatred toward people, their "sin against the machine". I do not think it is true; It only uses robots to show us, because as a human, we do not particularly feel like accepting or open to a person different from ourselves. I would like to do a great job that's it. The plot is good ... it acts as a historical document, which is a reason for the main contradictions of the triangle. So it reports imaginary news and holds clips from like. The voice acting is very good, if it's not so much. Animations are beautiful, and in spite of the practical drawings style, the use of colors, smooth transitions and other miraculous imagery makes it more open. These have strong violence and annoying visuals, as well as a little bit of a little nudity. The disc contains a commentary on subtitles and not audible in English, and hearing / readable pricing. Based on both parts, a good job is done and made informative, so I will advise seeing it as well as side by side next. I recommend this to those who enjoy the Matrix universe, and / or science fiction in general. 8/10
