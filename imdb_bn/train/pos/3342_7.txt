If you enjoy a romantic comedy, you will find this story of a 30-year-old American who will fall in love with the United States League Pennet nation. On the other hand, if you are waiting for Bill Bill Volume 3 or Sina City 2, you probably have to stay away. The compulsory person meets the girl's friends, meets the girl's friends, and the man meets the girl's parents' view. Even a guy girl met the pet dog scene. All differences for a movie course like this. However, what I liked about it is that this decision confuses people into the decision-making process, since they start to realize that their romantic interest is not perfect and is actually a bit ridiculous. Q The plot centers around the north; How much quirkiness is too much and does it love to take the quirks trump? Characters that seem to be profoundly seem to be attractive (if we accept it) we all have quirks. Barrymore did a very good job in his role and Fallon sorta surprised me - he's as good as well. I 10 out of 10 as a romantic comedy. If you are involved with one baseball fan or romantically one add one point. If you are a Red Sox fan, add another point and subtract two points if you are a Yankees fan.
