To me, this review may have spoilers, but like watching movies with no idea what I'm going to do, so I think there are many spoilers in this movie's other reviews! <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie again, and I must repeat that it's the best ending of a movie. Ever. Ever. Ever. The actual translation, 'The Betting of the Butterfly Wings', is not used as a curiously translated title. I think they think that most Americans do not know what Chaos theory (except those who can read or read "Jurassic Park"). Depending on the theory of film chaos, and how a small event may affect the outcome of apparently related events, all returning to an event. The film is a surprising cause and a cyclone of influence, because we follow the chain of chaos because it is interchangeable between different characters (about 20?). In a way, it seems inevitable despite the end, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Imagine yourself, "What else needs to be said"? It is a very brave ending at the same time. Too bad we would go abroad for a jewel like this, but like this one will never come to the end of Hollywood. <br /> <br />
