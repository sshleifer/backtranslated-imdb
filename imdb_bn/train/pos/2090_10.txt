Where this word comes from "classic film" It is a wonderful story of a woman's courage, courage and extreme loyalty. The poor Olan was sold to his helpless husband, who had been learning to praise him for years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not really shown, if any, the genius was other than its exotic beauty. But in "good world" she shows that she really does work His beauty was removed and he had a great dress, people said that he did not show any real passion in this film, like hell. His character Olan is a shy and fearful woman with inner strength. He is calm to express his emotions only with his eyes and body, for example: those scenes while shooting down the city and looting. If you say that he does not do well in this film, you do not see! <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Paul Muni sees that he too can work, his character is not liked by me, and he does not see him for the end of the story. Darya, with a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother. Most of beauty, a pearl-like. <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to see this picture, look at this. You will see one of Hollywood's best films.
