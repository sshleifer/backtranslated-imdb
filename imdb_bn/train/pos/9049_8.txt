An old word with Joe Johnston's new movie is said to be such that something goes like this: "The person who thinks that person and the person he thinks is not right." This is a very embarrassing statement that believes in a spontaneous and spontaneous person who is still standing after the road blockades and family problems in the film. <br /> <br /> "October Sky" is growing in the harsh, traditional family of the 1950s, Homer Hickam, a young man who believes in himself. Nearly every man is bigger than a mine where Homer loves a small coal mining town. All his friends, Quintin, Ray, and O'Delle, think everyone after their high school will be like theirs. Homer does not go beyond that future. <br /> <br /> One night, everyone looks at the sky, crossing a Russian space cart Sputnik overhead. It's something new to Homer, and it's spectacular and disgusting. From this point, his perspective will never be the same. <br /> <br /> First, he told everyone that he wanted to work in the rocket scientists region. Flabberted by what he says, his family sends the idea over their head and their friends continue to live as normal, but there seems to be some possibility of this idea. Finally, Quintin is such a smart person when it comes to such things. <br /> <br /> When four friends begin to test the model rocket and hit a white peak fence, then what if a forest fire is frightened by them, they are forced to end their progress. <br /> <br /> Acting in this movie is completely riveting from the beginning. Perform all the performers such as this real mumbo jambo here. All the greatness stands out: Laura Darn as Miss Riley. At the beginning of the year, the judges may think that if this film is released then it can be a very good Academy Award material. <br /> <br /> The letters are very well developed. Why Hemay is interested in this, filmmakers not only give clear, obvious reasons, but they also explain how successful their audience is in rocket learning. We definitely understand all the motives and beliefs of the characters, especially the parents, who are bent on infinite heritage, all understand. Unfortunately, the film unfortunately lost its speed due to medieval reasons, romantic sub-plot recycled Homer's love interest and how his brother stole him from him. Such high schools are becoming so dire in schools, not that the movie is targeted at high school students. Actors look at each other psychologically, like in a trance. In 1997, I was involved with it without alleging "Abbots of Inventing In", but I had enough of it. <br /> <br /> But this is a minor complaint. With real-time search, Assalamu Alaikum and the real life clips, in the end, Homer and Cinematography with friends, all of whom have a big hit with their dreams, especially Homer, it's the first film of 1999. <br /> <br />
