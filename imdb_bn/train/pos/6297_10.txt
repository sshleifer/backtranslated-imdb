I am discussing how frustrated my friends and I have with the film and especially romantic comedy. We feel sorry that they are working well on these days in Hollywood that they all work well. <br /> <br /> Not all good ... except for some bright spots like this movie. It's a big name actor, not a big budget, I do not think it was a big release (I was hired from a Hollywood video) It's not really big budget romantic comedy at any cost. <br /> <br /> But most of them lacked. In love interest, it was a great chemistry, "Parker" (Jonathan Shake) and "Sam" (Alison Eastwood). Their love story was not forced on a lot like us. The director takes time to help each other to know each other. Their story reminds me of my beloved "Tutsi". <br /> <br /> Supporting Cast is not only fun, but also the depth of the story. James LeGros' character was absolutely invaluable. Sam's gay friend was violent. Parker's interaction with his colleagues was very interesting with a psychic hotline. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I started crying, I think how it feels to fall in love.
