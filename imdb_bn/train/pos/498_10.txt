I was expecting this when Star Traffic was the DS9 premiere. DS9 is not a little bit. It was a wonderful show of her own rights, but it did not give the devotee more than what they wanted. Show that the enterprise Despite the similarity to the original track, it is quite different from its original way. It makes our exciting search idea again. And that was one of the main components that made the original element. Another element of success was the relationship that developed among crew members. The visitors really care deeply for the crew. Alongside the enterprise there are many promises in this area. Chemistry between bakula and blokak seems very optimistic. Although eroticism in a show often gets crutched, I think enterprise excitement can be more and generally say more than that. I think when we deal with such different types of race or grand scale characters, even we get some very interesting ideas and televisions. Also, our performance should be noticed, the block is very convincing because Vulcan Tiple and Baku have a really radioactive and characteristic power that provides a great performance. The rest cast delivers the best performance. My only gripes are as follows Theme It's good, but impressive for my favorites is a little better. We need something a little more grand. Do not be orchestral. Maybe some of the more electronic sounds will be enough. And my other complaints. They sold a lot of sales. They sell less ads, or can make all parts of two partners. Otherwise we were one of my complainers in the Voyager as we ended up looking at the way to the last final of the show wrapped up very quickly.
