Indian summer is a warm, multi-film film that will create a great afternoon film (with some editing). <br /> <br /> This movie started showing a maus to a group of children at the beginning of the past, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present, a group of adults from the "golden age" of the camp is again invited again to leave the camp for a few weeks. Either, Uncle Lou. The film allows viewers to spend time with the viewer while remembering their time in the camp and make new memories during their last stay. <br /> <br /> This image is a great way to succeed in its characters. In this fantastic setting, and able to develop their room without thinking about the development of the plot. These people are memorable, and their relationship with each other is what the film is and why it works so well. It never goes on top and melodramatic, always keep its warmth, charm and realism. I've never seen a movie where Nostalgia has been caught so well, and myself, like a camp, sometimes even clinging herself in a camp. <br /> <br /> For a warm, nostalgic film, I sincerely recommend.
