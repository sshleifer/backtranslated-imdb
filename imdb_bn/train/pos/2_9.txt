Bromwell is nothing short of high bright. Efficient lipids and perfectly delivered, a student and teachers of South London Public School leave this rolling with literally laughing to this parody. It's rude, provocative, malicious and sharp. Character is a fantastic caricatured cross section of British society (or no society to be more accurate). Following escapades for Keisha, Latrina and Natella, our three "dramatic", wanted a good word, do not shy away from parodying every imaginable subject of the show. Fly out of every episode window of political purity. If you enjoy the shows which are not afraid to entertain the appealing content of the fantasy content, then Bromwell will not be disappointed!
