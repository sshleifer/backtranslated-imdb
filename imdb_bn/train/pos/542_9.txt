When I first saw Brian Cruz going to this movie, I wanted to see. I took this week to realize that I saw this original and loved it. So I was more reason to watch. Well, I saw. It was better than the most growing for TV movies. I hate Brian's character (you can find it for yourself) and I did not like most of the characters included in Brian. But for the film Stanley Caldwell (Jude Nelson) once again, the film needs Chess and annoying and jaric-like characters to discuss. To the end, I was delighted for Stanley and his own happy ending. If you like the original cabin by lake or you like horror movies without blood, then I suggest you look at it.
