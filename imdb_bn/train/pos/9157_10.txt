Jane Eyre has always been my favorite novel! When I stumbled in this movie version at the end of the 90's, I was happy! The best and most complete version of this book! This version is a little sitting in a little but it's a little bit better value. Timothy Dalton is amazing as Rochester. I'm glad they are not like Genre actress (Jella Clark) Jane and not an impressive person. I love set and location. Anyone who is genuine Jane fan, version to see it !!! For those interested, I only found this version of DVD. I was thrilled to find it on DVD so I saw VVs copied almost broken.
