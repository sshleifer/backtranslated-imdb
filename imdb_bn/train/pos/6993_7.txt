This is not Lagosi's best movie at the moment, but it's a good way to get old style of entertainment for 40's. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that I will postpone marriage until the cat is caught, But it's a horror movie, so I think people ignore danger for some reason. However, Legacy is a crazy doctor, who wants to keep his wife healthy at the old age, the sick wife is healthy and happy. He always listens to the Kishon police (think of looking for a dead body to hear?), And bura just japed. There will be no movie like this. A Lois Lane type woman who is herself without the reporter wants to catch herself on the crime. Good to solve the crime, bad to keep his mouth off in bad times, guess who the person likes for hunting next to him. I love the "spectacular house" where Lois Lane is blocked by a storm of storm as a guest in the Lewis Lane's scary palace. Hidden passageways, a purple-like wife, an evil dwarf Igor's assistant, and so on. Good thing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like the old horror movie, it's a watch price.
