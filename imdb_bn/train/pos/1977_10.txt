I really love this movie. When I was in 2nd class, it seemed that my teacher showed us 16 mm film relay. However, this film may be a bit scary for the second step, such as the scene where Bill kills Nansi and sees Fagin's face for the first time on screen. One of my relatives is sick of seeing this film, because he studied in his music class. If I was a teacher and could grade people who created this nice movie, I would give them an A +.
