Again in the 80's, Arnold showed that he was the king of the future and a laner in this future film about a contendant living violent sport show. But Arnold as the tag line says to play yet! The film began in 2019, in which food and food supply along with other important materials have been reduced and the totalitarian state has been developed, TV and police control every aspect of life through the state. This is the most popular game show The Running Man, in which the perpetrators are forced to survive against "stalkers". <br /> <br /> The movie is running a helicopter mission to open with Ben Richards (Arnold), a food riot progression. His senior officials ordered him to set fire on, killing him, and preventing him from being thrown into prison. In the meantime, he killed people without their help. The government blamed Richards for "mass killing a bakerfield". After eighteen months, Richards worked with the breakout of two friends William Laughlin (Koto) and Harold Weiss (Mackinthe). They headed towards underground under the leadership of Mike (Mick Fleetwood). Mick quickly identifies Richard as the "Butcher of Buckerfield" and refuses to help him, but his friend is otherwise satisfied. They want to join him with resistance, but he wants to live with his brother and get a job. Soon he saw that his brother was taken for retraining and a woman named Amber Mendes (Alonso) took her apartment. He knows who he is, he will not help him, but he believes in him, but after police drop him at the airport, police bombed him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Damon Kilian (Dawson) hosts the show and one of the country's most powerful people, Richards is able to get out of the footage and get him for the show after his capture. Richardson refused to play, Kylian threatened to use his friends instead, so he signed the contract. You'll love that part. But soon he discovered that they would join him immediately and make sure that he would come back, he knows. Runners begin to make paths through zones and fight memorable, sub-zero, lightning show and many other characters. Eventually Richards joined Amber, who doubted that he had set up but caught, and he was even dropped into the game. Together they found the underground and went back to the Kylian and told him goodbye. <br /> <br /> One of the best films of the Running Man Arnold in the 80's The film was apparently somewhat visible based on Steven King's book of the same name. Some people say that the book is good. I'm not sure it and I do not care about anything I like the movie. Like all the Arnold movies, you will be working with Arnold's classic single linear and even Ventura will get a couple. But Richard Dawson is not able to stand out in this movie. As he hosted a real game show he was easily able to spoofed himself and create a character who was really a cold bloody. The whole movie itself rips on game shows and some big brothers rips on you Keep an eye on for fun and some old shows for others, poking "hate boats" among others. Apart from Arnold, Koto and Alonso, the performance was also great, Professor Toro Tanaka, Jim Brown, Ventura and Sven-Ole! The fact that the reality TV nonsense is going on is better now, but I'm sure Hollywood celebrities will make it a movie about "Evil Bush". The new DVD mostly fills up as the only gift of poor additional studios. How ACLU was able to gain some communism in DVDs and ridiculous garbage that should not be anywhere near an Arnold movie. Blasphemy! Above all, for any Arnold fan, we've grown up specially in 80, you can not miss it. In the 80's I saw the first and it is still very cool. Future world and humor is great. Above 10 out of 10 stars, of course its best.
