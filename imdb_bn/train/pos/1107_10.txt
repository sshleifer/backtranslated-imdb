In the classic sense of four comedies (which is not funny or even entertaining concept), Altman's "H.E.A.L.T.H." Have fun all the behavior, and actually very fun, entertaining way. Laurine Buckle's very slow, safe and protective character is portrayed as Ester Brill's personality, who has shown the goal of life, its beauty and its beauty protection than beauty, everything is present. Paul Doyle's choleric Dr. Gil Gany, who likes fish outside the water (probably more like a seal), encourages to roam terribly and subscribe to the crowd's crazy insanity. Glenda Jackson's Isabela Garnell's danger criticizes Shakespeare's annoying and self-righteous Hamlet - even affecting a solicitor or two. And do not forget about the character of Henry Gibson's character, Bobby Hammer ("The breasts that accept the rules of the world,"). Then there are characters such as Harry Wolf and Gloria Barbank (respectively James Garner and Carroll Burnett), relatively careful characters are among all companions and extreme comedians, who are in the AAAALAAA. - In the HAAAATA, especially the World Trade Organization type, which is to say anything other than health. This is Altman at its classic best.
