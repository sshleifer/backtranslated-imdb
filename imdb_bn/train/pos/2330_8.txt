This show is good. I liked acting, funny bits and it's authority. Actors, Lee Pace, Anne Friel ... etc, they are great to hear shows. The show started with the fun, unreasonable fundamental idea of ​​bringing dead people back in the first series, and in fact, the people said that the first few episodes of the second series were a little less frustrating, but later came back again, though good. And now I hate that's really going to hate it. Why does all the episodes end until ABC ends up? I really want to know how to know the story. I think it should be given a chance because it is still quite a lot of visitors who love it.
