Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy movies have a very small plot. Instead, they give them an old situation instead and let them be joyful! Movies like Help Maths and Buri Board are doing fun for boys or cleaning the house. Here in Dartswark, most of the movies try the same two of the two films - Stan and Olly Chimney Sweep and spend a lot of films (quite unsuccessful) to clean a chapel of a mad professor. Oli fell through the chimney, the boys made the room roughly messy, and Stanley's insane behavior worked together to make a very delightful film. <br /> <br /> However, that is a strange subplot that really starts and ends in a movie. It seems that Professor is a really crazy scientist and he is working on formula for creating small things. The film is late, you see him duckling in a duck and even an egg in a duck! In that case, he left the boys alone in the house, after the surprise? This usage was unnecessary, it worked well enough. What was exceptionally good work was in the middle part. The guys are not exciting to do anything and you will be surprised at the delightful results. One of the best films of the team and it is about 9.
