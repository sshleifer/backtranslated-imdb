This supermodel Peter Weir Thriller is one of the most scary and impressive movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain, as a lawyer in Australia, has performed his best here, who defended a group of young Abigidians for the murder. He gets closer to the case, he is the main protester, Chris, and at least find out more about himself. Chris told him that he is a Mulcurul, which seems to be a nation of supernatural beings living in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, the incredible high rainfall appears to confirm the prediction of the arrival of the last coming, which will sink the world. <br /> <br /> Dream sequence and supernatural influences make this movie better and make it a spectacular experience. Olivia Hamnet and David Gulpillill are strong in supporting roles, as well as a chap with a tough name, who played Charlie, old Aborigines who can turn into spirals. Do not be frustrated with Climax and Finish, those who have been flat in the hours of success or against the other in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers. However, it can not be called a pure thriller. It's a drama and discussion about the spirituality and spiritual identity of the modern world. An efficient work by Peter Weir, apparently the stunning drama master.
