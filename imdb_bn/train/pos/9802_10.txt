In the beginning, I have always been a fan of Batman cartoons because the theme is so universal, 'Everybody who is alive has changed.' This is true of Batwoman's mystery. The overall story is good but I'm disappointed that they did not do much for the franchise. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, you are trying to find out the identity of Batman, unfortunately you can easily find out by throwing a post credit on this website (so if you have not seen it already there). I was disappointed that they did not even make the movie. 75 minutes is very short way for any movie. Batwan's secret identity comes very early in the film, arranged in the middle and later becomes anti-weather because you know that good people will always win and after the end of the film, the new character known as Batwoman will disappear. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure about the new animation style used in this movie. I love smooth new characters but should have some detailed details for details. Some parts of the animation are so painful and strong that it draws your attention and disconnects your attention directly from the story. I apparently do not like the bright atmosphere used in most cases, it is a Batman that loses its dark and gothic feeling. Likewise, we learned more about Batumon's personality so that we can develop a deep sympathetic feeling with Bruce Wayne. Also I think the fight with Ben should work well. Generally, bad guys in children's fashion are easily matched with death by making tripping, collapse, electric power or by making some fools who work against them. Imagine, there was no drop of blood in this film. <br /> <br /> The bottom line, this is a lovely entertaining flick and I recommend the Batman fan to anyone looking at it. It is good story, universal appeal and even played top of it off. I could only deliver more permanent changes to the story by keeping Batwane more attractive. Just do not introduce her and kick her after finishing her job. I would eventually like to see someone outside the mystery for change. As soon as Batman's mystery is resolved, fill it out in detail in detail and later. <br /> <br /> I hope more animated movies are coming and we are waiting for that time when we'll actually see Bruce Wayne and Barbara Gordon break in. She has been stringing her for ever and she does not even like him and I can not believe that she was a fool to fall in love with someone who is 20 years old. I want to see the time when Team Drake leaves because he gets sick in old age. In short, I want to see everything that will take the letter beside the batman. Otherwise the same repetition formula will end it faster than just deciding to proceed with the story. <br /> <br />
