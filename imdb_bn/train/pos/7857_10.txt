Tempo and balance of the same structure as this movie. Silent movies were made of pure art, its structure, direction and acting was the attention - also had a word or computer generated confusion with no padding. A poorly made or unwanted silent movie is unknown. <br /> <br /> This film should be kept in context of people who may be disconnected from Christian themes. This is not a 'Christian' film, it is not selling anything. These themes, with reference to the current moral values, are often shown in this era - the Sunday church also had a national past, Christianity was given in most of the families, thus, this film simply illustrated normal life. These themes will flow deeply and deeply. <br /> <br /> The strong support of the good Christian thinking of this particular movie (and it is not a religion is promoted, highlighting only the difference) among hypocrites and good workers) In 1922, an open debate with representatives of the film industry was a huge crowd of pesters With a picor as an example of immorality, he gave the name of something else With tira.

In the debate, although the film representative has observed the following; Upasthititio salons that were dropped, actors more than the jail was feathers (true) and selected a few examples from many, was not completed. <br /> <br /> This was how the war between church and film industry began in the first days of the film. <br /> <br /> It tells family friends honest and true and is a wonderful movie for those who want to sacrifice it.

But it does not push us down the throat, but release the bit through the film. <br /> <br /> This is memorable for some modern Chinese movies, where the letters are gradually revealed publicly through a movie and it creates a strong connection with the character that is a character. /> <br /> For the first half of a smooth <br even damp contains all the elements for an end to the division. শেষ 30 মিনিট দুর্দান্ত চলচ্চিত্র তৈরি করে এবং এটি প্রশংসা করা উচিত যে এটি শব্দ, চলমান সংলাপের সুবিধা ছাড়াই অর্জন করা হয়েছিল - এটি নিষ্ঠুর অভিনয় এবং দুর্দান্ত নির্দেশনার মাধ্যমে অর্জন করা হয়েছিল। Sometimes it's no wonder that at the end of the movie you did not hear any word, but it seems like you've heard everything. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary performances, especially Glory Hope, Gene Herscott and Lloyd Hughes <br /> <br /> In the very last few minutes, Picforard is usually like a frustrating sunny, snowflake, perfect balance, and at the end. This is a particularly sensitive humor that should not be underestimated. Chaplin often used this device and copied something from Picford. <br /> <br /> Another special observation for silent movies, and especially PicPhone movies is that the star will often have to hold the camera for most photos without the movie.

Picforard is usually the center of attention through most of his films, but people still do not have a rules of verification for his performance.
