Feather is unfairly maligned as "Se7en" ripoff. There is no reason to compare with the two, perhaps for the same view in the final showdown. <br /> <br /> Now the way I'm going out, the flock is very interesting in some cases. In most cases it is a dramatic piece than a full-fledged thriller about a very conscious social worker who is obsessed with sex offenders. Very soon you can clearly see his work got his good. In two scenes where he is interviewing the first criminal and surrounded him and secondly when a woman tries to pick him up and everything he thinks about, his question is his emotional question. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As Ariel Badge, the predecessor social worker His way of doing his job is not against a police officer, he carried guns and always checked the newspaper and provided information to legal officials if some of his "feathers" could be held responsible for sexual crimes. He is a person who has lost all the happiness of living and his only relief came to judge his own surveillance on his flock. Twice you saw him laugh, once he apologized for treating his partner maliciously, and the other pardoned his wanderer after being beaten. <br /> <br /> The flock is not successful as a flashing. It has a few pieces of interesting pieces, with a bit of confusing and some annoying plotting. <br /> <br /> The overall flock is a tough play for a man to do inhuman work and he must work harder till he refrains from being surrounded by ornaments surrounded by himself. The world we live in is a very sick place and another person can be far away from the happiest person. Feathers get that dot across gorgeous.
