I'm not saying a big carrier fan. Although I would admit that I did not see all his movies * cough * witch cough *. Bruce was omnipotent enjoyable. Any other reviews have actually gone into the cheesy how actually gets to the end, I do not know what the author was thinking about. I could not help in any way, but this movie seems to have been a bad attempt to rebuild Leisure. <br /> <br /> On a positive note, Steve Corneli of the Daily Show and the rest of the cast. If you're a big Jim Carey fan then see Bruce Almighty, or you just want to see a light heart (que soft piano music) somewhat funny comedy.
