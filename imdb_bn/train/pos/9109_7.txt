Basically it is a story of two men who were part of the Portuguese Revolution. Competition was easy to understand, but usually the directors start from historical events to talk about something else, or they show the time before or after this truth, within a few days after the revolution occurred. It can be seen as a documentary. The film is centered on these two, it is not as common as the heroes, because the revolution comes from humans. Although the title was made from the military, but you realize that they were only "capitals" as the main character. Excellent color and light during the whole movie, the director is extraordinary for his first film, he does not fall in the best way. Show good emotions and emotions in the good people and the crowd. The character of Maya (Staple) has been well-formed and has a good explanation for Stefano Accorrior, capable of displaying Maya range, it is not a hero.
