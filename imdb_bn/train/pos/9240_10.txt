A videostore is available in this flick, it costs $ 2 to buy. The whole movie stinks really bad! The so-called colonel, if the cover can be credible, the hero here should be in his 80's, and only able to walk. Yet he managed to shoot some of the world's most cruel ninjas. Then the story leaves the colonel, which makes it difficult for the old people to do something remarkable, which now takes two horrible eighty-five boys, which can be a story. I lost a hundred times but I did not think that, because the movie is so bad, it is a real fun to watch. Zero-budget trash does not deserve that name of the actor. Check it out!
