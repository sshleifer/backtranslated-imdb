This movie is much better than the original jerk. I would highly recommend it to those who love quirky humor. We've included almost many lines from our movie of this time from Monty Python, as we have from Monty Python. <br /> <br /> Card games with hobos and then card games with Mr. Suicide. The scene at her distaste for dinner table and turtle soup. The original was the answer to the dancer's very dancer. Although I like Steve Martin, he was trying hard. Jerk is a spoof too and anyone will be happy. Zerak is your family friendly friend against the impairment of the original friend.
