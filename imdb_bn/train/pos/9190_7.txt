There are two incidents happening with Tony, seriously injured in an inspired coma: Tony leads a salesman's life to attend a business summit, when his family and friends go to hell trying to deal with the possible losses of big people. Dream sequences are out of the old Twilight Zone episode, because Tony transforms herself into an average win in a cross-country business trip trying to deal with a missing wallet and mixed-up detection. Like Blazer, his vowels and khaki-clad snacks are less than in Central America and fewer than Nuo Jos√©'s Italian Thugs. A nice touch. Suddenly, the long-haired, Hippie-Depp AJ (whose policy is called "Van Helsing" at one point), his comets have a great view with the old man. At the best moment, the older boys are trying to talk about life without Tony, which immediately broke into a regional conflict. Vito is going to stop a line about the new dead gene, probably a clasp case, which we are going to learn about Vito is interesting in light of it.
