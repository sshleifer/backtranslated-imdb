Robert Urich was a fine actor, and he is credible in this TV movie. I remember this film when I was 15 years old, and when I saw it the second time I had the same opinion. People will lose when entering this exclusive club on a computer-rich California city. Ureich tried to try what's wrong with his family, and I think the Halloween space suite, bright. This image is about a war of sprit. TV quality, big budget, New York gang I am surprised by the fact that Robert Urich has acted in many of his films. I hope so! 10 or 6 out of 7.
