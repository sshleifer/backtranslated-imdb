Prior to regular comments, I do not love my curiosity about the 94-minute IMDB schedule, and the 88-minute DVD from Wellspiring Media in the United States. Any input to this is appreciated! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Was going Instead of just a bigger chase, the film is playable and Spike behaves inappropriately like kids and is complicated by throwing her boom box like a teddy bear. Some viewers may dislike the story based on character Spike, but without the slightest frustration in the story, the film was very easy. Spike will look at the more stable character by referring to Hiton Spike's "big man" in contrast to the attitude and behavior of "children outside of control". Frankly, I was very excited about Spike's humorous acts, especially spray sniffing, but in a frustrating situation it is clear that some of their mentality will be temporarily changed. However, Hiten had to check things up until his head was on the road for a while. <br /> <br /> Kenny is a wonderful phenomenon as Glennan Hiton, and after a while I was wondering why he would like to make a hack because of GLANAN's excellent performance and choose Spike from the prison and continue to be friends. After all, there are many reasons during their run, which would be a good idea to save themselves for the sake of Hitakake Spike. I think Hiton felt like a protective brother to the speaker, and it was difficult to break the loyalty between the two - until things became very frustrating. <br /> <br /> While some cinemagraphs are actually artistic, rather men's shots run through the desert rather than the smell of stories. Beautiful landscapes, rains, and broad gray planes offer a low voice which feels sad conditions. The score is unusual, and the use of public image limited "Love Is This Is Not Love" and the title of the film is quite smart. <br /> <br /> Overall, if it is understood, you will not take care of it, it is not a good song because it focused on two opposite personality that is determined to run away from other people (a quiet, cool David Bradley Played by). This is not a big budget entertainment entertainment. Enjoying the rest of us for finding something short and dramatic, it's time spent expensive and it offers you some exciting moments that can make you breathe. <br /> <br /> I really like the movies that came out recently from Scotland, dog soldiers, and the Devils tattoos. I am also grateful for the subtitles given on this DVD because the accents are sometimes quick and difficult for some viewers like me. <br /> <br /> Frustrating, dark, and often intense, this love song is not a tragedy but story of the story. <br /> <br />
