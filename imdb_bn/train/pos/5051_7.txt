Most of Richard Attenborough's films as director, "Young Winston", "Gandhi", "Chaplin" are the biographies of major historical figures. "Gray Oil" is a biographical biography of a historical figure, but in this case, Attenborough's case is more obscure. <br /> <br /> Gray Gray was a Canadian writer of the 1920s and 1930s who propagated ideas about environmentalism and nature when these factors were less fashionable than today. He is widely believed to be an American Indian; The story he said about himself was born in Mexico to Scottish Father and Apache, and lived in Canada, where he was accepted as a member of Ozibwe tribe. He lived in a cabin with a lake in a remote part of the Canadian desert, where he earned living as a trapper. In 1935 and 1937, he twice traveled to Britain to spread his book and to give talks on conservation, and achieved great success, even in the Royal family. (One of these tours, teenager Attenborough, saw Gray Oil at the London Palladium Theater). After his death in 1938, it was revealed that he claimed that he was not; His real name was Archived Ballan, and he was born in the English sea-town of Hessings. <br /> <br /> The picture has gone a little bit away from the events of Gray Oil's life. In a scene in 1934, he said that he was 41 years old; In fact, he was born in 1888, so in that year there were 46 people. (46 Pierce Brosnan's age when the film was made, so I'm not sure why this change was made). Many incidents have narrowed down to the last four years of Gray Oil's life (1934-1938). During this time in the film, he met and married Gertud Bernard, whom he had said; In fact, he met Gartrude at the beginning of 1925 and got married. This film was also divorced in 1936 and shortly after his death, Gray Ole was married again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is done. Her supposed hype was used because of notoriety even because she was champion. Richard Attenborough, however, took a sympathetic view of his achievement. One of the themes searched by movie is ethnic identity questions. Though the former archived belon was not born as a Canadian Indian, he had no doubt that Ojibwe had deep knowledge of the culture and he spoke fluently in his language. Ozibwe accepted him as a member of his tribe. It appears to be ineffective that it is inappropriate to claim claimers of North American recognition to claim it because it chose rather than a motherland that she was born. <br /> <br /> Gray Oil's wife Gertrude was of Indian origin, but he came from a family that was rich in Canadian Canadian culture. Her marriage can be seen as her recovery in her family's main cultural heritage. She was clearly influenced by her husband, but had an influence on her, she persuaded her to leave her work as her lungs, because her moral objection was to kill animals for her animal. <br /> <br /> "Critical" as a critically-acclaimed film Pearson Brosnan heroes, a criticism that seems to have been thought of in the former concept that Brosnan can play James Bond model action heroes. But I think that the brochure could deliberately accept this role in avoiding the typedast, the quarterback backdoors, Gray Oil civil, the one that can get the most from the modern agent bond. While appearing in the original bond, Shan Connery, "The Hill" or "The Molly Maguyers", deliberately selected for the role of deliberately selected. Brojnan is actually very good in this role, although I would agree with those who became weak as Anti Gallipo Gertrude. <br /> <br /> I would not agree with another frequent voice criticism that the film is "annoying". Of course, it is not an action film like Bond, it is not an epic biology like "Mahatma" and it is likely to be one another It may be annoying for the prospective people, but, in the first days of the conservationist movement or in the philosophical influences of national and ethnic identity. The Canadian Forest View is also beautifully photographed. Richard Attenborough has served us a service that helps to revive this half-forgotten but impressive personality interest.
