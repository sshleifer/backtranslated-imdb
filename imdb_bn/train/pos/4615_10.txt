I think people are under the age of this incredible film. People are seeing this as a common horror film that stops us from getting scared and some sleep If you tried to do it would be 1/10, but I saw this photo some friends and we found it very entertaining and although it was a good movie like Stevebine Biton. That's why I think it deserves 10/10 for pure entertainment of this film. <br /> <br /> The general view of this movie is that it is a bad performance, a simple script that can produce 10 years old and it can not be taken seriously and because of this people are given fewer ratings. But I see it as a perfect entertainer ... it's a funny funny script that makes actors more entertaining and although it's not very serious, it's very entertaining.
