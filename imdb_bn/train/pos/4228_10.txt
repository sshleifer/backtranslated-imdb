A top notch Columbo from start to finish. I like interaction between Colombo and killer, Ruth Gordon. <br /> <br /> <br /> Like the Colombo fan, I can not remember another thing where he eventually did not set up the killer. In other episodes. This one, he is trying to determine the correct order of the box and the "fate" that the niece left behind, finally sank on it. <br /> <br /> The music of this episode is also good, it is much more than that.
