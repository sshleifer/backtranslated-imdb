This movie is great! It's my stone touching the cold heart. I could not tell about Antivan's experience of racial discrimination because I live in my own country. I think it is really difficult to discriminate. <br /> <br /> We saw this picture in our Sociology Department at New Era University, and I did not know that it was a true event, I thought it was created by an intellectual who wanted to bring a fresh air to the industry. It's very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The part that disappointed me was when Adovon was sexually assaulted (only six were). If I used to stay in his shoes, then I would have built a ten-storey high building. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He told him about the success that he got in the long years that he or she has not been bits, instead of being cut off. (I'll do that when I get the chance to trace my roots.)
