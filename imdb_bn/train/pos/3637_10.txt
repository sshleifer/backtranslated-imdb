It was really a great movie. I liked Dennis Quaid and the entire baseball team. J. Hern√°ndez is also very enjoyable for watching that is also very enjoyable actor. The chemistry team was fantastic at seeing things together, to demonstrate what it could achieve if combined with the only goal. This team has returned from the crisis, winning everything with multiple losing seasons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You can not do anything, but the root for this guy. It seems like somebody wants to do something, they're going to do it. Things fall into place and everything is clicked. <br /> <br /> Based on the real story, this film will actually make you feel "really impossible".
