So Mary and Rode are aged - who do not? Mary is a young man when I was premier, and when it left an air a "young adult". Yes, Mary and Rho were great to see together, and yes, perhaps the film could not survive the original series, but at a very long time it was quite appropriate to remember the soul of the series. Example: Producer recruits Mary and then points out the concept of a new series about "old man." Is not this ideal of the current Hollywood television and movie "Bein Counter"? This may not be the best show of Marie Tyler More - but it's a great great look in the best of 70s.
