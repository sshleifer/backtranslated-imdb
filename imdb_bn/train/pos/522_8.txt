Powell and Pressburbar are a great movie, whose work I now want to search more. This film is what we have realized real and real and how can be different from each other. Although beautifully shot and played, although David Niven does not seem to be 27 years old, his character is demanding. Fun to see a very young Richard Attenborough. This picture reminds me when I was watching it, and later on.
