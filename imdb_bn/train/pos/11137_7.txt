During the release in 1969, a mid-rating night cobbler created a big mistake. According to today's standards, it will be difficult to pull a R rating. John Voight, who was even better, was able to play his role as Joe Buck, in New York City, outside of the city, Hick to grow it in New York City. He met a seedy street hustler named Rizzo Street, who tries to make peace for his own purpose. A bond fraud that touches the end of the two and is unfortunate. Like Ratso, Dustin Hoffman only shines. Hoffman has often been brighter, but much more than this screenplay. That's so in the character so that all the others around him compare. One of the most ridiculous decisions of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, losing John Wayne to the academy award Director Schlesinger has a great hand in his production, but this glue sticky image, which gets a bad taste from the face of the viewer. Hoffman's performance is valuable for viewing alone.
