I bought this cheap from residue rental in our local stores. It was almost in mint condition, and I never heard of it before. There was clearly no one else. <br /> <br /> I can not believe my fate. Mandela Party is very moral and non-triumphalist attitude, undoubtedly - you go through the whole state of passion and try to get it a complex message. Despite its huge length (I had to see it in two meetings) - it was like a book that can not get down. Perhaps the song is not memorable, but the soul of the thing is burning forever. I do not understand any comment that a musical instrument (clearly designed for the stage) is not realistic! I have seen the "South Pacific" and read the book, and can guarantee that the musical instruments are not realistic compared to the book. I'll cloak this little until I wear it. One day they will do it again in a good budget. <br /> <br />
