This is one of the funnier movies I saw. It was a crude moment, but they were full of charm. It was a pleasure to see Altmanesque's screenplay, brilliant physical humor, and discouraged friendships, and a part of life can relate to most of us. And I can say with a measure of honesty that I was scared for Steve Carroll's nipple. I was really. Surprisingly, it is a good nature, undiscovered comedy which is basically about love, and many relationships we can find ourselves as well. Catherine Keiner was as horrible as Trish, and Steve Carroll's all friends were flawed but fun, and a lot of fun. They have a sunny metaphor for a young year-old virgin that doubts that Carroll was serial killer. But the simple truth he wanted to be the first love. Original, charming, and very fun. Highly recommended.
