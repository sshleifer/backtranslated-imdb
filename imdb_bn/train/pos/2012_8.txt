This is my favorite one of all time. Great music and some fun bits. I smile every time, pretend to be a dutant to her maid, keep her handsome hunky while chatting, and smoothly churn out furniture with her and chatting. I can never remember his French accent as a problem because they tried to stop him as a boss girl. <br /> <br /> This kind of singing of a teenage girl in the mail trim and very young Frank Sinatra. My mother saw Frank Sinatra at a theater outside this movie at the same time. She said she could not find "Bobby-Sosers" in the movies (that day you will not have to leave in the show). This movie shows you how interesting and interesting the young franc is and allows you to appreciate its original talent. And Victor Bourge gets a bit of his routine, which is a bonus. <br /> <br /> This is a sweet, easy story with a fun movie. Very enjoyable
