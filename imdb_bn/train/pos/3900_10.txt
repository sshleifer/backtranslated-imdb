The most hysterically funny show I've ever seen is this right at the top of my list. I smiled very much, I'm sure I missed half the joke. This is he showcased Izard as a brightly gifted comedian. Specifically, what I like is not to "spoil" the content for its audience. His time is faulty and the routine is combined as a piece of performance rather than a series of gags. Thumbs way up
