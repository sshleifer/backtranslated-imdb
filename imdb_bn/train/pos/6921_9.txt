Remember I am a fan of this genre but recently seen this movie for the first time. I have ignored it all the time, it's a surprise to me. This is a good film for me, then praised "Hi Noon". It's a great western with excellent acting and a great story. The DVD is beautifull black and white with outstanding cinematography. If you like Westerns or James Stewart, then do not miss this movie.
