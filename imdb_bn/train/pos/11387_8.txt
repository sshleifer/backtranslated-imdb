An amazing musical instrument about an American painter living in Paris for an American inspiration in Paris. She meets a wealthy woman, who praises her painting on the street and she believes that her work can be more popular to the public, e.g. A museum. Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly artist Jerry Mulligan both singing and especially dance is both perfect. She also met with the main daughter, Les Buauer (Leslie Carnon), who is involved with her best friend. She can not help her in this feeling for her daughter, even she finds out who she is involved with. Full of excellent romance and wonderful songs and dances, it is a very good musical film. It can draw a little with the continuation of her dance dreams, as Americans are American in the Paris Ballet, but there is a good happy ending. It won the best art direction-set decorations, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music, Musical Scoring, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay and Oscar for Best Picture, and was nominated for Best Vincent Minile and Best Movie. Film Editing, BAFTA was nominated for the Best Film from a Source, and won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy, and was nominated as the Best Director of Vincent Melleni (Lia's Dad).
