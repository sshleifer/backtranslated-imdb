I thought Christmas was a beautiful movie about how the hell was stolen. It was not awesome, it was cool, but it was enjoyable to see. I think Jim Carey has sometimes been a bit annoying. They thought Green was a special educator, when he wanted to do what was evil and horrible, but he still got annoyed. I was not inside the cave of the grin, when I felt visibility, and in some parts where I laugh, but most of the time I thought it was just boring. The film "SO" can be much better if they change the personality of the grin, and they include some more ridiculous scenes because most of the humor was not funny I like how Greenwich steals Christmas, but there is no excitement to see it.
