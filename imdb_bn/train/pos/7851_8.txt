The reason for the cameraman's revenge (fornication) or an animated version (which rendered Little Nemo in the film at the time of Winchester Mac), is an unusual short-cause, but it illustrates bugs for storytelling! Ladisla Strawych originally wanted to film the true bug in war, but they could not do it because of the camera because it got hurt by hot light, so he took the dead and used stop-motion techniques to apply the movement to his satisfaction. This little motorcycle does a good job of putting human features on small animals such as painting, filming, kissing, and dancing. Streewich also made Fragland (1922) and The Mascote (1933), but this would be his first significant work. If you are interested in mentioning this and other shorts, then check your local library for taking DVDs from Cameraman Revenge and other fantastic Tales from Image Entertainment.
