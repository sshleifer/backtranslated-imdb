Joel Schumacher created a hat in a choice when he decided to cast this on and on this script. The story was well-written and well-equipped, and the 10 or 12 central characters of this whole new cast were absolutely brilliant. It seems that there were 6 "Leeds" and about half a dozen fans, and so far the best part of the film about tomorrow, new young faces of tomorrow. Hollywood has touched the controversial Vietnam War Films, since it has been for a long time, which means "what the story needs to say" (as told by Schumacher) and in some of the high-end movie films, Tigreland says something about the land. Yet it can not be labeled as a war movie because it was considered more by Bushey and others than the human soul. I think that wants to see a good movie with a particular XX, but only good, varied plays should be seen in Tigerland, apparently Shumachers did the best in the last 8 years.
