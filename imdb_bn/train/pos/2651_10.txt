That's right. The movie is better than the book. I'm not mistaken, I love books. But the movie is just so much better. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duval are the best in this movie. (I did not see Scattin Crothers and apparently Danny Lloyd.) Some ideas used in this film are better than books. But I have already talked about my opinion on the mini series. But, I missed a few. The mini series is shot in a good position than the film where the shot is shot. And REDRUM is less than the scene book. So if you're looking for a great movie, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining Drink But counting on having nightmares for 3 weeks every night
