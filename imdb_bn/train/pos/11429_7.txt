This is an amazing movie for young people to show or show. Along with very brief nude scenes, it gives an interesting look at colonial rule in Africa that you rarely find in other movies. It carries a dorsal match outside of Africa, but without all romantic fluff. Cameroon's White French people are impressive, because they do not even consider the public as local people. White is all bosses and they expect black slavery without question. However, unlike the true servants, you once heard any white 'thank you' and no other respect is given to these people. Again and again, they are not considered even like the pets or slaves, human feelings. <br /> <br /> The central figure of this thought is the relationship between mother, Aami and its servant. Although sometimes they spend a lot of time together and it is quite normal for them that they can begin to have sexual feelings towards each other, white women never consider the prototypes or the existence of their feelings. A good example of this thought is that when he finishes his dress on it and it is clear that he is very sexual disappointment like this. Along with this relationship, almost all the White Americans deny that Africans are human, some verbal abuse behave like their behavior with abuse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> between the Proteus and the little girl (who has grown at the beginning and the end of the film). Although they are very close, sometimes they are like a game or a pet, and the girl can never play with the kids. <br /> <br /> There is a diverse white character, which can occasionally consider the black better. Unfortunately its character is very inconsistent and confusing. At one moment, he is working hard with blacks or eating with them (no other white will ever work) and later he is trying to beat the prototype! I could only encourage him - perhaps he was just blurred, or crazy, or perhaps a communist who tried to raise the blacks against White (who knows!). In fact, outside of some good scenes, this character has become much more spoiled. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the insight of this movie insight, I hope it was more than just a few snippets of this world through a child's perspective in a short period of his life. In the context of salvation of the country of colonialism and what has happened has never been restrained and the film likes me more. The film started in the early 1980's (as she was wearing a walkman-style headset), and when the movie went back, it seems that it was set in the 1960s (less or less), but there is no mention of it in the 1950's. Anti-colonial violence or freedom for the nation at the beginning of the decade. I guess some of this confusion may be that filmmakers have been disappointed and started at the beginning of the film (like in the 1970s) and in the early 1950's, this lady would think of returning to her life - before the experience of the country's political change. <br /> <br /> With the absence of missing context and time confusion as well as using the suggestions and theorem that showed him as an adult traveling in the country, it was a good idea. And I appreciate the completion, because it was nice when you could find out more about that wonderful person who had traveled to him. But overall, there seems to be something missing - there is no other solution or message except colonialism showing noisy and cruelty.
