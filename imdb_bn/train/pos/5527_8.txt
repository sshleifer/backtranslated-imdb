There is probably a special reason for Fox and The Child to hit a special note in my heart. Just say goodbye to my new grandma - oh ... one day - for unknown time, I felt a bit embarrassed about the different emotions and refrained from the bold face he wanted to see. <Br> <br /> I saw a few movies and TV shows, but I was lagging behind what I saw and I was shocked by what I saw. For that, I thank the movie. <br /> <br /> To be a lover of nature and already heard about this movie, I'm sure I'm going to like it. But I just did not like it, I like it. <br /> <br /> Technical expertise is surprising. How did they do it? How did they capture animals ?? It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story is a good one and the end when Oh so French and hesitant, it is a happy / sad one. Again, it caught me a little close watch. A man, who usually puts his own emotions on himself, will eventually see me on the full plane of hard people, for the next 15 hours! Perhaps I thought of what I left behind due to the end. <br /> <br /> But for a few hours of the plane, I'm happy to see something new and original. And that life. Of course, there are things you love and feel comfortable around ... but the great holds many mysteries abroad. So the next time I find something common in the open; I'm going to explore it, keeping it and hug it. What exactly happened in this movie and it's also exactly what you do with this valve movie / nature dock. 8/10 <br /> <br /> It is two months from PSS flight. We do not know when we will still see each other, but we will.
