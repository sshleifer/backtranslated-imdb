A great addition to anyone collecting. <br /> <br /> A monkey is a movie that you do not see every day. It has excellent actors to go with a wonderful story. It's not a normal role for Bruce Willis, but he played a role like John McClane. <br /> <br /> Virus kills all of the world and the story of hundreds of surviving stories is not new but the story is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This actor was awesome. Brad Pitt must be mentioned that the mental patient James Cole (Bruce) met in the mental hospital. He was laughable. <br /> <br /> Director of an annoying picture of a future managed by us. By a virus created by a man <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 10/10
