I saw this movie on TV. <br /> <br /> When I was young, I lost my father and this movie must have touched me. <br /> <br /> I can feel lost <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is given the opportunity to say goodbye .. <br /> <br /> And I have touched so much of the letter that it was written back to him .. <br /> <br /> It says that He's reading his father's letter, and asked him to answer Who has been sent back and bought him a gift <br /> <br /> The heavens no storefront, it's just me think .. the miracle exists ..
