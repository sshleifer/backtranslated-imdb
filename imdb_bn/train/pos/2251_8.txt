I received a very accurate review of this film by Alan Jacobs; But the chance to rent a DVD from Blockbuster was BewU's Computer, Motion Picture Archives James D'Ur. Then LDS prophet Haber J. Grant considers the film's deviation from the historical content for dramatic expression and telescoping events. For example, the film shows Joseph Smith during the trial. In spite of Brig Young's great commentary in defense of Joseph Smith, he was convicted in any way. Then Joseph was killed. Historically Joseph Smith has not been convicted of anything. While Brief was in Boston, Joseph Smith was arrested for this special trial. Both Joseph Smith and his brother Humu were killed before the trial.
