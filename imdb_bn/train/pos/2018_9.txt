I love so much that I bought DVDs and novels at the same time. Chemistry between the actor (with younger Arthur) is remarkable and thrilling. <br /> <br /> It could use a little more screen time for Frederick Lawrence (played by James Purefoy). And from the very beginning of Gilbert Markham's movie "It's Up" was amazing. <br /> <br /> I am thrilled by the amazing shock and surprises and surprises of Rupert Graves as Arthur Huntingdon. I worshiped him in the Foursite Sea, and the other that I saw him. But he threw himself here as Arthur. In my intelligent dream I could not have imagined playing a psychoanalytic psychology like Arthur Huntingdon. But he did. And I love it. And I love him.
