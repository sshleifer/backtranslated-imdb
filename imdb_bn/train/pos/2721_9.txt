A real story (held in Kansas in 1959) is a murder (Perry and Dick, two former criminals who enter a remote house on a rainy night and steal them and kill them). Richard Brooks has instructed the Capet's book to be cool and annoying for the reasons for making these children offense (What are they natural motherland?). Crime scenes are very barbaric and violent because of lack of ignorance and the reason we have seen it. Wonderful black and white paintings from Conrad Hall, excellent country- Sunny Music score, from Queen's Jones, outstanding performance in Robert Blake and Scott Wilson's two main roles and the first time in a movie is a tragic comment about the execution of the last moment before the death. . Jones, Hall and Brooks (nominated as director and adaptive player writer) nominated for Academy Award. Greatly operated and awesome, one of the best movies of this decade
