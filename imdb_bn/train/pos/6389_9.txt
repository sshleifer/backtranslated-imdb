Stone pass is certainly one of the best comedy independent films ever. You must have a sense of humor in order to fully enjoy this. For some reason this image did not receive its credit. First, the story line starts everybody looking for a better bowl. When a dead father leaves letters behind the hidden wealthy advice, then it combines only two families, but begins the courage of a cyclone. A Polish translator, a comatose mother, a crack-head with a terit syndrome, mixed with a hateful gay sex and a drag queen, does not merely encompass the world, but can make the family an enemy. My favorite character in this movie is to be addicted to the borrower / crack with the bourgeois syndrome, if you suddenly burst, you will cry and imitate for weeks.
