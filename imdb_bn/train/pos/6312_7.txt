George Clooney played together in this movie before Sam Rockwell was directed by his operated debut "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind". George Clonio was also involved with the film as a producer alongside Steven Soderberg, which shows that he really believed in the project. It is potentially a delicate and entertaining project, it is in line with film-remixes like "Ration of Anven" and "The Italian Job", but in any case this film has only succeeded, or at least it can be done as soon as possible. The characters of the film are all played by well-known actors, but shame is that the characters are not really given enough space to develop. Although they may turn into fun and enjoyable characters in their feasibility, they are now only gently entertaining such characters as the most playable sequence of movies. They did not really change what they played, even though they prevented their characters from being roughly boring or even boring, or something like that. <br /> <br /> It is of course due to the fact that the characters are not used in their full potential. I can only assume that the original Italian film "I'm Solitude Agony" works much better than this film. The film relies heavily on its simple story and the way in which the story is predicted. <br /> <br /> However, the movie is very fun to show very easily easily. This is a harmful little Caper movie, in which you simply should not worry a lot about the stories. "Welcome to Collinwood" on this topic is still a movie that works and only uses its purpose well. <br /> <br /> This is a movie which you do not regret after finishing it but it is also a movie you can really really do without really see it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
