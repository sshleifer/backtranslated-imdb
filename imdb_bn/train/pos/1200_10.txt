There is no illusion, it is a morality story. Granger is frustrated by the former Left Front hunter, the backbone tyler was once again tempted in plains. Granger looks at the end, and birds, Indians and lands themselves feel deeply for hunting. On the other hand, Taylor, confesses false quarry, or Indians 'lie with a woman' equates. Although the role of the torture hunter Grenzor is fantastic, it tails out Taylor, who stole shocking, anonymous, immoral 'universal' for quick money and happiness. There are not many bangs here, but the story moves fast along, and we are treated to acting a delicate character of Nolan. In the early 1800s, the theme of this story is as ruthless as today, as relationships with humans and relationships with it, and racism. When it was made, the censors shook their hanie during the scenes of 'Body House', Taylor's relationship with the scene and most of the conversation scenes. Though downbeat, it's really a great western picture.
