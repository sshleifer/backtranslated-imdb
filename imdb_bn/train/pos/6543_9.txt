I have always read the nancy druck and the books grew up. I like the effect used at the end of the movie (and a little earlier), where the line drawings in the book style are converted into a movie scene. It was a fair way to indicate the relationship between film and book situations. For example, scenes with oriental antiques traders were very memorable in many situations I think from the book. I thought Ned had been completely cast, and Emma Roberts was the 21st Century Nancy Drew explanation. (Just like the picture of Betty Krakor, it's time!)
