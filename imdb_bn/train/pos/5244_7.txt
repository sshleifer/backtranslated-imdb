"The Ladies Man" is a common problem in movies based on "Shady Night Live" skit. And that, usually a sketch of successful in five minutes will not be so good in ninety minutes. Although the film has a smile, like Team Midoose Leone Phelps, she has been sexist straight from the 70s, and Farele returned as a wrestling husband by Leon. So this movie is fun enough, but it is not "Owen's World"!
