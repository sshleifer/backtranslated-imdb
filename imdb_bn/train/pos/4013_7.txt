At the first scene, the curable eye patch, named Hawkeye, has a smooth forehead, but when she follows Johnny in Payello, she is shown with a stain on her beaten eye. In many variations of this small spaghetti Western, it adds a special odor instead of being Western, rather than being cut off from the picture. <br /> <br /> Another incident happens when Sanchez dies three. Companies need to test them for their identities - "You just can not imagine how many foes in our city". Immediately afterwards, Caradine (Lawrence Debinin) looks at collecting a donation more than a wanted poster. <br /> <br /> For the film's main Johnny Uma (Mark Dammon), he showed up with his holster Barroom brawl after shipping the gun belt with the following Carradine on his right and left hip across the movie. Johnny is bound for San Margo at the request of his uncle, but he has to take revenge for his death in the hands of deceitful wife Samantha (Rosalba Neri) and her congratulatory brother Pedro (Louis Vannar). It takes some time, but it's a fun journey among the best music scores of the record. For that salon battle, I got kick out from the impact of Kung Fu with each time a punch attached. <br /> <br /> Some more stories care for too much? For the first time after the conflict with Pedro, Joni broke the small amount of blood from her lips, which she led to wash the whole face of Pedro. Likewise, when Pedro has an ant on a pap after the film, he will not cut it, but as long as it does not, the face of Pepsi will be covered with blood. <br /> <br /> "Johnny Uma" is probably one of the best styles, it's not Clint Eastwood. As Johnny, Mark Dammon is a reasonably appropriate stand but outside the outside. Without a total bad guy, Carradine began to be the replacement for the compulsory Lee Van Cleef character. Initially, the identity exchange between Carina and Johnny is not understood, but as soon as the film is over, it all combines. You knew that each henchman would get wind due to its cause; There was a commitment to identify the time for each. <br /> <br /> If you are astonished, there is nothing to do with Nick Adams' character from the title protagonist's classic TV Western "The Bournle". In this movie, Johnny once received his name from Uma's gunfight. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most unique element in the story was involved in a matter which was associated with a little feudal, the string behind the whole scene. After the shooting of Kardin, Johnny retreated a speed before retaliation. Still alive, it seems that Carradine tries to miss him, but it does not take much time to track him in Dessert near Johnny and Sanchez, where he dies without water - Caradine targets his canteen.
