I hired this movie and saw it 20 times before returning the shop. Bill Packstown fares some first-rate talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Both power booths and Paxton provide good performance. 20 years ago the story was told interestingly with both flashbacks, then the spot at the present time, later and later This style of storytelling does not get dull that makes for a good thriller. Bill Paxton, create more horror movies, there's a genius for you!
