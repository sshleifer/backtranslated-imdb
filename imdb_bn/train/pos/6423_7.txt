This movie is a terrific non-stop laughter riot which includes all the normal elements of a Dawood Dhawan comedian - heroic heroes, buffoon supporting characters, dolls for the heroine, nasty villains, advertising cracks, screw soundtracks, and a small dimension of action. <br /> <br /> Both Amitabh Bachchan and Govinda play double role in police and conman. Amitabh's heroine Ramya Krishnan and Ravina are against police Govinda. Heroines is sheer rouge-smothered props as usual. Conmen has no heroine. Paresh Rawal carried out his outstanding law in the Doward Forward (he also played the same role as Dawood). Ashari plays a brief role. He starred in his famous "Angrezon K. Jamayen K Jailer" in Sholay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He made the Hindi Bihari style a ridiculous outcome Spoke with Amitabh Bachchan, believe or compare to him. But still AB fined. Madhuri Dixit makes herself a chemist like "Makhna". He dances like the wind. <br /> <br /> Wisju Shah's song is remarkable. Check out "Kisi Disco Main Joint", "Makhna" and title track. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not look for a LOGIC because it is a comedy and fully playable screenplay. Just enjoy yourself.
