Rock Star: INXS I've ever seen the best music TV series! The greatest rock n 'roll songs ever written by 15 very talented singers / actors were written. This (my opinion) was a real-hearted, well-felt, reality reality on TV. It really made tears of happiness for the winners !!! Visitors were informed in 13 weeks of this television competition and became familiar with the contestants. After a part of 30, the remaining contestants looked more like friends than some of the strangers in competition with one reality TV show against each other. And the INXS was, and still, the only one among the greatest rock n 'roll bands has added mental tension created by this wonderful reality series. If your series is not recorded, Rock Star: INXS DVD is a great option.
