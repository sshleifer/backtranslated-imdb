Be honest and say I did not see many independent films, but I thought it was done very well. Direction and cinematography were involved in confusion. Cones, settings, and lighting use successfully created the earth in the night, where the main character was stuck. Many scary and memorable images coming out of the movie have long been prolonged (always a good sign).
