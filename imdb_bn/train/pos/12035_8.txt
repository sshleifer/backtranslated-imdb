Recently on vacation in Florida when I threw this image in TNT ... (Hey there is a little down time in the hotel, okay?) I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart being the length of any feature film on TNT. I mean "drive me drive" is not it old, is not it? <br /> <br /> But I got stuck with him, and I was completely surprised. Melissa performs her role as an excellent psychologist Jennifer. Supporting cast (Nick, former lover Karen, his best friend and his life-control parent) all adds a great degree of credibility. Finally the fat girl was a beautiful bond of the story of the girl, who was always going one step ahead of each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> Check if you have a chance! <br /> <br />
