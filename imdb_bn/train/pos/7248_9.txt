When I saw the first 3,000 years of exile, I did not expect this movie. Although, I was thinking so it was not bad. Cast with the Italian version of Rodewarier, which is famous in Italy, including Ventinado Verneti. The story follows Elisa Brittany and Dardo Sanchetti who are responsible for the story of junk food. You can see other links to the Italian horror movie: Luca Ventini played Tommy role and you can see Mary Robins and Kaniabal as the role of Mary Bhair as the public of Neela City de Murati Viventi (dead city of AKA Gates city of the dead). With some modest parts, quite entertaining movies.
