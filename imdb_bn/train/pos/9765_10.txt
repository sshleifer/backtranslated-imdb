When I was released in CBS in 1979, I saw this shocking little movie. I do not know it was in a theater. To rate it from the children's point of view, I want to give 4 out of 5, because at that time it was a little girl because of being a little boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dilettante Tickles was a bit annoying with everyone, but you increased that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> When I rediscovered the blockbuster video in 1995, I had to reconsider it! I still liked it despite that it looked a bit "old". I do not know here another critic got the idea that it is not VHS. <br /> <br /> There it is. Even now the DVD can be, at least I hope it. I want to share with my kids one day! Here are 10 stars, it's still a great kids movie. (Last) <br /> <br /> 09/08/2009: Finally a VHS copy is available !! Hurry!
