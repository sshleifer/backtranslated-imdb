When I think of the return of the stubbornness, I think the epic. Yes what was echo there? They are an interesting link to the film (not to mention that they were able to accept a technically advanced army with primitive activities like Vietkong). In the rest of the film JD must be more bold. Emperor Palpitin (best portrayed by the amazing theater actor Ian McDermid) is the best part of the film. Palpatine looks so like Mr. Rogers than evil and wicked, Vader compared to him. According to Darth Vader, a wonderful ending of such a symbolic character. Vader really is the day of the modern Greek tragedy and I think people can understand and appreciate especially after the revenge of Sith. Finally he was on the way to his release and really brought you a happy but prudent feeling. The best part was of special effects. It is amazing that an eighty-century film can still stand for the test of time with its graphics. Jabbar Palace scenes (Liya looks amazing in a metal bikini) And of course, the battle of the three battles at the end of the epic is still stunning to see. A perfect ending of ZDI's deepest plot and emotional moments (primarily Luke Vader and Palpitin and when Luke Liey reveals the truth) and incredible special effects are the most favorite franchises in film history.
