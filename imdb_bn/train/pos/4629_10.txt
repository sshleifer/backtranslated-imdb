My father was a prison warden (now retired) in this documentary and I grew up around prison life, so perhaps my opinion would be completely different from everyone else by watching this movie. I would say, the filmmakers who brought this 93-minute miracle are superb artists and better people. They were brave enough A) Show and tell this story, b) Enter the hearts and hearts of these prisoners, and c) Do all of this responsibly. Responsible for their industry and, more importantly, the Luthier Lacket Correctional Complex's prisoners and employees are responsible. They should be appreciated without end for this work. 170 hours of footage, yes hours, and 93 minutes minutes are not great to cut and float and I have great respect for them. <br /> <br /> I saw this picture in such a situation that only a very, very few were able to see it. I was screened in captivity. I was in the same room with these men because they entered the screen in their hearts. I saw people weeping in front of me in front of me crying and told me, it was a very deep experience. In some cases these men have committed a terrible crime, yet they have found a way to try to free themselves, even if they think they are ineligible. How many of us have this courage? How many people have worked in such a harsh environment? I had an experience to show their reaction to the movie which I am forever grateful for, and I will never forget it. I thank my father for this glimpse of their life, thanking my father for making this possible, and I thank Philomath Films for giving time to pour blood, sweat, soul and tears in this project. <BR> <br /> This movie will change the way you feel about the life of the prison, and the prisoners in it will also change it. 'Oz' is not real, television is not real. 'Shakespeare's Back Bar'.
