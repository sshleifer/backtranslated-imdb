I am grateful to Caesar Montano and his crew, once again in the revival of Viayana film criticism. "Panaghoy" is expected to be a resurgent predecessor in this native language (which claims more speakers than Tagalog). Dialect and lifestyle descriptions are correctly remembered in this region of the Philippines. Downside: The corny and stilted act of American rival. The other item I did not realize was the lack of authenticity of the "time" dress of the same character and more than that, its bright red kit-car that I think was the 1930's for the streets. Without that small radioactive description, "Fifty" has become 9 out of 10 in my rating - Daigang Salamat, Manya Caesar! Addition: This picture has definitely hit Pic galaga's "Oro, Plata, Matera", which provided different views of visas during World War II. Alas, there are some parts where cinematography returns to Spielberg's "The Color Purple" and the story begins to be memorable for "Nelly May Tongy".
