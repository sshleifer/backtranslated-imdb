An incredible picture of "end of days". In some ways, it is better than "third kind of close encounters". (I like the Chess independent flicks for the big budget spectators.) Special effects are Chess, but that's a big part of fun. Jim Davies gives an excellent performance in this film. This is probably one of the best roles in the feature. Musical scores are very good. The story does not make sense. But it only makes all the more enthusiasm. One of the best works of the industry, "days are gone" is not afraid to be fine and unclear. "The day has ended" may be a low-budget indie film, but it is not as elaborate as it is "comparable" to Europe with the 50s and sixties European films. (Which was a lot less budget independent productions themselves.)
