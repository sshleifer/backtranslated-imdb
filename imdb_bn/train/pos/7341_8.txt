I enjoy the Ralph Bakhshi movies ("Wizards", "Cool World" and Undertined Animated "Ring of the Ring") and Frank Frazzita collectors and fans. I'm also a sword and magical fan who are Edgar Rice Burroughs and Robert E. Love Howard's world. <br /> <br /> I got the release of the "Fire and Ice" theater in 1983 and it is waiting for the video or some enthusiasm from then on. Therefore, the release of 2005 was a dream come true for me. However, I bought it with a bit of frightening, because I hope it will not be valuable to watch it and then the sand will be kept as a collection of "collectible" dust until the day of my death. Thankfully, my fear was terrible and I was fascinated with this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a diverse film with the French industry that has physicality and sexuality that is most commonly found in fantasy / sword and astronomical films. Without solid Chinese or dirty. Art is good and you see Fragitta glimpses at its best. Even my young boys love seeing it with me and want to see it again and again. However, my wife is a little objectionable due to the little princess (too Faratatta-Esquiera). I do not believe it because it is credible and has no sex scenes. <br /> <br /> Rot-scoping has been used, but personally I enjoy rot-scoping. It's hard to find in animation that gives more fluid and realistic movements in the characters. <br /> <br /> Despite some continuity problems, I recommend this picture to all Bakhshi, Frazzeta, Kanan, and Swords and Magic fans. Enjoy!
