I'm not lying, it's a great movie. I saw it in my local theater about 4 months ago. I saw it the second time, and I was somewhat slowly bored. Seed (slogan) is not all flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the film. Animation is outstanding, and the story has a touch ending. This is acceptable for kids of 10 kids, but thirteen probably find it a boring annoying. Also, the uniqueity in the characters is so interesting. I said, this is a pretty movie, but I will rate "Toy Story 2" or "Shake". 8/10
