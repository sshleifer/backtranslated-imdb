Go back to the ten page of this review section and back up your way. Proceed; I'll wait <br /> <br /> is over? Well, then you probably noticed the same trend. You can long-last for long jokes, date-time and definitely derivative plot points and 'bogas' chicks for a long time, but this movie seems to be one of the flickers 'now hate me and love me later'. <br /> The biggest problem of Bill / Ted was that appeals to the original 80 children who objected to themselves and considered themselves as fashionable.

Quantin Tarantino, someone?

So, all of you hate B & B for ... all of your screening tree, close your CD, get out of your hair, go to the beach and become lighter.
