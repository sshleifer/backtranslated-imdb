Laputa: The castle bombs in the sky. The message is more powerful and more pure, excellent and flying pirates as its new task, how it can be even better! The industry is absolutely amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused several times after that (I'm not sure whether I heard it for the first time) and expressed the most emotionally sensitive response of a movie soundtrack. The role of female leadership in this movie is absolutely remarkable and the boy, Paju is a big role model - he himself is on his own! The plot classic Miyazaki. I will not give it away, but the end is really great. I rank it as one of Miyazaki's three best novels and Spirit Away. You might also want to see it after moving out to the Moving Castle (a few years later, I hope) if you like Miyazaki, it can be easily found in the US. Enjoy, at Piper
