I have seen this a dozen times for years. I first saw B & W at the local PBS station at the age of fifteen. <br /> <br /> I bought a DVD set for children, and watching them. They do not teach school history, and explain the most important events of this 20th century. It extends their critical thinking. Unconsciously, everyone participating in their own language explains what they have done and why, details of the war and actual war details. <br /> <br /> Buy it for your children, including Allyster Cook's America. See it with them, and understand them. You will be so happy
