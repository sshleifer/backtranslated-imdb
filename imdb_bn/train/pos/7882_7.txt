"Ship Aho" was probably made to display the MGM genius. This movie is a fun journey to sea fishing on the way to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the country was involved in WWII. There was a general rental for this studio, which started public light light entertainment as a loss during the difficult time of the public living in the film. <br /> <br /> Beautiful Alan Powell saw the best of her music numbers. Where he clearly shows us he was counting with a dancer. Red Scalton is also seen straight from the jungle, because he is going to Puerto Rico, following the beautiful Miss Powell in the ship. Bert Lahar has a good chance as he was a weird man in the film. Virginia Gray is also seen as a funny girl, which is not fooled by anyone. <br /> <br /> There are a number of best songs included in Tommy Dresse and her orchestra, among which there are some wonderful solutions with the wonderful Body Rich, who has a great deal with Mr. Dorse and Mrs. Powell. A young Frank Sinitra also appeared as the lead singer of the band, it is supported by Pied Piper. <br /> <br /> This is a nostalgic trip that should be satisfied by the fans of this genre, which is fully controlled by MGM.
