One of the bloody films should be one, a transvestite in New York is killing people, and its answer will not be doubted by everyone. You can see how Brian Depalma can have some effects on the camera with the angle and stuff of Hitco. Michael Kain has played one of the most thought-provoking characters, and Angelina Dickinson is basically a distraught rich woman with a bad hair. Keith Gordon (who later starred in "Christine") is perhaps the most attractive character in the film. But you can not really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you can trust, whom you can not believe. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.
