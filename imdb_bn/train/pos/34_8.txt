What a fun movie! If you are a Gallo fan then Red Quinn Kills 7 Times is a real winner. In the beginning, it is difficult to make mistakes with the same Gialo Barbara Bucket and Marina Mulfi. Both are wonderful - especially the wide-eyed innocent Bouchet fears for his life as a criminal gentleman. The 7 Times in Red Queen Kilis offers serious amounts of blood, especially for the beautiful and most of the fans. The first murder comes in a rather unexpectedly and really gets a good starting movie off. The Killer, The Red Queen, is one of the most extreme and interesting looking killers I've seen in Italian movies. Set of 70's and fashion wonderful. Actually, all the scenes in the Red Queen running across Brazil during the night are interesting, one of my favorite moments in the movie. Holding my interest across the convoluted plot. Finally, I heard Bruno Nicolai's score from the musician. The main theme is so memorable that I can not get it out of my head for two days. <br /> <br /> I have two problems with Red Queen Kills at the end of 7 photos. First, the person responsible for murder is very easy to spot. If you have seen more than a couple of Gialli, you will not have any problem determining those behind the murder. Secondly, the end is slightly shaky and consequently, a little confusing. I'm not really one who needs every plot point made for me, but I'll be involved in losses to explain it. Watching a second might just be clear up to this.
