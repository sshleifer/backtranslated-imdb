William H. Messi is her sympathizer and is here as a hit-man and loving father, who wants to move away from family business without the anger of her parents. In the same region as TV's "The Sopranoans", in most cases, in the context of the middle-life crisis of a criminal theme (here also he had a brief inspection), but still interested in thanking for some guidance from Bromel. This guy points to the next), a nice script, and great performance around. Macy is always as nice as it is. Perhaps it's his best role from "Fargo". Donald Sutherland dominated his uncle's best as the father. Tracy Woolman gives the dramatic turn of a wonderful writing as the wife of Messi. Young David Dorfman is fantastic like Messi's bright and sensitive son (many of his lines are unwanted and surprising). Even Neve Campbell (I'm usually hating) is bound as a boring young girl caught by Messi's eyes. This is an expected but still strong climax and meaningful touch that is punctuated by a moving score and Christmas speed and leads to the next. This film was very well deserved to be released, because I think it will be connected to the audience.
