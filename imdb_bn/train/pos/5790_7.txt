How nice! I can say that if Elizabeth Montgomery is an enemy (he speaks Russian), then I'm surrendering now. In her short skirt, high-top boot and spoken bast line, she comes to sort of the eye shadow sort of her zombie and even if she is a real babe. This 30 minutes is the most sexiest in the series no doubt. Bronsoon with realistic and revealing wrestling match notes until he ungallantly churns his slugs on, ruining all the fun. All right, maybe I should stop responding to my hormone. <br /> <br /> It is very well produced half-hour by the underrated ball behind the success of the series. Naturally, the producers want to lead the third season with the upper average entry. It is the nuclear holocaust America (we know that he is part of the attacking force) and only 20 tons of realistic ruins, as well as American Brunson and Soviet Montgomery are left. They are flowing into a complete mood of destruction, we wonder how much time will take for biology politics, which finally ends, (Lucky Branson). And that's about it. There is no real conversation, which Bar√ßon is saying which is pretty overblown. Still, the script is still entertaining and brave for its time, even suggesting that all Russian women do not look like a truck driver (a popular silly war stereotype). <br /> <br /> Strange that rather than Slavic Bronze (Buchinski) American and shiny look Montgomery will be cast as slave. According to the appearance, it should be the opposite. My guess is that the makers do not want to throw American Americans without acting in a physically weak role. However, it may be, there is little to normal TZ scare or atmosphere, yet the episode is very, very watchable at 30 minutes.
