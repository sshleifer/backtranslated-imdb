I have seen it recently, but when it started, I had no idea what the idea was, what was the topic ......................... .................................................. ....................... It was a documentary, it was a comedy routine ..... well, it was both. <br /> <br /> It started a bit slowly, but I think because I had no idea about which type of program I was. Were watching. But it sucks me fast Among the episodes I saw, Robert Ullall has discussed history and imagination. Basically we can learn how (American) history is not true - and how we can learn what we have learned. He did this in order to be completely entertained and interested in the audience. I have actually learned some things and how it can be useful in this type of program is the real index. <br /> <br /> I want to highlight it as a series for HBO. I believe it can be fun and useful with various things - especially if they are "educated" in the same way as the episode.
