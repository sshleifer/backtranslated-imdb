I give ten in ten ten, it's one of the best movies. Seeing the whole picture is shocked, surprised and surprised, Jason Stuttam, Ray Litata and all the crew, amazing plot ... ... look at yourself and increase the courage to admit - it touched your soul, because it is weird You always have the answers you are looking for ... very good, Mr. Richie! Never very good Those people who were looking for a simple figtings and collision kept them frustrated. But nowadays Hollywood has mostly shallow movies, you have seen that you can not remember what the next day was. On the contrary, Revolver is unique, I could hardly expect that it is possible to illustrate a clear and gifted image that everyone will see. Absolutely unclear, surprising, surprising ... anyone can see this observation, I have no doubt. Actually, no words can express my respect ... I am still wondering how we can take pictures of how long the movie has been seen in the Hollywood Hollywood trash. Thank you from all the hearts, it's just the best.
