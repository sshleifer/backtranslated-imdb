I thought this movie was exciting since the beginning - like a movie like Spielberg - and this plot seems to be provocative because I tried to determine what the actual situation was. <br /> <br /> Start - before opening the first - the action begins, immediately bring the suspense. <br /> <br /> Two main characters are very desired. (Alex's extra-pedagogical, political activity caused much trouble for I liked any of Baldins, but William was not very bad in this movie.) <br /> <br /> There were many unexpected twists that enjoyed contributing. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in many places where there was a boring high pick sound in the soundtrack - something like 19K Hz. I suspect the video monitor is pick-up on the microphone set.
