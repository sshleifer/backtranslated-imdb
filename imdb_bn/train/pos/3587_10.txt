I really like this movie ... When I started watching it then I thought I would be very annoyed soon, but it made me wonder ... I thought it was a great movie and now it has been seen several times. The letter is trustworthy and I want to say that I again fell in love with Brian Austin Green (for the first time, Beverly Hills 90210 is for the first time). If you are a fan of it I would recommend this movie, but I agree with other comments I made earlier, that the last is frustrating. I used to like it a little different! Although does not seem to be good gripping stories.
