I saw all the films directed by Robert Redford and praised the American people and their love. A River Races At It In, the High Rocky Mountains of Redford Montana show romanticism and visual shock, as if he was a 19th century painter like Thomas Marn or Albert Bourstat. This film is visible by the author Norman Norman and Sarpreet Russellt (Surpr√©s Kisses, Regen Margot), and is very much loved by the word. <br /> <br /> <br /> Redford throw is perfect. Tom Scratch Rev. MacLean, whose education method includes fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blython, Mother, and his sons, Craig Shaffer and Brad Pitt created a family, with whom the interaction reflects the same problems. Growing teenage boys, and later, complex young people. Both Shaffere and Pitt are believable, who will gather the brothers for fishing and each other forever. It is a relationship between humans, fathers and sons, brothers and the world outside of their women, which is running across a river, a rock in the story which is missing in many Hollywood movies in recent years. <br /> These relationships are particularly important, however, Redford concentrates attention to the spoken language in the conversation. This is a literary script, beautiful and unforgettable for listening when combined with the Montana River and the mountains are unforgettable. The sound and setting equal to the performance by a cast that is grown from their material. Although the concept of fishing may seem like a strange device centering on a story, it is not so impossible at hand operated by Redford. Contributed by the component, Redford has an easy time and life interchangeable and reconsidered.
