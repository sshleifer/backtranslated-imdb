I was a little suspicious in watching this movie because fantasy movies are not always my cup tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I know that I was on a journey through a cinematic magic. Everything from the plot to the conversation was very perfect perfection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Claire Danes is as bright as the star of this movie. From the beginning to the end you fall further to love this character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Growing. <br /> <br /> Overall it was a movie that surprised me as a movie fan and was delighted. If you're looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that is fun for kids and adults, but the road to Stardust
