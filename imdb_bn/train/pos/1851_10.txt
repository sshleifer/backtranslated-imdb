This film was seen in Milwaukee, the 27th Annual National Association of WI's Black Journalist Conference in August, it was the first public screening The film is awesome !!! Hide Derek Look as excellent Antwone Fisher. These young actors have a very bright future. The original Anton Foster film has done a great job of writing and Danzel's directive is just right on the money. See it at the start weekend. You will not be disappointed.
