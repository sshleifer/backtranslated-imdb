This movie is a great documentation. It is followed by a unique way of returning gangster rap, ice cold, delicious flavors and tone deef, followed by Rap Group, NWH. Through problems with women, egos, police and white, this group Gangster rap gets the world's top, this movie goes up to the documentary. I know every favorite music is Spinal Tap, this is a very good reason, but I think if this is the right mood, this film is even better. <br /> <br /> I'm not a white guy, rap music, culture or anything else related to it, though I love this movie. Rusty Kundf, who wrote and played in the screenplay, has a lot of potential and it's a shame that I did not see her from the fear of Black Hat. However, I saw him more than once, and that is, I recommend you to fear a black hat for a quick smile. <br /> <br /> Remember, "do not shoot for you white! .... in their eyes .... do not see any white color. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Enjoy FYM and Movie.
