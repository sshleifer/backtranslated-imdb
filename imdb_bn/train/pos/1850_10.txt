This is my favorite movie ever I saw it at least 10 times and I cry every time. My family would not want to see me, so I can not cry. I think I love it that it is a true story written by true Antonovan that I love the movie. Acting top notch, and the actors were perfect for their role. Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actors. But this is my favorite movie he made so far. I took care of the little boy born in prison. She was the most valuable little boy ever met. He has now been taken by a wonderful family who fought for him for almost two years. Even though the war continued, I saw this movie and his future was uncertain and I am very happy that he is safe and loved. And I'm happy with Antoshon and found his family. <br /> <br /> I want to know more about her and how she got it after meeting her family. I just could not say enough good things about it !!
