Space Cobra was compelled to write a review because it got a good score of 7.3, but only a few reviews were particularly positive during the writing. A strange situation and hopefully my positive review will point to this old and mostly forgotten anime movie. Space Cobra is a smuggled and horrific story of the perpetrators associated with those three sisters of an old and dead planet and an evil force who wants to use the power of the planet. It is an old film and animation show, but it creates a lot of attraction with the lack of modern sophistication. Space Cobra is very much interested in Western audiences and is very easy to see. There are a few to look at and enjoy great for any reference to certain Japanese cultures and anime novices. Space Cobra is a bit diverse and preferred. I can not say about the English dub or the creator's motives, but it is one of the few Japanese comedy characters that I really like to think funny. The style with a fantastic soundtrack by Yello is very sixties of Barcelona. The style is colorful and fantastic and has constant action to move stories along the way. The strange aspect of this film is how it begins as a comedy and rarely ends in the dramatic note. I can not think of another animated movie or the general movie that has been able to work this stupid and firmly. You rarely have understood that this is happening, but it is so complete and seems perfectly natural. You really think the characters went on a journey and they were changed by the whole experience of life. Check out if you can
