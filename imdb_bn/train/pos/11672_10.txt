Nice pirate entertainment! There are all the good elements of a glance - An exploitative story of conspiracy, a flaming female pirate named Spitfire Stevens (Maureen Wahra), who has attracted the unexpected Mr. Hugh (Errol Flin), who is in a secret mission, his own <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Nautique, Mrs. McGregor, who played a supporting role as the patron of Princess Patma (Alice Kelly). <br /> <br /> Beautiful rockery, ships and gulf. In an interview with Maureen Ohhar in an interview with Maureen Ohahara, the clash of sword fighting, war ships, the Robin Hood in the shipboard, Robill Hood from the board ship, and I heard from Maureen Ohahar that he proud of Bellwip's great command and that Flinch could have been taken out of the war for that day, but there is no need to test it here. <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable movie.
