I did not see this movie in almost 5 years, but it still disappointed me. <br /> <br /> Asking about my favorite movies, I'm always going to mention first. There are some films (Art work like this movie, "Dark City" and "Breaking Waves"), which seems to touch a space between you, a place that is so safe and hidden and still sensitive, so that they give a living impression. On the audience, not like life-changing events, such as the end of a serious relationship or the death of a friend ... when I saw it, the film "smiled me". It lasted for several days that left me with a mental hangover.
