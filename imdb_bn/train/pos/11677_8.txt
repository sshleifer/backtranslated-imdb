I liked Long Way Round and I was not aware of Race-to-Dakar until I saw it on the shelf of my local supermarket. I bought it and after a little while, 'hmm it will be good' the first episode I decided that it was. Charlie Boorman was great as the other members of the crew. Great to see him again with Ian. The oath was neutral, but it did not bother me. It is not mentioned on their package. There is more to do with the absurd Excempt from the classification certificate that has BBFC. It should be given only for 15 languages. <br /> <br /> highly recommended series, I want more !!
