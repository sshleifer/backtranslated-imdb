I was waiting for this movie since I saw the trailer, it's like a political drama, my three favorite actors have played; Al Pasino, John Cusack, and Brigitte Fonda. And even though it was managed by Harold Baker, who did unfinished work, he and Posino had gathered in the SEA of love, which is in their best work. But some level interference (initially, most of the original trailer does not appear in the movie) and the change of tone (next trailers look like a thriller), it's time to watch, as far as possible nearby <br /> <br /> <br /> Very bad, because I really wanted to like this movie. There was a possibility of a film about how the government can be effective and how to make a critical statement against corruption despite the corruption here, normal guys are not bad guys vs. bad guys. And here's the good acting. Both passinas and couscass are very good, and Danny Isle also gave one of his career best performance. But Fonda has lost his role, he has nothing to do, and the central story has talent, when it becomes a thriller, the film lost its way, and came back briefly with the final scene between Cossack and Posino and then finally down. I want more of this, but do not want to.
