Fred Astaire and Giner Rogers are one of the best in the film. Great music by Irving Berlin Strong support from Randolph Scott, Harriet Nelson, Lucille Ball, Betty Grable, Frank Jens, and Astrad Allwyn. Let's go to myself, "" music music, "and" putting all my eggs in one basket. "The last song Astaire was playing a jazzy piano and then introduced by a beautiful dance with Rogers . Rogers also sing the song "Let Him Go" with Grable in backup singers. <br /> <br /> <br /> Harriet Nelson (Then Hilder) sang two excellent songs And Rogers played Mossie's sister. "Get Tha Bihind Me" is a song that has been bombshell with you for a few days. He is singing "But where are you?" Snappy and fast paced, this entry in the Astaire-Rogers series is even better. Classic and amazingly beautiful finishing, "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is the most familiar of their numbers. Rogers wears a huge dresses in the movie history .... He has a flexible growing number that revolves around his feet (weighing hem) and he sees little. pretty awesome. This number is rebuilt in Steve Martin and Bernard Peters of Pennies from Heaven. <br /> <br /> Randolph Scott seems like a peculiar choice of Astaire's flock but he appeared in his Roberta with Irene Dunne. Fortunately, he does not try to sing or dance. It seems that in 1936 there was a large part of the ball and ball, but they had a few scenes and had little effect. Allwyn has a big role but only okay. <br /> <br /> Rogers has the best single number in the series with his "Let's Uraiage C" .... Jazzie and Thumping, it's a great song. <BR> <br /> <br /> Enjoy the rest of the time when we get tired of "we've joined the Navy" for the third time.
