Due to his testing in the textile laboratory, there are problems in maintaining a job in Sydney Straat's various textile mills. Straton is using the formula for a new fabric that will create the ultimate fabric, which is never dirty, never worn, or will not wear. When Stratton finally created the fabric, he created enemies from all the textile workers (who lost their jobs) and owners (who would lose money by acquiring monopoly rights from one match), so in his white case, Straton became the most hunted man in England. The film is ideal and can only do Ealing. The performance of Guinness (and great supporters such as Greenwood, Thesgar, and Parker), and makes Maccrenic delight in the film, but the real hero story itself, the great mockery of business and industry, romance with additional elements of drama, and mystery.
