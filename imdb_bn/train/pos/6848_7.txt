A very silly film, it starts with a soft porn sequence, takes the initiative in the Farsial comedy in the Art Gallery, adding a twinkle of an invention to the hotel room and then killing a random for obvious reasons. What follows is strange and strange (especially the stopwatch scene is extremely irrational), an incentive "wrapping" ends in the end which is incompatible as visible to the viewer (see triangle section why it is deliberately inappropriate). <<br /> <br /> The movie is going to be invasive to as many groups as possible as possible - transsexuals, insane, and wonderful "hogi bears" - subway terrestrial stereoping - dealing with subway and sympathetic spectators is a fool, Explains in detail with each other and again over again what happened in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Well, works.
