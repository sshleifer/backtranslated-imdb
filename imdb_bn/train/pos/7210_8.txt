New York playwright Michael Kain (Sydney Browl) is 46 years old and quickly bursting; After opening the film, Mr. Keyen's last game flopped on Broadway. TV critics enjoy this fun in Kane, and he is drunk. Long Island runs out of the railroad in the corner of Monteauk, instead of his residence in East Hampton. Finally, while reaching home, Kenne was comforted by unfortunately heart-shaped patients (Dian Canon) (as maya). There, one of the former students of Kain and Miss Can Canon, a violent young Christopher Reeve (Clifford "Cliff" Anderson) discusses a new game called "Deathrot". The couple believes that Mr. Reeve's "Deathtrap" is the key to reviving Ken's career. <br /> <br /> "Is Trap set?" There will be a wicked funny trick. "<br /> <br /> The long-running Broadway hit of Ira Levin, directed by Sidney Lumet, does not travel far from its stage source, cast exotic and twists of the story are still engrossing. One thing that did not work (for me) The screen call was over; Of course, it played well on the stage. "DeathTrade" is a funny picture; The performance has died - but, on the heights, the greeting Rive laughs the kine at the East Hampton train station. The location is not actually East Hampton, but the ventilation and the pond are the same, and many ballyhooed love scenes are shockingly tepid. But, the game was so good, "Even a gifted director can not destroy it." And, Mr. Lumet is not frustrating. <br /> ******** DeathTrade (3/19/82) Sydney Lumet ~ Michael Kain, Christopher Riv, Diane Canon, Irene Worth
