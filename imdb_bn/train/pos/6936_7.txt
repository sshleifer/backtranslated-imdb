Winchester 73 received credits from many critics to return to the west after WWII. Director Anthony Man received great credit for his excellent side. Jimmy Stewart has done a great job, but I think Stephen McNally and John McIntyre have stolen this movie and stole it with two bad guys pictures. This is a good script with the same story going on in the same story. See the first look of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Over the years, thanks to God, we let Indians play themselves in western movies. The film is black and white and the shoots are shot in Arizona. I did not have Winchester 73 in StageCach, Hi Noon or Shane, but it got the above recommendation from me. <br /> <br />.
