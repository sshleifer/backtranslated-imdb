Four teenage girls in all corners of Los Angeles have had all kinds of problems: groups, drugs, police, mixed-up parents, older lover Jodie Foster, like Puck's mother's chicken, tries to keep everyone together "like a family" (like a family unit) and she can not do the heartwarming thing of the film. Gradually, everyone grows and goes away. That's the final plot point, though underscored across the whole, unfortunately is tampered with. Do we really need a long order to ride a cool car on his skateboard with Scott Sky? Or even a longer sequence - with Baio - where Foster has a weird soliloquy about "pain of illusion". Indeed, just a few loops of dialogue, and I did not take much care of editing late in the film, which was disturbed by the marriage from death. But it is nitpicks which is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a cruel bondage. And at the end Jody faces face face. The audience is molded to the end, the movie has achieved this. It does not ask for pander or sympathy for tears. This is an example of our friendship and we hope to understand. *** *** to ***
