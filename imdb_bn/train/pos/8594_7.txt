Sentinel I hope a movie and boy were just right. The first story from a novel, and I thought it was an original story, but I guess it was not and it was a very smart story. In this film Michael Douglas is very good and Satherland is too much, but it is very difficult to stop him from playing Jack Bauer for 24 years, but eventually you do and he is very different from the Sentinel for 24 years. Another person was trying to stop the role of their TV but failed. Eva Langaria He was not good in the film and the whole thing was behind him. I saw the movie when there was a constant dream about my Sentinel and I woke up. Overal Sentinel is a good movie and I'll recommend it.
