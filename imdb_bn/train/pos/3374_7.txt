"Swant Green" is one of the best and most annoying science fiction movies of the 70s, and today's trends are still very prominent. Although defective and short dated, the mysterious touch and environmental compound (for that period) still feel very uncomfortable and anxious. According to the quality level of this film, strong cast and in a number of sequences, I have been passing contemporary SF flicks considering contemporary classic. The New York of 2022 is a sad place to live, unemployment of populations, an unhealthy climate and the total lack of essential food products. The only form of available food is delivered by the artificial and the swalliant company. Charlton Haston (in a great way) acted in a police investigation into the murder of one of the best-known executive executives of the Soulant, and he blurred on Scandal and the dark secret mystery ... The script is sometimes slightly more sensitive and Climax really does not come as a big surprise, the atmosphere is still Very intense and weird The riot-order is truly awesome among the most deadly moments in 70 movies. Edward G. Robinson is a striking (but very modest) helpful role in his last role, finally appealing and for Joseph Cotton ("Baron Blood", "Hate Dr. Phibes"). This is my book Science-Fiction: A nightmare and inevitable fades for humanity! No fancy space ship with hairy monsters attacking our planes.
