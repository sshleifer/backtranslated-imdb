I'm not sure where these enthusiastic people are speaking here, perhaps some people want to disturb things. <br /> <br /> The film was certainly incomplete (disrespectful, there might be some difficulty with change in time, I was very much interested in going to actors everywhere, etc.) But IMHO was something that was made for defects More than <br /> <br /> First and foremost, I love the 'Break the Rule' bit. Naturally, when you leave the ghostly house, Badie lets you leave alone, to re-group you, get to friends, and find the mysterious type of tokens. Naturally (semi-explosive alert) when you hide behind the covers, they can see you only through that small opening. Naturally the demons suddenly became less obscure because you have found that they just misunderstood, or they were released, or whatever. <br /> <br /> Second, the production was extraordinary. Although the film was rarely influential-supernatural supernatural bits, but worked briefly very well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Freddie and Jason feel that the best film for them is not the best. Against them, they got their place), but those who have started the convention for honors are great and those who do not have problems with time distortion.
