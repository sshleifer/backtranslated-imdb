In Movie Retro magazine # 2, it has been published that Mark Lester's voice was actually dubbed by 20-year-old woman Cath Green. Although the title role in Least seemed to be perfect, director Carroll Red was not satisfied with his musical ability. The secret document published in the 2004 documentary "The Oliver! Later They Are Famous" was released in the UK documentary. Greene was paid 400 pounds for his work and agreed to keep his secret, like Mark Lester. They kept their word and released this information as part of the TV show for decades to release the film. For the record, Mark Lester retired from acting and practiced in England, osteopath.
