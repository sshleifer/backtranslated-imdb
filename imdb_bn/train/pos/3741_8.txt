The 1971 war drama in Louisiana followed basic training, and then followed a bunch of appointments before recruiting it through the proper screenplay of Vietnam in the Tigerland-American soil. It's two men - Boas (Colin Farell) and Paxton (Matthew Davis) ... how they meet, become friends and work with a changed squadron leader (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Borderline Psycho (Shea Wingham). br /> <br /> An amazingly non-commercial video directed by Joel Schumacher. She mostly used a handheld camera throughout the movie and used digital video for battle scenes. It works very well - the movie shows the reti (as it should) and uncomfortably realistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Farelll successfully covers his Irish brooge and a beautiful believer accepts the Southern Act. Her performance is just superb - she is a highly talented young man. Davis, unfortunately, is not that good. He is tall, muscular, very handsome - and very soft. But the rest are just great. <br /> <br /> This image was thrown in his studio. It was not a star, it was considered an old story and "just another movie of war". It just played one week in Boston! It's a good price to catch video or DVD. <br /> <br /> Also, Farrell and Davis have a long nude view.
