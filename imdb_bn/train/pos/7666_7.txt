At the fourth level, two magicians fight, one (Brian Thompson, trying to destroy the earth), the other (Jeffrey Combs as Ant√≥n Merrad) is trying to save it. "Doctor Morrad" is an enjoyable fantasy rental that offers lots of cheese. This plot is very stupid and completely absent, but the film is very small and entertaining. So if you have enough time to look at it, it's a look. My rating: 7 out of 10
