Evidently Ruggero Doodoto also came out that if his story reaches very seriously, his job will not work, so he decided to camp it. The result is a film that can be seen as a ridiculous sword-and-magic epic or very entertaining comedy! And I think I will go the second way. Small bull moments are well done, Paul Brothers openly mock the ingredients (they surround each other in one scene!), And Eva La Rue's charming, cheerful, beautiful nature is like a girl who tags with "boys" Plus, where can you see a dragon's insight enlightened by a disco ??
