Well, I saw "they all laughed" when it came out <br /> <br /> Around 1982 and it was a vague but favorite reminder. About 20 years later, I saw this again in tape ... I have a sincere pity for his characters, and there is a kind of sympathy that is not difficult to feel. Nice comedians and actors, all good lines and pretty good edits for everyone, and so on. I laugh and smile all the time. Just like we all are, at all. Get it done.
