John Travolta, the world's biggest Hanquetkon, and a mechanical calf ... What more could you ask! Yes, you probably will not get this many surprises or deeper money. Yet, I've always found it fairly enjoyable to see this redneck romance. Bud (Travolta) and CC (Debra Winger) meet Gilly and fall in love. They have all the difficulties you can expect to have a harddisk redneck couple. Honkeytonk scene is fun, riding mechanical bulls, and-of course-fun with the necessary brawls. It's a good, 1980's soundtrack, among which my favorite Jimmy Buffett's "The Devil Watt Down on the Rathless Place", "The Devil Winter to Georgia" and "Hello Texas". Break your cowboy boots out and have a boot-scoutin 'Boogie! <br /> <br /> *** (out 4)
