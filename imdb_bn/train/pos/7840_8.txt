Buane To Buzzi is a real 'quest' - Although Rock Fan for almost 30 years, I only watched this movie a few days ago and rated it among the top rock films of all time; The music's awesome (T Rex's cream) and the scenery are constantly exciting and unusual, and this viewer has been looking forward to the Ringle Star's more pre-determined effort, who has done a fine job here. If you love the song then you'll be in T. Rextasy, because Mark Bowl really is the piece, front and center star. Even repeating some songs is not something important: different places, costumes, musical instruments, and diverse visual concepts are used to provide different textures and lots of ridiculous humor which is simply "a concert film on the other hand. As rich as sister-to-chest and full packed, the film is about an hour long, but fully satisfying. There's only one criticism - the video package is something 71 minutes long and at least one online source claims this picture is 67 minutes, but apparently it's more than 61 minutes of interesting fun.
