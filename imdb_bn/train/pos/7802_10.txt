When I saw the first in 1983 or 1984 I was electric. Steven Biko has gone half way through the film but his courage and knowledge resonance is not forgotten. Finally, when I was in South Africa in 1993. It is basically a story about friendship and loyalty. When I was in South Africa and I was telling the audience to dance in the dance drama 'Cycling' Iphika, my hair was standing at the end of it. There is a lot to learn from this story for all the people.
