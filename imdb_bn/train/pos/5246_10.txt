This movie is a player's mind experience, 10 worthy of the best works of the world around the world. Although I think the world is morally boring, the film best describes the story's conversation and it accepts us through an experience that we could never otherwise tolerate. Tim Meadow has so strongly portrayed Leone Phelps, and this story brings me to Leone's reckless world, at the moment I forgot that I saw a parody of the fountain world and was forced to rebel against it. Here the film's prediction is false, because in his story, his great and brave achievement comes to the value of his success. It is understood that a large number of filmmakers will only react to the story of this film and will reject this story, I will misunderstand them and acknowledge that I like it. I just do not like the misunderstanding of his boyfriend, not only for his tragic figure of sex drive but also for his brave courage to find the shadow of discrimination. Plus, it's just fun.
