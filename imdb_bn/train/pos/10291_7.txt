After slowly starting, Bruce Almighty was a very interesting picture which said something positive. It was not among Jim Carrick's best performance, but he was still right. Morgan Freeman was just as God. Jennifer Aniston had some good moments. I miss Steve Corel "I see every day!" <br /> <br /> I like the director of films like Tom Sadid. He was also Leir Leer, Patch Adams, and Nutty Professor. Among those three and Bruce Almighty, he has taken a great comedy star and describes a human story with him. A director who knows the comedy, can get the talent that he gets, and it can tell a meaningful and intelligent story. It's hard to find <br /> <br /> My biggest complaint is that they could use more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest portions of the whole movie. I suppose that the first few of the screenplays of drafts were mentioned in the Bible, but the producers were afraid to insult the people. This is very bad because I thought it was a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> My grade: <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 7
