At the end of the 20th century I saw this picture. I still remember the film specially, especially Robert Taylor's performance. I always believed that Taylor had been cast as an actor because most critics viewed him as kind of hard, almost incomparable leading people, and women just loved watching movies because of his looks. However, this movie has proven that he can be an interesting actor. During his long career, he did not play a significant role. This is his best performance. He is completely credible in a genuine villainous role. From what I read, he was a very hard working and simple man in real life and did not fight enough for such roles. He will do only what MGM gave him. This picture proves that he could manage more and more difficult roles. The other thing I think about this picture is how annoying the character of Lloyd Nolan is. Nalan was a great actor, but this character really excited me. The last scene of the film has been stuck with me for all these years. This film is definitely worth a look.
