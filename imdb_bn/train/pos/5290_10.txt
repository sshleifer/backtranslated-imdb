John Waters (Happy Birthday, John!) That's going to deliberately go away from the things that are being made, it's the parody of celebrity / art world. Edward Furlong played the title character, an employee of Baltimore-teenage girl who loves to take pictures. When New York's agent (Lily Taylor) discovers her work, she gives her a big break, which she accepts. But once he has hit big, he has to reconsider everything. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> We can expect something that can be sure, but with Waters' instructions, there is always something we have to surprise ourselves (you know them only when you see them). I certainly recommend it. Also starring Kristina Richie, Mink Chor and Patty Harst.
