It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And it's always the perfect B-adventure with cast like Castro, Christopher Lee and John-Rice Davis. It's actually a fantastic fun, swashbuckling adventure that captures your interest, even with its flaws. It will sometimes be felt as the biggest movie for people to create. Even it is made in the 90's but it does not have a modern feel. It was an old Errol Flynn movie that has more similar feelings. Big Adventure movies are big things in Hollywood but I am afraid their feelings will not be the same as old movies. On the other hand, there are only real feelings. You just can not hate it. I have an Adventure movie right there. And I really love soundtracks. Well, I like theme songs.
