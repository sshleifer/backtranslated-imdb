Well, it can be the most fun movie of all time, and Sandy gives a tour-de-force performance! Well, his career never ended, but - in the end he will always be remembered for his first three pictures: "The King of Comedy", "Dallas Dale", and "I'm nothing but you". He created bitter and ridiculous criticism of popular culture in America among Diana Ross's personality from New York socialite. Sexy and deadly, flexible and sensual, philosophical and annoying, she convinces the audience in every scene, and she is actually "really beautiful". Check out this one (if you are not from Iowa), you definitely enjoy it !!
