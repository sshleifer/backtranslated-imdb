As an adult I really enjoy this one. I saw it with my two grandchildren and were impressed by 3 1/2 years old and giggle in the 15 month old mouse. <br /> <br /> The music is funny and the animation is amazing. Do not do this sequel back to Neverland. Cinderella is a good follow up story; But what happens to Drusilla? Another series? I hope so!
