This movie is very embarrassing to get you to the US. I found it through a rare video dealer, and it was definitely worth it. It is without any doubt, the best film in the pre-code era and the best film of 1930's best film. Brain director director Frank Borezz created amazing films about depression, and with the castle of humans, he created a fairy tale in the era of trouble. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Loretta Young and Spencer Tracy There is a great chemistry between. Make this movie a wonderful romance. Young tina of sweet and hopeful, when the tracy bill abolished and closed. Dynamism is one of the most difficult in character, but it creates one of the last fruitful relationships of the film. <br /> <br /> I saw Manle Castle as the most sophisticated pre-coded movie. In Borges Scholar's village, Bill and Trina use dangerous and dreamy techniques to live in the palace. Depression problems are not ignored, they are actually integral to the film. But Boreges portrays the film as a craftsmanship of a soft focus fairy tale, making the situation less stringent in love. It makes the film warm and loving. <br /> <br /> The main success of the Man of the Post Pre-Code era. If only more people can see it.
