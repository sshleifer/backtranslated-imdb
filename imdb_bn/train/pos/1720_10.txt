This early biography was a watch to watch briefly. One of the second disc disks. Griffith's "Discover Year" DVD set (highly recommended) It combines three extraordinary performances by major leads and Henry B. Walthall (The Little Colonel, a nation born) is a Countess the Evil (and other things) as a campi singer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is incredible that they could not get the wall, but hey, the wine might probably do something with it. Here Mr. Johnson (father of silent player Raymond Hackett) germs wildly and joins melody, but unexpectedly ridiculous. The best moment comes at the end. The lady came out of shock and fear, once she realized that she had condemned, Henry raised her machine and "fans" on her. He was so unexpected and strange as he did it, and I lost it, and laughed my head. Face in his face! From that moment I was Henry B. Walthall was impressive.
