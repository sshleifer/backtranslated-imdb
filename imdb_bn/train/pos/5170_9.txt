I hired this movie while coming out of the video tapes and really enjoyed it. I got the opportunity to buy it in DVD a few weeks ago and since then I have seen it several times since. I have to agree with others when the Indian summer atheist said it. When I see it, I can again be 10-14. I think that why we all love movies. We all often wish that we can revive our lives like mature children with knowledge / knowledge. Do not all your friends / dad want to be young again? Do not worry about your work, a parent etc ... I know that I want to enter De Laaurian and want to go back again. Although I've always enjoyed watching my favorite camping film though Bill Murray has meatballs. I wish they could make an Indian Summer version.
