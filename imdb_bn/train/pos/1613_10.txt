This movie is still a favorite time. Just a proactive, ridiculous moron will not enjoy this wonderful film. This movie is like a part of the hot apple pie topped with French vanilla ice cream! I think this is Cher's best job ever and its most credible performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks, and a flexible thin figure. You do not want to sing her or - Who sounds like Cher? The park has definitely made its mark in the entertainment industry and will be considered long after others have come and gone. He is one of the most unique artists there. It's funny, because you could recognize Chery so naturally as a gifted actress? She heads up the so-called "stars" today. Chair considers Davira Winger, Alfred Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Baset and others to be the real actress of the same level, which he does not think of "acting", he really believes the real character. There is more to her than her colleagues and the filmmaker's respect for the ongoing public. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will never be tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the scene where everyone is sitting around the diner table in the house every day, I gave a break to see how Ramadan can see delicious food every day. Serving I've seen spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can not figure out whether they are eating Ravioli, win? What is that main course? It looks wonderful and it's driving my nuts! <br /> <br /> Everyone in the family was a hard worker and they respected and respected each other. The grandfather did not have to push and bear on one side, he was an important part of the family and he is revered and respected for his age and wisdom. He feels that he became a very healthy, independent old codger. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was "not a housewife", she was the glue that kept the family together and should be the wife, mother, and home manager. He was proud of the way he chose, but he did not have to define who he was. Highly-traded businessmen are not as comfortable as their skin, as was Rose Castrini. She said, "I was not a child at 37 years old." It's not finished You understood that he was a young girl who was pleased and could not understand what happened to another person. She was charming, quickly witted, and very smart. What a great mother <br /> <br /> I really did not like Loretta because he had something to know - it was not really brave and others thought that if he wanted to keep himself under control. . He can tell about himself and where he went wrong, but he did not apply his general knowledge of life. He was going to marry a middle-aged uncle's son because he wanted ideas about the identity and motive of a husband and his life. She was more prevalent than her own mother. He was dressed in a home wearing a matron and wore hair and humorated and bored, but then you felt that he was weak and lonely and loved the right people for much love. She probably would like to finish making an awesome mother. <br /> <br /> I can see in the future, Loretta and Ranio loudly scream a happy family, and Rose and Cosmo enjoy every minute.
