"Earth" was released during the celebration of Earth Day Disney. While not far from any provocative message of sadness and disaster, we do not feel very bad about ourselves, we deal with some nice footage of their habitats. <br /> <br /> They are elephants, smokers, beer and a whale and a calf family. The North Pole starts and reaches the south until we can reach the tropics, it is always introduced to the compressors of various climatic zones. <br /> <br /> Global warming is mentioned when we see pole vibration carrying; The notes are composed of shrinking sea ice islands in recent years. We never see that the bears hold a seal, but frustrating searches for the father's food make him a dangerous solution. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is enough to reward and reward the value of admission to see them on another Big Screen of Wildfowl Migration. <br /> <br /> I was one of those disappointed that the great white shark taking the ocean is imprinted cracked shots slow motion. You do not get the idea of ​​one characteristic of wild animals; Their incredible speed I think the idea of ​​reducing the film to express great speed (or at least this is the first one I remember) is the television show "Kung Fu" in the first 17 days. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the cinematographic techniques employed as credit rolls are then expressed in some protests. This movie has enough dramatic, ridiculous and educational moments to make it a tough choice for nature buffs. Perhaps due to some electoral editing (our hunting, as the end of the scary end of the shoot) and this footage was released in 2007 and it was available on DVD, this is a correct film. . And you can take your kids! <br /> <br /> Three stars.
