Everybody likes a young man named the court. His painful bloody death came to all. You can find other symbols and emotions throughout the movie. Whether or not predictable, and regardless of religious beliefs, it is a moving story, full of milieu and sexuality. <br /> <br /> Another thing, someone mentions that his fate was so fast that it does not seem to be effective. But for this the material is set up subtly. Note what her mother said about bringing her lunch to the field. Note how he is holding steering wheel and his gloves. She is operating in sweaty and dangerous equipment. These days, tractors are quite dangerous.
