One of the best movies I've ever seen about these serial killers should be one, and it's coming from someone who absolutely likes the chin silence. HBO hit the jackpot here This image is forced from the very first moment until the last moment. <br /> <br /> This movie has so many underlying themes that it is difficult to know exactly what to do. It is the long history of the history of the Russian serial killer Andrea Chicatillo. Stephen Rira gives a brilliantly preserved performance as an inexperienced forensic expert in charge of the investigation, and Donald Sotherland gives more involved work as his disciplinarian and gives the Russian government the only person willing to help him. The fine performance of both of them --- Rhea begins to be naive and unwilling to compromise, when Sutherland starts isolated and amused almost by the situation. At the end, Rhea becomes tired and dead around the world, while Sutherland considers herself to be more passionate and idealistic. <br /> <br /> In any other movie I used to say that the performance of Sterland stood out of rest, but here even the serial killer is competing by Jeffrey DuMann himself. DuMann has brilliantly created a character that inspires sympathy rather than hate, we think that he will get - he is a monster, but he does not want to be, and we have got the idea that he is as hateful as he is. He is tortured, ashamed, but as well as evil. <br /> <br /> If you can take the incredible dark thing (and it's * very annoying), you will see this movie.
