At first, this movie looks so bad that I often saw it when I saw it. It was like a bad dream. A cosmic bore. But this is the second opportunity, then another, etc. ... I finally got the addiction of this movie, it's a dream of a slow, dynamic, wonderful natural set, a gentle autumn light and especially musical score, which is about 70's progressive rock and actors The singer / song created by the writer is a fine folk song. Derek Lamb (The Troubadódo). Remember the hedgehog wood, silver trout, and lady's disappearance in the air ..., in the middle and at the end of the film. Initially, there are some spiritual scenes, wich Elizabeth Shuojuki's natural character is appreciated. If this film was made by some "guides" director like Bergman, Lars von Tears or Jean-Luc Godard, critics would swell on the movie like this movie. There was a cosmic masterpiece. I personally think this image is one million times higher Fellini's shy sh # ¤ @ Certainly not for atrocities.
