What a delightful romp ?? There is a lot of romantic comedy lacking a very skillful movie which is a lot of attraction and a feeling of reason. Einstein brilliantly played by Walter Matthew, and Catherine of Meg Ryan is unforgettable? Against Tom Hans, I saw him in the pictures ?? The young man is struggling to be recognized as a mathematician. <br /> <br /> To understand Catherine's struggles, you do not have to be a young girl and should be sympathetic to her immediately, and understand as a young man who must have followed true love through Ed's (Tim Robbins). These emotions have universal appeal, even if IQ. It all stays light, fun and nicely. <br /> <br /> Of course this is not heavy, but if you see there are some symptoms. People think Albert Einstein as a scientist yet he was a great spiritual; His opinion, as if with some lines, 'If this is not impossible, why?' He recommends a believer to meet the high goals beyond his immediate perception. Is there any accident in this movie really questioned? For example, in the context of Albert and his sudden Sidekick's Catherine of Catherine, Kathryn strengthens-high-lips, unloved James (Stephen Frei gives life to this cardboard character and you can not feel the feeling of his feelings but can not feel his feelings). How many interventions do we see in our lives, and they seem to be streamlined? <br /> <br /> And of course, we want to think in real life, which we often keep track of people, we must learn how to define how Catherine of Edwards and James have to defuse ice water in their veins. How excruciating (and annoying, especially Caucasian) IQ is, how wonderful it works in Eisenhwar-era beliefs. How wonderful it is to know.
