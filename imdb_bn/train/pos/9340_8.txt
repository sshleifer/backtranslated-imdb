** Possible Spyler *** Adam Sandler is typical of comedian typestust, but in "Rhine", it provides a steady running performance. Although in September 111212, people who showed courage in front of the poster, Sandler Finnmann, who is a lonely and "lost in his own world". Johnson (Chadell), a practicing dentist, faces the friend of his old college (Sandler) and wants to catch the "old bar". We see, such as Rain Man (Dustin Hoffman), Feynman is also recalled in psychological and exciting situations. Old music seems to be comfortable for him and "psychological" crutch. <br /> <br /> Johnson, looking at Feynman, has some happiness and easily missing family. He also feels unhappy and unhappy with his job. Similarly, he wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social "cracks". I have a different view of this movie and compassion for the more sympathetic families.
