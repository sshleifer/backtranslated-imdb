This is one of the strangers in the Zodiaca series because of playing this extraordinary pacing and Aichi film. Interestingly, this is the first Jatocichi film made by the new production company of Cantor Kato. Now, instead of just playing blind tones, Katu is in charge of making films. It can easily explain why this film style seems so different among the last 15 films. As far as Ichia's role is, the film is very different because he is not as usual in the film. He is a fool too easy, and actually, for a little while, instead of helping people, they can do much harm! <br /> <br /> "Jatoyi Rewaburi" was started by Ichi, an elderly lady who tried to take advantage of her blindness. Surprisingly, in this view, Ichi said that she has been blind since a strong, although in the previous film she set her blindness when she was 8. It was a minor mistake, and only set a crazy fan like herself. <Br /> <br /> This film takes place at least six months on a certain time and can take a year more - so you can see what I said about seamless footprint. Most of the films in the series are held in a few days or weeks. Ichi is not a town in which there is a boss (Asagoro) who is very difficult to try, because he knows the fame of the blind man. The boss is quite charming and surprisingly Ivy is completely taken by evil people. At the same time, he met another boss (Shushui) - a poor guru Shushui advises people to abandon all violence and even Ichi falls under her education - for many months she will release her fruits. Shushui's teaching is very similar to the teaching of Dawood to China - as it is for the sake of nonviolence and life (for good or for bad). <br /> Leave all of this city was just thinking after all>> month <br, Ichi could know as soon as she left Asagoro showed her true colors - being enslaved to women, being poor oppression and all-round jerk. In this case, Ichi is responsible for this, he helped Asagoro and is counted as a friend. Now, Asagoro has caught Shushui and many innocent people have killed themselves because of the barbarous act of the boss. <br /> <br /> When IKE comes back, he does not automatically recognize that Asagoro is good or bad but he cleverly examines him. This bite with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale, where else, the Ichi kills baddies and Shushui is free. This last was very good and the rain happened. Then the final scene with Asagoro and stone is a baby chestnut according to the title of today's special effect, although the head is great. <br /> <br /> While doing pluses for the film that is weak formatted, it is different and can not be wrong for the previous 15 (which often seems to be similar). In addition, it ends very well. Minuses (from stepping apart) include that for some that Ichi disliked seeing so fallible and that the scene with Ichi and other blind men included flick for comic relief fall ... very very, very flat. They are sticky and weird ... it's that flat sort.
