I can not tell you all you love this movie. I have read the reviews "very confusing" or "swimming in dry concrete". I have no idea what these critics have! Anyone who loves fantasy fiction, this movie is for you. If you ever like to play Dangies and Dragon ... this movie is for you, (especially if you go to oriental adventures) I'm sorry I did not see this movie on the big screen. (More encouraged to get my own big screen TV :-)
