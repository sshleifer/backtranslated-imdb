There are no messages. No symbol. No dark undercurrents Just a nice wonderful music, nostalgia and good fun people who had a great time could be done by it. This is a fresh antidote to some of the harmful garbage produced by the studio. Certainly impossible to obscure some observers with Judy Dench. And a bonus of singing the bright jazz of Cleo Line. This lady is in the same league as late ala. It is necessary for a warm experience and an impressive good nature of chocolate at any time outside of my movie shelf. Just a wonderful film!
