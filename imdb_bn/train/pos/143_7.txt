Riget II is a good seagull, but the first is not as good as well. This series does not seem to be as serious as the first one. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mrs. Drusse is almost done to leave the hospital, as her job is done, but the fate is like it otherwise. He is now chasing the ghosts and helm everyone's madness and will soon become very bad, because the black forces in the state have spread. <br /> <br /> This story is more comedy than ever before. All the fun in many ways, but it makes the series a little less serious. Many elements have been kept from the last series of stories and some new ones have been added. This is good writing, but some new stuff is simply stupid, but they save it as a comedy. Good story, but the original as the first series is not real and thrilling. <br /> <br /> Actors are similar with regular throwing. They're all very good. It's a weird story and setting. In some parts, the total fuq shows and characters change during the show so that it can be serious and keeping it real is not easy task. Nevertheless, this actor fully governs this whole situation. <br /> <br /> Most of the good qualities in the first series are kept intact. Cinematography is one of those qualities. Triare World's famous tool camera gives the series the mystery and the reality. It gives the camera a unique ability to move and follow letters and Trier uses these capabilities. Good, movement, great lightning and good composition and editing can be seen in this enjoyable way. <br /> <br /> Get ready to see the best effect on this signal. Also ready to see some more. I do not think the green thing looked all too well. Worried that it was unreasonable and not suitable. Never less, the effects like Scratch are really good. The non-digital effect looks very good. The younger brother just looks really weird, but you take it. I want to say good throughout life, all right. <br /> <br /> The music is pretty good too. Moody and beautiful. It's something really touching. It fits really nice. The first one has a little less music than the workspace and it works very well. <br /> <br /> In all, it creates a better signal. If you've seen the Ridge, you can see it as frustrating. It has a lot of similar qualities like the first series. However, I would recommend to see the first series before watching this. These two do not want you to make up a missed series.
