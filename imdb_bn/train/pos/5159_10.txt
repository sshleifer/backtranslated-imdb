This is certainly one of my all-time fav mountain treks. This is so much of a movie that its crazy cool. The first man is about to explode that beam down on an alien planet. They meet a lazy librarian type dude (playing very well). Then, Kirk himself managed to return to the world like the 16th century. McCoy and tried to follow the spark, but in the past 100,000 years later, after the last year, the non-native world died in frozen versions. When Kirk managed to lock himself up and accused with the witch, Spock was defeated by some bad guy in this frozen, terrible world who enjoys some amok time with a sexy cave. <br /> <br /> When hes hes happy where hes decides when Doc suggests that they will have to find a way to give McKay a royal assupment whuppin. However, they finally left behind the poor cavegirl, finally escaped. Spock finally gives up and leaves the page before it takes a ton of sure. You can literally taste sorrow at the end. All of the frozen land leaving the cavegirl alone seems just cruel and is really touching. His greatest hope for love and the need to follow behind for the people must be out of his mind. However, not very beautiful surroundings <br /> <br /> <br /> However, you'll get so much fun for your profit with this episode .... A love story, Salim Witch test, spoke like a human, left in total isolation Frustration ... abandoned, and the three completely different settings of alien planet. Its amazing they managed jam in all this one fifty minutes film. This is a classic, do not miss it .... I want it on DVD fer shure vulcans !!!!!!
