A great British indie movie! Among the three main characters, fantastic chemistry creates some delightful drug-fuel set pieces that will make Chechen and Chong proud. Phil Daniels is great to look back on the big screen (even if he has changed sides from quadrophenia!) And Gary Strache is surprisingly good and a treatment for women! The final battle scene has been sent to Zulu, and now I know how it happened after Arthur Brown fired the top of the Pope! ... she's not acting .... She is actually a British British hippie. !!! You do not have to be a biker to enjoy it and it's my Friday night post-pub repeat view collection straight from the collection. <br /> <br /> Go to this picture and you will not be disappointed.
