I saw this last night with low expectations. The reason is that, I do not usually like "Made for TV" movies and rarely do I like the "Cast Reunion" movies. However, the Los Angeles Times critics preferred it, so I gave it a chance. I'm happy i did It was quite good. Adam West and Bart Ward reconcile themselves. But, in a similar way, they were acting as their "Batman and Robin". They were camps and did not accept themselves, or this movie very seriously. The film started with them "George Barris" designed by Batmobile, who stole an orphan house before taking it for auction. Although, they are searching for cars, they have reminded the series together that they did together. This flashback is called. It has been well done. Those actors who died for the death of Little Burt Ward and Adam West, they died. And, for a TV movie, it went on the screen and off-witch-satirical about their real behavior. I can give it 9/10, I like it a lot.
