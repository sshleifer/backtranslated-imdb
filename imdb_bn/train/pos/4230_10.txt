For the Colombo fans, like me, the episode which was why Colombo was so popular and how good it was. Ruth Gordon made an intelligent crime novel Writer Abigail Mitchell on a field day (as before). It seems that Abigail called upon his nephew to sign his heirs to sign some papers. He believes his nephew is not getting over death, and his dead nephew's husband (Charles Franc) has worked dirty. It would be unthinkable to say more. There is a cruel role as a personal assistant to Marte Hartley Abigail. This episode of Colombo is itself in a class. This is really a good television movie. I highly recommend it.
