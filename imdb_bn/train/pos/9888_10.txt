Although this beautiful art of art uses the vocabulary of some movie of spirituality, it is not really about anything. It is a political and cultural fairy tale after Mexico's Colombian ODC, a momentary focus on the history of Mexico. <br /> <br /> Contrary to "Chocolate Water for Chocolate", "Erandida" hopes that at least half of the viewer should meet in order to prove that it works a little. (A good start to see the grand character of Spain is: proud, lazy, sad, and above all, to lose weight with history.) <br /> <br /> The heroine's final work is unclear because the "outcome" of history (i.e. present) is always unclear, Because we are very close to honest evaluation. Referring to the film's ambition, the only real favorite film found by the director is to stop closing. <br /> <br /> "Erndida" is fantastic. If it can be found in a local art house or on the screening of the university, then a large screen experience will be ideal. But if not, VHS never sees it.
