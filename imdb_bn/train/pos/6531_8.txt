I really liked this movie ... it was cute. I enjoyed it, but if you do not, it's your fault. Emma Roberts played a good nancy druid, though she was not like books. Old fashion outfits are weird when you see them in modern times, but she looks good on them. To me, the rich girls did not have the accessories that they thought were rich. I mean, it looks like they've got all the clothes - BrandFold- decided to keep a garage at the time of sale and keep it together. Outfits were all tacky, especially when they wore penny loafers with their regular outfits. I do not want to see the movie bad, because it was definitely not! Just go to the theater and see it !!! You will enjoy it!
