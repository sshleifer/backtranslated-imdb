A wonderful and satirical war film focuses on the internal suffering of blind-blinded Marine Al-Schmid. Although it is difficult and unpleasant but the last heroic - victory over Shmid's disability and depression. The war scene was fantastic. But take one bone. Anyway, I have thrown up some .50 bullets I have never seen water or dirt effect! It hits reality, but I can live with it. As his daughter friend, Eliar Parker's fine acting again.
