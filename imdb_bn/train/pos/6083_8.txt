Brian Denhe, Bill Paxton, Joe Pantalino, and finally, Jeff Fayi, all in one movie. Wow is all I can say about that. This is the most inferior actors in biz and they work together pretty well. Like poems they play with each other and it seems like they were the best friends to shoot for the film. <br /> <br /> This picture itself may be good and one can be very intense to see for the first time, and four of them help in a huge amount of surveillance powers again. I can not describe how good Bill Paxton and Jeff Fahie see together on the screen, when they see the couple from a distance and fill the voice, the biggest moment, it almost brings a tear to my eyes. <br /> <br /> Watch a good movie, a wonderful cast, Why? Four words, Faye, Denhehe, Paxton, Pantalino.
