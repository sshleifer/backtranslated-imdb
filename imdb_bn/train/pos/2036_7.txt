- The little spinner is here! <br /> <br /> When I saw the "Creep" vote today, I am amazed at the rating of this IMDB user "1". I wonder: What do people expect of this kind of movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It automatically means: It has a strange story filled with holes, harmful hazards and easy one side characters. So why do you complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable on your seat and ... ... be afraid of death! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing compared to Kate and a lonely subway station incredibly awesome. There are mysteries and fears in every corner of the screen, and you will blur something because of the sudden sound of a blazing neon lamp behind you. (In my opinion, the sound editor did the best thing in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the effects of Gore have been well done and the story is quite well developed. (... remember that it's a horror movie that you see and not a discovery channel!), Then you want to scary yourself very scary. See the hour and then cine Leave or turn on your TV, even though the rest of the story knows, bad guys will die and Kate will only survive, but if you look at the end of this movie you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> And if you want to impose the anxiety on the next level, then after doing this film do what I did: Leave the movie in the dark night, go to the next subway station and the last train goes home. Go to ...
