The beautiful story of Stardust has written blue gyamen (Mirrmashkar's authors) and this is a really good story. I think it will appeal to a stranger, Princess Bride or the 10th Kingdom Fan, and yet it is completely unique and it stands on its own. And I think the film adaptation of this story is far better than the presentation of Neil Gaiman in the original novel. I will not let it down for you. <br /> <br /> The main character, Tristan (the troupe of the novel), the son of a deceased person and a ferry slave has kept a ferry slave. The story begins in a city near a wall that separates the world from magic to earth. There is a falling star when a girl promises to recover it for a girl she infatuated for him. He was surprised that star angel took the form of a girl in the world and then there are others. Three elderly magicians who want to become his heart again, and some boring princess <br /> <br /> This is a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scene and visual. It's charming and I think it is seen by children of all ages and adults. It's just magical This is a real classic fairy tale, since the 1980's, I have not seen in movies.
