The film was designed to impress the viewers and this film left me stupid. Films that have seriously played with photographs and episodes of poetry include passion, hatred, murder, rape, theft and cheating. It is an acute web weaves that close screen until the screen is unable to take my eyes. The story is sweeping. It escaped the persecution of the Spanish Civil War, leaving the audience behind to human ruins. Roger Casmajr and Bruno Bartznani are two young actors who run the screen. Supporting players are thrown nicely and lend a real sense of authenticity. Set, light, scenery and cinematography are wonderful. I absolutely love photography.
