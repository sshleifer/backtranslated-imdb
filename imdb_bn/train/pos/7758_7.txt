An overblown melodrama is common in its period (the mid-1950s) and the appropriate matin√©e food. Rock Hudson, who always falls in love, plays her normal stereotype role, but in the same year of giant, when her material and co-star (Taylor and Dean) were more than average, then in this film, how difficult it is to be rich and happy. The ability to cross multiple stories is not enough. Self-destructive brothers and sisters (Robert Stack, surrounded his path through the movie of drunken stupor and Dorothy Malone, playing the wealthy girl full of the rich wealthy girl) eventually gets damaged and Hudson gets baked - who is not the framework or intellect to get her part Wood in the part. Imagine Oscar Wilde, happily happy and sadly sad, which means fiction. However, I was curious to read that this movie was based on the real story, which proved the truth of this plot. Like other movies of the time, homosexuality is inconsistent in discriminatory terms. Maybe the image can be redefined: If the character of the stack hides the feeling of homosexuality for Mickey, it will actually act. All the heavens that have been exalted from Heaven's Heaven, have been promoted to heaven. Perhaps Hans can write in the air and give us a really memorable movie.
