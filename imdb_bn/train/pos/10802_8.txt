I am on the opposite end of the previous comment. <br /> <br /> First of all, I do not think it wanted to be a direct sign in "Jarac". I mean, this is not titled "The Zerk 2" ... it's "The Zerac, Too", which drives me to believe that the characters have the same albeit, but it is actually moving around completely different people. <Br> <br /> Think about it: There is no connection to the previous movie except the character names; A completely different story; Different cast; And it's a partial musical that is true. <br /> <br /> Please tell me to give some credit to this movie. It has a lot of smiles in it. Its Blackfield is its main mark.
