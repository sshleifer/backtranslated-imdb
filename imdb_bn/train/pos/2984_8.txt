David Junk instructed one of the most enjoyable comedies of the secret French year. Yes, it depends on the nature of the taste and the resources of the Sophomeric world, but it is all about the latest comedic efforts, all the fun. The film is loaded with all types of jokes which are obviously more obvious than the more harmful types that you have to pay attention to everything in the frame or you probably miss them. Like its previous effort, "Aircraft!", "Top Secret!", And "Naked Guns" are included. Humor flies almost every second. There are many moments to work on, which are easy to ignore when it falls flat. This movie differs from other pale imitations of the spoof style, how it is a real story line. Although many people rely on the fun of many famous scenes in almost random movies (please "Mafia!", Please), this movie tells a new story with favorite characters. It touches on ordinary movies and instead of changing the light of a particular movie, mocks the real sports industry. Even for those who are not concerned about "South Park", their maker, Matt Stone and Tray Parker, make a good pair of leading actors related to natural chemistry. The film makes use of Athos, Athletics and other celebrities in Kyos' most effective ways, especially with the "unsigned mystery" Robert Stack, a light breeze. However, stay with credit for the ultimate joke with Bob Costas and Al-Michaels. Finally, Zucker has been achieved, probably in words applied to the mix of movies, Dunk in a house.
