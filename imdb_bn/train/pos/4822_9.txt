When someone puts your hands under the feet or down the stairs? Taking your food before eating others? An over-bearing mother? In this film, there are some obstacles in this problem with young Victorias (many of them are struggling with energy, as well as their efforts in life). Not saying, it makes it very interesting and informative to see. <br /> <br /> I have already seen Emily Blunt at Demal Wears Flute (and anything else). The picture he was in, he was standing here again. I was highly impressed with his photo of young Victoria, and he played very well in the role. She met Queen Victoria at the beginning of the film from young Victoria who became completely credible. Blunt plays a complete role, shows different aspects (from weak, strong, young Victoria who makes the queen wrong in control). This role can not be said enough about Emily Blunt. She - quite easy - subtle, commanding your attention every second of the screen. He kept you with the final shot of the film and moved it. <br /> <br /> Rupert Friend proves Victoria's love interest (and finally husband), as well as Prince Albert as well. Actors have excellent chemistry and you absolutely believe in their development relationship. They have opinions, but you can say that they love. Blunt and Friend are nice in every scene they share and are interested in what's happening in Victoria and Albert. Other actors in the film are very good. Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne, Sir John Conroy as King William and Mark Strong as Jim Broadbutt, as Miranda Richardson's Duchess. There is not a bad bad performance in this movie. Less-minded people are also well-documented, which have little screen time for them. Even Victorian dogs (King Charles Dale of a Cavalier) are memorable and influenced by the film. <br /> <br /> Although this movie exceeds some aspects of Victorian life - especially to the end - and instead * we tell what happened to him (with him and Albert) on the screen, which we really see *. After all this, a film about 'The Young Victoria' (not 'Medieval Victoria', not 'Old Victoria'). Although some decorations have been made in history with this film, it focuses on what it determines - which tells us how the young princess came to power. <br /> <br /> The movie looks amazing, costumes are amazingly visible and the music only detracts from it, adding Amili Blant costume. This is incredibly shot and, unlike many movies on this day, this film is actually a good length, because it will not last for a long time that you lose interest or feel it is being dragged inappropriately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " She has become a wonderful form here, another amazing performance, and what this picture might have on her, she played another actress in this important / historical role instead. It should be clearly shown that, with a nice performance, a delicate-designed film. If you are aware of a significant attraction for a woman who is very prominent in history, it must be seen.
