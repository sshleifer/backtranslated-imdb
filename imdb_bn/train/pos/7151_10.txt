I used to read the 5th grade so I heard when they were doing a movie! Of course, I'm busy self, I did not have the chance to watch movies in the theater. The hole was just outside the city, but we were very busy. I was surprised to hear that all my friends saw it and none of them invited me! They all said it was good, but I've read amazing books, which made a vague movie, I was definitely worried. <br /> <br /> Suddenly there comes a perfect opportunity to see it. It was that week and my dad went to a cruise and I was left in Babysit. My sister, who is 9, and I saw it and loved it all! I took another person who I liked in the children's home and their children, 9 and 4. Even my parents liked it and they were brutal film critics. After all, I recommend this movie that understands the family's courage and loves a ridiculous cast! This movie will be your top 5 "View" list !!!!
