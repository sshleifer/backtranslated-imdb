As a movie, Ulysses should not be compared with the novel, because they are two completely different bodies. However, who says that the film still maintains many elements of the book, but it is more difficult to drag the stream of consciousness as a visual medium. I think this is the best movie they can make with this element ... and it's annoying with movies that are not regularly like their literary counterparts. I recommend the book, but the movie is still entertaining.
