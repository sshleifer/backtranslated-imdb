I gave this movie 8 out of 10, as 10 for 10 amas and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire. This movie is near Slumdog, but it is difficult to judge in such a film without a spirit of Balkan life, mentality and kushurika nicely presented. To understand it you have to be really one of the best. It's an amazing movie, much better than its earlier movies and contemporary, which is boring at this time, I think Castro is moving forward with this movie. I like the humor (Balcon humor), photography is an art itself, each scene is limited artistic. Plot is probably a fairy tale, do not remember now, but remember my daughter-going to sleep in a similar story.
