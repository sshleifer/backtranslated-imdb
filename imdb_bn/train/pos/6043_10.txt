I have seen Freebird movies and think of it as great! Fun back on his back, British film industry came through through some recreational time! It is good to see how the person who met them at the service provider station, the news agent, the best way to film the film. Acting was believable (I'm a bicker) They remind me of some good times of bike scenes. Film director played good acting role in acting actor! Finally a new crop is mentioned, is it the foundation of a second movie in Ireland? So hope them coming. Great film, good writing, realistic characters!
