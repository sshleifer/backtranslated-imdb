* Wonderland Splilers * <br /> <br /> 1 July, 1981: Five, Ron Lioness (Josh Lucas), Susan Lionius (Christina Applegate), Billy Daverell (Team Blake Nelson), Barbara Richardson (Natasha Gregson Wagner) and Joy Miller (Zenne Garofalo) during a time of attack on 8763 Wonderland Avenue, Laurel Canyon, LA in their house to sleep with steel pipe and brutally. Only Susan lives. <br /> <br /> The main suspect: John Holes (Wall Killer), the former king of the screen, the owner of a 30 cm long dick, and now a hopeless addict. <br /> <br /> Two investigators, Luis (Frankie G.) and Sam Niko (Ted Levin) are investigating the case and trying to leak it with the help of a witness who can tell that people rarely took part in the murder, David Lind (Dylan McDermat), Barbara Lover and Dol Riller (Kate Bosworth), a 19-year-old girlfriend of Holmes and a Witness from Susan, who is sadly shadow of his night and some Neither enters the husband's head and suffers almost the same fate, and Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), a major drug kingpin (who is always close to women like Barbie (Paris Hilton)) comes to light as a suspected planner. Genocide <br /> <br /> But what happened that night? And Sharon (Lisa Cudro), the man's wife, know something about it? 'Wonderland' is an educated, intense thriller, a great love story and the story of a bad story in between. A clever use of 'Rasoman' technique (we see David, John, Don, Susan (for a very short time) and Sharon's day and night events), a nice direction and a great script, but in most cases acting, especially Kilmer, who takes the central stage with his hopelessness, anguish, sometimes the child Homes, Lucas, whose lunis are weirdly alluring, the power of Sudra Shali Sharon and Bosworth's innocent Don Wonderland: 9/10
