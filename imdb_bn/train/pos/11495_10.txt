We saw this in one of the local art cinema theaters in the Montreal area of ​​Houston, Texas. It was fairly surprising compared to the theater newsletter, but we were both blown by artists. It was done nicely and (apparently) in the Munich area, it was portrayed in a Schloss (German name of Chutur). It is a very clear search of sexual relations between twenty-two men and women separated from twenty-two-day restrictions of the day. It's superbly magnificent to remember. We came home after the movie and talked and talked to 4am the next morning. <br /> <br /> The version we saw was in English (mostly) so first critics need to have at least two editions. The movie (probably its original) in the German version. I searched and searched for a video tape version but nothing comes along. Want to have a VHS or DVD version absolutely. This is a great tutorial on how to search relationships on a basic level and how to relate to your partner. If someone knows the writer / director, please release him, especially in the movies this day. I probably can not imagine being tired of seeing fifty innocent performers in their fifties. Please bring it back.
