It's two dog stories and a cat looking to return home. Ancient and wise Golden Retriever shadow, young American buldog chance and Himalayan cat Sassi escaped from the bird and went to the desert to reunite with their families. Homeward Dam: The Incredible Journey (1993) A family adventure directed by Dwight Dunham. This is a remake of a 1963 film. This movie got a signal three years later. Michael J. Fox Chans is the perfect people to voice-over. He took some logical strength in the role of Fox. Sally Field did a great voice as Sassi. Don Amex Shawn as Fantastic The world's second final movie of this world. Also visible actor is superb. Kim Greist Laura Barnford-Savar plays Robert Hays Bob Savar Benji Thal plays Peter Bernford Veronica Lawrence Hope Bonford Kevin Chevalia Jamie Savar Jane portrays smart smart ketts. It is quite surprising to see these pets trying to survive in the desert. We saw the Sassi River and it looks like AJ is the array. Beer beer is visible and fun Chan has no chance with that big, hungry bear. And his meeting with porcupine looks painful. This is some great fun for the whole family.
