"Shore Vacation" is mostly an adventure adventure in the average Star Trek. There is nothing wrong with episode, though. What I could offer to the fans only is not the best representation. It's light entertainment, nothing. However, I was happy to see that such a TV show had enough good ideas to take a break from serious interglantic contradictions. In this episode, Kirk decides to stop her crew for a while and a landing party is reduced to a planet that looks like a perfect place for a vacation. Naturally, the planet does not seem as peaceful as it is. There are some actions and tense moments, but most stories are played for laughter. Well, but unexpected.
