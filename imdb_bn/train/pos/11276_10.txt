Probably hard to believe, but this film was condemned as unethical to more polypets than any other film produced before the application of the Buenos Aires Code. Yes, in fact the priests told their flock that anyone who went to see the film was a serious sin. <br /> <br /> I'm not making it They had several reasons as follows: <br /> <br /> Items: Like Jen Sex. He and Tarzan were shown to wake up one morning in their torrent shelter. She stretched sensuously, and with a playful look she said "Tarzan, you have been a bad boy!" So they are not just having sex, they are having strange sex! A few years later, under the hedge code, people (especially women) were not supposed to be portrayed as sexual enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Item: Jane is a savvy, savvy (Tarzan) savvy, not respectable, five men (Halt). Initially, Holt carried him with a beautiful dress from London, then he was a little annoyed; Holt tried to kill Tarzan, and both Holt and Jane believed that he was dead, he wavers many. But when he realizes that his people are very alive, the attraction of civilization disappears for him. And why not? Tarzan and Jane's relations are proportional: his "civilized" lack of helplessness, which forces him to be called "the head of his wife". For the boot, he lacks many more "civilized" hangups, for example envy. When Holt and his friend reached, Tarzan warmly greeted both, knowing perfectly well that Holt Jane is the old flame. When Holt made her doll in London's clothes and danced slowly with portable phonographs, Tarzan drew her knife out of a tree. Jealous? No He has simply taken caution towards the weird music machine, since he has never seen before. Once it is explained, he is calm. <br /> <br /> Item: Civilized HOTT messy mind. Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy. Hollt's Lamplut will go to the tent, Hunt sees her silhouette as an outfit for a fashionable fashion. Conversely, dragging the dress after the Tarzan game, after which it takes him to the swimming pole and dives, following the most scenic sex nude scenes of all the films: The tide spends five minutes in a beautiful water balloon. Dressed in three versions - dressed, lazy and naked - the scene was spent before the release of the film, but the cash version was recovered on the video available now.) And when Jane grew up, and leopard chip glasses stole for her dress, Jane made it clear That makes her irritable only because of the "civilized" men and their hangups. Where is the "universal values" so favorite of the seminarians? Nowhere, that's where Another reason why this missile thought this movie was sinful? <br /> <br /> Item: The human concept is the crown of creation, and animals seem to be a deadly fatal just for the use and comfort of humans. Holt and his friend want to be directed to "elephant cemetery" so that they can take up ivory and take home. They want to give Tarzan directions to their graveyard. You, the reader, are thinking of "Fat opportunities!" And you're fine. He said, "sleeping elephants!" Which explains to him all. Jane said the feelings of Tarazan, which two "gentlemen" are ridiculous <br /> <br /> Item: Jane, former civilized woman, is more wealthy than two civilized men with him. Holt and buddy blow it out, and find themselves surrounded by hostile tribes and wild animals. It keeps Jane cold. During the boys' panic, he charged, ordered them and pulled out the rifles. <br /> <br /> item: There is no punk below Jane's costume. (The original idea was that for his helplessness, the leaflet closed his breast binding, which is actually a brief scene.) <br /> <br /> Finally, a couple of cloth men complained that the film was "Tarzan and his wife "Instead, it is called" Tarzan and his companion ". No comments <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where did they steal from the holy place? The end <br /> <br /> so you have. A completely devastating film. Similar to all other films about complex and funny women (see, e.g., Rita Hareth and Reymand Messasi appear) which form the trend flowing in the early 30's, and these are brought to a sudden end by taking hedge codes. <br /> <br /> Jone de Viv of this movie released the famous version of Zence's famous Karzan Yar. An excellent touch, unfortunately is abandoned in future production. <br /> <br /> It's artistic freedom, feminist jen, and listen for sex.
