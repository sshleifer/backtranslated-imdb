There is not much to say about this movie ... it's weird, but fun <br /> <br /> Plot outline (from IMDB) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing When the game gets huge success, they form a professional baseball league in addition to the help of a millionaire, where everyone gets the same salary and no team can change cities. Coop and Rimers team, Milwaukee Beers is the only team that has changed the rules of the rules that Dallas Fellon's owner (von) wants to establish. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Although I'm not a big fan of SouthPark, Parker and Stone do a great job in their first real movies. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun moments in this movie that I can not come close to their namesake. It really does not give up, and they do not try to make some cruddy dramas to make it even more serious. <br /> <br /> and my favorite aspect of this movie: Soundtrack It's cool I especially like "take me" and "beer" by real big fish. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> James "Black Wolf" Johnston
