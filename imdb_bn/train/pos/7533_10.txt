When I like this series in KWW, I do not believe that with the end of the main event in 1995, Batman spin was closed and in 1997 the show came. First of all, I like the idea of ​​leaving Robin out of Batman himself. It was an interesting perspective on their relationship. I liked the series of Team Dreake, and again like its predecessor, this show was like a great story line, great animation (the original is better), extraordinary voice work, and certainly brilliant writing. The only thing that I did not like was in America when it often runs episodes in a 15 minute story. I wish I could only be part of the episode. My favorite episode of a Batman cartoon comes in this series and it is called "over the age", according to my opinion "heart of love" and "Robin's calculation." Overall a nice follow-up, along with Superman, this show made my childhood very happy.
