A tragic surprise movie ... brought us to a Japan that does not exist anymore. Despite the technical expertise of Hollywood, I still see a Hollywood movie that can show the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town near the sea ... The last Samurai of Tom Cruise chose Lord's last installment, trying to capture the rural Old Japan ring. <br /> <br /> If you like uninterrupted but intense story lines, it's a must see movie. It's a vacation like 1000 blockbusters you've seen from Hollow Flashy Movies. I think this is one of the better stories of Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> Even if it is a guide to prostitutes and rules of rules that govern life in such settings, it does not become a skin flick. The characters are full of depth and work with a lot of intensity.
