Well, this is an Ivan Reitman film. With rare exceptions, Ivan likes entertainment. His films are not generally "deep", but often they are quite entertaining. My super-ex-girlfriend surprised me that I thought I wanted to. Uma Thurman is just so grand, and I love her portrayals. I also like Louis Wilson, and Renan Wilson is straight on the hottie. Without taking yourself seriously, the film is at the top and it is still not very unique and it is not even where nobody has followed ... it's a nice rental and probably a well-crafted movie, especially if you have headache and your brain Do not want to strain. It's escapist fun and there's no mistake. When you snatch "super-girl" stuff, you leave a story about the relationship and the relationship gets worse. It met a boy girl, boy girl left things. And at the end, the letters are looking for love. All of them can not be "dumped" and they can also .... a part of life with a twist.
