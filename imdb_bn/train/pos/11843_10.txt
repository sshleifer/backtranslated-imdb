Soul: Simron Stallion is an overall wonderful movie. Animation is unique in combination of type, storyline amazing, and music surprising. <br /> <br /> Animated animation is a special thing about many animations. How they expressed the characters, especially the horses, especially through their animation. Although horses are easily communicated through body language, many young people and horses studying do not understand. Without the word, it would be challenging to publish the features that I have to imagine. Because of this, I understand the 'eyebrows' added to horses (though it does not have thick lines in real horses). One of the few things that I have portrayed as something strange about horse practice is that the soul leads its mother's meat. Wild horse cows, lead stallion usually chasing out young colts. Also, some people may think of white army officers drawing as 'stereotyping the bad guys', which has been portrayed as local Americans who think of all the movies. Sometimes back then; They behaved very badly in the mustangs. For example, in real history, the army officers of the Apollosas were almost depleted. Imagine if the best Americans in the world could not save them, what happened to the world's best favorite races. <br /> <br /> I do not think the reality can be reduced by talking to each other with horses. . The feelings of the soul were expressed by a little detail, but mostly through music (Brian Adams). The songs have been really well-publicized, and Hans Geimmer and Brian Adams have done a great job of telling stories through a harmonious song and melody. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie I got the emotion, in the first or the twentieth century (yes, I saw it a lot), you will not believe me. Some scenes take away your breath, others seem to emphasize tears in your eyes. In the initial order, showing the homeland of the soul, puts you directly into the right of spectacular tasks. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why this cute movie is somewhat hated. Overall, I rated it a 10/10 - must have a watch.
