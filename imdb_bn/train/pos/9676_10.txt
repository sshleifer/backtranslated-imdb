The film was very sweet and hearty! I watch the movie almost every time we cry. I would recommend this movie for everyone. The movie was so inspirational to me. Acting played a great job, and the movies are very well played and done. The film was a little girl, which had a paral, whose name is Polly. Poly has separated her from her parents because they thought it would be good for her. <br /> <br /> After the experience of Polly, she finished herself in a cage in the basement. Finally this Russian man who has acquired a job in a place as a janitor. Pauli found Pauli at the bottom and Silly started talking about talking to him. Eventually this man helped reunite with Mary (the little girl raised in the party). Love overcame all the obstacles.
