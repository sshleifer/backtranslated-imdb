Most people (36) gave this movie 10 and those who are not very critical or perhaps something else is expected. This is one of my favorite movies of the 80's, it increases on you and it has all. I got it DVD and 20 years later it is still not frustrating, there are plenty of action, drama, romance and even comedy. This makes the cool car move, automatic weapon shootout, and lots of things to spare and your seat experience has a fun lane! Even after you see it the main theme song for several days will be whistling or whistling. <br /> <br /> You can see this image with your wife / gf and you both will enjoy it. That's the book of the papers, like the dock. Savage, really exists and helps people fight bad so that he can write stories here is almost true of life. Actor Jack Speed ​​also has many film directors, producers and authors. Jake Speed ​​(Character) in this movie is the type of courage of Indiana Jones, he usually uses his head to get out of the cluttering situation, but occasionally resorts to tears of fires (yes !, and undoubtedly foolish fate!). Watch out for one of his "James Bond" hi-tech equipment, the final street fighter SV is coming out of the sky. <br /> <br /> Heroin is the first interest of the beautiful young love of Jim Carey Pavilion. The movie "Once Upon a Time" is still a duplicate of the young girl here and here and her teenager blonde younger sister. <br /> <br /> Bad guys love the "really bad" male and the worst locals villainous scams. Finishing is just perfect and can stand alone or invite you to a sequel, not sadly made - but you can imagine what will happen next! <br /> <br /> You must see this movie because it will entertain you and enjoy you and a ticket price worth.
