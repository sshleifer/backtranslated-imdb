This movie was made in 1948, but it is still true ring. Very, very funny. It starts with a family that wants to buy a little space in the country and it "builds" from there. Anyone has ever built a house, this movie will be very respectful. Great Cast Keri Grant and Mirna Lloyd are delighted in this movie. It is a classic black and white film that reflects the huge grand style of 40. Clothing, architecture and family life. Many references are worth spending, and those who compare today's costs are pretty amazing. I can not imagine anyone who did not fully enjoy this movie. I am surprised about the number of middle-aged people who never heard of it. A true classic
