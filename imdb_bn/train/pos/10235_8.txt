An unusual movie from Rango Lam and weirdly acclaimed. The fiction that Kung Fu mixes with a sword and a more realistic picture of the spear, especially in the first ten minutes. Cut into a horse riding rider and keep riding his waist and legs. Several horses cut-up This is very unexpected. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple, Fong and his Sholin brothers are captured by an insane billionaire general and are imprisoned in the Lal Lotus temple jail, which seems to be a chamber of torture of temples. In the Apocalypse's apocalypse, the cartridge resembles the same, because he suddenly started the philosophy of philosophy and created horror images of human blood. <br /> <br /> Production is very impressive and the setting is silent. Blood everywhere The action is done very well and most of the HH action scene is most consistent with. Sometimes the film flips into irrationality or influences Chess, but it's never bad to destroy the film. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Hong Kong fu movies in the nineties. Just remember it is not friendly.
