Probably Jackie Chan's best film in the 1980s, and which kept him on the map. This self-managed police drama is clear from the scale opening and closing scenes, of which a squire village and shopping mall are destroyed. The differences between the original Chinese and the dubbed English editions are clearly, many of these jokes fail to enter later. Modern people prevent adults from hearing about something like their characters. Actually, the only thing Dabing was during the court trial? Then the judgment of the colonialist Hong Kong was held in English, originally in Canton, this was the scene! <br /> <br /> However, Chan's war style and martial arts corridor make humor wherever possible, so non-Cantonese visitors do not miss too much. After all, a channel that makes Flick the dialogue, but takes action and painful out. It is easy to follow the story: Chan is a ganglong godfather (Cho Yeun) who persistently follows Hong Kong's intelligence and protects a star witness (Braggate Lynn). The action is fantastic from the beginning to the end, and there is not much time to breathe in. It does not have to worry you, but what's a recreation, and well strung together, film. Arguably, this is one of the best martial arts films out.
