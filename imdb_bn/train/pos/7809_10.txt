This movie has taken me out of understanding, it will always be my favorite film, mainly because it is surrounded by almost every emotion in about 157 minutes. The most difficult part for me is that whenever I want to listen to amazing music and songs from the film, I have to keep it in my DVD player, so I wonder if anyone knows where the music is singing in the movie and where they can be found , I look everywhere, in the last 5 years, I can remember spiralingly.
