089: Football Parade (1933) - 9/30/1933, Release, 5/5/07. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This time it was a super-fast piclite parade, as James Cagnick became the Jognart stage producer Chester Kent. I'm 100% sure that Cagan was managing Berkeley Channel with his performance in unknown Kentucky, who came up with a new idea for performance every minute. Jordan Blondell turned as acid-tongued secretary as love turned as nice. Ruby Keeler / Dick Powell Subplut This time is not as main but less enjoyable. One thing that bothered me was that Barclay acted, which seemed too extraordinary and complex at some stage, then a stage that would later show a movie. Obviously, Basavi did not allow a little thing to stop her story in such a way that she would probably prevent her from joining with the top musical numbers. I ultimately liked this movie, shamefully aggressive number "Shanghai Lil", which anyone can guess, it often comes naturally annoying performances as stomach-sprain. <br /> <br /> Dug: Three months six movies. Got to be a new record. Anyway ?? This is Warner Bros. Completed '1933's Musical Triangle,' 42nd Street 'and' Gold Degrees of 1933 '. I would definitely recommend three observers in a row. James Cagan is inspired by playing Chester Kent or Busby in this film, I wonder if Bashar Berkeley Channel is managed. I hope it was; It seems that Berkeley is such a kind of person who sees a wide variety of everyday events like Chester. The funny thing about Cagney was that he really does not look like a leading man in the traditional sense. He talked with 5'7 ", square lead and a wicked New York accent, but the man was quite versatile, from the toxic gangsters who talked to him so fast that we could see here. He could dance, essentially he was a character actor There was a known person in the body, and there are some familiar faces in the rest of the cast; Joan Blondel came back Dick dressed as a loyal and wishful secretary to Kagina, and a cute couple playing Dick Powell and Ruby Keller, but seems to get less screen time than before, Billy Berti once again appears as a spoof, which is more warm in the pre-code era. And like adult-oriented songs, more than 50s and 60s were based family, and Warner of that year An excellent measurement of musical instruments ("Shanghai Lil" number was not unreasonable, the carer's Chinese did a bad job). <br /> <br /> The last movie: Dinner at at (1933) Next photo: I'm Angel (1933) .
