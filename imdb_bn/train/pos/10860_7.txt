This is not violent because I was optimistic that the violent scenes would become more cruel and effective. <br /> <br /> Many twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When it comes to violence, it's a brutal, martial arts scene with no guns or special effects, it is trustworthy in your face and all the conversations You are never allowed to forget that Trid is a violent criminal organization. <br /> <br /> The last but surprising but thoroughly consistent and credible.
