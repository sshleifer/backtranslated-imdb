I did not read the novel, though I understand that it is a little different from that. I rather enjoyed it, that is not my style, but the decision to decide to read this book brings me back. I can not read any of Austin's words, I can not compare it with any of his work. What I can say is that every line of clever, malicious and well-established dialogue is often the biggest and the biggest source of comedy. This makes me laugh very loud, with the perfect British and oral elements. Each acting performance is on the spot, and Paltrow is completely nail in a kind matchmaker role. Characters are well written, credible and consistent. I think many of them are very annoying, and even though I think at least some are meant to be fun, it continues to be overdose and it is true that they do not appear for the first time. Editing and cinematography is awesome, and everything looks pretty gorgeous. Plots and pens are great, you do not bother. This is a * true * ending clearly, but probably this audience likes it. I can not claim that it does not give me relaxation, it starts from the beginning, and I want to see it again. There is this short language. I recommend this to fans of romance no fan. 7/10
