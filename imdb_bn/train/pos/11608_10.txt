This is a great movie. From reading another review, I can see that I'm not the only one who has tear a tear. Tamilina Tommy acted with such skill and firmness, she made her last hearty and memorable. In the hands of a small actress, her last scene was quarterly and arbitrary. No one will guess this image in a tight, limited budget. Cinematography has a number of fantastic and big name actors. The script is so amazing, I can see why they all want to stay in it. If you end up seeing a long, long list of credits, you will see that half the Hawaii is drawn to create this movie and for good reasons. Soundtrack (available on CD) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood across the film. My only "complaint" I just do not want to end.
