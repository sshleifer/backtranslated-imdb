Some people might call the movie "Polly", but I say it's more than that. Without possibly anything else, this film successfully moves towards huge lengths to look after the plight of immigrants in the United States - recent controversies are consistent. Russia's immigrant generator (Tony Salahb) portrays a paroir about America's search for its original owners, the film tells a number of stories. An elderly woman (Guya Rowlands) whom she is friends, then a Mexican immigrant (Chechen Marin), and others. <br /> <br /> To everyone, this is a very good movie. I usually do not expect much from this type of movie, but it's a treat. I certainly recommend it. Also starring J. Mahr, Body Hackett, Bruce Davison, Holly Yenenberg and Trinity Alvarada.
