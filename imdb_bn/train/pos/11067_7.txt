At the end of the film I still do not know whether I like it or not. So critics were in most cases. I have read a quote long ago: Writer is of 2 types, 1. Those who think and write. And 2. Write those and think readers. When I think here Richie took it very literally and kept all the thoughts for the audience. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was a mixed bag that was filled with several Devil's Advocates and Flight Clubs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ), All the curiosity and mystery of the film have been taken care of. <br /> <br /> If you are reading this review to read this review, then what this movie was all about: I will post midnight this will reduce me and answer this first if you decide to watch this movie or not ... when you came across a puzzle that 'never solved' you want to try? <br /> <br />
