The book based on this movie was excellent; It took a while to hug Houellebecq's overwhelming style, but once I realized the mood behind writing, I completely started painting the pain of the Creator on the world. In fact, no other book has affected me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has made my own personal struggle clear and made the incompetence of my own struggle acceptable. Houellebecq's introspection is dominated by Harel and the hero's indifference and the indifference of a world that has been perfectly portrayed in her absence. This is a movie that publishes today's society for the greedy man of perdition. Hopefully, everything will change in the future, but for the present we have to accept the rat-race shown in this movie. It's probably best that Harrell or Houellebecq did not make a work of talent like this. One is enough for any human.
