I just saw this because it played Jose Lawrence, who knew me <br /> <br /> Whose results from this ?, this painful British Impression <br /> <br /> comedy show. I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical jewel. It's encouraging, touching, and <br /> <br /> romantic or unfortunate or unhealthy. Characters <br /> <br /> With all real people, real foibles, fear and need. See it!
