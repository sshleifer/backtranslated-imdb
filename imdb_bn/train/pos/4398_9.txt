When I heard this film directed by Anne Lee, I made sure to see it. A few years ago, this Tunisian director earned fame with "The Wading Benchate" and "Bright Driving Man Oman" and then went to "Sensitivity and Sensitivity" and "The Ice Storm". Now, he focuses on other American icons - civil war. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This formally configured army did not join. Instead, they formed the band called "Bushbackers", their hair grew long and sometimes the union unions seized that they were wearing their regular clothes. <br /> <br /> The movie has their moral conflicts, high play time, and their supposed heroic mission of killing shopkeepers and peasants who help them in the union. There is no star in this movie, unless you consider the singer "Jewel", but a young confederate starring star as the star. <br /> <br /> Toby McQueen is cast as a young German farm boy, because his traditions were sympathetic to Germanic unions. This young man is a wonderful actor, fresh face full of youth, whose performance includes his wonders and subtle perceptions, because he is open with the horrors of war. <br /> <br /> Jeffrey Wright is a freedom fighter who travels with Gulshanese because the young man who bought him his independence for tyranny. He gives a fine and understated performance. <br /> <br /> There are some of the acting, their long discussions about woodwork, especially morality. And their clothes are very new. And the behavior of women and the "south lady" theme of hot-typing and arrogance comes mostly - especially since they create a point to kill all men who have withdrawn their arms, then burn the shops and the house <br /> <br /> Although I do not think it will be down as one of Lee Ang's "Great" movies, despite the slow part and its length, I found myself fascinated by it for 140 minutes. I was interested in what was happening later and felt sympathy for each letter, which emerged as the true real and imperfect man in the history forces. <br /> <br /> The movie is not as much a step as normal war, but still has been recommended - especially for civil wars. <br /> <br />
