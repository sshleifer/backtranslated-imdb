Dana Andrews is one of those actors who I've probably seen in a dozen movies, but who never registered for me. Often firm, Tectonus plays the same role, and similarly shows something like the underlying Glen Ford, he is an actor who really strives for gratitude; But once you hit the right film .... <br /> <br /> And this is it. The premiere's New York movie look is nearly 50 seconds of filthy and painful, and Andrews is similar to Mark Dixon as his material, who does not know how to play the game to proceed: The haters of the criminals are always too much to play. At the beginning of the film, he accidentally killed a murder witness, an illegal wireless game founded by a private gangster, who was hated by Dickson for personal reasons, and he tried to get involved in the other involved film and to gather. His kind of "justice" is his. He was involved with the person he killed in the separation of wife (Jean Tienni) and tried to get out of the hook to kill her father. <br /> <br /> The great photo picture of Joseph Lassel is a strong and powerful ending with Ben Hect's harsh and striking dialogue and tragedy material and is available in just a minute or two minutes, it's another silent for ages and so far my favorite premiere The film may be - it's like every other successor Laura.
