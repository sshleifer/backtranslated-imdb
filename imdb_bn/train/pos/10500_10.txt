Although Super Mario 64 is not like the rest of the series, it's still good as a classic and old games. This is a few and far away games with many replay values. Plus, this game has so much to do. There are 15 levels of different levels you can do different tasks and there are many hidden tasks. The game is not very challenging, but the lack of challenge does not move away from this game. Once you beat it, you want to delete your game and start over again. And it's just the same fun, second time, or third time, or two hundred times. A Nintendo 64 will be the owner of the owner, and owns a Nintendo 64 because it owns.
