I give + a + at a camp for this movie! Maria Riva, daughter of the dieter, wrote in her mother's book, "If anyone looks at God's garden in connection with the high camp, it can be very interesting." And how! I score overwrought and surprisingly, ridiculously, sunny with joy at the fantastically melodramatic dialogue. Visitors who are reading the details of the boar cap (it is stagnating in heat), when it shows its appearance, it will snicker. <br /> <br /> The directory and the boy rarely look at each other - instead they look at the distance in a dream, perhaps their faces can be photographed in the best corner and the most convenient light (if you are acting in a Turkish See!). Dietrich's clothing is outside of this world. As Riba's book notes, Diirch was able to steal the Paramount's tragedy and designed him the most divine gown, such as the Shiffen Beige Dresses and the Cape. <br /> <br /> I sincerely agree with other critics, rave about Technicolor. It is really hard to believe that the film was made in 1936 - the color is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> In childhood, if you see the Garden of Allah with a generous outlook and you are impressive then you help but enjoy it.
