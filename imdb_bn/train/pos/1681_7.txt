"The Cop of the Scorpions Tail" contains all the elements needed to create an effective gaelo film. The value of the story is giallo. When a man dies in a crash his wife (Ida Gal√≠) collects $ 1 million life insurance policy. In the summer, the widow goes to the summer for marriage, but she is followed by a continuous series of deadly murders. There are many suspects, including a strong investigator (George Hilton) from the insurance company and the widow boyfriend. Director Martino is running the story at a rapid pace when the audience tries to guess the identity of the killer. Anita Strinberg ("Your Vice-Ised Room and Olive Eye Is Hey Key" and "Who Shows His Dead?") A great visual heroine. This is one of Martino's best films.
