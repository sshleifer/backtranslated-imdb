One of the best movies I have ever seen is the Irish movie Philadelphia, here I come. I saw the movie and love them both before I read the game. It's a young man's story ready to go to America to leave Ireland because he can not live in Ireland. It is said from the point of view of this young man (whom someone can show another character) and another young person represents his extravagant thoughts and feelings. However, other characters of the film can not be seen. This is a very sad movie, but deeply touched, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to remember something. I like an Irish movie, or almost any movie in Ireland, and in this case, Irish actor Donald McCann gets my vote. I see that the person kisses the screen for 2 hours and unfortunately for me. Shame has lost him so young
