This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and why it is easy to see. Even after 45 years it is a very effective job. Why is it not a non-printed mystery that only Disney can explain? Good use of Tandem live footage and animation It is used to run every few months or so as part of "Vault Disney", but I did not see it in several listings. * sigh * maximum recommendation.
