One of Paul Wierhovan's main directors was one of the odd ones: before moving to Hollywood, he started to create art-house films in the Netherlands, Netherlands, where he started creating misleading continuous pieces that were seen as entertainment only by the mainstream crowd. The fourth man of 1983 seems to be the latest movie he made before going to the US and it's a converted movie for him. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the fourth, it will be clear that the film will be seen, finally, by the weak writer Gerrard's perspective. In a similar novel titled Carnel Reid's 1949 film The Third Man, the author begins to talk to the public of literary enthusiasts. Before reaching to Saddam, Gerard does not fall into any major problem and this lecture itself goes quite smoothly. Although he has done this function with relative ease, we know that the authors have become somewhat frustrated because there is realistic imagination about killing his roommate before leaving his house and he has a supernatural fantasy which he sees in a hotel that he sees the advertisement and is an isolated Growing out of the peephole of a door in the eye. He has sometimes felt difficult to separate his fantasies from reality, he has become more evident when he said what was said to be untrue and he admitted that he "lied" until he knew no matter what happened or did not happen . <br /> <br /> The fourth person fills stylish fantasies and dreams which makes it even more annoying because it looks very It is easy to see what events we've seen and sometimes they predict, it has happened yet. It is now the most atmospheric film in this aspect of dot drama, with the effect of unrealistic sequences and in the editing style of Vernovan, and this film is an ambiguity like this. Gerard's deeply rooted Catholic beliefs appear in every aspect of his life with sex, as opposed to the film, the fourth man is reversed. She naturally connects a woman's hair stylist, she knows closely with the Bible's Dillilah, though she fears that she will remove even more important marks of manhood with her scales. In a romantic fantasy sequence to impress Luis Bu√±uel, he replaces a person who is attracted to the image of Christ's life-size cross. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is both full of fine and visual visual symbols, which helps in creating a unique and satisfying movie experience.
