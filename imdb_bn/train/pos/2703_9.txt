I do not see a huge fan of camp kitsch and "so bad it's good" However, I really like this fun factor and - do not believe it - it's innovation. <br /> <br /> The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is incredibly enthusiastic, but making some of the most outstanding actors and considered aspects of slapstick and styalised movements. Billy Jane continues with the incredible expression (see the bus scene for a textbook reading of how to use the movement) and some unexpected stars are ready by him. <br /> <br /> You may not like this picture, but do not enjoy it, but if you get a chance to watch it, then skip the time because you will end up with a confusing smile on your face and some of the stars of humor End the movie with a new perspective. Very reccomended.
