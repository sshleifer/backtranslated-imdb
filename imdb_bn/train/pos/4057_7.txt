Like many Americans, when I saw the work of Hajiio Miyazaki, I saw "Spirit Away". I fell in love with the film and saw many times. Now I want to see every picture of Miyazaki. One of his previous works is "Castle in Sky." Although it is still enjoyable, it is not as good as "Spirit Away" (though it is compared or its film is probably inappropriate in its 2002 best version). <br /> <br /> A young boy named Paju (James van der Baker) was working late in the night, when he saw that the girl was slowly falling from the sky. When he woke up the next morning, he presented himself as a winter (Anna Pakkin). But the secret of winter is the mystery, and he knows beforehand that the paw has been dragged into an adventure which will put him in danger of piracy, army and lost floating city. <br /> <br /> <br /> You can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. Many filmmakers have tried, but Miajaki can not create any kind of magic and fear. Experience a wonderful dream from your childhood seeing Miazaki's film. <br /> <br /> Because of the movie being animated, due to the film's sinking it does not cause much problems because it determines the impossible to reach the lips movement word. This translated conversation is well-written and voiced by talented actors. Voice acting is different. James Van Der Beek best rental. The role of Pazu that he deserves for the character bring an unforgettable encouragement and excitement. Anna Pacin is as good as the winter. He is scared by the events happening around him, but he knows what to do. Mark Hamilton is unaccustomed She is dangerous and wants something from Sheeta, and it will have something to get. Other voices are bad Colise Lichmann is horrible as Dola. Lycheman might have won an Oscar for "The Last Picture Show", but he is boring as a pirate leader. The character of Leachman gives an insulting squawk that is almost always monotonous. It's so bad that it almost gets destroyed! Jim Kamings is an effective voice-over actor, but he miscast as usual. <br /> <br /> I would certainly recommend viewing "Castle in Sky". I'll probably end up buying it myself. But it's not as good as "panic" but it's still pretty good.
