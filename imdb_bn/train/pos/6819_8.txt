I found a recreational and provocative experience 'top of entertainment'. Acting, not usually bright, was perfectly acceptable and sometimes very good. Of course as a small demographic film, as a film, it must be one of the best works of the genre (children's sai-fi). Generally, I want to say that Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia create the best movies and TV shows for children and 'Time at the Top' does not give anything to leave this theory! I do not think it's important for continuity and great acting young people. A good plot and a fantastic screenplay are a lot more important for them. Both are abundant in this film. Special effects are good, without detracting from the stories, or off of viewers off their own imagination. In essence, an additional load injection of SFX was very easy, but it completely destroyed 'entire Rhesson d'Ere'. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Overall, this movie is extremely satisfying, and I recommend to all the viewers who can see the world with children's eyes, or those who try themselves! Now, I must read the original book as soon as possible.
