One must see all - you need to borrow your neighbors kids to see this one. One of the best animations / cartoons ever released in a long time. It took an entirely new-stage antza movie. Do not make mistakes in both of them as the same movie - although basically the movie is similar to the plot. Just go and enjoy.
