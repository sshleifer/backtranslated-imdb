How nice. This saw last night and I was still good how good. Every character felt so real (although most of them were small, selfish ** ** hole) and malicious stories - the middle class widowed began to rob his daughter's desperate lover - totally believing. Top performances are all round but North Royal and North American Daniel Craig (coming next to ours David Thuylis) our friends are off. <br /> <br /> and director Roger Mikhail? It could be as far as possible from Notting Hill. Thank God! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie !!!
