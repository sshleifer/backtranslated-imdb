This movie will not sit well with anyone, but it must be seen. How African African couples work to create a name in the community, and many of them are trying to move as "African Americans", I am surprised to have a real discussion. <br /> <br /> This little showtime film is almost like Spike Lee's Joint ... You have an African American Male (Danny Glover) who traditionally owns a white law career Worked hard on the path. In the 1970s Like any American, he managed to adjust his family to its upward mobile status, but forget that there are still many problems. At that time there were only African American maides around. Owning a home? Wow <br /> <br /> Then the mix started. His wife (Hypie Goldberg) has been told to "get involved", so she does all the other women who are her neighbors. And when people think that she and her family "inside", the door on the right side comes to other African Americans, because they have won "Lotto" (Munnic) and in her eyes and she does not want to do anything with them. Do not want to. He, of course, should not have a good qualification, his new neighbor "Ghetto"! <br /> <br /> What does this picture show that this family is fitness for you and how it loses itself to the process. It asks you where racism starts and ends ... and with whom. It shows that no matter what color you have and how much money you have, you can still stop yourself around the world and help the people around you. It shows how these African American children are "mixed" around them, when cultures around them (filled with golden hair and blue eyes, remember!) Are trapped in their change. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No matter which race you have, this movie can be terrible to your neighbor and to each other ... All of it to be happy ... That makes you feel that you have more money than others so it automatically creates you better - and you were struggling and those who are coming behind you forget it. <br /> <br /> again, not for everyone. But a look and trial for yourself. <br /> <br />
