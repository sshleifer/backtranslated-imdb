For a low budget project, the film was a success. The story was interesting, and the actor was convinced. Eva Langriya, who is now bigger than the TV show "Dragon," is more sex than before. The locations were ideal for the Gunster Plot, and the director took a lot of role for his project and showed his talent. Of course, this low budget movie can use better editing and more special effects for gun scenes, but the music keeps the script moving. Although this film is part of the series of problems, I must say that I will hire the director's next film. If you are a film student, you can learn some things from the director's commentary.
