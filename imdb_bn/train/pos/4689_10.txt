I agree with the whole heartfelt comments as far as Remember this documentary as one of the most amazing and informative I've ever seen. As I said earlier, I thought that I started, thinking that it was just another nature study - interesting, not necessary, but I was wrong. The story of the colony was not unbelievable, but I remember the music as part of the appeal. I remember correctly, it was a native pipe (like a song over the end of a flame over the dog's nest). I was looking for a copy too. This should be required for anyone, but especially the school. It should be re-released.
