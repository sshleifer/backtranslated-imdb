Well I personally do not like the rope, but I still got scared of black hats. I'm sure I did not get some inner joke, but some I knew, and soon after I stopped smiling, I used to laugh laughing. I'm a big fan of spinal tap, so naturally I was checking this out. It's The Divivative of the Spinal Tap, sometimes slow, but the film is still standing on it like its original, intelligent, and funny mockery. My personal favorite: "The time of the slaves, they did not have their hats to protect them from the sun, so at the end of the day they were very tired of rebellion. Now we have hat."
