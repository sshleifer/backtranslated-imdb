***** ********************************************************************************************* **************************************************************************************************** ********** However, it was a movie as a child that I was a proponent fan; Remember that it has been made for children, I rate it on a relative basis. In the history of winter break, children build a terrific snowstorm and jump back and forth to control with the same kind of snowballs and other conuktions. If I have a child, of course I will try and be interested in this film, because when I was young, the snow fort was awakening me, and I think the kids will still agree with all the pixels and all the animations of the computer. Out of date and just can not understand it. In addition, the message of the film is a wonderful metaphor and positive for it, for children (and adults alike).
