I really enjoyed many reunions! If I had this "laugh" and "Little Look" then it would have been a 10 rating. There was a mention of why they did not attend today or where they did reunion. They were very popular characters and I think it was not wrong to give any explanation about the lack of their appearance. <br /> <br /> However, I'm glad that the TNN series ran again! I was looking for the episode for years and how happy I was to tap the whole series (I missed a few episodes). Jenny Hannah
