Director Vinceenzo Natali showed her tendency for her 1997 film "Elwooded" character-based Saifai Flickr, where 3 are trapped in the elevator and the invisible monster roars around the building. The next feature project "Cube" was released later that year, at this time there was enormous expansion of interconnected dense deaths with 6 people and instead of lift. Both of them have a commendable endeavor to take science finance one step further, intentionally refusing to show a visible enthusiasm, instead of giving as much attention as possible to the human element, how the characters respond, react, and steadfastly interact, and dangerous conditions. After the mainstream exploration with "Cipher" of 2002, Natalie is our "Awesome", her latest, and most optimistic and interesting "movie"? <br /> <br /> Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) are brought together with friends of life, mutual isolation from society and the lack of others. Dave, who is always selfish and somewhat gradually hindered by nature, is in a stuttered and inexhaustible home-built apartment with rent-free Android, where he often takes advantage of Andrew's neurotic and antisocial mentality. Despite all this, two Mofits are happy together, one day their faults in their character, until they meet with the bad luck of some astronomers, face a few serious cases of their prison-prone problems. On top of them, they discover that their house is considered inadequate for existence and planned to be destroyed before sunset, so whatever mistakes are made for them are frustrating, within nightmares, they want the whole world to disappear. And do it. <br /> <br /> In order to do more with Sinopopis, Dave and Andrew will deal with what they have done and how they deal with their new reality, very slow (sometimes very slowly) compromises. Studying the behavior of human beings under the authority (Ala the bird), the kitten attracts the kittens, but easily makes friends of the main character more than the strangers, he is able to liberate it from the thriller-material of this premises. More comfortable and optimistic layers. It's almost the opposite of the "cube" opposite image. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is not a 85-minute smile and sunlight. Keeping the fundamental reality, the dynamism of our two anti-heroes often gets dissatisfied, sometimes with rather bad results. Like the "desert island" game, the film shows how best friends can be left apart, but at the same time it shows that friends are vital for the quality of existence. A very twisted, science-based, it is a feeling-good flick, with a heart and good intentions. However, there were a few tricks with "nothing". Both Hewlett and Miller's two main actors played well with their portions, but their characters were almost as attractive as they were fully regarded for our entertainment in just one hour. There are some developments in Dave and Andrew related relations and personality, some backgrounds are given but not enough until the end. A generous audience will eventually sit through a less compelling section of the movie to see it, but the seniors will probably leave very soon. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> David Hewlett and Andrew Miller, both of whom wrote the script's co-author, were a longtime friend of Vinceenzo Nataly: Halot actually played in every film of the drama. Perhaps it was their creative input that led the film to a more positive direction. However, a lot of stories may be involved. Imagine, it will not really happen (for any intelligent purpose), it is officially entertaining considering that, but you feel this feeling that more experienced hands can be done more in this premises. <br /> <br /> Justify all, "nothing" an impressive piece of work in many ways. The idea is attractive, innovative, the script works on the human level, and most of all, it shows progress in the creative mentality of the cure. For his work fans, it would be a pleasure, and for others it would be a great way to pass a small unwanted time. The stability of the director directed by human drama is shameful that it prevents it from being a great, funny movie.
