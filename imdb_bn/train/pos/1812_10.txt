It is sometimes one of the greatest films of all time ever. I've forgotten about 12 years of movie. Until I saw an ad on TV for ADGTH and when it was my little boy, it brought back my favorite memories. And when I saw it a couple of hours ago, I became addicted to the movie. Usually I do not like animated family films, but this is a special, perfect family movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the film always touches my heart and makes me very bad, but this movie is amazingly amazing than all the tricks coming for today's kid films. I mean the movie has been rated G and it is about 2 dogs who are involved in gambling, where they are portrayed in a lot of smoking, drinking alcohol, killing, death and hell. Which I believe is the best movie to make great. I mean, movies can not bring reality to kids today and they have done this movie. <br /> <br /> RIP Judith Barsi and Dom Deloise
