A very well-made movie set in 60th Communist Yugoslavia. Thousands of young actors give strong, heartfelt and emotionally strong performance in the center of the story. Understanding how natural manipulation can be done under the influence of natural faith and sacrifice at a young age and how a restored life affects their lives. Highly recommended.
