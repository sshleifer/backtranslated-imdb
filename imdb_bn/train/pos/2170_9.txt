I think the creators of this movie (s) are probably more beneficial than they ever got. This is not an Oscar career film, but at least for me, this film has had a lasting impact since the return of the movie (Theater) in 1984. <br /> <br /> I do not think it (and it can not be expected) is a mocking, but: Imagine acting on your emotions. The first thing to say about the first words on your lip is to do ... we do not say or say like a restraint, a conscious, intelligent adult, we know that we should not really say or not. If there is anything, this image only scratches the surface - it can not go as far as possible. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, take it to the next level? Can not deal with something a little, or even the original crew, can not deal 20 years ago? <br /> <br /> It's just my opinion. Hey)
