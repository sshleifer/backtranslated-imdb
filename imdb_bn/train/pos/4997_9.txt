This is a great movie for any fan of Hong Kong action films. Its small plot, weak play and comedy antics bits, this film is involved in gun battle and martial arts activities. Finally entertained me from the beginning. I thought Shannon Lee was horrific in the movie. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong's work has been strengthened because of being an action manager like Corey Eunen. This modern action film is highly recommended !!
