Martin Shane, Michelle Phillips, Stuart Margolin, and Der Waiko Moro are the stars of this movie, who is searching for answers to the death of a young man's brother. Mr. Shane, Mr. Margolin and Mr. Moro became the first-rate performance in their respective roles; Miss Filips has done some harmful work in trying to spice up a film made for a movie (twenty five years ago) by providing "sexual interest" to any other sex movie. Real star, however, "California children"; In 1934, "Jack" was placed in front of the camera in a Ford coupe taken from Jackbox and a drill that kept the edge of the seat with the viewer's pants, gasping and breathing. <br /> <br /> The view is spectacular, (though a bit taller in the dialogue) A beautiful evening diversion is made. That's how all "who cinema" should be made. <br /> <br /> Try catching it in the late movie channel; It's a good price to sleep well.
