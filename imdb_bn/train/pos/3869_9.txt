I watched this movie in Vientiane a few years ago, where visitors liked it. I like it, Summer Phoenix performance still hunt me, so why I agreed to write a comment. <br /> <br /> This story was published in London in around 1900, where a Jew decides to become an actress. He tries to become one, but not before a person knows him badly that he realizes on the stage that he has talent and he connects with the audience and appears as a powerful man. <br /> <br /> There were some reviews, its performance was damaged, they could not live their uninterrupted life, they could not bring life to its character. I think this is his strong position, just like Esther Kane should be and Phoenix has made a brave decision to make her ester a boring girl. So it is more powerful than finally being transformed. Cinematography is fantastic, images of London are very dark and sad in the beginning of the century, you can see how unpleasant lives are back. <br /> <br /> In my opinion the only fault is the length of the film, you loose the touch with the characters, it is only about finding the actor, so there is no dramatic work in the film. . This is phoenix credit that we do not reduce interest in movies after the first hour.
