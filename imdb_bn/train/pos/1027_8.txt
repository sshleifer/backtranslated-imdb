I'm not good at writing reviews, so I'll just give my opinion ... <br /> <br /> I like this series first. Adventure, action, comedy, drama ... I thought it was all shiny. Anderson, Tipping, Sank, Judge, Davis ... I love them all. Davis believed that he was the fifth-most important person. nothing much. But at the end of the seventh season, his character (General Hammond) went away and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neil) went to the office from the ground, the quality of the series suddenly got steep. I do not know why it was more important than Hammond that I understood or did, but for some reason, the series has turned into **** in the seventh season. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, though, were awesome. The movie Stargate seemed to be the first for the first time, but it was not the main purpose, even it was a great set of series. I recommend that you first watch the movie, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you will have a completely new perception of it, believe me, secondly), and then watch the TV series. <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but this does not mean they are not good. <br /> <br /> <br /> After finishing this series, do not forget to close the series, Stargate: Atlantis. This is the deserving successor of this great series. Edit <br /> 7-18-08: I died just a few weeks ago Don S. Davis died. This is a great loss.
