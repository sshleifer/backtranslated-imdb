I just saw this movie in HB, and it was really good ... actually a tragic love story! I really lauded that the heart of the story was lost by using its feet in an accident. It is rare to see the love story associated with a physically challenged person. The kind of love that developed between the character and the woman that came into her life beautifully illustrates how I can make a person's heart healthy by the opinions of love. Laura Liton ... At the time of the creation of this movie, everyone was 27 years old ... this woman was so full biography that she could revive the heart of this man. Unfortunately, because of his wealthy family and not his, the "problem" develops. <br /> <br /> This is playing HBO several times this month.
