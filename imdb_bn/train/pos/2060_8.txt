This movie is not your ideal horror movie. This is something shimmery humor and death scenes that can be ridiculous. I personally liked the movie due to the beat of the off-beat. This is definitely not a super-horror movie, if it is good, then you will not be afraid and later become paranoid. I like the performance of the mountainous people and Leicester ... very credible. I think I'll color the red hair like the girl in the square -croll - very cool! However, the overall value of the rental price for campi humor and extraordinary horror experience.
