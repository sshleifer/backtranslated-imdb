Critics need a quality movie as they review the class. I think critics have seen many movies and surrendered to Matrix style of movies. Europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so much layer that a viewing this outstanding film is not enough to understand or appreciate. Lars von Tier shows that old styles of filming can create great movies and create dramas and excitement. The back projection used during the film stimulates the effect and increases the character and focuses on their conversations. He used color and black and white effects in many areas like Hitakoos and the red coat girl draws attention and increases the drama and meaning of the scene. The commentary is gorgeous and has a hypnotic effect, again to maintain focus on the central character of the scene and have actions. <br /> <br /> I could talk about more effects but I believe that all of you agree it will agree on the film itself, and really the film's drama. If you do not already own and you are not, then buy a movie to see it. <br /> <br /> Do not miss this silent movie from the top 10 of the best filmmakers.
