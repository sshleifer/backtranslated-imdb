It is a very strange HK film in many ways. First, the order of action is not so much fun really fun. The very first gun fight happened, the movie was only silly. Not cool, or even funny, but just silly. There is nothing to say that there is no big step view, but most of the films I see are not up to the level of other films. On the contrary, this film is not actually a character. The main characters are attractive (in addition to the bad guys, which are flat as billiard tablets), most of them play well. It is fun to see all the plays in this picture. The conversation is quite diverse, and the translation does not seem to lose much. This picture is valuable to watch, but I hope the unpredictable American audience thinks it's the best HTML offer.
