Bachashi's "Coonskin" is one of the most interesting movies to be classified as, rich writing done to inspire rich writing. He wrote it in collaboration with Scat Man Crothers and Barry White, who was also present in the film. Racist imagery can often be annoying, but the message of the film was so strong that the NAACP gave it an approval (but only mad). <br /> <br /> I am interested in watching this movie a wide spectrum of racism that solves the contentious decision. Wonderful stuff.
