This movie had an interesting cast, it does not have any list but the actors did well in this movie. I'm happy that we have such a B-grade movie, the story is fundamental to the original actor and so on, so you do not need a million dollar budget to make movies, only the list of general artists can be listed and a fundamental plot. I liked the way to them and there was no one around them and what I was interesting was that they did not close a cafe to set the gear and they did everything from a police station. Arnold Vaices and Michael Madison did a great job of filming the role of hostage situations. This is a great movie and I hope to see it more in the future.
