This is truly the greatest Swedish movie of all time. It is not only revolutionary in its description, but it is also among the first films of Swedish humor and the next generation of Swedish comedians. Felix Hernerganen and Friedrich Linstrum are two of the most intelligent and diverse filmmakers of Sweden, and this film is really on display. <br /> <br /> "Voxana Manisco" (adult folk) is a warm heart and funny adult story, and the question is if we would not be better without it.
