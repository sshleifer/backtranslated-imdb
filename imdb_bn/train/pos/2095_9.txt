Let's talk about the use of non-Asian actors playing Asian roles. The movie is 67 years old. In 1937 the studio chiefs believed that any actor would be able to play any role. The actors were under contract, and they did not always have a choice about what role they were. The story ends. <br /> <br /> This is a true epic story of love, individual rights, class level and male / female topics. The centerpiece of the film is Lewis Renaar and Paul Munie's two brilliant performances. <br /> <br /> A Chinese farmer plays Wang, who is going to take a wife (Rainer) in the role of Muni. From the beginning, he treats him with respect, at a time when women look a little more than hired help. Without the film being too far, they all go towards the height and bottom of the relationship, and although in the late 19th / early 20th century the story could happen, the stories and most of them feel believable. <Br /> <br /> The film does not need more than 5-10 minutes, and the performances of Charlie Grapefin and Walter Conley are usually like the 1930s cartoon characters, it's a really extraordinary movie, which, unfortunately, has become a victim of political purity. <br /> <br /> 10
