I like movies Twisted Desire's favorite Jeremy Jordan was one of the best actors of all time. Melissa Joan Heart is a good actress. I saw most of her movies but all Jeremy Jordan's. The thing I dislike about Twidd Desire is that "Nick" is arrested and "Jennifer" rats him. Twisted Disney is my second favorite movie. My first goonies are. But I still love Jeremy Jordan.
