Well, this film is really a difficult one. To keep up with you, this movie does not contain most riveting stories, but if you want to know it's about to end ... but I'll tell you something now ... never. I was yesterday my life! This film guarantees jumps and thrills! To be fair, I saw it in the middle of the night so I was a bit sleepy, so I can explain why I was frustrated ... or whether this photo is provided from that direction! It's basically a couple who are about to lose their child in a tragic event. They look at the mountains and decide to rent the cabin's search ... their first viewers (until they come to the main character's sister and she comes with her husband) looks calm and calm. At night, the man can hear the word ... check it out, and when they really start to go in the wrong way ... they do not stay for another day and tell the couple that they will go around because they are not right ... Cut a long story short ... finally they know what happened in that room over the past few years and decided that it should be taken care of. <br /> <br /> It's not Hollywood blockbuster, it's a huge budget, but please do not let that stop you. It's weird, mythical and very damn! Just try it out :)
