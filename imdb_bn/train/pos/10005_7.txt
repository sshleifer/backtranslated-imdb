Yes it's an art ... to successfully create a slow thriller. <br /> <br /> The story is released in good volumes when you do not even notice it happen. <br /> <br /> Fine acting Robin Williams. The sex cornices of the film may seem unnecessary and you might probably enjoy this movie. However, the original plot is very compelling. The movie does not hold onto you and still grips enough to keep you from being surprised. The direction is good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
