That was definitely the case with Outfield Angels. It was on TV last night and I believe I did not see this movie since my first year in high school and now I am in the fourth year of college. Although the film has many errors, it is so sensitive that you can not help it, sit, watch it and enjoy yourself. It's fun. Ranting of Danny Glover so you can not help but above that high loud smile at the top. It adds film and I'm sure that the director wanted exactly what he wanted. Although the development is not the best, you actually feel for the film characters. A must see. I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
