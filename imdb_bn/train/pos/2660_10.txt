When I first saw The Shining I was expecting a decent film from what I heard and I liked the many works of Stanley Kubrick, but when I started watching it it was a lot better. Occasionally I felt ridiculously uncomfortable and I could not take my eyes on the screen, yet it is very annoying about everything in the film. Now some people do not like the version of The Shining of Kubrick because it does not follow the book of Stephen King entirely, but in my opinion both versions of the Kubrick, the mini series and the book are great. Jack Nicholson gave an amazing performance. If you are looking for a good real movie that will make you think after films, then you will see The Shining.
