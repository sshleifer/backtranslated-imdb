Timman Junior plays about the first American African American Navy Master Diver (Gooding Jr.), who despite all the narrow narrow trainers denied all disagreements and achieved their goals. The screenplay is not bad, sometimes it's a bit extreme, but the direction and acting is the first rate, and this film is inspirational and achieves what it's supposed to do. I love the led D'Niro, though it is not the same as its skillful work (taxi driver, godfather and all others), but it's just as good as comedy kings or other good performances of Angel Hart. DeNiro is always believable and credible here, very good performance, gooding junior bad, certainly one of his best performances. --- IMDb Rating: 6.6, My Ratings: 9/10
