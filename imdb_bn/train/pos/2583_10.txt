Casparov or Fisher's greatest games can be a mess for the total rookie. This is a very nice movie. There is no special organization involved in the plot. This yarn is! It's a private plot, built as a private enterprise. It is a self destructive and a self-organized plot. As a conclusion, the scenario has described the perfect professional plot: personal, self ?? Organized, self destructive, with no trace at the end. Anyone can be behind the plot: a smart "director" with some money. All can be made only by the representatives. The "director" must be just triggered. If ordinary viewers do not see the plot sequence in clear sequences of the movie, then there is less chance of discovering a real plot. Performance of all actors, along with some specifications for Gene Hackman and Mikey Rooney, is well done.
