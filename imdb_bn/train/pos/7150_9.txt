What a great movie! This is a memorable one in the wonderful Disney classic family films of the 60s and 70s. I was very happy, for the last 20 years, Disney's live production sequences have slowed down. <br /> <br /> Enjoy this movie completely. The child was just that; Professional, quality actors. I'm most impressed with the quality of this movie. <br /> <br /> Sijurini Beaver is a complete syncf * Hyperbolt inserted * Run a prison camp for pedestrians. Sion Falun was wonderful as the star's mother. <br /> <br /> I will not reiterate the story here because it has a little point to do it again, but the story is extraordinary, the aspect was awesome and the performance quality was fantastic! This work reminds you how it chooses to be a child, not all sugar or very serious. The deleted view that appeared in the DVD version was really the best left to move left. They were very strict for this movie and they used to get a lot of it. Although misuse is indicating the end product, it has not been shown directly beyond a certain amount. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Fiend :.
