Please see my comment on Die Naibalungen Part 1, please see: Siegfried. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, although the part was a discouraged screenplay of the personal work of heroism, the second one is a chronology of blood chaos on a huge scale. <br /> <br /> On one hand, the director Fritz Lang maintains continuous dynamic rhythm, with increasing speed of action speed and shot composition and with smooth decline as the voice of each scene needs. These pictures should only be seen with a note-perfect Gotfried Hooptz score, which fortunately is in the Buy DVD. Now, with this focus on mass action, it is presented with more challenges in lengthening. The actions of his early features were often badly produced, but now he only creates them as part of the emotional flow, which is the level of activity on the screen, like orchestras swelling. <br /> <br /> As part of this, some people witnessed the fact of Sigfried incident and without excitement, the second part represents war as a devastating tragedy. In both pictures, there is a deliberate lack of emotional connection with the characters. For this reason, Lang keeps the camera out of most of the activities, not letting us feel that we are there (and it is a difference of the work of the laugh because of its involvement with the audience). Actors are unusually dramatic, because actors roam around like sleeping. <br /> <br /> Yet, the revenge of the Cromhild always works with emotions, and is actually deeply humanist. A moment of nature when Atilla holds her baby for the first time, and Lang really insists on the softness of this scene to build it with the terrible journey of the wild. The point is that Lang does not favor us, and in that sense this version is more common with the original version compared to Wagner's opera. The climatic bride is very opposed to a satirical war scene. Why Hitler and colleagues Get a lusty outlook on it, is an incident that badly damaged the fame of these movies? Because the intolerant ethnic ideology of the Nazis allows them to automatically see Nivalong as a good boy, even if they kill the child and betray their relatives. For Hitler, their fall will always be a nationalist tragedy, not human. <br /> <br /> But for us, non-nude viewers, what makes this picture enjoyable is a beautiful concept of patronage and musical style. When you see these fully developed silent pictures of Lang, you can understand how much he has lost in Hollywood. Instead of damping him with the help of a low budget potbelia, he will have to work in some of his sword-and-moon epics, a picture which does not have to be credible and we do not have to be mentally transferred, where it literally sweeps us along the operating tonality.
