I did not expect much from this, but I acknowledge that I was rolling in the sunny land several times during this movie. If you have not paused fairly within the first ten minutes, it could be a film for you. If you are afraid, Amanda Peet will enjoy watching an hour and a half shuffling card. This is certainly not an important part of the comedy, but it is efficient to give low budget indie genesis. In order to compare, on the field of play, imagine that all the studio films with their budgets have been reduced by 100 or more factors and see what you get! To see through this, Kudos from Peter Cohen and his network. I look forward to his next effort.
