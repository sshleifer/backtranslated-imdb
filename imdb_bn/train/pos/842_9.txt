Motherardo is a wonderful, dark ridiculous and suspicious meddram that arises in medievalism, Pierce Brosnan's two very compelling and heartfelt acting, which was never better here, and always reliable Greg Kierner, who has played his best role here, as Jack Nicholson's homosexual neighbor, Playing at et gates. A big plus goes as well as writing. The glossy and occasionally very nasty dialogue is delivered with gusto by Brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two separate individuals is completely convincing all of the ways. The story takes a few unexpected turns and the viewers continually guess where it will go later. <br /> <br /> You do not know how to label the film with excellent artistic touch from the director, such as the good use of music, cute editing and a bit of unreasonable cinematography set by film, and excellent tone for the film. But this is also a very good script, thanks to the viewers (whatever) at the edge of their seats.
