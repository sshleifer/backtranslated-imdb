Trap: The living graveyard brought us to a resort that is now open, and will soon be closed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Somehow, that does not make sense. However, he'll fly a particularly big one, notice when he opened the resort. In spite of his best efforts, the higher authority tells him the end of his day. <br /> <br /> As soon as everyone hopes, a glacier hit. See, I will not publish again, I can say that it was a B-movie that was designed for the channel (which I saw it and it was not an advertisement, it proved a B-Movie ) However, this is a beautiful movie, but it is partly unreal. <br /> <br /> First, when people bury with ice and snow, they will bury. Not just the powder is marked. Or, what about a CD for a screwdriver? This is not possible. And finally, I can not put enough pressure, it's not a blast that can stop a glacier, sure. <br /> <br /> Also, it is for rent or watching TV, but not ownership. 7/10 <br /> <br /> The movie was rated PG, but maybe it should have been a bit stronger. A boy almost lost his legs in the elevator, but his feet were cut in ankle, a person was drawn by electricity and diesel, and in the weighing room, the dead people were almost torn. Enjoy <br /> <br />
