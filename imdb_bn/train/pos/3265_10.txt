I have always had a big Cybill Shepperd fan, since I saw his series a few years ago! This picture certainly shows his best light yet !! The film was cast so wonderfully and played !! Every time he threw a little funny line, just to make the best of what I saw in this picture !! Everyone really makes themselves !! Especially Robert Doni Junior and Sibyl Shepard, they've actually made the real movie !! Mavis lost his wig and I died on the floor, he died! This is the best movie!
