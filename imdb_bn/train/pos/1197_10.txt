I just made a mistake, saw this movie. What a little gem This film, created in 1956, looks like a late Seven Movie movie. And actually better, saying more uninterrupted and accurate, blue soldier. Environmental, anthropological undertones is the way forward ahead of her time. Short screenplay is superb and terrific realistic. More than the Wolves, Volkswagen, The Last Hunt, led to the appearance and feel of the soil "killing field" in the late 1800s. Probably because of those who had genuine murder in the movie. The film was shot during the legal forests managed by Banuulul Cools, so the animals you see are actually being shot, the bones are real. In conclusion, a very low rating Western Masterpiece, superbly played, guided and shot.
