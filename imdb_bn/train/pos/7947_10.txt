I've seen this baby through my kids' hood many times that till now I can see most of the conversations. And when I see it now it just makes me happy and surprisingly still laughs. I wonder how wonderful it was that they were able to train animals especially cats that they were able to play a major role in the feature film. But now seeing it I can unfortunately see that it is not the best composition that it once was. But when I was young at VHS in VHS on my small TV, I felt how I felt in my mind. And remember it's a children's film, so I still have to pay it 10/10.
