My 14 year old people are very happy that they are now able to create fantastic fantasy movies, and they make all the rugs, ring lord, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Noraia loads at the box office. This year will be seen (and already seen), more significantly the Golden Compass, which I have seen this year has the most exciting trailers. Stardust, based on a novel by Blue Guayn, showed this week in the theater, a little more than a pip. I saw no preview for it, only a few ads The kind of critical reaction is blah. I did not see anything open on weekends waiting for a friend to see Bourne Ultimatum, even if I did not see it. Well, if you forgive the terrible punishment, then after going to see the starstasts, they must have been properly appended, and I like it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. Plot line is filled with hurdles to find your very basic imagination (the hero sets out to look for a missing star) But in the original framework, the story is vivid and fantastic. It's just a lot of fun, and a charming little romance to notice. And it's wonderfully successful. There was a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them were so funny about it. Much is going on, but the story has been well-said and almost completely coherent. This is not a great composition, but it can definitely capture the same ground that something like Princess Bride (though I do not like it as the previous movie). If you're a fan of the genre, it'll be a lot of fun here.
