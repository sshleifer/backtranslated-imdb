I have seen this picture in Sky Movies long ago. I must admit, it was a really good Western characteristic of two big names. On one side, Charlton Houston was notorious and retired, Law Minister Samuel Burger. On the other hand .. late James Coburn villain is playing Jav Provo .. burgers are seeking revenge! No cost! <br /> <br /> The best thing about this picture was some really good characters. Most actors have done it really well .. especially James Coburn, who really understood the meaning of this film. But how was he ... <br /> <br /> <br /> I have all the films I saw in the movie .. Playing the Hall Brickman .. I felt that his character was cold, but he managed to get himself under the purse of the Provo, joining with Bergda to get himself back! After all, it was a great movie .. Very good to see .. Great score from late Jerry Goldsmith. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Western personality Wonderful piece ..! 10 out 8
