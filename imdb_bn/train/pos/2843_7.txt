If you are not the mood for more than one hour, then this movie can give you some diversity. I wonder what is going on in love. 'New York I Love You' does not want to continue one or more small films, not just once. Yes, a few short films make you weird, some of them are very small, some of them are long, some of them end it, there is nothing in them. <br /> <br /> Most of the stories present in the capital city are sad sad. It shows different nationality backgrounds. Many of them feel the same feeling that I once went to the capital city of another country for a year where it came from many different countries. This movie explores many things you can know, but it is a new thing for all characters. Maybe you've traveled abroad for some one year or two to feel something new, to meet new people; Dreamy, sad, but saddened that what you are looking for is just because it's annoying you were at your own home. You can reliving it again, seeing it.
