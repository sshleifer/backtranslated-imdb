"Life Stings" is a parody of life and death, happiness and depression. Black and white are always present in our lives. Mail Brooks performance is always as bright, and the performance of other actors is also fine. There are some cappucca smells in this movie, why so good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just ignore him, or When he meets a fun crazy person who believes that Paul Gatti and after that he mocked each other and killed each other. <br /> <br /> Do not you know if you do not see it? <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie tells us about the old and infinite struggle of the poor against the rich. <br /> <br /> The difference between this movie and the reality is that this movie is a happy ending, and no reality. <br /> <br /> Yes, Life Stings.
