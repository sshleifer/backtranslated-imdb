Farhaha Fawcett is superb in this strong 1986 drama, where she played Mergara, a woman who led to flee from rape of rape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />!), had to play with the awesome demands of Margie Joe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To make the right thing and make him a policeman, bites the film more nails. <br /> <br /> I think Diana Squareweed is quite boring, but when Joe finally acknowledges that he came to kill everyone there. , It creates a very emotional part of the real drama. <br /> <br /> Overall, superlatives are a brilliantly thought-provoking and well-liked film and I've seen it hundreds of times! Well done to everyone involved.
