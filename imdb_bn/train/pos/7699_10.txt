The Flobidane Planet is one of the best examples of Hollywood SF movies. Its effect was felt for more than a decade. However, some of the elements related to how this wide-screen entertainment was being watched in the mid-50's, some of the elements that have gone are quite date-wise and sometimes lazy pacing of the film does not help. However, the strong central concept of the story of the ancient, extinct kaleleas and the story of the "ID to monster" has lost its appeal, and the film is considered "relevant to view" the movie as relevant. I'm very interested here to tell here that the current DVD for this movie is terrible. The movie never feels good on home video and it's a terrible need to recover its components. Hope this will happen soon and we can get a special edition of this SF Classic.
