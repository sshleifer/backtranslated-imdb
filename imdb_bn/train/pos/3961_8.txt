This Swedish Swedish king, astronaut artwork from Matt-Helg's Olson. Very rarely a measurement of this measurement has been made in Sweden and it stands as one of the most amazing achievements of Swedish film so far. Who pays for this thing? <br /> <br /> Russian nuclear scientist Markov wants to forgive Sweden. But his plans were destroyed by the Russian army, who kidnapped him and said he came to Sweden. The curiosity to see them is that Markov continued his work in nuclear physics, which would revolutionize the power supply for the entire planet. However, the CIA is forced to get Markov in West Bengal and send her ninja for her release. <br /> <br /> The Swedish actor's practice of English is something that matte-helge has become perfect in his subsequent works. Cheap B-movie feel is probably unfinished for this creation guess. But without this? Good action standard straight-to-video style Fire firing huge clouds of machine guns. Thousands of Russians are dying The black ninja cases are almost running, trying to hide in the ice. <br /> <br /> Although it's genuinely true, the dancer is still fighting. When they say "Ninja" in the title I hope martial arts, I hope for a close fight. But this movie has two or three scenes of the actual martial arts. And they're fun. It's so bad that I lack it to describe the word. If Nija moves at a speed, then their heart will stop. And of course, the whole movie ends in a bank that indicates four food stamps and special effects budgets with McDonald's vouchers. <br /> <br /> What is the verdict? Of course the classic immediately. Sometimes a movie has been created that is so clearly meant to eat with huge amounts of alcohol. This is the extreme party movie. Insert video and smile. Only one has to understand that such a movie is no longer made. This is the history of film. <br /> <br /> So rating 8/10, 1/10 for quality and 10/10 for answer.
