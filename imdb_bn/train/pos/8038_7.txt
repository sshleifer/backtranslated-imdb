Two sniper travels deep into the jungle to find their goal; An inferior South American drug-lord and a prominent general. <br /> <br /> <br /> A little successful to build the atmosphere of the little atmosphere, most of the Sniper accounts are made by a very difficult thriller, it takes time, establishes its character and their misery and climaxing. Some good action sequences. Director Llosa has not always been successful in maintaining psychological mood and can strengthen some stories; Here do not add a lot to some rolling. But this film is much better than its Stallone / Stone Travelli the Specialist. <br /> <br /> Billy Jane, usually unbelievably tedious, is uniquely associated with the sniper expert Benvenger. This photo proved to be the last big budget Hollywood venture for Brenner. He can play such a role in this sleeping and he is very convinced here, dvd sequels direct reprising more than double role.
