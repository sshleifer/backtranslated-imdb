They have a wide range of cast with the amount of actors they are working on the project. Excellent Starship CGI in places but their green screen needs some work. After Effects 7, some have heard that they will buy their keping better. <br /> <br /> The stories are well-thought-out, it has lots of trek elements to keep in the right context. But the idea of ​​kissing two sons led me towards the episode. I'm not homophobic but I can not help that I do not kiss the men (not mind). However ... this is a good thing for a fan series. Brush the acting with their small screen development, and some guidelines rating in this series are stunning. Yet I recommend this series that never enjoyed TNG and DS9.
