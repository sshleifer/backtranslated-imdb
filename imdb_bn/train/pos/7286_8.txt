I had a heck of a good time to see this image, and its more stupid features were nicely amazed. Firstly, the film is undoubtedly made with its cardboard set, limited settings and creative scientific promos. This act plays a titleless role in the title role for the first time with very poor (two striperes), very few professional (as the main person of EVER's Eve), Gothic Overstation (Leslie Daniel of the Assistant Cart), Virginia Lith. His desire for science and desire for his fiancee. Even though the scripting is very good and this type of dialogue is fantastic for a movie. The problems that science and medicine play in our lives and what their borders should be. This image is a thoughtful movie in many ways. However, his real intention is not fooled by too much. This is a lazy story about a man covered with the expertise of a physician science who wants to fuse his dead girlfriend's head together with the perfect body, making both body and soul perfect women for the best man. Another very bright aspect of the film is Sax Music, which makes the city scream for every woman's beauty.
