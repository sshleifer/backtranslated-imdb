I really enjoyed this movie really. (That's why this site got so much ratings from so many users, that surprised me!) I'm not saying that it was a film artist, but it was a great way to spend on cold, snowy Saturday night. It's fun, tragic, and uphill stories of tough friendships and bad things that make women friends behave badly with each other! (Encourage women, we were all there!) Bill Paterson such as Rev. Gerald Mursden and Andy McDowell proved that if the role is correct, she can be a good actress and she keeps her mind. (And indeed, I have never seen this movie or dreamed of the best "wedding turn" ... which is more frustrating than what I ever know!) You will smile and cry - ignore a marketing campaign and how this movie is being marketed .... This is a hidden gem that tones the box office. (Now I have to look closer to buying a copy!)
