I totally agree that "nothing" is a fantastic movie! I did not laugh so much while watching movies for ages! And David Hewlett and Andrew Miller are fantastic! They really work well together! This picture can not appeal to some people (I'm not really telling why it's spoiled!) But everyone is their own! I like it and highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The guidelines are great and some shots are very clever. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To make the film enjoyable.
