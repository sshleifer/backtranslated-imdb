The accusation of a Chinese scholar who had criticized the violent nationalist of making the rigid critique of the ruler of Japan's ex-Japan emperor, who was accused of being a 'communist' and lodged in jail for life. His loving wife, who fully supports her husband and her ideas, goes alone to save his family from hunger. This movie is a huge statue created to praise the role of soil in the history of mankind. Sayedee Joshinaga is not less than the superiority of the title, and it was a memorable scandal that she did not get Asian Oscar in 2009 to achieve her best female role. It gave a young girl very limited acting ability. <br /> <br /> This deeply moving and most 'human' feature must be seen for all true children on earth.
