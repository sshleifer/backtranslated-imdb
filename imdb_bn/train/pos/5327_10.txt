As an intelligent fan I recommend this film as events and faithfully played. As a 11-year-old resident of Istanbul, I'm talking about some friends about a new music sensation that screams to women. I thought Humami, if girls are like them, they must be desperate. Until then, my record was Halley Mills, The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. Soon after leaving the family with Ismail's military cafeteria, I heard a song (which I later came to know about 'love me') and after that it was fixed by the difference between what I had ever heard. When I heard my older brother's 'Meet the Beatles' album, there was a quarrel for my life. I was surprised to read a specific book of their beginning (by Davis) that the film followed the events except for most sex and some drug use (it touched on the use of meddrien / decandery)). >
