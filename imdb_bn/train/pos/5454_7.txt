It is one of the most courageous and important among the so-called "pre-code" films made in Hollywood in the 1930s. Similar to some sometimes duplicated images of pre-code films in topics that have not been allowed after 1934-5, this movie starts completely from the start and drowns itself in a very important but entertaining plot. The traditional morality of this film was not clear at the end of the 30's and 40's, because the film is about a convincing woman who can sleep on her way - and does not ask for forgiveness from the road. Both of these "wide" both enjoyed sex and used it to everyone who could help him to be wealthy - something that you did not see in films made after two or three years only. <br /> <br /> <br /> Barber Stanwick is working on his father's speaker. In addition to his boss, he also gave his pumps and encouraged him to sleep with the local government officer so that he allowed the illegal bar to be convicted. Although it is not particularly clear here, it seems that Daddy has rented his daughter's body for a long time "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its nitty-gritty, Barbara was just enough and big city head, it still hurt and killed her father, but she feels that she is disturbing herself and for her There was nothing to show that it was about to move. <br /> <br /> Despite depression, Barbara A huge mega bank uses sex to get a job, she starts with a beautiful girl job like a file clerk, but for some weeks she feels like she could sleep somewhere else within one hour - until she is sleeping on the bank's head and His future son-in-law !!! All this ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem to shook too much on the death of these two men. Later, he was able to move in a new CEO, and once again topped (possibly more than one). <br /> <br /> So far, it's a wonderful film, because it was so wonderful and unexpected. 100% Society of Barbara - A woman has no morals and no conscience - just as much as she wants to breathe out of life, because she does not mind hurting any process. However, brave writers and producers feel important to deal with "chicken out" and a redemptive ending. This woman feels so bad and sincere, ultimately her heart changes a big disappointment and strongly refrains from film. In many ways, it reminds me of ending jejbal - once again, a wicked man changes "light" and turns into a very traitor conclusion in any way. <br /> <br /> I would like to see the red headache and the dinestarai. Redheaded bomb is much like a baby face but ultimately there is no magical transformation feature - the main woman is really a pillar deep! In Denstars, the film is as much of a red-headed woman, the roles are reversed, and one man (John Gilbert) manages the same congratulatory character. Both are classic and somewhat better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fantastic time for most of the ultra-lazy Hollywood movies, and in this light it is suitable for cinephills. Also, Duke's fans take notes - John Wayne plays a very small part in the film and at the very young age, Wayne is so unusual to play a common role.
