Based on the book written by T. de Krebbe, 'De Groot' is a terrific Dutch thriller. Another book, 'Het Gauden EE', was created in the famous Dutch Mystery Thriller 'Spurlos' ('The Vanishing') in 1988. It's not as good as this thriller (though the American remake is also called 'Vanishing') but it comes back over and over again. <br /> <br /> Especially the opening moments are cool. We see a man, after which we have learned his name, Ign Wager (Fadza Van Hoet), coming from a plane in Thailand. When he picked up his bag, it is clear that he is smuggling across the border. These scenes are perfectly directed, photographed and played. A kind of suspense is created which you will not normally be in such an opening scene. Later we saw how Egan contracted with a woman in Thailand, both say that they did not do such things. <br /> <br /> The movie is constantly flashbacks and flash-forward We see Egon, still a child (played here by Eric van der Horst), a friend of Axel (as a child of Benja Brisinger) We learn how they become friends, how big, and how Excel (as an adult managed by Marcel Henessa) has become a criminal. Meanwhile, Egan goes to college and settles with a woman. Often he meets Excel but does not want to do anything with him. <br /> <br /> The movie is growing. It shows Egon and Excel as kids, young students, young adults, and in their mid-30s. But from time to time, as I said, when the children go back to the movie and move on again. Whenever we look at them as kids, they explain something that they are adults. <br /> <br /> here is a small loss. <br /> <br /> The title means 'cave', and it is the cave that gives its happy ending to the movie, although it is not really that happy. Like the start, the last horrible. The middle part of the movie is entertaining, and it distorts our attention in the first scene in a way that eventually comes back to that point. This is an edit which gives her a happy ending to the movie, though we can say that the dramatic ending is also happy by the way.
