Just came back from the basic institute of Basic Instinct 2. I thought this preview would be desperate based on the critics and I was happy! If you like the Basic Basic Institute, I think you will enjoy 22 more, not as much as The great story that always keeps you wondering and thinking. The music is fantastic, reprising the original theme. Do not expect academy prize ingredients, go see it for fun and fun. That movie is built for - escapism. I can not think of a better way than to run away with Sharon Stone. I'm thinking about going to see this weekend again. See it!
