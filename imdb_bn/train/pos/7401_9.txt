I find it very interesting that the film was actually managed to maintain the distinction between my own American culture and originators, that is, the Chinese. It becomes a story about value, and the observer can rebuild their own preferences in life and obey the organizations. Surprisingly enough, it was managed to do it in a gentle, gentle, ridiculous way, which only threatens the sensation of the rejection of its condition. I enjoyed the movie, and if I could, I would have seen it again.
