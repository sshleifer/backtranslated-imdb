What a wonderful surprise: a Disney DTV (directly on the video) that's really good. "Lion King 1 1/2" is a comedy affair which involves everyone's favorite Mirror and Worth, Timon and Pumba. It starts with seeing the original movie and commenting, until Timon complains that "we are not here yet". After the war on the remote, Timon and Pumbaa decided to tell the audience "their story". They started new movies, and smile started. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I was losing hope in Disney. Most of their direct video rentals have been aggressively scary, mainly on the lines of the story, are cashless. "1 1/2" decides to try something different: it tells the original story from a new perspective. Okay, it adds some things, like Timon came and how and Pumba met, but it's a fun idea. Nathan Lane and Arne Sabella have completely restored bonds and friendships that make us love them in the first movie. There are also some handsome movie parodies (including a scene called "The Good, the Bad, and The Augley" and a scene called "Cool Hand Look") and this script is filled with funny memorable lines. <br /> <br /> Julie Cavner ("The Simpsons") is a mother of Timon's thoughts and Jerry Steele, like Dimona's little crazy Uncle Mac, for the cast. Matthew Bradyk looks as Simba, and his "teenage" scene reminds me of Feris Buller. Everyone is good, especially Robert Gilham (how do you spell it?) Like Rafiqi, who has even more spoken in this movie (Timon has commented this many times). <br /> <br /> 'Lion King 1 1/2' Choosing the perfect alternative to exhausting your animation's shikkikation. 10/10
