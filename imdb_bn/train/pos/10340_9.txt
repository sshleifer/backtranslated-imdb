Although this movie came a year before my birth, it was one of my favorite comedies. As a father trying to understand Red Fox as his father's peer Like most parents, they do not know what they mean to be gay and they have these stereootic ideas as gay people. His son, Norman, now grew up in his own life. When his father Ben learned that his son, Gay, he fulfilled his hope of changing his son. The movie comes from one of the most fun lines in this movie - when Ben gets in the apartment of Norman, he goes to a prostitute and thinks that it dragged her boy ("Norman ... what is this?"). There was a smile from the beginning of the movie. Redd Foxx is great. Although most of the materials are stereotyptical, then there is no objectionable way to handle the material and it also has a good finish. Highly recommended.
