Repetition: This is the case in Tanzaro's casino business as usual. The casino is closed and the next day is ready for a big deal. Owner Louche and some employees leave for the night, leave the charge of the modesty. Suddenly an armed gangster attacked an army casino, fired fiercely. Unknown to entertaining, they've already killed people, and now after the hidden money in the vault. But someone in the casino does not know the code to open, and still open, open the Vault. Vault itself is very stupid to be trapped with explosives so attackers can not blow the door as planned. Suddenly, the leader of the Modesty Gangsters, watching the game of Roulette engaging Miklos with his eyes, kept his eye on his eyes. <br /> <br /> Comment: This is a review that is not written with any relation to the other published media Modesty Blaise, since I have not seen or read it. The first point I want to do is to classify this slightly wrongly. Most I think it was a thriller with the Battle of the Wight as the main plot of Modesi and Michalos. Of course, there are some explosions in action, but they are not really an integral part of the story. <br /> <br /> The main plot and the main cryptic filled scene are mentioned in the game, and Miklos in Moderator. This is an innovative and interesting way to express the background of a character, and this story happens much later in the casinos. Some have said that this is almost like a pilot for the TV series, and the feeling is that it can actually be used this way. But, I felt that this is a better way to introduce a character than another. I was not frustrated because of lack of action, instead I enjoyed this game, the history is much more than a normal action movie. <br /> <br /> I think two major stars, Alexander Staden and Nicolas Costaar-Waldo are very good. Staden has specially portrayed Moddie very well and has really carried this confident and gifted character. <br /> <br /> 7/10
