Looking back at the last 28 years (after the first publication of my show), what I can say is that once you get it once - it will be with you forever. I think my initial reaction is: 1) Overacted annoying, 2) produced 3) Unlike characters <br /> Well, two years later I saw some episode again and it was not found almost annoying. One year later I was able to catch the whole series from the beginning and quickly became mad at the varied stories of happiness and perspective of the people. Yes, the show is a style that is not for everyone, and I'm sure the date data value will be hard to deal with nowadays. But, I still think at least once a month, a lazy lazy eye, which seems like an easy time for a long time ... <br /> <br /> BTW I'm a married man ... (For those who think that A show for women)
