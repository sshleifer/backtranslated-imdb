I have read most of the comments posted here and I can say that most of these posters are the main problems of life. This show, unlike most game shows, was unlike. Mr. Shatan, which he was all that hit the show's brill, again. He actually shines like a beacon of bubbling personality where he goes. She makes fun and makes you smile and shows exactly what she does. Dancers and questions, round about fashion they are only added to the show appeal. And although it's a great deal of great money. Existing stress (pressure) on most game shows does not exist here. How many people who have posted the message saved time with dancers and selected questions, and do not have time for C-TimeWesters like Millionaire. I can say that most of you miss the whole idea. The idea here is fun and pleasing yourself. There's something for everyone. Wrestling to test your knowledge, eye candy, mystery, Mrs. Shatner's wonderful fun-filled personality ... If it is not torn then I feel bad for you; And if not enough, you can get rich! I really miss the show. From all the games that have ever been, and looks to be quite stiff, I hate the show on the show, this is I really loved and really miss. The only other game I ever played was match match game.
