Yes, this is another great magician Muppate film and I worship them all; Characters, movies, TV show episodes (this is the best comedy or musical TV show ever) and all the artists behind it. But here they made such a terrible mistake and I must be talking about the wonderful ending !! <br /> <br /> I think it's a much more reasonable, American drama, and love is lost in love by marriage! We, all the poor visitors, feel so annoyed or can be happy in the absence of his grief, absence and suffering! So we all enjoy these stories that collect two intelligent heroes in love with two couples, without valid bond like Mickey Mouse and Mini, Superman and Lowes Lane, Dick Tracy and Tess. Therefore, all previous couples and their choices I believe you feel secure, peace and peace. So when you are already working with the makers of this movie you will be crazy like me! <br /> <br /> They married the poorly poisonous creatures (Kemit) with her nightmares, the most painful woman of all time (Miss Piggy)! This is a historic change by the steps of the American entertainment industry! And it was quite normal for the negative impact on the audience, who refused to be blessed or just believed or suddenly got married (even during the time of the frogs or the right things to think or decide!). Therefore, when you know that this movie has made serious problems with their cinematic, five years ago, the first one (The Muppate Movie ?, 1979) earned more than 2.5 million by earning more than 65 million! <br /> <br /> They just took Manhattan in this movie, and my rest!
