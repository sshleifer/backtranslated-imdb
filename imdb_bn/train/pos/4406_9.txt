Curiously, this movie did not create it on the big screen in Denmark, so I had to wait for the video to be released. My expectations are high but they are frustrated in any way. Always played superb with Anne Lee, an intelligent and thrilling plot that guides you until the ending and gorgeous filming. Along with Unforgiven, two of the best 90's of the 90's are the best Westerns <br /> <br /> Those who are pathetic (corny) or Braveheart (acceptable) will be sourly hoping something along the Mel Gibson line, others who appreciate the above mentioned qualities A fantastic time will be watching it. 10 out of 9
