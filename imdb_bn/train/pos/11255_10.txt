It is doubtless without my favorite Ley Carr novel, and all the love and care it wants is transformed into a silver screen. I have read a review on this site which seems to be offensive to the characters but I think it misses the point. All the stories of Le Carre essentially love the story and this is no exception. It is a perfect reflection of the time in which it is set. Betrayal is not good for anyone. PIM upbringing is so close to my own that I find it cooler. Peter Egan mourneded his best role and late Ray McAnally is incredibly good. Andy De La Tour, Tim Hailey and Jack Ellis, also played a small role. This is a theater Impresario's Dream cast. The story should not be spoiled by a poorly informed story, but it is sufficient to think that it is slow but unexpected destruction with a young slogan and descendents of espionage and rebellion. All my sympathies are related to his only (non-sexual) love for Magnus Pim and Poppi. (Rudiger Weigang - always surprising - his only true friendship, but another by the definition is another among the long lines of betrayal. Insufficient! Rent it, buy it.
