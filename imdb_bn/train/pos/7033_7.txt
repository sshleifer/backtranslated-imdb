After all, do not call it a 'rimak' of 63 pictures. Although this version is great for staging, it is too long. Welding was good with some exceptions. Chinese Phillips did not like cutting well. He was about 30 years old when he did the film and it was difficult to believe that he was a teenager. Jason Alexander was a good choice, but after a while he gave me headache. Taie Daley overdoes her part as ladder peterson. George Weindert Harry was funny like McAfee, and showed that he could even catch the tune. Like '63 photo, they were unknown to play Cordad Birdi. Mark Kodish had fun with his role as Birdi and it was shown. I even have soundtracks and I love listening to his songs. So what is this a tv ratings flop? It was long for one. They kept in new songs and scenes. Although some new songs were good (like "let's set up"), was it really necessary? Now do not make me wrong, I like it, but instead I see the movie '63 (see my review). This was just a lawsuit overdoing some actors, some changes, and again, LENGTH. Another thing I have forgotten to mention was Vanessa Williams. She does a good job with introduction and music. Give him a song and he can sing them So here my suggestion has been produced by a couple by Baidi couple: If you want to see an entertaining step for this game, then see the movie '63. If you want to see a version that is genuine for the game, see '95 version. Just take it to restraint even though. Do not be heroes and sit together and sit together.
