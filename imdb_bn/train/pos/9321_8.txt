Go as romantic comedies, this is a cute and winner. I thought the writing could be strong enough to build a final connection, but this is not a huge tripping point. However, Amanda Dieter and Scott Wolf gave excellent performance and were as charming as before. These two were my favorite actors, and I was just happy to see them cast as romantic Lead. I hope to see them throwing in more projects soon. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but it is sweet, warm and winner. Not bad things at all.
