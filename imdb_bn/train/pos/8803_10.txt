I recently saw this Sundance channel. The idea of ​​the film was that many filmmakers, famous for their own country, making small films, 11 of them, in one film, focus only on one thing: September 11. <br /> <br /> <br /> I can tell the film why these filmmakers were great in their country because it was all the elements of a great movie. <br /> <br /> This image starts with a film in Iran, where a teacher struggles to teach the students. What happened with the September 11th they failed to grasp until now. <br /> <br /> The second movie in France involves a deaf woman, who is angry with her to write letters to her boyfriend, though she is aware of what she is going on TV. Plays <br /> <br /> In the next film of Egypt, filmmakers talking to a deceased soldier related to the bombings in other places, not for terrorists, but for the recent events of themselves. <br /> <br /> Next comes from Bolivia where a girl can learn about events on September 11 and believes that they must travel for them. <br /> <br /> From a country in Africa where a group of boys follows a man, whom they believe to be bin Laden. <br /> <br /> Next comes from Mexico which does not show anything but the words of that day. <br /> <br /> A reporter involved in a bomb explosion tried to get a report from Israel later, but the attack was often called. <br /> <br /> Another picture I can do is not to remember at this moment but all of them are strong. It will bring back your emotions from those days. <br /> <br /> 10/10
