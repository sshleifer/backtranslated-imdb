Deodato takes some desperately shocking moments and a movie which does not take itself very seriously. It's a classic of its own kind. This movie offers a refreshingly distinct look at barbarians. If you get a chance to see this movie. You will certainly have a smile at your mouth most of the time. Because it's not funny or any kind of monkey, but it's so bad that it goes in other ways and gets better, though it may not be fun, fun.
