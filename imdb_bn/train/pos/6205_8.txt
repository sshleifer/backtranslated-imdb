Transformed, dissatisfied and impossible, Phey is difficult to fit through the Gry but Parker is really the only actress who can take this story and run with it. Once he touches, funny, tricky. Supporting actors are also committed to it. <br /> <br /> I will not even try to tell you this plot .. It is related to the characters of Hartley's Henry Flower and tries to international intelligence. <br /> <br /> If you are walking with it then the film works well-it is understood. In a sense, completely ridiculous. As it plod along with it became more and more ridiculous. (I resisted the temptation to close the DVD twice). <br /> <br /> There is a bold film-gear for Faye Grim who is willing to deal with something that is not cookie-cutting. At the end, it offers something that defies the description.
