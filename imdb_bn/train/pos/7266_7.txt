I remember having a pretty low esteem for an initiative when I first released. James "Not Jim" Belushi, Hammy Baby Actress, and a Chasey title for John Hughes. You could not pay me to see it 15 years ago. However, I was caught on Sunday afternoon to see it during the abduction, and it hit me a few levels. Fairy tale (part is beautiful woman, part contrasting beautiful woman), very weak, Elizabeth_ Perkins_in_Miracle_On_42nd_Street-like performance, shirted by Kelly Linch, escapism. Over all, it pulls some very nice strings slowly. A crash developer on Kelly Linch, identifying with James Bellusy, disliking a bad guy's boyfriend, and smiling at Karl Suay lines is very difficult. All up and downs, a happy ending, and kind of kind of kind you want to listen to. Go ahead, this movie is your time wasted, it's worth it.
