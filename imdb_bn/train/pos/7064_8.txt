Deba Durbin is truly able to save Universal from bankruptcy and it is a great studio. In the middle of the 30's, Universal such as Milestones, Browning and Wiley's greatest director Dr. Not only did James remain hello but his dignified horror movie was behind him. Dena and Judy Garland were shown in a brief "Every Sunday" and Garland was initially advised for the role of Penny of "Three Smart Girls". When the Garland was unavailable to the public Durbin switch. Initially, he was clearly a supporter, but his feasibility was so obvious that the script was rewritten to make him the star. This film directed by Henry Custer was a European touch. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a beautiful panorama of a lake of "Switzerland". "Three Smart Girls" of the title - Three sisters, Joan (Nan Gray), K (Barbara Reid) and Penny (Dina Durbin) are fleeing with her glorious voice to "sing my heart" to Penny. Not everyone is very good at the Home Front - their parents are planning to remarry a little lady (Biny Barnes) so that three girls will go to New York with the help of her trusted nurse (Lucille Watson) and reconnect with their mother. . Lossil Watson is considered to be best off on Robert Wallace's role in the "Waterloo Bridge" (1941). <br /> <br /> <br /> Doona is a gold digger who is married to her drunken mother (Alice Brady) Jadson Kraig (Charles Winnar). For someone with a movie experience, Ana Penny is a wonderful, usually pesky, passionate kid sister and she's as beautiful as a picture. When he sang his father "someone to take care of me" he would be melting - did he have glorious voices. She has the most fun lines in the film. When his father asked him to "take him to the zoo tomorrow", he said, "oh I can see a lot of monkeys here!" <br /> <br /> <br /> They decided to hire Donna Romance a "count" (Mischa Auer). They arranged to meet at a nightclub, but due to the mix-up Lord Michael Stewart (Raymond), the count was wrong and Donna fell for him (he thinks he owns half of Australia !!!) This plan will return to him and Donna jadson Together with her wants to marry. <br /> <br /> Penny agreed to decide on something with her own hands. He was taken to the local police station where he was trying to "il basho" (he was trying to convince them as a young opera singer). Everything ends happily with their mother (Neela Walker) fleeing from the patch. Uploads items with their father, and in this case, Dona Foni counting (Mischa Eye) is known and moved to Australia with her in Australia. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
