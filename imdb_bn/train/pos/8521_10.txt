I absolutely like this show. It was seen at the end of the first generation since its inception in the early 90's. My honest opinion is that this is an extraordinary family drama which is so rare these days. Of course you can meet with a friend or your children, a show. Yes, we have finally changed a bit with Joe after watching the books, but it's still a great story and a good lesson for good lessons. Acting as acting actor, Joe Barah (Michel Burke), acted as a performer acting Nick Riley (Spencer Rockford), we can see and read Nick, as well as developing romance between daily stories and lessons. Kids and students learn I recommend this show to anyone
