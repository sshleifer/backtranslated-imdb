I'm really surprised how this show left the UK and Europe. It's volunteer to be an American (especially white Americans) That this fever can be a big cause for some toxicity and vitriol expressed herein. I love Shoke but with some reservations and I think it's a simple way of Spoller Spollar: <br /> <br /> At the end of the second season, everything is destroyed and burning. Julie closed the door to any hope of reviving the show until some of the events occurred in the middle of a haistack. Who knows? It was a fun, messy and occasional, mad scary show.
