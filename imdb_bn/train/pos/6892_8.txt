The closest to me that came to see, was a clip shown two years before the release of Gerard Filip of Paris. There was no interest in my resurrection and only after the creation of this half-century I was caught, I could only conclude that the fenced fence was deliberate, it was the goal of a long-sighted target. Hollywood was fighting for a realistic sword from the 30th when the greatest of them, Basil Rothbone, Errol Flynn and others crossed the foil so that the technology was available and so that only mock. After some time you did not know about Henry Jinson's conversation and reminded both versions of Jeddah. Gerard Phillip was certainly present to bring such a role, and Gina Lallabrgrida was probably better than Martin Carroll, then another candid candidate. I saw the print was particularly bad and broke completely at one point, so perhaps a DVD version would improve it.
