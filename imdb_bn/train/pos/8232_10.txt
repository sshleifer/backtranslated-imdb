Opera, the greatest Greek comedy series ever! Lepheteris Papapetro wrote and the great title of Antonius Ageloloolosso Soso, Alexos, Flora, Achilleas, Dada Aristides, Machi, Johnny, Corina, and Mikhiles have been directed! In some languages, Alecos is married to Sosso, a native of a district in the center of Athens. One day he met his old date Flora, who has now married Achillas and is living with his father-in-law and his caretaker Machi Machi. There is also a boy named Johnny who appears at the end of the first era and at the end of the second second. The other major characters are Mikhalis, assistant assistant to Alexandros and two sex workers and Corina, lost sister of Achilles, who is the best prostitute in whole Athens. The main story of the series is the reason for Siso's attempt to kill Alex, because he is cheating on her, but all the things happening in it are of little importance. Excellent picture, poisonous quote, Aw esome performance and a great instruction. The main idea and especially the shootings were for some of the first time Greek television series in Greek television, e.g. The water below the scene! Of course a cereal will not stop you enjoying!
