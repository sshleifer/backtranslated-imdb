Yes, Keaton seems to have really enjoyed this picture. With a skip on his step in his favorite pin-striped case, he will remind Jimmy Cagan! Johnny (Keton) Hood Hood, who can pay for his mother's high value medical bills and send her younger brother (Griffin Dunne) law school. Johnny Kelly does not even know after Johnny Scandal until the film is in. Joe Piscopo is Vermin and Johnny does not like one bit (and I do not like Vermin). Marilu Henna has an excellent song / dance routine when Johnny revels in it. They are in a moving gate car, I love it! That the police are calling "all the cars" are the captain from the island of Gilgit! See this for gangster 1930s laugh! This photo is lovely but you have to catch them or you will miss them! See each scene in the background.
