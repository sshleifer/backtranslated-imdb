Such a documentary is often given a lot of opinion. This image takes all the opinions and determines what to do with the information given to the viewer. It is tragic to work on these poor people, this picture works a great way to show the ugly side of sweat shops. Movie Mardi Gras: Made in Want China was a great way to show something less like a mat for an event that could affect the lives of one of the world's people. <br /> <br /> I was watching it for an English class where we were talking while in the sweat shop and some people were trying to eradicate them and this film helped to roll the subject. This is a great, very informative movie and I want to recommend it to anyone, it opens your eyes.
