'Friends and alienate locks house to house' is an entertaining, if loose, adaptation of Toby Young's memoir of the same name. It's a great heading to help meet the LINE requirements on IMDb reviews! The main events are dramatically similar to those of the book with similar events, but a romantic plot is added and the last one is Hollywood. Simon Pegg, despite playing an essential irritating person, carries his usual favorite and funny self and mostly films. Just a few years ago, there was a strange TV sitcom, and now she is shaking with the name of Hollywood. There is a good supporter cast and it's a fun, easy watch - a male 'firewood betty' kind, but fun.
