If you say something negative about a Chinese ghost story, a nice joke is a wonderful composition, a great essay of romance, it is also seen with special effects compared to modern technology. The film has a general consistency: a poor debt collector should be in an isolated area while trying to collect the loan. <br /> <br /> I do not expect this picture for the first time that it is the story of any sensitive love that I have ever seen; That is losing without losing the slapstick comedy that you have in the stitches. Unlike some of the Asian movies, a Chinese ghost story is not difficult for Chinese people who do not know Chinese Chinese culture. In fact, it is unusual and plays romantic, culturally unmatched themes. <br /> <br /> If they mix the wonderful love story, then remember Evil Dead 2. This picture is for real, despite ignoring by many. It's absolutely the one in the best I've ever seen It's the ability to combine the best aspects of multiple styles, and the ability to cross the cultural boundaries to apply to humanity everywhere is not great. Highly recommended, 10/10
