I do not understand why the reviews of this movie are universally bad, unless I am just outside my Rockstar I found it sick, bright, twisted, and mentally sophisticated. You will not get a criminal psychopath deeper than this in a Hollywood film. It has levels in the level, played by the Stone, nuanced, and a plot that it will guess even after it ends. Sharon Stone will have to capture the man at the age of 48, and Michael Douglas is not like that. I predict that this movie will be huge hit on DVD and once people see it for it, and drill will not stop paying attention to professional reviewers. Give it a shot, you may be glad!
