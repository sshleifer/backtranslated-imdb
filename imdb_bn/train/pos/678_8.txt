The first international success of Peter Weike, The West Wave is an effective killer with a captivating back story based primarily on indigenous myths. Richard Chamberlain gives good performance as a defense lawyer whose life continues to grow from reality because he is deeply distraught in a murder case involving indigenous tribal rivals. David Gulpill is playing one of the suspects, who tried his best to guide Chamberlain through the reign of 'Dreamtime', an alternative reality / timeline center for local Australian history and tribal custom. Heavy in the atmosphere, deliberately flawed in the plot, the film produces helpless finl, which is reduced by some bad effects, probably due to budget constraints. However, a mysterious film whose mystery and fear that we feel as 'reality', will be with you just under the scary hiding.
