I'm a rather pedestrian with a little rather taste. However, I occasionally tried to raise the bar over my cultural awareness. This movie was one of my efforts. I was scared throughout the movie. I liked it very much that I got my own tape so I could see it again. This is a very thoughtful and mentally attractive movie. I saw the viewer as a huge question: What is the depth of sacrifice, to accept acceptance after one, can be said to accept, should be accepted? As a military member, it is certainly an important question to me. This question is very valuable on the audience of this movie. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
