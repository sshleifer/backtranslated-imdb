This is a true character and story-based drama that covers most of what we see on TV at a level. <br /> <br /> I was really impressed from the beginning. If you do not have any scientific substance (such as my ...) it may happen in the world, it has made it more attractive in the other galaxy. There is no space ship or laser gun (no one yet) I have seen till now s01 e04 and I'm trapped and wonder what's going to happen next. <br /> <br /> <br /> The role with throw pasion play there. Eric Stoltz is particularly strong. <br /> <br /> This show is really good, if you have not seen or have not seen the BSG, it does not matter, they are actually quite different. I have read some negative reviews from science facebook who hoped for less drama, more aliens and ray guns but I ignored them. <br /> <br /> This is a really positive start of a show. Hopefully they will not show this day well after 1 or 2 seasons, which they generally look like.
