I liked this picture a lot. It's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, perfect car-chasing your brain worker movie. Many background letters and motivation sticks are unclear, the audience is going to make their own decisions. The director looks nice to see a movie that allows viewers to create their own minds. <br /> <br /> Finally he is inspired by love or vengeance - he does what he does. "Right" 'Will God ever forgive us for what we did?' It can not answer a question-and-answer man - so he does what he wants to do, he does whatever he can, what he can do for what he can do. <br /> <br /> Danzell Washington is a great actor - I can not really think of a bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supportive cast. I would recommend this movie thoroughly.
