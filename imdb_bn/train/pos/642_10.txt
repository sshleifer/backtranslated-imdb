Four years ago, a friend of my French film friend had dragged me. <br /> <br /> For the first half hour I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat in Hollywood's New Beverly theater, hated this picture, I hated myself and even hated French actress. And then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened but I'm dragging in the film as if I was not for years. And despite one of these projectors broke and they had to change each by hand. I was in the theater for about four hours, but it was valuable. <br /> <br /> I believe that great movies allow you to drag in the world, make you a part of it and leave you to talk to your friends on coffee or water. This image did that. It is one of the best filming experiences I have ever had. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
