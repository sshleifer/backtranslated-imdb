This movie takes you another time while taking it at different speeds in everyday life. We got an idea of ​​how the family had to deal with the war and how we sent a young man to the war. A very sensitive look in the past and a reminder that the damage to war does not just happen in front. <br /> <br /> Thankfully, many of us went through a war hour of our grandparents, grandparents or parents who want to do. This picture, I think, is a small thank you. Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter O'Wowel and Russell Crowe is absolutely impressive and he can be as Australian. He must have heard the word "high flight" and he wonders what he can do with Shakespeare.
