I saw this picture several times in the 90's and almost every time the laugh is divided on my side. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is something else. He is so funny Even p. C. Brigades will find this delightful. It's a sure clock, and even better if you've got guys or girls for a drink. It's like taking Michael Jackson, if you close your eyes, believe that it sings. The descriptions he describes are true for life and if you were not funny, it seemed that you had to bypass a humor. My local video stores do not stock this video, but my husband and boys love to get me to hand in copying to show when they can make old-age humor. However, highly recommended, hope to enjoy you.
