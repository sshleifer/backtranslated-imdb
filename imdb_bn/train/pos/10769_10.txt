I love Monte Carlo and I've enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I thought everyone was very good. I was not familiar with Richard Lewis, I thought he had his character (Julian Peters) very personal, interesting and interesting. Swan Young was good with the heart of the rebel girl very good. George Hamilton was captivating and perfect Italian gigolo. John Candy has field days as a forest lively. James Belushi raids as a total quarrel. Cybill Shepard gave a very poor performance as a beautiful weakened housewife. Delightful ensemble cast. Lots of genius, cute scripts, a lot going and beautiful location. Just pick me a nice day for a nice day. Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere in your horizon.
