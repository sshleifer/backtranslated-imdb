This collection of eleven short stories in a movie is a great idea, and some great categories represent, but some frustrating surprises. Eleven directors were invited to give their views on the American tragedy, based on the tragic incident of the United States 11 September 2001. The result of most of them is not just sympathy for the American people, but mainly for culture and people with intolerance of the world. <br /> <br /> Kane Loch (UK) represents the best division. On September 11, 1973, in Chile, when Salvador Allinde's democratic government was defeated by the dictator Augusto Pinocch with the support of the United States. <br /> <br /> Another nice part is Yusuf Chahain (Egypt) to show intolerance and the number of hunters in different countries with contemporary history; And Mira Nair (India) one, has shown the true story of ancestor and ancestor against the Pakistani family, whose son was actually accused of terrorism in the United States, when he was really a hero. <br /> <br /> Some sections are beautiful: Samira Makhmalbaf (Iran) innocent Afghan refugee prepares a troubled refuge against child bomb attacks, when their teacher tries to explain what happened on the other side of the world; Romantic Claude Lail ouch (France) shows the life of a couple in New York near the WTC; Danis Tanovic (Bosnia-Herzegovina) shows a small position and the effect of their fight on the solo protest of the widows; Shan Pen is very poetic, shows that life shows; And the story of Shohi Imamura is perhaps the most fascinating, which shows that any holy war but sadness and humiliation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > Amos Gittal's (Israel) section is very annoying and impressive, showing more violence and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The segment of Alexandra Gonzalez Innerruta is frustrating, without any inspiration and of course the worst one <br /> <br /> My vote is seven. <br /> Title (Brazil): "11 de Septemo" ("September 11")
