GI from Japanese troops If a platoon of these was sent back in the middle of the communal war in 400 years, then the way to build the Takuwawa Shogunate? Great pitch right? Decide what the film says on the tin. Thanksgiving writers are ridiculous in Saif-Fi films, the scientific mob did not stop explaining the transportation during the Jumbo time. How or why not They just did not. But the trip in the transit order is troppy as hell and quite beautiful, unless a bit date. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Takes up with a devastating war sequence. Undoubtedly it is the main command of the day. The whole concept and elaborate film was probably raised from this simple pitch: GI If you are equipped with the latest war in recent war, then do you have to fight with the Samurai? And the boy gives it. <br /> <br /> The continuation of the main battle that is more than half of the time is that it is probably the result of 70 action / war films. It is not relentless and tedious in speed and length, it is a fantastic flick of styles and tricks which is only G. Eye. A unique place like this. Samurai can provide. I mean, where you can get the full range of tanks, features, vacuumers, helicopters and samurai with the same shot? Sepoy Platoon literally led by Lieutenant Eva cavalry shot them with hundreds of machine guns, mortars, grenades and tanks. <br /> <br /> This mosaic of style is basically a foot of Jadai - Geeki epic of the Samurai banner of Kuosova, or the Hiroshi Yagaki Samurai banner, the other is Western action and war movies. There is stylistic touch (such as amazing slow shots and bloody violence) that is Sam Pacinpah or Engro G. Casallari comes to think of Cayoma. Japanese cinema is always Western and other Hollywood works and the opposite, and GI Has been affected by Samurai makes this East-Mill-West Gelling pot an exciting movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The tongue-in-cheek mentality is not completely absurd, it is not that it is so bad-at-the-good-listeners who do not have fun to laugh at their movies. The budget was probably quite strong, because it has hundreds of extra, extravagant costumes (very good for a traditional win-winless production and special effects). Camera-work and editing are all the top notchs, almost better than movies with no higher artistic ambition. <br /> <br /> This is certainly not with its flaws. There are many "song" scenes, where more than 70 Japanese rocks, disco and country songs play on Montage (a mortgage scene, a love interest scene, a "battle hell" scene etc.). The song itself is quite long and uncouth and isolated from the whole thing. Although it jumped for 140 minutes, it mostly flies like bullets. Nevertheless, some early scenes, flashbacks, and suboptags can be clipped for an acute effect. <br /> <br /> This cast is also notable, Sony Chiba, such as Isho Natsuaggi (Geokin, Samurai Wolf), Sunahiko Watze (Yakuza papers) and Hiroyuki Sanda, hit all of them with the right notes.
