It can not be a memorable classic, but it is a sensitive theme with a sensitive romance that emphasizes the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and the consequences of life for the unfortunate person in need of this vital skill. <br /> <br /> Story goes round around the house, Iris, who is familiar with a fellow employee in his factory job, Stanley, an illiterate cafeteria worker. Iris discovered that Stanley was unable to read, and after losing his job, he sent him to his kitchen home. Of course, you can predict, even though initially aware of the involvement, develop feelings for each other ... <br /> <br /> Jenny Fonda plays an expert in Iris with her own problem. Lack of job expectancy, two teenage children (one pregnant), one unemployed sister and her abusive husband. However, Robert DeNiro must have been intelligent and rich, but uneducated, Stanley, paying tribute to the order of his respected wisdom, illustrating his reverence bright. They are not your ideal charming young couples, usually portrayed in screen romances, but the general working class, middle-aged couple, neatly struggles with the world. <br /> <br /> I'm not far away, but it's a lovely, heartfelt romance and a personal appearance of an issue with an adult illiterate problem, though from the point of view of a fictional character.
