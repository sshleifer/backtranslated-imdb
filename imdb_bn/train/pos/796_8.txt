Tom Copper was the governor of Annie Mary, Thomas Coppone. That is why the Fed was involved, he called Clinton and asked him to involve Fed on this matter. I used to live outside of Philadelphia, so the case was the daily page news. I read An Rule's book and saw the A & E "City Confidential" segment. Tom Kappa was a megloman (SP.), An uber-controller and a demon. He claimed to love Anne Marie, but he could control what he wanted. When he did not allow him to do it, he killed him and controlled the final form. I think it's still a living meaning that he's still alive.
