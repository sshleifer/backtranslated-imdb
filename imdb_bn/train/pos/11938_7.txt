I enjoyed the movie like this for their soul, intended to pun It is a decent, clear film and a young fan, wanting to win over a baseball team behind him, because his father's father told him that he would be back for him. <br /> <br /> The soul stirred in two ways: Danny Glover and a young man Joseph Gordon-Levitt and funny fantasy with the heavenly Herald Al, the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd. This is an energetic movie. It gets you smile, and really involves you in the game. <br /> <br /> there are my foreheads here. One kind of thing that bugs me in this sports movie is that you turned an unexpected fan for the team. There is absolutely nothing wrong. I find it strange that Angels will be moving away from the film, a strong, wonderful group, when I truly live with my base adherence, such as Toronto Blue Jays. It's really interesting. It's a movie about an underdog og kids team, then all right.
