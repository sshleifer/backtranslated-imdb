After watching this movie, I think the first word comes in "Beauty". Around the beauty, actors play (Andy is always as pretty), well-designed shots, and writers' red lines idea - are all in love all around. <br /> <br /> I think Keene's character is the only white spot of these three girls' otherwise annoying and anticipated life. His interaction makes Andy's character alive as an entertainer, perhaps it may be. When he left, it became clear that we can not really grasp our inner faith and our desire for sacred wishes and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br <> Any form in this small British village, which is fully displayed. <br /> <br /> Another reason I love this movie is that it is all British - all the houses and "phagas" and pronunciation :)). Andy is doing a fantastic job again! It's a shame that this movie has received so little sign. 10 out of 10!
