It was a really cool movie. It is proven that you do not need stupid little things like continuity and scripts for making movies. Within a few seconds it crosses the continent, man shoots, and there is no clash with them, the tanks burn in the fire, Samui war over the sinking galleons, the symbol of the David X and the Rogue Davis is the only child. I have enjoyed this movie but I like ** ** movies, this is a very good example of a very ** ** movie which is just kicks ass. If you like the world of war, you will love this movie, its snapshot, its fast, its stupid, his samaritest !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> as it was done in 1972
