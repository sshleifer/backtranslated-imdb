I saw this photo TNT 12 years ago. It is Susan York's birthday and they see this photo as a double feature with Tom Jones (1963). I did not see this picture on TV. I was interested in seeing this movie because one of the stars is a very interesting and talented Jim Dell, whose sailor I believe Dell has given the description of Harry Potter in the cassette, but he is quite funny. This is a fast paced comedy. It's not VHS or DVD. Colombian images should go through collection of their films and DVDs should be considered for the recovery and release of this film. Christopher Plummer is ridiculous like Lord Foptling, Ian Banene is also ridiculous like a sailor Rambal. It is a Buddhist comedy, one with great production values, and the kind of film shows. **** of 1/2 stars ****
