After reading the original game, I thought it would be more difficult to adapt to the screen. Donald McConnick has done a monstrous great performance in John Gard, a suppressing competitor who has exposed his outward (but invisible to others) screen on the screen - Private Garrett. Eamonn Kelly also plays an excellent "screwballs" whose inability is not mixed by the feelings of his communication only. <br /> <br /> You can find it specifically to rent the price. (Probably unavailable outside of Ireland and the United Kingdom)
