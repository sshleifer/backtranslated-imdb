First, it was a brave film. I've seen unchanging and can understand the comparison. However, I can not begin to understand the people who have trashed this movie. I can see how the end might end but I used to lie, if I did not say that every man forced any woman to have sexual intercourse, it is worth the jerde. On the contrary, it does not solve any problem or can not make anything better, and that, without congratulating the film, I congratulate that it is thankful to me. <br /> <br /> Previously suppressing the comment and claiming to be an adult stick. I certainly and deliberately I am 24 years old. The way to drag the film is the way it is realistic. People have become so beautiful that they show on camera and fast-paced plots on screen that if you ask them to pay a lot of attention to a film based on a brick, they just do not lose interest, they destroy what is made and call it garbage . When in reality it lacks patience and understanding which requires fine tuning and does not require creative minds like Talia Lughasi. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rogerio Dawson has shown himself the stupid flexibility. I think he portrayed the Maya alumni and posted attacks with great ease and saw a work of transformation between the two I worked very well. Often, like the "Thirteenth Target" movie mentioned in the previous commentary, the effects of rape are seen as extremely modest and emotional or horrible, isolated and dead. According to Dawson, in my opinion, many survivors are victims of the victim's work: During the watch, drone-like existence, survival (and confused) some dead works work and then distorted themselves for behaving badly. <br /> < br /> I told this picture honestly and finally I was grateful to show people various aspects of rape. Many people float this film in the middle of the middle of the end and start ... I believe that the face of the Maya was over during this act ... the law itself is not ... revenge or not behind it ... only his face ... <br /> <br /> Thank you
