I was really surprised with this movie. I'm going to sneak past, I did not know anything about the movie except the trailer I saw, I thought it was going to be a child where my car's kind of festive festival. I hope the bad sex jokes and the farting and hope of a kind-hearted lead character were laid to the end because that's how the movie works. Instead, I got a beautiful, amazing original movie, an honest, average person who never had sex. Yes, this movie is full of shiny 'sex trick and obscenity and sometimes hey-look-at-nipple !, but it has done a lot of work in the spirit of bad Santa rather than sonority boys. All the characters you probably know in real life, are worthy friends who try to push only one brother and live their lives. <br /> <br /> I think this film is going to be a total length, and I was very surprised. Yes, it's mostly on top (kissing, a movie about a 40 year old virgin!), But it's done very impressively. Finally, you're really dragging for this guy to get the status, which tells a lot about movies because really, do you really care if Ashton Kutcher finds his car?
