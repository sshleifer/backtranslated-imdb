I first came across my tutor friend one or two years ago during TV Surfing. Before that, I did not see a Korean movie before my whole life, so MTF is actually the first Korean movie I've ever seen. And what a joyful surprise! I was totally amused from the beginning to the end, and there was a great time smile. His comic style is different from the Hong Kong comic films (which I have used for my whole life, and so tired), breathing fresh air in my experience of seeing my hindrum film. I think MTF has a number of scenes and strategies that are ridiculous, malicious and original. <br /> <br /> I have seen MTF a few times a few days ago, and have already seen it once, reducing the surprise / comic effect of me. However, however, the film does not negatively affect my opinion. Instead, through this period, something else came - it has moved me - two young, seemingly 'enemies' who are completely thrown together incompatible, and how they gradually solve their differences and begin to take care of each other without feeling the feeling. Remind me of the long gone high school day. To me, Suuven and Ji Hu are really consistent, because there is something between them that is pure and true in them, which is a quality that separates them from people like them, G. Hun's Sassy girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Two separate parts - the first part discusses 'war' between Su-Wyun and Ji-Hun, and it is more violent and faster. G Hun passed the pass in his final exam and began to change the story of Su Waiyan (G-Hun's opinion), excited dance, things began to change. The speed decreases and ... GHU suddenly realized that he wanted to imagine more than Suu Van. So the second part is related to the development of their mutual feeling, which is moving towards a happy ending with the ultimate listening of the gang-boss. <br /> <br /> Just a last comment. I think this is somewhat unbelievable - actually 21-year-old self-proclaimed 'bad boy' will feel ashamed of being naked in front of her and lose her 'cold', a little bit weird. I think that G Hun is just a boy pure in his heart and does not really feel in his face. Btw, Kwong San Woo (GHUN) DOES have a sexy body and perfect figure! ;-) <br /> <br /> MTF always has the list of the Top 10 Favorite Movies.
