Director Martin Ritt's director-class romantic drama comes as unbelievable, yet most of the stars Jenny Fonda and Robert De Niro (both great) have fun moments due to the creations. He is a widow who can not continue, he is illiterate and a closet-inventor - perhaps you can guess left. The title of Pat Barker's novel "Union Street" (a good title!) Is so nice behind it and the editing of the film is a mess, but it's still pleasant; A pink-colored blue-collar fantasy. There are no types of serious problems (even the illiteracy angle is just a plot-tool for the upcoming love story) and not a real firework, although the letters are deliberately colorless and the leads are dragged into an interesting degree. The last part is pure lung - and it will be difficult to swallow the seniors - although these two letters are a happy ending and the image will not be satisfied by any other means. *** *** to ***
