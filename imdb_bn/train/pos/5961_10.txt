I can be favorable, I was a writer of self-published, The Hungry Bachelor Club in 1994. My best friend and hungry bachelor, wrote the screenplay by Fred Dresch, who was inspired by the film Marlon's character. I could not be more satisfied with the trailer, I hope to see the film completely and I will make more comments. But Jazz Fox, who plays Delmar Young, playing my character Delmer Young, is the star of his character. He carries bulk of mental vehicles in a fine shape. I could not do myself well! It's like real people, drives at least sources and drives my statement fortunately and passionately against racial biases.
