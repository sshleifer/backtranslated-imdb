This is a very light-headed comedy about a wonderful family, which has a boy packer, because he uses Peacock in his diet. Pecker loves to take pictures of all kinds of people in a small suburbs of Baltimore, and managed to get attention from a group of photo-art lovers from New York City. Pecker is an intelligent sister who goes smoothly on Sugar and actually acids an Adidic, taking sugar spoon from a bag. Male scenes stop movement in their jockey, and movement and cheeks are almost the same. It's rather hard to be upset rather than excluding your mind with this film, but who cares, it's just a movie to give you a smile in a simple film made in 1998.
