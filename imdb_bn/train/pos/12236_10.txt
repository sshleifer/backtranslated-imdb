I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old in my theater in a drive-theater my family <br /> <br /> Returning, I thought it was very interesting. . . Although I was very young, 90% made this extraordinary movie so happy! I saw this morning in the "Turner South". I have seen, I am absolutely impressive with the smile! "The Mating Game" is a unique classic from an ongoing age. If you are young enough to achieve this wonderful experience in the history of the film, I am very sorry for you. You can not see such a movie and there is no way to understand how they (even today) can give them an "old timer" such a delightful piece of heaven. Not saying that what I can do is honorfully request that young people refrain from commenting on movies like "maternity games". <br /> <br /> Such films were made for the previous generation of your generation's current group. And thus, these movies can speak different languages ​​than any of your languages. <br /> <br /> In other words ?? If the film is okay then do not understand, please do not embarrass yourself by commenting ?? Frankly ?? Make no sense.
