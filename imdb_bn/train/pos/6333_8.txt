I used this video and I saw it last night. Acting started extremely bad (Hey ------ Hei ------ twister) but got very good after ward. Tornadoes were very fake, and most CGI effects were very bad, but the house scene was completely bursting, and the inside stuff became almost flabby and well done, and movies were similar to those of Twister. The ruins scene was also very well done. The story is very well written, and refreshing to look like a movie away from this old "disaster formula" movie seems to be stuck in 30 years. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>>
