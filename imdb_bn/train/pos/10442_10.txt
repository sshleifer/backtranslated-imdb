This is a really real true movie I've ever seen. None other than "Sunset Before", which is not technically another movie, because it is about the same two and same romance. <br /> <br /> This is the real world "love". . All right, this is only when the majority of people in the film are intelligent and intelligent. To read the other reviews, it likes me to know how to go crazy as well as many other people as well as a dialog-based movie. And this is what's so good "before sunrise". The dialog is perfect. It's so real, so cute and fun. Jesse and Selin fall in love, it does not seem very surprising, 'Coz you fall in love with them at the same time. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is one of the coffee shops, where they call their best friends, claiming to be good friends with others. It's okay. <br /> <br /> I said, if you like, then before "before sunset" see "before sunset." "If you, like me, first saw" sunset ", it is difficult to stop the feeling of sorrow and sorrow for the two young lovers across the whole show. <br /> <br /> Again, the greatest romantic movie in my books. Wonderful acting, excellent script, And beautiful place. Young love, it's good.
