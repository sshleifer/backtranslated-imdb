Hello Dave Burning Paradise, a film for anyone who likes Jackie Chan and Indiana Jones. The main protagonist of the film is the perfect son of these two weird parents. Other characters are well conversed as they are known in the same action film stereotypes. This movie is the original where Hollywood action combines boldly with the style of the traditional Hong Kong film. Sadly, this is not true for Hollywood movies.
