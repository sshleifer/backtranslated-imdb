Dirty Harry was shot dead in gunfire before being killed by a rape victim. They should probably be given more punishment after the initial operation and let them enjoy their life like them and their sister ... However ... San Francisco and Santa Cruz again have an action-packed story set. The main rapper run by Andy Drake is strictly helpless and ultimately punished (of course!). Not a genuine movie, but better than the other dirty Harry.
