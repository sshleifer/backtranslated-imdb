General Douglas McArthur's film "MacArthur" starts and ends, Gregory Pack, American military academy of Hammon's West Point, Alma Mata. We see 82-year-old General General MacArthur delivered a speech in the beginning of the post-graduate class in 1962 that it is a matter of respect for serving their country. The film came in a flashback of nearly two hours of light and controversial career of General McArthur, which began in the darkest hours of WWII on the first island of Korigider in the Philippines in the first spring of 1942. <br /> <br> Before being attacked by the Japanese army, General MacArthur, in his military career, was asked to leave Australia's island for the first time with his highest US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt disobeyed direct orders from Dan O'Harely. MacArthur seems to be reluctant to go to his men's biggest house together with his wife and younger son, he did just what he had said to be hunting for reminder of the war. For this reason, his escape from the death or death of prisoners in Japan, which led to General McCarthur's use of his influence, two years later, instead of the island of Persia, he used all his influence to start a major attack on the Philippines. His commitment to the Philippine people, along with thousands of US dollars, is left behind. He will come back and go back to his commitment with the strength of the US Army and the Navy! <br /> <br /> In two years, the Japanese army attacked the General MacArtha attack until the attack of the Philippine Islands. In the light of some brightness of the South Pacific Islands, the island's hop battles separated hundreds of thousands of soldiers into self-esteem and hungry. The ocean has faced so much of US military damage, then another fellow commander in the Pacific War! <br /> <br /> In the Korean War, 1950/51, General MacArthur won his worst military victory as well as his worst military victory. After the North Korean army woke up and completely brutally lifted, the feeling of MacArth has been unreasonable in the absence of invading doors or left hooks behind the Incon General after less than 100 incidents of attack by US Marines, US / UN forces on its border, communist Red China's Yalu River along . Because of the danger of attacking Communist Chinese army general MacArthur, he is telling by his subordinates that this attack was taking place before the US and UN forces were rigged. After the wave of red Chinese aggression, the volatile force forced America / UN forces to return to their "Big Bag Out" in 1950, North Korea retreated all its equipment across the border, even leaving South Korea's capital city. Seoul! As the largest military record of US military in US history, it is the war in Korea, killing 1,000 people on the first day - November. 29/30 1950-Communist Chinese attack! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! The army but its own commander and Chief Presidency Harry S. Truman, Ed Flanders, is not spin or depressed about what he should do: To prevent his army from overthrowing the Korean peninsula, if necessary, start a full-fledged attack on Communist China with nuclear weapons! For Pres. Truman faced public with enough junk from General MacArthur, that he did not want MacArthur to do as he wanted, as he wanted, as well as the last straw against Red China! President April 11, 1951. Truman threatens General MacArthur as Korea's United Nations General Secretary of Ukraine Press Truman's brave but very immoral decision prevented MacArthur from fighting with the war strategy of Soviet Union-Communist China, preventing the prevention of World War II - at the time it was like a American nuclear bomb! Press Truman's controversial decision to dump General McArthur was low in his election numbers in 1952 - in the middle of the 20th century - he had withdrawn in March of the year - from the American presidential campaign <br /> <br /> General McCarthy Unfortunately, when the political and military climate of the world was going to continue to fight in the future. Similar to the horrors of nuclear war in 1950/51, like General McArthur, it was a national suicide for the assassination, such as against Red China, perhaps it is a nuclear holocaust which will touch only the US RSS and Red China, the whole world! General McArthur has never been taught that the key fact of the future war was the fact that since the A & H bomb was not yet discovered, the West Point would return to the West Point. <br /> <br /> <br /> Return to the General Jane. After finishing his initial lecture at West Point, MacArthur, an old and intelligent soldier, as well as after the retirement of the US military, became a big politician, his feelings about war, and his completely innocence. General MacArthur was taught at a young age that the life he had been stuck with from his father-in-law General Dad Douglas MacArthur's sir was that the soldier like the war should be the last resort of war. Problems in the nation. In this way the army must fight and die. With the advent of the nuclear era, General McCarthur finally realized how accurate and intelligent his father was, like a Congressional Medal of Honor, like him, really was!
