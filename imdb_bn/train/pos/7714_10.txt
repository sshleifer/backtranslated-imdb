There were more than 50 Saifai movies. They were big draws for the drive-theater. Many of them were even crappy even then. This movie and 'The Earth the Stuffed Steel' have stood, and both have been well in their own way. Very soon the musical score with its eerie (that still sounds weird because the strange sound is still used) is forbidden to take you to the planet where no man has gone before. Star Trek commentary There are so many elements in this film that it was like a pilot for the series in the Star Trek; Interactive Captain / First Partner / Doctor, Crazy Scientist, Alien Man, Small Skirt Child, Computer Intelligence; It's all deige now but this was the first. Besides, it has good acting and orderly artwork, which still gives a certain surprise in the imagery. Consider how huge Krell machines are successfully pictured with some real depth. I saw it as a kid (in a drive: 0) It was a new movie and it was afraid of me. Finally, even vaguely scary each film came back, but I'm really worried about the invisible giant. Banned Planet is a movie that a scientist can see the fan several times and find something new with each visit.
