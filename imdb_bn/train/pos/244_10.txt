I do not know what I can expect from 'Ned Kelly', but it just likes it. It was dark, dramatic and gripping. It felt very authentic, I felt that I was sent back to the 1800's. I have never been like a hit laser fan, only seen him in teen-type films, but he is very much in the role. Ned Kelly played with Ledger's dignity and intensity, which showed us that a very enthusiastic boy has become the most infamous murderer in Australia. Naomi Watts Kelly is a very helpful contributor to society lover. Highly recommended - and that is from an Australian!
