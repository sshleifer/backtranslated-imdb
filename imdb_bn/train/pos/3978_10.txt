I enjoyed reading Martin Targf's book "Can not Fin My My Way Home", which has filled the American State's narcotic culture for 1945-2000 years. This guy knows his stuff !! I found him to be an excellent spokesman for this documentary. I especially look at the clips of the Hippies era and are happy to see Stonyar culture of the 70s. The soundtrack was excellent. Anyone who curated it was definitely communicating with the tune of each era. Hopefully they will package them and sell them as CD sets. With the LSD exam in the 1960's, I am very much interested in how we changed American culture. One thing missing was the mention of George Jong (played by Johnny Depp in the film "Bloos"), who was responsible for most of Marijuana and Cocaine for coming to this country in the 60s-80s.
