On September 11th, the September 11th incident does not require additional people's interest in the form of Rookie Fireman training or in the progress of two French brothers. It would be better to leave it in my eyes. I think the managers worked very hard, perhaps they thought that the events of the day needed a story as a story. A policeman's comments - "This IT F *** ID Designer" is suitable. <br /> <br /> But it is interesting to watch the screenplay of the incident. The filmmakers were in the right place at the right time, any footage they got from day-to-day shots.
