This is a very simple picture about 3 of 40 good friends in a small Albion town. One gets a new start with a piano boyfriend and a small piano trainer, when tragedy strikes and hearts change forever. Of course you have a box of tissues with a film! A strong piece of work This is definitely my favorite movies all the time. <br /> <br /> * Speaker !!! Spoiler alert !! SPILER !! * <br /> <br /> The main character is accepted by her young, handsome piano trainer and an enthusiastic romance flower. Her jealous "friend" is an unexpectedly fantastic game that leads to quick tragedy. She swoop a boyfriend to lose her love and her friends. Finally an unexpected surprise pulls them back together. (In my opinion his forgiveness is not warranted)
