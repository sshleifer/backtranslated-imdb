The story about the four teen girls growing up in California Johnny (Jodie Foster) is the group of the biggest pillars - but she lives with her divorced mother (Sally Kellman) living outside her house. Annie (Cherry Curry) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and bad boys and her father is beaten. Majesty (Marilyn Cagan) has a supernatural parent. Deirde (Kandice Struh) thinks that he is more mature than everyone else. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new anymore - but it has a big difference - it's right. I was surprised when I graduated from high school in 1980 (when I saw the first movie) and how real I was. They got the dialogue, clothes and attitude completely down right. Even the main song of the movie ("The Radio on" in Donna Summer) even before it was a big hit. This film makes me harder than any other movie of the year because I can understand the characters and relate. I knew girls who were like this in high school! The film must be (of course) in the date, but it takes time that we will never see. <br /> <br /> Best of all the qualities with the best Foster rendering. The relationship between him and Kellerman (who was excellent) was realistic and well done. Even the Scott Biao (whose girls have a small role as a friend) played little kids baby. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - if needed at the age of 1980. The film should have an independent rating rating (drug use and plenty of oaths) but all teens should be seen by it. I give it 8.
