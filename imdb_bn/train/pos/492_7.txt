Let me tell you first that I saw at least two episodes of StarTech, I do not consider myself a tractor or a trekk. Those who live in the basement of their parents and who are present in the wear wear conveyance with the pointer rubber ear. I dropped seven stories in the movie next to historical errors. The performance was better than the average, but the plot held no surprise. They tried very hard to counter the technology engineer, but still special effects were a temptation. Now, like historic flaws, if you call them, the first captain to run the enterprise was the commander in April, then Captain Paik, Jim Kirk etc. According to the statement made by both Ricker and Kirk, we called Clientes and educated them and provided them the technology (for that reason the original order was made) but I said that there is no reason to deny this fine series. I hope the plots will get deep, and then special effects can take a backseat.
