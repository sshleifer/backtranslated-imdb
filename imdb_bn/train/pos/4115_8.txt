This is one of the weirder movies I recently saw. Because it is less like a movie and looks more like a test film. Kurushwa's test was of different types of people who live in a garbage dump and poured their experiences into a test that gives them a glimpse of their general hard facts. Each episode is not depressing and harsh, but overall this is definitely tone. Let us see ... Our sexual harassment / rape, attempt to murder, detonate wife, drinking alcohol, infidelity, loss of small boy after eating harmful fish, a man with severe depression (he never speaks during the movie and looks very dangerous dreamer, Schizophrenia, who is considered a street car conductor, and all his awkward moments, his street car "junk" "It's time to spend time driving on the road through a stomach", that is, schizophrenia, a complete f rew (I think I'm even less than that of the barbarous rapists!), It is quite frustrating that it is about Japan's Egmore Bergman film It seemed like, as Bergman made many films, mental illness, and the tendency to cope with the disappointment of life Is it any wonder that after creating this picture, Kurasawa himself tried to kill himself? So, I liked it? No. It was not a fun experience, but it was a very good movie, which must be my attention. And as a result, I really wanted to see what happened to these people. It was good to see the ruins of a train - you do not want to see all the killings but you can help but watch! Among all vintettes, I think that the elderly was interested in watching for everyone and who was not really fit (it was very well equipped and learned to be a garbage dump), possibly representing the meaning of Kursava itself. may be. I sink <br /> <br /> If you have seen various Kurusawa films and see high tolerance for strange art films, then this is a clock. However, do not make this your first experience to watch your movies - it's sure to scare away many viewers!
