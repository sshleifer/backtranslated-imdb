[WARNING: Contains Spokes] <br /> <br /> I have this adult friend for which his parents make the idea of ​​sexually awkwardly awkward. I began to think about the response of the audience "mother". <br /> <br /> When people watched May (Anna Reid) in her bed with her little lip lover, Darren (Daniel Craig), or later seen sexually explicit drawings in May. I am suspicious of seeing a woman to enjoy the sexual excitement of women at the age of 60, and suspect that as much nudity or drawings made the audience uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is again proved why he is among the most fierce storytellers on both sides of the Atlantic, taking his stories is not easy. This intimate family drama is not a movie you can enjoy to claim because it is raw, complex, and often makes us very uncomfortable. However, it is a strong thing. <br /> <br /> Kureishi and Roger Mikhail His "Notting Hill" is directed) An old woman who, after all, draws an unsentimental, wrenching and superbly portrayed portraiture portrait this year, she can still enjoy all the pleasures of life and, at a wonderful moment, when her son, Bobby, does not say it difficult Asked, "Why not?" <br /> <br /> <br /> Reed deserves an Oscar nomination for his turn as May. Restrained, strong and sad, often at the same time Ola (Catherine Bradshaw) in a seemingly enthusiastic touch in a pub, see Reid in May. Or, when she asked Paolo to open the door after the dangerous date. Reid's eyes and face expresses all of May's pain and frustration. At the most devastating moment of the film, she could kneel before Darren, agreeing to do something for her, only to be kind to him. This is an extraordinary fancy performance by an extraordinary actress. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed using Michael's natural sound, especially when May and Tutus reached Bobby's place first. It perfectly portrays an impressive image around May and Tutus, which welcomes them to their own family. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture reminds me of the honesty of the work of Mike Leigh and the croaker. Mother's "hanging in a little sense of expectation of waiting. <br /> <br /> I have a quarrel: Michael and I decided to give Darwin's first love scene around sugar sensitivity. When lovers are out of focus, in the foreground, a white screen bursts into the air slowly And the only sound is in the throes of emotion. May <br /> <br /> The problem with Mitchell's approach is that both Reed and Craig, Rain's role is completely envelope, it is unfair to hide both of these roles so relentlessly that their characters hide almost primitive power from the audience, especially since Michael does not have any jokes about making sex scenes later. <br /> <br /> This picture is very popular. No syllabus, we are sympathetic to the girl, but she has also caused the pain of her daughter. I suspect her story with the people, her point, I believe, face a family who is already being cracking while some mentally mischief occurs. It's unflinching in its candor and finally unforgettable.
