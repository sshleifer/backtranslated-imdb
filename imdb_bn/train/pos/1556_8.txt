Like other people who commented on "Friolin Doctor", I heard about this little jewel opportunity on the night of night on TV. On the one hand, a strange mix of storytelling story about a sexy but unreasonable anti-heroine, and on the other, a realistic and well-educated art of war between the trains started from the beginning. For me, it is one of the other five best films about WWI (the others are "All the fun of the Western Front", "The Great Path", "Gallipoli" and posthumous "LAVA at Reiyan de Array"). The scene of poisonous gas attack is really cool; The horses and men appear as riders of the public with their gas mask. <br /> <br /> I just taped this image.
