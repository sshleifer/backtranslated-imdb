The film can be a looking glass to see the world in a new light. For example, the good night and the good wishes of the modern judgment - parallel to the unity and freedom of independence. When it is not too close, it is easy to test moral problems: leaving it in our imaginary or historic context, from our recent situation. Through pornography, we consider ourselves 'illuminated' and our unbelievable concepts of ancestors - usually involving fire and sulfur, but the definition of vulgarism can easily be an ignorance of evidence and an absurd interpretation. The Betty Page was an icon of an era, which, instead of MacCarityism, would make it half-crazy teenage crime, based on the ban of comics (such as the Tales of the Crypt). This picture emerges from the main questions raised in his life, like the 1950s nowadays related disagreements. <br /> <br /> <br /> Our picture opens with two key scenes. First of all, we see men dressed in a wonderful book store, looking honorable. One of them asks for strange pictures and pictures of women in pictures - then turns into an incognito police. The second scene shows the Betty page, waiting to be called as a witness, most of the time she came out of the church. <br /> <br /> The first 50 minutes is black and white. Old fashion film effects such as wipes and fading adds to the meaning that we have been watching a movie since last year, such as casting methods, rebuilding the 1950s scene, the phrase of contemporary words and film-making related to Tier dialogue efficiently. Duration The archive footage is frequently intercut - which is very much cheerful and will annoy others. Holding its theme, the film often focuses on the age of the 'Health and Nature' journals, against the classic postures of Betty's classic clips of old-fashioned-in-motion collections and old clips of old beaches and landmarks. . . Although I acknowledge that if you are not inspired by the story, then you can think of the effect a little sticky. <br /> <br /> Soon, we go to flashback. Betty Naseville escapes from the worst life of a depression year, only to sing the church and rise up with self-preservation, and to be alone in creating her own path. After her initial success, her modeling work is divided into two levels: the mainstream glamor work focuses on her over-sunny smile, and wearing 'high-heeled boots' and light tie-gear dresses in 'specialist interest' pictures. A previous audition (a memorable memoir of Naomi Watts' character on Mulholland Drive - also known as Bati), is her usual animated, delightful (but eventually soft) day-to-day expression. Is her still partless? Betty is often rejected in Audition once she is a well-known pin-up girl. But we have never been asked to apologize for Betty Page: her abusive childhood has been quickly referenced and dropped; When raped by four of his dude, we only saw threats and then restored the Beti and survived, raised myself in a deserted forest, and raised a brave face of one who refused to lie and refused to die. <br /> <br /> Although no nudity is involved, it is a special interest photo which eventually causes problems. When we return to court, a clergy opinion opinion about the effect of this picture is taken as evidence. A psychologist officially says how these pictures are managed by 'youth, suicides, and psychology' (probably not according to that order) among young people. Finally, a star witness explains how such a picture ends the life of his son - 'is ​​like him' How 'trashed up' is not cleaned because of death). Text written with a series of pictures of Betty in the magazine says that how it was forced to tolerate "terrible aggression" (the audience knew that she actually felt ridiculous and the words, such as photographs themselves, were dramatic plays). After waiting for 12 hours, Batey has been proven - she is a person who can definitely say that she did not get a picture in the painting - 'No need'. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a woman with a photograph behind the "fashion and passion along with your local store For the whip, "said. She is wearing a bra and thong and her hand is handcuffed behind her back. Underwear and sex toy companies, which target female consumers (and supports domestic war fighters), targeted their advertisements, "women have been shown to maintain sexual confidence and to control women's sexuality." Someone might conclude that the bias and ignorance of the Betty Page investigation still carry the currency. <br /> <br /> The cane's religious aspect is integral to the story, as the concept of sin is integral to Christianity and "forbidden" is often the nature of sexual enjoyment in the United Kingdom and the United States - opposing more realistic methods found in continental Europe. It can be justified against the sources of sin and salvation and the sources of "being saved", even referring to the native language that makes traditional male dominance permanent. A police friendly (but sexually motivated) approach to Betiel outside the court proposes to 'save' him from loneliness. Knight-in-astronomy-armor can be impressive, but it also estimates the need for a woman's rescue. <br /> <br /> To love or hate it, the infamous BT page is an abnormal and extraordinary movie and call it a moral awakening for those who concentrate on it. There is an excellent acting and Gretchen Mole as the Betty was successful or the whole film was successful in its amazing performance.
