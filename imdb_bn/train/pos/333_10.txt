In all the capacities, this series is a classic (goes television) just like the original poem of literature worldwide. Far from far away from a beautiful and respectful presentation among the defining books of Western culture. <br /> <br /> I was relieved by the suffering of Odysseus and his followers; Troy's touch touches the drama (which was perceived but not seen); God is intrigued by the ways of playing with the fate of gods. (It should be noted that the humble SGI animals here do not roam around their heel bird, or a weak-fashioned fashion model in bikinis, they work through mortal agents or rarely represent classical statues as Homer's work). <br /> <br /> This is a sad thing that is not available on DVD, especially the worst and tasty adaptation of Odyss that can be found in video stores.
