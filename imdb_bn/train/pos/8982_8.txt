Great, it was a lot to take. I was quite mesmerized throughout. It was quite perfect, though I had to do a lot with the edit. I can not believe that this guy can have good condition on them (especially anton) without any serious consequences ... beef meat Dandi got together well, middle-class children who enjoyed their situation (and just so!).

You will probably learn something about film making.
