These pictures are fantastic. Finally the well written characters you can love for all their good and bad. Pierce Brosnan is flat-out hysterical in this self-effacing role. I think this is the best thing of all time. He has played other roles that show the shadows of doing this kind of work, but eventually this role gives him the opportunity to run in the room. I almost died when I went across the hotel lobby in his underwear and boots. And Greg Kinnear and Hope Davis are a great couple, as well as the actors are very ambitious. Kinnear is so strange that at the end his turn is really beneficial. You better play with the game of the actors and they give us something more to return.
