I made this movie available for streaming at Netfix and thought I would try it. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor (Pen Fever and David Kubit), who eventually saw each other after their parents died. Ryan and Theo debate about who first did. But later, Theo finds that his brother Ryan is not only homosexual but he is killed due to terminal illness. So, Ryan and Theo spend time patching up their time difference. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible film. I only saw pen fair in season 7 of 7, but that was amazing. David Kubit, an actor, I've never heard of great work before. <br /> <br /> I am interested in Gay and Lesbian style. This is a movie which you do not want to miss. <br /> <br /> I took 10 images out of 10 of this image.
