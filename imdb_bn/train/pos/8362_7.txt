In 1938, a criminal revolver named Fred (the Fraud), a criminal named Craggel, was found in the police search. <br /> <br /> It's a tough little entertainment in the 1960s Wallace film. The revival of Dr. Babus's films was clearly influenced (or influenced by this), the frog seems to be more villa than a master thief. Wallace is not the best of the best films but it is a look. It will create interesting interesting features with excellent nice movies. <br /> <br /> between 10 and 6 and 7.
