This is one of my favorite Govinda films and the best film of 1994. David Dhawan has done a great job to handle this film, he makes fun of it and adds family drama. Govinda is excellent as King Babu and gives a great performance. An actress who hates Karisma Kapoor, she is a little annoying but still bothered in some scenes. Kader Khan is acting in an actress and yet has done outstanding performance. Aruna Irani is awesome as a mother and gives a tremendous performance. Shakti Kapoor Nandu as well as bright. This movie is full of comedy, action, family drama and romance entertainers.
