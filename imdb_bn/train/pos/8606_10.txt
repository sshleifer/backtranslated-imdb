Looks like there is no middle ground in this movie! It mostly happens in dreams and it is often stupid and illogical, like most dreams. It is an excellent production with some great songs and fine performance, especially by our angel. <br /> <br /> At the reception of the dream, Janet's death, an unnatural insult, and a lot of misunderstanding, and his twin bibs with Biny Barnes were a surprise and a joy. At one point, he sings a snippet of Carmen, then Fawost's final trio (containing some lapdogs for some strange reason), then "the lights" on the beach! <br /> <br /> This is a strange trick - if you can enter the cave, it is very entertaining.
