This distributes distracted D-Sica products. And it is said that "the humble earth will inherit." This story of the surface is a metaphor for all homeless people in Europe after the massive civil war. They are homeless but delightful, the very poor and selfish care of a society or their admission, the footmats for the Italian carpet market. De Sica likes to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. I did not read it based on the book, so if I could create a djuice exemplary instrument or authorship, I would not be able to override it. Since the beginning of the words, the story can be set anywhere and everywhere to measure the uninterrupted story of "Once ...". This bulgaria makes everyone happy when the bone of the bone, the transparency sketches of the unrest, the theoretical nature of the homeless, especially when they begin to give their wishes and the end of Spielberg's picture. De Sica's most accessible film is also its best. Neio-abandoning realism, he was completely destroyed by the creation of old and old movies, he created a movie which breaks the heart and simultaneously hopes that it will be filled with the hope that it needs to go to this world.
