As long as the title of this movie does not see the operation, it is not very sensible because it is a word created by an imaginary young man to manage his fantastic carts, which he does all day long. And he is one of the strange figures in this strange and sometimes miserable story of a group of slum dwellers of Japan. <br /> <br /> There are two drones who make women's business, where there is a human desire to be an architect, and his younger son who he sent to request food. An intelligent elderly person who is going around him seems to be a pillar of softness, and there is a businessman with a serious nervous bitterness, whose wife (and others) all behave like dirt. <br /> <br> There is no special plot in it, in fact, it is a bunch of stories that are interwoven, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic. I think it all works quite well, and I was dying to see it for a long time based on its details. I was not least disappointed, and I definitely want to recommend this. 10 out of 9
