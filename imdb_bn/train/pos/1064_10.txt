I am just wondering why the great Fox had canceled 3, although the season was not as good as the season 2 which was really nice !!! I love it so much that I'm also thinking about buying DVDs in Amazon. (Fail!: _ (I'm a Chinese student and it's an international credit card for me and $ inconveniences.) I hope Fox can bring DAC back on any day!
