"I'll take you there" is a sad person who lost his wife to someone else and found an unforeseen mate in the dark darkness. Unlike most romantic comedies, this little indie is mostly in the tongue-in-cheek comedy, which emphasizes romance with Rogers and Shady. A lot of fun with a lot of fun and some crazy moments are running, fresh, and a perfect watch for Indy Lovers.
