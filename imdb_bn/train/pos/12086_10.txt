Wonderful family drama / comedy that plays McCain and Gare, which I saw when it humble the heart. Recommend strongly for all ages from grannies to 9 years old. In 1962 the profitable period was broken into pieces. The story is involved in Ger's fight, his two children, and the ancestor, Zenna (McClline), trying to meet without a man as the head of the family. The "family" inherited a long-forgotten relative when pursuing to the west, which, in the late 1940s, a run down of Garre, goes to the ramshackle road side cafe. As a sweet but strong mother, strong gaar gets the whole family to recover and open the caf√©. But wait ... an old circus actress with aunt Zenna card tricks, magic powder and comedian ...... She loves to get stupid and sometimes dangerous games between the kids and her ... What happened next " Lord's dignified "is a delightful combination that caves the Cuban missile crisis (from real events to authentic TV news stories) and a" ghost "that completely goes out of hand Comes with her and comes together. This image questions entertainment, philosophical, religiousness and gives an inaccurate fear about the horrific fear of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Finally, the rest of the faith, family and restored love are left with wonder. Oh, and the music is very good in the early 60's! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
