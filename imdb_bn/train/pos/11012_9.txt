At first I am not sure if I see any documentary, propaganda film or dramatic presentation. I guess the production time was a mix of three mixes. <br /> <br /> Certainly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable. But you had a sense that the film will have some interesting scenes to start. We were able to see what realistic training regimens and equipment were to be. <br /> <br /> Where this movie came together for me and was close to the end. There was a realism in the scene (at least I felt it as) that I never encountered before. You could place yourself at work and imagine thinking of young fighters. Japanese Japanese soldiers were mixed with the common problems of being portrayed at a time when you can think that real Japanese actors are a little harmful. <br /> <br /> This movie is excellent as a source of American mentality. In 1943, the war with Japan took place. Japan's interest in Japan last year helped in Japan.
