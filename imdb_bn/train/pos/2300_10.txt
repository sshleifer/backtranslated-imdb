This picture contains such wonderful stuff! Reese Witherspoon's first salute is, of course, surprising, but his chemistry with Jason London too. Score is remarkable, breezy and pure. James Newton Howard has enhanced the quality of any movie for ten times. For the filmmakers of the era of the youth film, it seemed to him that he did not forget to pick up his score for the recent "Peter Pan" and "The Village" hunting Gothic music. I first saw this movie at 13 or 14 and now I'm not crying at the end, I've torn a tear or two for nostalgia. Show this movie to your girls. It will end up becoming a lifetime comfort film.
