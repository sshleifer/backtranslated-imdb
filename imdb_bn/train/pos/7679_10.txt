For my human quadrant project for school, I have nominated human trafficking. After doing some research on the Internet, I found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I'm still thinking about it. I can say "wow" This is a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holi and an interesting story of Patrick, an American man who tries to save her. The end you breathe leaves, and although it does not end after a happily-ever, it's very realistic. It's amazing and I recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patrick and what will happen to you in your heart and its result. I love it a lot and now I want to know what will happen next!
