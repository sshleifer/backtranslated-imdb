Instead of being a spontaneous parody of teenage girls in the 1950s, this film was the first British teenage film, which actually tackled the reality of violent rock and roll society. In an effort to celebrate Liverpool's Junior Lean Officers' work, the opening title shows that 92% of potential criminals, who have been dealt with under the plan, did not commit the second offense. However, the theorem of this movie has only become a trend towards the following two plays where we have been instructed that we should not be liable or guilty for such crimes, but they may feel mixed up. <br /> <br /> Stanley Baker is a tough detective player who unintentionally serves as the Juvenile Leanen Officer. This hard-hitting character is an example of unemployed. Moving on to the path of a notorious arsonist, known as the firefight, is currently being transferred and does not confuse the transfer. However, as a good all-drama drama, he is headed back to the full circle back in an extraordinary event, returning to its original investigation. <br /> <br /> Her first case is that she is in the house of two kids, Mary and leads Patrick Murphy (played by brother of true life and sister duo), who made a small thief. Here he meets his older sister, Cathy (gladly portrayed by Ana Hugh), who are eventually romantically involved. It has quickly become clear that the wild environment of such urban city estates is a breeding ground for teenage crime. <br /> <br /> Morphi's older brother Johnny, the rock and the roller gang leader gangster. As a mixed mix of Americans, McCullum has made an interesting change, which is more than Marlon Brando's opinion than the previous British stars. Johnny, the character of Brendo, reminds one of the 'Wild One', who leads the gang of 'Johnny' in this film, and in the same way leads the gang-ridden gang. <br /> <br /> Previously, criminal crime plays such as 'Blue Lamp' are not so clear. Instead we are presenting several well drawn out characters on both sides of the legal side, criminals take the maximum of romantic interest in drama and hyde and unemployed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, It seemed as if that rock and roll music had a huge impact, it was played in a scene where the man left his music, which proceeded against the serious progress against the police sergeant. The most memorable memorable piece of the film, however, is the climate class scene where a bunch of horrific school children, including Mary and Patrick, were kept hostage in a gunfight by Johnny. Clearly in the light of the real Dumblyn genocide, this scene seems to be all terrible. For this reason, this movie is rarely available for broadcasters or modern viewers.
