Best cheech and chatt movie so far !! All of Cheech and Chong's are far sure of this until now. I've seen almost all of them at least times, and I love them all. But this is most definitely the best. Compared to others, this one covers a lot of themes and gives you a lot of smiles. Part of the text is still part of our language after 25 years. I hope that one day they can do another, because they are still a great comedy. I have heard that they are writing a new script so that knows ... I guess these guys are the only ones who have succeeded in creating a great movie in this series. I wonder if John Ashraf has seen them sometime ...
