Although I understand something bad about this movie, I still feel absolutely amazing. It will touch you and your reviewer will deeply search every film's errors and damages, or you will not touch anything, it's valuable. Do not come to expecting movies, there is only a tissue and an open mind box. It's beautiful and brilliant acting. I think Will Smith, since he is still playing another solo condemned person, is amazing. I believe a good actor is someone who can express real feelings and emotions in our worst / good experiences so that it reaches you and thinks of you. And that's exactly what this movie did. Give it a chance.
