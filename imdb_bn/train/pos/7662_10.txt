As B movies continue, it was better than average (I warned the reader that I can release some original elements of the plot or other parts of the film, although I try to reduce this trend). Seagels usually go away, but it was pretty fantastic. (Despite the keyword "cookie master", it tries to copy some material from the original movie verb. Despite this sometimes annoying tendency, it started working on this particular movie, as long as the attention was drawn from viewer audience comparison "Scanner" <br /> <br /> According to the description of the childhood character of the main character and the relationship with his parents, the film is "Superman N "series (who created models in the same way as Kent in" Superman "stories), and the morally pure hero's theme contains extraordinary power from a young age, etc. It was surprising or otherwise that there was a theme for non-kids, teenagers and / or adults Me "Real Genius", and ("Doctor Mouradrid") hit another extraordinary character, the film was a positive messag, and I enjoyed some insight and accuracy (in terms of some aspect of unusual experience, in terms of imagery) and even deeper times, these moments are occasionally a great formula driven sculpture and an invalid sex (in this case, sexual elements are done transparently) and violence B movies (or Shakespearean plays, about that!) Makes. Fun to see! <br /> <br /> It's all comic books, Saif-Fi, "Remote watching" enthusiasts, and watch for the awesome fans! With the right exposure to the right circles, along with the original "scanner", the film can develop several cultures.
