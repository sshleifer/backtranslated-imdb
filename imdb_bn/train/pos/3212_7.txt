I tried this film for a second time trying to determine why it was not successful as a successful (commercially or artist), and it discovers most of the artistic qualifications - which ultimately can bring its commercial undo. <Br> <br /> First of all, this film has more effort than "serious" science-imagination, social commentary, action-adventure. It has action, but it's not really about it. If you focus on it, you will end up with a bad "alliance" clone (as mentioned by others). But, again, it is not about what it is <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie really transforms Tod's (Curt Russell) transformation from human to the nearest machine and returns to people (mostly * back *). But it is not usually trying to answer a glitch Hollywood style, instead of telling it, Kurt Russell should make this transformation, and basically without the express expression. And he's really done a great job - it can take two views to appreciate it. It is not enough to say that the "social logic" around it is enough and it is not enough to keep its position against an army. Whether the war criminal or his new human trait, or perhaps more senior soldiers from his experience, the film still creates an extraordinary showcase for Russell (easy to underestimate) talent.
