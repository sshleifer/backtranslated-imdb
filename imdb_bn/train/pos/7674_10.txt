I had the privilege of watching "Holly" in the Edinburgh Film Festival last week. What a powerful and moving story! Holly is a 12-year-old Vietnamese girl who is living in prostitution of her own family and a prostitute in Cambodia. Patrick (an American) comes to Holly's life and decides she wants to help him. Whenever Holly is sold, Patrick strictly searches for her. We follow their difficult journey through Cambodia and hope for their reunion. <br /> <br /> Holi is one of millions of children sold and trafficked daily. The film lines illustrate this difficult issue beyond the lines. I want to know more about child trafficking and ask how can I help? This film should be viewed by everyone because it is a beautiful story and it reveals something that we should not ignore.
