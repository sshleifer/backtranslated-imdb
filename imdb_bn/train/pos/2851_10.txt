Japanese Indie film is accompanied by humor and philosophy, where three main characters are literally driven through the whole film, followed by strange situations and comedic events each other. As they are running, we are running into their minds and they see where they got this moment. The ongoing law is a metaphor for these people's lives in their fate. In any way, they are not really following what they are pursuing, but rather to escape the meaning of their lives and their personal problems and broken dreams. Running makes them feel truly alive. Big life-changing running adventure ends when they accidentally get in the middle of big, violent and so stupid that it's fun on a clever way. First of all, a talent director of my favorite films, Sabu.
