This composite and intense kit film Foley's Noir's quality is seemingly fits together "perfectly". Shot shot by shot, edited by editing, the film reveals itself on its own purpose (or lack thereof), and shows itself near a boring boxer. Perhaps other comments probably indicate the lack of kindness interest, but I personally think it's a superbly piece of movie together!
