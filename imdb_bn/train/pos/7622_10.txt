I love this show! It's like watching a mini movie every week !!! The first episode was so intimidating and horrible ... so the pilot's part 2 ... I'll be tuning to this show! This is the real life! I have seen some other comments and I can see that there are already wailing wreaths here after one or two episodes ... Sorry if it is not another reality show, sorry! There was a time when ... Now bind yourself! The real TV show! And today's day is just as much like most CraftCommunics or the same as the ENP-Aesthetic copy of a law and order, or the NYPD blue or CSI series. See yourself to make it your own opinion, don 'take one here from the boneheads!
