Normally, for watching this Halloween to be annoyed with the main films of Run-of-the-Mill, I took a chance at "The Sentinel", hopefully it could flow my horror. You think, I just came back to see "House Heel on House" - Dark Castle Remix - complete and nasty shit. Thankfully, "Sentinel" tell me! In a controversial story about a model of Brooklyn Heights, the film offers an offer that I hope to find in a good movie - (1) Campi and fantastic juicy letters, exchange and dialogue, among which Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldbull and especially Martin Barsam, as the missing psychological professor - (2) horrible terrorism! Not just for giving a frame, but the scenes of this movie let me cool down my pancreas - (3) McNeane gives a fantastic hole, awesome make-up and vacuity (if very incomplete) to the winner, which is a great deal of behavior. If you like "Evil Dead 2", "Dead Alive" and "Deep Rising" - this will be your favorite queen. Just to strengthen my love for this movie - I saw it for the first time, after being dropped from the jaw, I repeated it and saw it again. It's a favorite of all time now. Do yourself a favor and check it out!
