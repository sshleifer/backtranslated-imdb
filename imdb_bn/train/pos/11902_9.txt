This movie is about William Castle's life and times chronicles. In the decade of 1950-1960, he created a series of horrific films of low budget that he sold with the hostages. "13th ghost" You need viewers Scratch (they were in color, film was B & W). "The Tingler" a theater seat was equipped with a buzzer that escapes to a movie theater of a giant when the audience shakes. "Marbri" promotes a life insurance policy to all the members of the death penalty! The movies were quite bad, but the hostages were running to see them. This document contains interviews with Castle, his film, and his daughter actors inspired directors. It is the life of his home and he gets that kind of man (by all accounts he was a great guy). Loving documentary, is very funny and absolutely riveting. It's too short (down to 90 minutes) and there's never a dull moment. A Castle fan and horror movie fans will look for. One of my accusations - There were very few sequences shown from his picture. That's just great on one side.
