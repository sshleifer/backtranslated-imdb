This review is about 30 years late. However, it should be noted that I had a copy of this movie in the middle of 2008 and it has been seen repeatedly for almost 4 months! I just had to write about it! When I saw this movie I got hurt and forgot something else. The most brilliant male drama of literature is ridiculous to portray the most beautiful man! Yet, what a welcome mock! This is my perfect fit and more so because Timothy Dalton made full judgments on his role. He delivers a wonderful and winning performance! I have never seen such a thing before! All other actors are very good. The whole movie is nicely put together. I do not care what someone says about this movie. I just love it and love it! It made me happy and satisfied. It pushed me a little bit to tell me, but I loved Jane Ore 1983 at AndE of P & J, which I think is the final mini series. <br /> <br /> A quote from Jane Eyre a little back in school. As well as knowing the story very well, I did not go very close to reading this book. Seeing this special production my story came to me and brought me closer to fury. The scenes and Mr. Dalton's voice made me steadfast and eventually led me to read the book seriously, which is certainly a wonderful work. Bravo is the whole team and especially Mr. Dalton! This movie is now a part of me. <br /> <br /> I can rate it 10/10.
