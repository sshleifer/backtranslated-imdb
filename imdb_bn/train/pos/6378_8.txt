Atlantis: The Lost Empire's Best, Stunning Animation and I've seen the cute conversation of a Disney movie. And I was sure that in the first 15 minutes. I love voice work, especially in Joshua Strangbaire, in Don Nobel's Vincento Santorini and Phil Morris. The very whole whole film can go to double the speed of a good creator - at least in the first law. An important aspect of a Disney movie is a satisfactory opposition - which does not provide Atlantis. He is the best average. Halfway through the movie there is a middle wrapping. Here's the end. It is still a great movie. Everyone should check it out.
