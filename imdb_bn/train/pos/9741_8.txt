The trailer led me to hope that I was amazed at how to defeat the friendly and alienate people. I quickly became absorbed in the expressive explanation and all chaotic. There was more visual humorous content pacing, I, spot. (I mean that I am disappointed that I have seen many times attempt to restore 'real time' to control Peuge's killings.) At other times the main characters (i.e. Pegas and Donost's) are allowed to share the reflection. How events were influenced by them and they had led them to where they found themselves. All the characters cast well, some amounts interesting and themselves, and were generally quite likable. (Any clear stupidity ambition, tempered by resilience of similar good nature.) An entertaining, intelligently scripted, brightly-handled and wildly starring movie that I totally recommend.
