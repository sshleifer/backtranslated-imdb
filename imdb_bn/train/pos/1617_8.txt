'Moonstrack' is a love story There is not one romance, there are at least three, but all of them have to be with the same family. Loretta's family. Loretta (Cher) is about to marry Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello). She does not love him, but he is sweet and good man. When he went to his mother's mother in Italy, Loretta meets Johnny's brother Ronnie (Nicholas Cage). He and Johnny did not talk each other for five years and Lorenteta wanted to invite him to the wedding. Of course, they fall immediately to each other. <br /> <br /> This story of love and development of Loretter and uncle and aunt will only be seen for yourself. Each one is a joy to see, with the moon as a bright star among all. He won and really deserve that year Oscar. The cage is quite good, and as well as the Lopatra mother and the Olympia Ducakis as Vincent Gardania, her father is awesome. This movie is fun, charming and so enjoyable.
