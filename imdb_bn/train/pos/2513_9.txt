Beautifully done. Anti a lot Friendship can not tolerate all, but ultimately it is important, or so to learn a group of friends. I have seen over and over again. The music is also amazing. Whoever loses a friend, then he surrenders it until he fills an orphan boy, who does not abstain from his true nature. In the devastating streets of Mallepa, they can fight for their positions in the melting pot of the nations of Asia and learn that you are always ready to spend at the top. A complete surprise that grips as much as the whole movie. I could not get enough of it. Gackt and Hyde acting do an amazing job, proving they are more than beautiful boys who are admired.
