There is no day passed without any new animated computer animated movie, so we have the potential to really see some nice effects now. After watching the age of ice, I feel that this film did not have a big impact on me than any other film. <br /> <br /> But it's because I'm a big guy now, and I'm sure it's a very enjoyable movie for children (probably up to 14). The story is quite simple, and "actors" are funny in cute movies without any strange or complex humor. Even the "evil" that lovely, fluffy big cat with fun teeth. And the story is a happy ending, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the major characters have sadly been destroyed for extinction) but a great thing for children. And nobody dies except for some fights (even when he gets stomped by a huge, many times), which created a cartoony feeling. <br /> <br /> The computer animation part is nice but some special, really nice cartoon feeling scenery without anything, when you like to walk on a nice painter or comic page. [Anyway meaning too many work!] <br /> <br /> There were some laughs that made me laugh - I confessed that the makers tried to please those big stars - but they were hard to spot and my opinion was good It has become vague, since it can not fit in the story. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie, but it is ideal for the world-and-fold-animals-kids-Disney-Cleili Do not hate the beautiful creatures you make fun things, at least once see it.
