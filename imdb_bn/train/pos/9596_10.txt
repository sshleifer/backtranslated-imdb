This film records an transformational experience for a group of young men and the viewing experience is transformed into an audience. Some movies are even attracted to this level of outline, and I can think of any other movie - documentary or drama - it achieves it. There is no movie that I laugh at both and cried so loudly. Yes, it is about DMD and accessible travel; These issues alone, it is a suitable initiative, but it is also more. It's about friendship It's about life, about living you alive that day. And it's a great, fun, adventure. That is why the creator of the Creator! Watch this movie !!!
