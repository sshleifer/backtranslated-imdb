A very high quality Colombo story that was the first portrayal of a long-running series, but was originally sent to the second (after "book murder"). <br /> <br /> <br /> The guest of this series was present as a murderer and private secret organization, the wife of a wealthy, highly influential businessman (Patricia Crowley) Blackmail (played sympathetically with Ray Milland), after a false allegation on his behalf, it was a matter of discovering it. The wife then rebelled against the blackmail scheme but died in the scandal .... <br /> <br /> In many cases a very satisfying phase, especially the plots were set up so strongly and improved later and also the crime of the rare column Because of an unpremeditated murder. In order to help her investigate the Colombo, the widowed husband increases the whole thing to help the murderer: a feature that fills three central letters in the first order, especially for the first time in order to facilitate the good quality scenes and proves the significant catchy qualities of Colombo. <br /> <br /> Bernard L. Directed and operated on a high level with Kwalsky Flyer, it actually set the voice for the entire series (since "Murder by book" was dropped by a bad end). The script of columnist Richard Levinson and William Link is illustrated by a specific, well-organized and well-thought-out and strong, productive motion and meaningful sequence that really shows the unpredictability of the story. Finally, the final publication reveals that Columbu was always one step ahead of the killer. <br /> <br /> Overall, for Colombo, it is a subtle piece of intelligence and strongly suggests that the production team has worked positively and rewards a smooth Columbo story constructively.
