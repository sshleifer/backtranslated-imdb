One of the movies that you are thinking about to wake up the next morning. It will give you warm, vague feeling and will leave you with a smile on your face. <br /> <br /> Of course, we're eating common stereotype letters and stories, but it does the trick: Entertainment. <BR> <br /> From Sweden and living in the United States for a while, it's interesting how we react. "The husband of death will kill him", "He (Gabriela) is going to die and then a hearty big life will end." We know how these things work, everything comes together at the end. And it did. The letters were somewhat easy, they were so broad that you did not think twice about it, that there was really nothing left for your own imagination. The closest would probably be a sive, he would ask himself if he really loved Daniel, but it was about him. <br /> <br /> But the movie is beautiful, set in the countryside Norland, the music is absolutely amazing and the character is lovable. Michael Nyqvist is truly gifted, with his crazy unique appearance and Frida Hallberg charming and approachable. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture mostly thinks, and this is the most important thing. You cry, smile on you, hate you and identify you. I do not know about you guys, but that does not happen often.
