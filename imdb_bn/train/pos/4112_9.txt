The title is anomotropic, a street movement on the road. It may not have been metaphor for all those who live in the dump. The misery of those people is illustrated by the streets of the street, which represents the relatively unexpected rich life of the middle class. The little boy and his beloved boyfriend but the tragic insane father is touching most of the stone. It was Kurushwa's first photo color and she used a nicely frustrating color, the colors are only seen in dreams. The movie is surreal and beauty is surpassing. Feeling of compassion for humanity, but as always, Kurosawa film is focused on capturing beauty. It is a masterwork by a genius in the movie.
