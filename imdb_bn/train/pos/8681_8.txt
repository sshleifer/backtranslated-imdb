This cartoon shortcut plot, but an apparently stunning piece of work. Very short, very small spoilers: <br /> <br /> This brief is a "story" which is incredibly little-gnomes groundwater responsible for returning to spring every year, yet must be prepared with a winter retreat. Gnomes and Storm have both their own songs. This is mostly the plot, as it is. But this cartoon is not about a plot - it's about color and animation. Visual exceptional Back in 1936, this bright color was still some of innovation and here there are some incredibly inspired work. <br /> <br /> My favorite moments surround the fluid movement with pipes. At a number of points, there is a series of rows queued pipes that move from small to long and the colors are moved through the pipes and the musical track thinks that the row is a piped organ. <br /> Scenes of war between emerging green vegetables and winter storms that refuse to leave silently are very effective. These shorts were notable for Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising, but perhaps it led to their final exit from MGM, because the cartoon probably went to the budget, and MGM finally decided that if they could control the better cost of animation, Herman and Isinge Less than few were aware. <br /> <br /> It is really a beautiful cartoon and good to see. It is available on 30 character DVD attacks. Recommended, especially if you like good animations.
