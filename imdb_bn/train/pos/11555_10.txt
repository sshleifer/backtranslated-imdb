A simple comment ... <br /> <br /> What can I say ... this is an extraordinary movie that I can keep an eye on. It's one of the top ten comedy created explicitly. Jack Lemon and Walter Matthow wrote a perfect script by Neil Simone through a perfect Christie. <br /> <br /> This is truly real in real life. If you have a digital cable, give it to the menu below the screen. It usually gives ***% big to this picture but the reality it deserves to be **** big. If you really see this movie, nobody can say that it will be as fun and fresh as one hundred years from now.
