When I was a child, I liked both Bill and Ted. The other night, Bogus Journey was on and I have seen it since at least five years, I have decided to protect. And I love it all again! This film is still funny all year after. 'Excellent adventure' is good, but this one stone is exactly the same. Sure, some sophistication is a bit cheesy, but hey, this whole movie is Chesie on the cool side. Plus it features a coolest personality ever in a movie ever! Conclusion: Completely non-bogus movie like dude! The way is wonderful! STATION !!!
