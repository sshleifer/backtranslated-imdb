This is a quirky little movie, and I agree that it has some quirky acting. <br /> <br /> It follows the courage of a young man that wants to be a young Las Vegas. All about misguiding, and partly about his dreams, partly about the dreams of others, and the travails of the showbiz. I thought the movie was charming, and it was a moment of real magic or two that would make the whole thing worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Alan Orkin is awesome as a sorcerer, and Max's advice creates a fun and sensitive relationship for him. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, perhaps, but if you like movies about the journey, then you think you like it.
