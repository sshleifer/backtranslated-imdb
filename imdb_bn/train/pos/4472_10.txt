From the beginning you can see that "Anchor Away" is a great comedy. Jean Kelly and Frank Sinatra are such fun teams! They sing singing together pure entertainment Kathryn Grayson is fantastic and really sweet. Dean Stockwell I've never seen inferior child actor If you are a piano boyfriend, you will be surprised by Jose Itur. This film combines the first actors with real actors and it is an unforgettable dance number. Undoubtedly one of Kelly's funniest movies.
