Monstervision was a show I grew up in. Joe Bob Briggs, the only one to have a hosting with Penn and Teller late in the night. The program holds me in high school years on Friday night and never gives out some memories of the best drive-memories beyond drive-in. <br /> <br /> Never be the best night television, without any doubt. If you were not there, you were missing. <br /> <br /> I knew John Bloom and Joe Bob live, but I want them back where they belong ... Monitor! Question: Did anyone else sit for 4 hours of "horse"? Q :) <br /> <br /> A long-standing mindset!
