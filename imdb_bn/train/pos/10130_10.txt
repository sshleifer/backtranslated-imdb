Pilot is working very well. It makes out how to bond the future episode. I do not think anyone for this show might have made a good pilot. It shows extraordinary creativity in part of the author. Although the first thing was not straightforward because it was the first episode, the event that happened in the future season was shown in the pilot. An example would be Ross and Rachel's future relationship. Although the nervousness of the first episode appeared, it was overcome by an amazing plot and extraordinary cast choices. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
