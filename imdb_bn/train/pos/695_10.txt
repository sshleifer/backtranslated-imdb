This movie attracts you and makes you attractive to keep your eyes on the screen. The authors / directors are bold using descriptive parts and creative and attractive camera corners and perspectives and it is all tied to you firmly. Insomnia nightmares are real and you are different from refreshing from any film. Is it a dream or a reality? This indie will talk about twists and turns you through conscious and subconscious. It has an eery feeling with the dark explanation of illusion. Dominic Monaghan really became insomnia. He is a great actor who is not hard on both eyes! She really pours this role to her full role. This indie makes my favorite one, from storyline it is shot. I am interested to see more from this innovative, creative writer / director / cinematographer and wait enthusiastically!
