This darling little comedy has so much love. Anyone who has bought or bought any house, even the space is decreasing, he will see that Mr Blonding's illness has more than a real crop. Malvin Douglas, along with the comedic flair, works both as a narration and Blindings' attorney and voices of the cause. Besides, Marina Loya is spreading instead of her but she is best as the patient's wife. But the best performance is Grant's He is American American, especially during the liberation war of this movie when there was a housing shortage in the aftermath of the war. Themes are universal, lack of money, pressure of work, fear of unfaithfulness Yes, it is wrapped nicely, but you must remember that it was a time when the world was restored only from a terrible war and a good ending. It is relevant even today, and I want to be discouraged, slim poor reviews that look at the current choice for current humor. The appearance of the film is light, and some great bits of comedy have started well, especially at the beginning. It has lost some social relevance after almost 60 years of release, it is still a jewel.
