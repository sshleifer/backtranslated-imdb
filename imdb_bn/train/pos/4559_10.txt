My eldest sister was born in March 1985 and has a Sevral policy. At the age of 22, he did not see anything except our house and the wall of his school, which also occupied with other disabled children. My sister has become disabled, because I was the butt of everyone's joke, and I still think that no one will be able to blame her, or her condition and her condition. Then I saw this picture. <br /> <br /> I knew how the family of Christ was running. But they were lucky. Christie could speak, she could communicate, and had her artistic skills. My sister can walk, but she can not speak, and she can not use her hand to do anything but she can catch things. But this picture helped me realize that there were other people in my world like my sister, and the last (to tell the truth) made me cry. And I saw Bashir !!! This image is intrinsically important, and it should not be. This movie says something to the people. That people should be proud of their own life. Do not you think you can write well? This guy wrote with his legs. Do not you think interesting? This guy got down a lot by the girls because of his condition. Do not run fast? Christian can not stand even My point: Parents of small children, I advise your children to see this film with you, so they will know that they can see someone on the street next time. Wheelchairs, they look alien like they do not look at. Millions of my sisters got stares, and it seems to break my heart that it is still happening to many people. This film will teach people that people who do not seem to be "normal" are also people. 10/10
