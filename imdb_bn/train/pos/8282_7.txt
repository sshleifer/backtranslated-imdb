** Possible Spirit ** <br /> <br /> The biggest part of the movie does not work Wendigo, and when your title character fails, your movie is not usually far behind it. The interpretation of Wendigo's form of filmmakers is interesting, and if properly portrayed, it may be appropriate - when the fleeing assassin sees Wendigo flash in the mirror in his back scene, for example - and the form of the tree was actually very good. However, it does not really come to life as a demon character. We do not get much explanation for his behavior, and what we see from it is in the story of the film or any Winedogo story that I can never read. <br /> <br /> I think that the main reason for the giant failing is that it is not given enough in the movie. When you throw this film in its bones, then what you have is a mysterious thriller with a supernatural element. It's a giant about a movie instead of a <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />; The filmmakers use visible, light and daylight to better express the atmosphere and mood. Otis's character comes across as a real dangerous and unpredictable, which makes him the real giant in the film. It can be more effective to explain his behavior because of holding him with the hungry spirit of Waindigo, which may also be a more accurate representation of the true legend. <br /> <br /> I've heard vague reports (from a newsgroup) that do not have too much Wendigo because, when the giant suite was made, it became very heavy and uncomfortable (imitating the opinion of the standing position on the shake hay To do, the actor had to walk in) his hose) Run it, walk, or otherwise it was almost impossible to perform. In this way, many flashes of animals are still standing, and its clear speed-up footage is underway. I stress that this report is incomplete.
