The movie disappointed me. Personally I was mostly bad buzz of beef. Eventually after a few months of being owned by the DVD, I pooped it on a sleepy night. Although the movie dragged, the extra footage would have been less realistic if its emotional seriousness and the game's use of its reclamation exceeded the scene. The best thing about the movie is that it is compatible with the relationship. No ex-popping up or letter relationship was threatening. I think we usually see the girl seeing some amazing turn of the fate, and she sees the date, some of the things we've seen pauses them, and then they come back together in the last five minutes of the film. But this movie does not follow that mold. We actually felt relationships and flaws, and although there were no anti-love moments in the letters, they did not have dramatic pauses and they did a montage every 15 minutes and then again met again in love. I think the movie was not as expected for the rest of the romance movies. This story was true and true truly true that I thought these people were the most credible in this movie that I have seen in modern romance movies. And it was not all that baseball games were real and they were kicked in a little bit of luck so at the real world series. This is not a "my fair lady" but it is an enthusiastic and honest film. I just want to say I like it.
