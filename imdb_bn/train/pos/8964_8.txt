Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak created the horrific title of "Whirlogo" by Hitler, in the same year, in some happy cases, they created this light comedy. Perhaps two actors will have to do this after hitting the heavyweight film. At any rate it is a great part of "Vertigo" as part of a great companion, and it again searches for a very impossible but powerful romance. Actually this film can be seen as the opposite of "delicious". Here again incorporates a transformation of Novak, Vertigo he essentially plays two women and here he 'transforms' from the witch to the mortal. Stewart reacts again and for some time madly by his love for him. Unlike Vertigo, a perfect harmonic "Bell Book and Candle" are combined for the hitkoc film. Again the love and attraction of dynamics is examined but a completely different vein. Throwing horror Like Novak's Fraud Brothers and Elsa Lancaster, Lemon gives classic performance as a sunny aunt. Alanie Kovacs is an alcoholic Sanskrit writer and of course, Hermione Jingled Novak's competitor plays all the best. The best of the comedy with Stewart's Potion Water scene Vertigo has never seen anyone or even you will see this memorable light comedy.
