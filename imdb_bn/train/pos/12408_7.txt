Viggo Martensen stars as a new prisoner of a hypocrite prison, among which Warden (played well by Lane Smith) is a mystery secret, because it is being killed by prisoners and prisoners by a supernatural presence. Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the mystery and is scared for his life. When I think of movies in prison, I always think of action-oriented action films like Stallone or Van Dam or Shashank's Redemption or high-performance plays like The Green Mile. However, I did not expect another ghost story with Exstस्ता III. However, the prison is atmospheric effort and it must be the best movie of Roni Harleen's career. The movie is unclear and has some good acting from a cast to unknown. Lane Smith is best off because his warden is not a normal person of bad personality but rather nervous and anxiety, which gives some credibility to the movie which exceeds expectation. <br /> <br /> *** 4- (good)
