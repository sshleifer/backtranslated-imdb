Tweedy was a professor-kind thought out they all figured out. Today's people living in Polynesia have come down from migrants from Asia, which has been extinct for thousands of years from Island to Island, to Tithi on the east and to other other tropical islands of the South Pacific. But the established thinking did not sit well with young Norwegian dancer Thar Heyyadahal. If this explanation is true, how do some people born and reproducible in this island, like tradition, art, and physical features, not from Asia, rather than South America? Ecuador, Peru and Chilean trees, how many thousands of miles away can you see what you are looking for in the island? Is this just a compromise that the Islands point to the sea from the direction of South America and say that their ancestors came, the same thing as their Adam under the leadership of Tiki? Meanwhile, how did the Norwegian residents retreat from the continent of South America, colonize the Scandinavian predators, and together with some local people, they had closed on the sea - did the West Heading? This is a lot more than a compromise of Hieradahal. An unusual amount of Maxi, a mobile phone for the Kremlin, and local know-how to build a traditional roof, an expedition begins. It travels a lot more to human imagination because it is a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with basic equipment and marine systems. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in its tone and Anglo-Earth-centric approach, but it encourages the adventures of the space program that began decades later, because people think it is risky to test such a theory. Truth. Wonderful. Make yourself a favor and read the first book. This is an amazing page-turner and perfect setup for newsroom-style movies.
