But that's what director Brad Cyberling did. And it was really good. <br /> <br /> "There are similar ideas like" 10 items or less "before Sindhi," lost in translation "or more recently" Once "movies. If two of these people are involved in the opportunity meeting, those who do not stream there, they probably will not cross the path, or if they did, they would not talk to each other.

The presence of Freeman gives credibility to this film, although he usually shows some amount of elegance and fun that he does not see from him. Paz Vega, meanwhile, is encouraging yourself for the success of US film in the future. I love him in Spanish and he is equally good here, as good as nonsense scarlet. At the end of the film, he successfully published the growth of his character.
