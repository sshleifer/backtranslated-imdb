I saw this cartoon for the first time and the characters of the famous black entertainment ... Cafe Calloway, Besie Smith, (Josephine Baker or Sophie Tucker, who was not white), Thomas "Fat" Waller, Bill "Boogangles" Robinson, Steele Fetchit (Anyway) Louis Armstrong and chorus girls are out in the famous "Cotton Club" in Harlem. True ... there is stereotype, but this was the way ... and the main features of these cartoons were previously considered as adult entertainment in your local movies. <br /> <br /> Harmon and Ishq cartoons are more "cutesy" and more enthusiastic, (above all ... we are talking about MGM) Mannan, Parameter, Universal, Fox, RKO or Low Colombia. Disney's very basic Mickey Mouse was also Bernard's humor, before he became "technically correct" Uncle Walt made him clear. <br /> <br /> Disney had some cartoons as well as black entertainment ... For example, 1937's Silly Symphony "Woodland Cafe". But we must keep in mind that these movies are part of specific times and places. From now on 50 years ... Clips of Simpson, Family Guy, and South Park will also be examined, analyzed ... and will also be influenced by future visitors.
