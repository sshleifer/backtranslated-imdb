I'm honest I got this movie so I can make it fun I mean, "the living dead hood"? Can I have another response? In fact, the film (and its creator) decided that it would not be fun. Instead, it's going to try its best to be a good movie. <br /> <br /> and you know what? It came very close. A little less cheese in the instrumental music, a little more professional in photography, acting, events (opinions - love the best buy bag) ... Well, it's not artistic in the zombie movie, but it's still a beautiful little movie on its own. And acting, writing and pacing is all amazing better than I expected. There are even some decent humor, because our two leads have to debate whether dead zombies die. <br /> <br /> If you have a low budget (which leaves fingerprints in everything) and almost constant prejudice, this movie can be a fantastic fun time. No, it's not great. Yes, it could be good. But the creators, actors, crew, they all tried to make a good film (instead of a camp classic) and many have been counted for it. Campmy zombie movie line is a mile long, and thanks for adding you, say, <br /> <br /> Couode with quiroz brothers. I want to see what's next. Oh, no one, give them a budget!
