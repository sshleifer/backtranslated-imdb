Super Mario 64 is undoubtedly the greatest game ever made. It is so busy that you can play it for hours without breaks. I lost the game 4 times, but I never got 120 stars ... (I got 111) ... but I hope to finally get them. Although I did not play this game officially at the age of seven, my sisters liked to play it. Now I'm 13 years old and still playing, erasing games and starting again. <br /> <br /> Graphics are incredible for playing the initial N64. Gameplaces addictive Control is great. Dimension is difficult, but not impossible. Bowser fights are challenging. <br /> <br /> I want to tell you more, but why do not you get it for yourself? Keep the X-Box 360, PS3, and Wii away and go find yourself a Nintendo 64 and play this amazing, wonderful game.
