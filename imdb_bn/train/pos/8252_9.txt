A year or so ago, when I was on TV watching a zombie movie shooting in my film, I was watching TV news. From then on I have given special attention to the film 'Fido', because it has ended and started playing on the festival. Two weeks ago, Pido started playing in my local theater. And, yesterday, I read a newspaper article that said that without the exception of our local theater, fido is not attracting a limited audience. In fact, it is here with 300 out of all the shows in The Paramount Theater. Of course, this is what locals want to see their city on the screen or go around in Jumbo makeup. And for any locals who have not yet seen ido but considering this, I can say that there are many pictures on the screen, from school to city banned areas to banned area, which you can recognize. Actually they look beautiful in the Okanagan Valley. That's a beautiful scenery right in the zombie movie! However, Fido itself is a very good movie. Yes, despite its flaws, it is good after 20 more movies in my local market. Fadi is best described as an episode of Lassi, in which the clay is replaced by an unwanted member. This is a tricky evidence. And emphasizing the 1950's collapse and playing the cold-war paranoia, which led to McCarthyism, the film goes further. In addition, it gives the idea that Jabbians can be hostage or trained, which Georgia Romero introduced to the dead day for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Longs for a zombie servant, so he would be like other other house wives in his block May However, his father (Dylan Baker) was against the idea because once he killed his 'Junkie father'. Finally, the family achieved a Junkie named 'Fido' (played by Billy Connolly), and adjusted life with the inferiority. Billy Connolly was inspired to inspire. He is able to express Fido's confusion, emotion, hatred, and loyalty only through his eyes, lumbering body, and grunts. Connie shows that she can unexpectedly play different letters than comrades. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Eli Roth and more than just cross-examined Bruce Campbell and Misty Munde are somebody who admires the movie, I like the humor in my horror. However, I understand the criticism of the awesome fans who feel adequate 'indefinite killings' in the idoos. Still, I am convinced that the audience of the patient will be rewarded with mild humor. <br /> <br /> This movie breaks in the third phase. As the authors wrapped up on the beautiful premises of Housewife Jumbo in the 1950s, so they forgot the story. However, my interest in horror comedy and my gratitude for watching the surrounding area on the screen, I have 10 out of 10 feeders.
