Love! What is not to like? You got your suburbs, got your jumbo, your family got a problem, you got your social conflict, you're feeding yourself with a fine retro-1950s-style flush under the class held by a fine reverse thought. It's about whether they casts the next meal high. You can not ask for more. <br /> <br /> Cast Fantastic. Kerry Ann Moss is the absolute perfection as a debut social holiday housewife. He is both passionate, and criminal conspirators. The dream of each colleague. The boy is just trying to be as normal as possible in the existence of this nightmare and howsoever successful, who's really great. She has a real screen appearance. Extremely photogenic, and natural. Without all their names, the rest of the cast wonders. Henry Czerny plays a suspect with respectable instincts and a little intensity as if it is his daily personality. Billy Connolly is as pleasing as Fido. A fine actor: I want him to play the role of "Brahhart", by the direction of Gibson. My idea was that his William Wallace was close to the real character. Includes its Fido, yet accessible. A beautiful touch <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A real reality show.
