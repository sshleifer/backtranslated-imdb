I just imagine this humble, and finished watching beautiful acting / directed movies. Due to extremely confusing advertisements, I was sure whether I was going to spend time watching a movie on the Lifetime Movie Network. To read the previous comment it persuaded me to give a shot. After all the bad that may happen I could fall asleep at one point of annoying but tall bug spray ads. So why did I see it? Mainly because when IMDB gives a movie, the "weight gain" of 5.8 degrees is average 7.3 of the statistical average. This is certainly a sure hit. <br /> <br /> I'm absolutely glad to take time to watch this movie, Commercial Pox and all. Helen Hunt surprised me with her ability to play a difficult role in attracting her key personality to fit my role. <br /> <br /> The painting he painted in this film is still difficult, but the accessible human police officer was finely executed. When the scene quickly witted, calls for timely delivered oral reception, he can stand fingertip to toes with any actor. Even if there is no sound that is based on facial expression and body language, he is able to provide emotional response volume. Rather than advertise the continuity of any good movie continuity, it can be the Nail-Biter of the original seat. I gave it a 9.0
