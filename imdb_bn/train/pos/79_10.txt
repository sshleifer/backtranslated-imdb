I love Real Mac Kais√© (1957-1963) It is very bad that Lydia Reid has forgotten and decided to appear. She was nice to show Of course, Walter Brennan and Tony Martinez were also excellent. I called Amos Sunr Village. I bought Season 1 in DVD and I can not wait to buy it in season 2-6. If there are more shows on television then everything will be better. This show was briefly published in the summer of 1999 but then disappeared. Bless all the great members of God Cast and please, Lloydia Reid, introduce yourself to the public again. You are loved and respected. Real Mac Kays will live forever.
