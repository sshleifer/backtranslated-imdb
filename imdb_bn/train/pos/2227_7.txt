It can get all the reviews on the map because it is not quite comfortable in a mold. It's awful - but not a splatterfest. It's also as part of the Suspense as well as the Horoscope - without the usual Hollywood screams and shocking cameras. <br /> <br /> The feeling of movie is extra and lean as well as a special effect, because I think you will hear and see the faces of the characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Buffy graduated in the universe. That's a red herring. He's acting here. The tone of the 'camp' story is a mistake to read. Adrienne Barbeau is giving a rock solid performance - so she has to say something to the script she will believe. We all know sorry excuse where actors are no longer taking care of and waiting for the director to "cut" and get their check marks. This incident is not here, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keep the balance off. <br /> <br /> Think of it as a horror 'movie' and a horror 'play' on one more platform - which reduces the Wheelwash House. Then you can see that it is really paranoia, fear, and isolated dementia, located in isolated places in the United States. <br /> <br /> And twisty it Time travel, mind control, secret tests and Nazi people will not die. . .yet <br /> <br /> <br /> Please tell me to rent it and if you are in the mood for a little brain then try it. It would be a good choice for a midnight Saturday on Saturday.
