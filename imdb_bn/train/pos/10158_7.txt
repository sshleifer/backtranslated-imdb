Johnny and June Carter Cash have made this movie a traditional rendering of Gospel stories. The music is great, how you feel like the world of Jesus (I was also there) and June came to a part of Mary Magdalin with a single mind. The description of the cash is very good. <br /> <br /> But .... <br /> <br /> 1. Jesus was the actor actor miscast. 2. There is no point in the story that keeps some cash based on her belief-based music. 3. Because it is incomplete, I suspect that we will always distribute it in a broad way. <br /> <br /> I love to buy CDs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tom Pinn, Texas, United States
