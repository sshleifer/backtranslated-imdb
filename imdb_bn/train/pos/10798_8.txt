At first Joe saw this gem from Serno, and I must say that after seeing it, I could never forget Jennifer Wells. At first I thought the film was going a bit slower than the move, but when Jennifer made her entrance, for the first time I saw her somewhere, I was sitting and noticed. It is hard to avoid his presence in this film, and the scenes he is involved in spice up. I mostly watched Saraon's movie and starred in other films or starring Jennifer Wells, and I must say that both of them move and Jennifer is their collective best The move to the domestic adult drama film is fantastic, and Jennifer has shown a performance skill (metaphorically and literally) which it must look for. Co-star Rebecca Brook (Ur Mary Mandum) and Chris Jordan, often co-starring Mrs. Wales, and Soranna's work often become credible performance as a pair of stars, adventurers, normal housewives. This picture is classic to move.
