I just saw the drug year on VH1 and I love it. I think it best reflects the history of the drug and, most importantly, it is a strong message to all generations. There are many examples of drug use, drug use and drug addiction, there are deaths of Joplin's, Hendrix and Jim Morrison. It covers the length of time in drug use and evolution in America with good and bad ways. According to me, this documentary is well done and I want to congratulate its producers because this is exactly what it is about playing on TV on this day. I'm waiting for a DVD release. You will definitely see it !!! This movie is stunning - big time!
