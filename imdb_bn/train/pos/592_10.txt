In Arielton Heights, there was no cafeteria in elementary primary schools (1961), so I used to visit my bike home from school for lunch and have always seen this game. Honestly, I was 11 years old, but I thought it was the greatest thing! I want to paint hidden pictures on my blackboard and see if my family or friends can find it. If the contestant gets the final hidden picture game, then I think I won the excellent car (Pontiac or Oldsmobile). I was even home version! <br /> <br /> I wonder why this game has gone so far. I enjoyed music and hidden pictures - the only one that I could ever get was hidden hidden as part of a bridge over the stream of a garden. <br /> <br /> Really good memory is connected to camoflays
