Recently I had the opportunity to watch the screening of this movie. I believe that it will be some time in Canada's theater on Mother's Day. If it is in a theater near you ... go! This is not a fun-like movie - it's more like a feeling and thought film. <br /> <br /> The director does a wonderful job of developing the character - hurts you heart, mind and heart. Little bit At first, there is not much knowledge of his attitude and behavior. When his story is released, anyone who understands it becomes. Like life ... The burden comes with sympathy. I found her favorite at the end of the movie - especially when she shook the young man in the lake. <br /> <br /> Hagar's relationship with his two sons was painful - and many of our own experiences of this world reflecting it. His little boy, John, who completed life and adventure, takes the viewer to the very edge of his seat - and such a raw emotion that is so pure and rare. <br /> <br /> It is fun to watch this movie starring Allen Page. She is much different than a young man in Juneau. It gives even a wider expansion for its performance capabilities. If you like him in Juneau, you'll love him with Stone Angel. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is Elen Bertstein. There is probably no way to express the power of acting, which enables the actor to empower you to never forget any of his other characters. Sometimes I never thought of Bertinin in this film - I always think of Hagar and only He entered into my character - hook, line and syncer. <br /> <br /> Curry Skogland's power to capture this image is impressive by one of Canada's most sophisticated authors. He brings these curious women glorious, Hagar-stone angel both stoney and angel both curtains.
