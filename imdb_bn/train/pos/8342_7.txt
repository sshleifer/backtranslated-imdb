A fairly romantic comedy that I do not think I've ever seen a crocodile in Mega. All players have done a good job to keep an animated romp. Indeed, in the real world, no gifted mathematician will look at some of the monkeys in Greece, but that is why I love romantic comedy .... Anyone can truly forget completely and get a good time. Nice movie. Well, Meg is a child, is not it?
