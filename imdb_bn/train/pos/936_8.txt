Everyone is familiar with this most famous story ?? The unfortunate businessman is seen by the death of the former death partner of Christmas and warns that if he continues in his absurd way, then he will be destroyed in the chains for the afterlife. So that he can avoid the fate of his partner, he visited with three souls who showed him past, present and still the perspective of Christ, so that he could see his ways wrong before he was too late. May be a rather morbid story, but it is also the classic Charles Dickens, and is one of the most famous and popular Christmas stories of all time. <br /> <br /> The definitive version of this Dickens fiction story; I always remember to see in school, and I feel completely scared! Jacob Marley's Scratch, the final scene with Christmas ghosts under the bridge, and Christmas spells have not yet come, especially I was scared. How did the film get the 'U' certificate on earth? ('U' for the non-UK readers' lowest classification, meaning family friendly and children welcome, they have nothing to fear ... in this case it is not, though some small children will doubtfully find the final segment horoscope positively. Looks like a <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm adapted for the film from many versions of this classic story Yes, this is probably the most trustworthy side of the book, most notably a segment seen in the adaptation of the film, which shows the two children hiding under the scrooge of Christmas Eve under his clothes (you will not go away with a scene like today!). Represented (though you want to change this image). <br /> <br /> Criticism for me They are again seen again with more targeted and trained eyes, among which George C Scrooge's sketch is not enough to just feel cold. He is very laughing. I do not want to use humble word because the aerobius is something else, but he is frustrated, cold And, rather than a stranger, only an intelligent old man thinks he is in books and other movies. Despite acting alongside Pepper Stuart Muppet, the most recent versions were portrayed and illustrated by Michael Cain, who was positively cool. Furthermore, due to the development of character over the film, he learn more about the error in his way and progress towards release and seems inconsistent. He seems to have changed little by the time the third soul's final lesson reached. <br /> <br /> But ignoring this one (although major) quibble, it's still a spell and at least heart-warmed Christmas story, all be as Christmas films. Looks like London's perfect beautiful snow-covered English town seems like most Americans probably imagined it (that London was gray and slowly and no snow was so white!) And everyone dressed up very irrational, even poor people rather look dapper . But of course it's a Christmas film, so why not look beautiful at all? Visit Perfect Holiday Season; It's a wonderful life, the 34th Street and the statue of Snowman and it got everything you needed.
