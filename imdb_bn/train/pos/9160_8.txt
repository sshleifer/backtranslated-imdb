In all the comments of Dalton's praise or suppressing comments, I thought he was nice. He does not play Rochester as a humiliating rich son, but as a barbaric, strong man. I liked this version, though the video aspect shot was sometimes confusing, and Jane and St John's scenes were not fully sparked. I give this an 8.
