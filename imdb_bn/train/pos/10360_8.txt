It is a documentary story in the London Chamberlain case and it is an eye on the impact on Australian society. It shows the problem of real life, especially stupid, silent and hopeful when dealing with dramas. <br /> <br /> A problem related to the story is that it is expected that people will have the same mental reactions. The circumstances Not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics for each major crisis. The characters of movies and TVs are played in a certain way because the real people do not expect them to do this. This is especially suitable for journalists and news editors, who search for large-scale scenes that pull ratings. This is a subject which will be constantly restrained. <br /> <br /> Leads can play letters with depth, personality, and sensitivity. And they are supported by a large cast based on public-based people. Some viewers may be surprised that many people supporting this story are known in Australia as comic actors. It reconsidered my ideas that comedians make some of the best fans of the drama because they can establish quick impressions of individuals with a comedy. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Alert!) <br /> <br /> I have to say something very private here; I was actually a former Adventist who was a practice member in Australia when this incident happened; So I have a slightly different impression than the story. I think it is managed with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. I think the best scene where new couples hurt the couple <br /> <br /> I once said to Fred Schipsky in an interview that he told the actor that they can play the best role for their character. Although it is particularly suitable for this story, I think it is also a general principle that should be applied to all the roles.
