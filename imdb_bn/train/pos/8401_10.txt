Love trap is a "must see" independent film. When I was sitting to watch movies, I came with low expectations, but gave a blessing. Story is poetic, real, and creative. The author is dragging you into more and more each scene, which allows you to relate each scene to realistic characters that can be detected by everyone. The film allows me to reflect my life and reflect on what I think. Does the film really show love, actions or emotions? I was fascinated by the cinematography and the soundtrack of the film. The whole presentation exceeded my expectations. I suggest two large fingers up in the movie and all age groups and all backgrounds.
