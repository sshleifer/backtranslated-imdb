I have shown this film the speech of the university students and the media's law because its text is uninterrupted: why talking against injustice can bring changes and changes made by the oppressed. Why freedom and freedom of speech are essential for democracy? This view is seen in the way of how the racism was brought to the world by Steven Boke's activism and the journalism of Donald Woods. It gives an important lesson for free lectures: "You can blow a candle, but you can not burn a fire. Once it starts to flame, the wind will blow it up." (From Peter Gabriel's bikes, trees flock).
