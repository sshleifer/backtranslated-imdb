I saw The Blobby several times and was one of the few lesser foreigner foreigner aggression films in the 1950s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And a young couple, who look at the weather ground and take them to a local doctor, where the old man is completely absorbed by the mass. The doctor and his nurse were next victim and mass being larger. When this incident is reported to the police, they do not believe in the young couple and blame them for doing it all. The masses are now active in huge city towns when they finally believe in them and everyone walks on the street streets. This is then a young couple and some others attach themselves to a diner. Blobbetches it in a spray of fire extinguishing machine and it is frozen, which is its weakness. Then it is transmitted by the aircraft to the Arctic frozen waste and settled there. But it is not frozen, dead ... <br /> <br /> This movie is a general setting for its time: teens and a small town. At the beginning of the blob, there is a good rock and roll style theme song and the film is full of atmospheric. <br /> <br /> Sickle, be careful! Following the Blob in 1927 and came in a remake in 1988, it's the best of The Blob films. <br /> <br /> This image is directed by Steve McQueen (The Great Account) and is a film that makes him star and plays Anata Krosaut with his girlfriend. I'm not familiar with any other stars. <br /> <br /> Blob must be seen for all fans of science-fans. Nice <br /> <br /> Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
