I really enjoyed this movie as a small kid. At that age, I thought that the stupid baseball antique was fun and it was "cool" because it was about sports. Now, a few years later, I can look back and see if it's a well-designed film. This film confronts other children as my little child and struggles for real world problems. This type of exposure is basically a lack of lack of cinema in movies that I do not think it is for the benefit of our society. Of course, baseball antics really seem to be stupid, but they attract kids. No seven-year-old kids are looking to see a movie about children, but they want to see a movie about baseball. Disney realized this fact and enjoyed these kids to teach an important lesson about this world. <br /> <br /> The performance of Al and the other angels as a young adult seems much less impressive, but I have both creditors, both actors and Danny Glover who have done an excellent job in both the games.
