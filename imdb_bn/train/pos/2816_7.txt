It's an upper average Jackie Chan Flick, a fantastic ending and a great comedy, but the other that does not have anything special about it. All the characters are quite cool, and are entertaining throughout the film, plus Jackie Chan this is simply amazing! Jackie and Y Man Chan were fantastic chemistry together and both were so funny, and I thought that the main opponent looks really dead! However, dubbing was just terrible! The development of character is more than average for this type of thing! And the main battle is just awesome! Plus Jackie takes some of these obstacles! There are lots of stupid and silly humor in it, but it surprised me, and the ending is lovely !, plus all the characters are quite likable. It's quite cheap and generally made very well and it will be enough to see you as long as you do not expect to fight with Jackie Chan Flick, and one of my favorite moments in this movie is when Jackie (Dragon) and Y-Man Chan ( Tiger), playing around with a rifle and closing it! This is an upper average Jackie Chan Flick, a fantastic ending and great humor, but the other is not so great, but it's good to watch! Directions are good. Jackie Chan does a good job of keeping the movie here at the speed of the camera, excellent angles and in most cases here. Acting is very good! Jackie Chan is always amazing, and surprisingly, he has made some crazy stunts, very enjoyable, ridiculous, cheated chemically with Y-Man Chan, kicked the donkey and played this wonderful extraordinary character, he is amazing! I just want them to stop him drowning! (Jackie Rule !!!!!). Funny as Yee Man Chan Jackie's best friend, I really like him, he is a very good martial artist. I guess the rest of the throw is OK. Overall the clock value is good! 5 out ***
