This series is "something different" Sometimes the European series is less accurate than the United States, but this time the authors hit the right target to create a mix of works in a consistent way. Edel and Starc are great: it's great plot, smart, malicious, always well-distributed lines, one of the most attractive cities in the world, is an extraordinary dramatic time displayed by all the stars and beautiful shots of Berlin. How fun it is to work in other countries than in the United States and it's a fun way to "feel" the old European method of life. Congratulations to all cast and crew for a good work comedy that will be seen in the next few years. The series in Germany is very good to see.
