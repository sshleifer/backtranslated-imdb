This movie is great! This movie is beautiful! Finally, a film that portrays Moslem as a human, there is no stereotype here. This film is directed by the story, by acting and by its theme, on cultural approval and discovery. They may seem like clich√©s but they are not at least, this is not the movie. The monument of the Grand Mosque of Makkah is absolutely remarkable and visitors have been given a glimpse of Moslem in a part of the world which is never seen in the West. People here are caring, supportive, devout, tolerant and devoted to each other. Arabs are a welcome and delayed exit from the usual negative illustration. Awesome movie.
