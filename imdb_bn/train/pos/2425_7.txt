I grabbed this movie in the IFC and I enjoyed it, though I think the edit was a bit rough, though it was deliberate. I had some hard times, to understand what was going on early, because they thought that they were taking a little bit of presentation of a Piper Fiction-style non-linear plot. Although it is slightly compulsive, though. I certainly think it's valuable to watch the movie, but I think it can be used clearly. Some scenes do not seem to make sense just after others. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that there are fewer ratings here. It is not outstanding, but there is no serious problem. I gave it a 7/10. The film showed at least that Laurence Fisborne could work when she could. They must say that they are not in Matrix movies.
