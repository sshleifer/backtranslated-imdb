This is the only David Zucker film that does not ruin the first thing in its kind. Night of the Night at the Roxbury 98, the fun movie was on the right, but I do not think Theres was funny about Mary, so she does not count them without francis and beans. Do not listen to critics, especially Roger Ebert, he does not know of strong entertainment but just look at his reviews. However see that you will not be missing
