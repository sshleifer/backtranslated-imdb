Paris, J.T.Ime (2006) is a film made of 18 divisions. You can calculate - in 120 minutes, 18 segments mean each director will take seven minutes to tell his or her story. The film is based on the evidence that you can actually tell a story in that short period. Evidence works. Almost all categories are strong, complete, and satisfied. Everyone represents a different aspect of Paris's experience and almost every director shows great performance from a cast of great and near-great actors. <br /> <br /> There were so many powerful images in this film that it is difficult to pick one or two favorites. Perhaps the most memorable of me was Juliet Manoche, as a sad mother in the "Place des Victors" section of the "Place des Victors" section. "Quarter Latin", Catalina Sannino Moreno Segment "Louis D16 Emami" and as a maid of Margo division as the beauty of old age. As Collindo Mail Carrier, Martin, who has learned French, can go to Paris ("14cm Arodement" segment). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An outstanding movie. I and my wife have decided to rent it within a few months so that we can certainly catch some fine points which we must have missed. However, Paris has been so beautifully photographed that I will try to see you on a big screen. In any case, do not miss it!
