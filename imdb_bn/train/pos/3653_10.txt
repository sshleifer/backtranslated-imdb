Why is this a good actress like Elizabeth Barclay? Cast gives some good performance (as a Barbie girl Elizabeth Barclay, a man named Justin Halleline and Justin Halleline, except El Kitts, but her side is very annoying) and the story is not so funny and original. I can not believe that such a movie was produced for the big screen! Julie Karman (Producer): Are You Cradle ??? !!!
