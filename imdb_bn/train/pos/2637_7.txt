It is a direct video film, so before saying this it should be said that it is not going to challenge the first lion king, but said that it was neutral. <br /> <br /> My kids had this love, but given that one, they love something that is a cartoon. The big shock which I like it, it was also funny funny (even deadly jokes *) in some parts, there were creative tie-ups with her first movie and even some of the jokes you had to make grow up (but do not quarrel like Shake [[Do you think he is compensated for doing something?]]. <br /> <br /> A special note on fert jokes, I was surprised that someone jokes only the tomb of the toilet (There was actually no word / imagery in fact, the references were rather subtle), they were actually a setup / space / etc and were in good taste. I want to remind my kids that there is more humor than going to the bathroom, and this The film is good for them. <br /> <br /> What is the noise? Music is not so creative as the first or second film, but lots of fun for the kids. There was a painfully corny moment, which was a blessing for me. A small step but nothing scary (NIMH's secret gave my children nightmare, not sure that a G rating was appropriate for him ...) <br /> <br /> Say it's a great movie for kids of any age, 100% safe to watch them (I do not try to be too sensitive but jumper me a bit and turn off the TV Which was less suitable than the kids expected) - but you're safe to leave this one time room. I like to say the stick almost whatever, though, that you can enjoy it too :)
