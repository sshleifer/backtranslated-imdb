Many commented that this film was not as good as the first. Well, maybe it's not - you. However, how does your child react to this? Well, I love it more than ever. <br /> <br /> The past Disney movies can be a little harder for little kids. (For example - Babi got mother shot.) This movie was really cool for my sensitive little girl, who likes humor and happy ending choice. <br /> <br /> If you like what Disney needs based on, past - skip this movie. <br /> <br /> If you have a sweet little girl or a soft hearty little boy, then you really want to do this, buy this movie and treat your little kids. This picture is as spectacular as a sleeping movie instead of a nightmare. I'm happy with a movie that pleases my child and always does not need to affect parents.
