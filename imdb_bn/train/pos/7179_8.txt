It brings to mind the story of terrorism filled with stories of stories like Stephen King and IT - exactly the opposite. There is no terrorism in these childhoods, any friends - who still remember or suffer for 20 years of friendship. The line has been described as friendly for all, probably from time to time, described as "one or more" sorted, but all have been forgiven. There is no bugs like the film and participants in the next life describe the relationship - what we see is that the youth are largely growing up from the same person. More mature, but basically still the same people, and the same power structure. <br /> <br /> Completely amazing! For not only that the relatively unharmed people can be big by the social constitution - but that friendship can actually end. In this case, the film is a small Pearl - as if it were the intention of this film: A portrait of unwanted emotions stops people together. Violent restrictions can easily be springs in the years after the films depicting the dark aspects of childhood - violent restrictions are easily springs in the Bengalis for the cambay, but with the growing upbringing of children and childhood in the middle of the '80s (along with) many films and documentaries are being successful with illustrating the dark aspects of growing gradually Has achieved - misery S, loneliness, Excel to access the push - so dark and thick and have the adults in mind. <Br> <br /> And here comes a movie, which says: It can be a happy childhood, see! Thank you for the <br /> <br />. Or counterweight illusion ... <br /> <br /> 8/10
