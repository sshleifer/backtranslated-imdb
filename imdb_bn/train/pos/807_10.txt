Dear reader, <br /> <br /> The final battle between rebellion and empire. After the completion of the second death war, and when it is completed, it speaks of the destruction of the rebel alliance. Louis Skywalker, now returned to Tatuin with Jadie Knight, Hann Solo and Prince Lia, now has released Luke as the eldest sister! They agreed to lead the attack on the Shield Generator attack on Andor's Forest Moon, when Lando Calician led the attack of Death Star. They do not know that the most fascinating trap has been kept for them and Emperor Palpatine himself is supervising the construction of the Second Death Star himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The real trilogy back to ZD is my favorite. It has extraordinary music by action, drama, romance, great war, fantastic acting, amazing fight scene, and John Williams. Mark Hammel is now mature enough to become J.D. Knight, the stupid farmer boy has gone and there is quiet, easy to be stubborn to save galaxy instead. Leia is still cool in this film and Han and Lando. 3P0, R2, and Chevy play their role in one, but James Earl Jones is still the best villain in the movie: Dr. Widder. Ian McDermid also rolls as a nice arch and cruel ruthless Emperor Palpatine. The action sequences of this movie are amazingly amazing and the deadly deadly and great of the sword. Scores of John Williams are still cool and the film's growth by different levels. <br /> <br /> Sign in, Constant DVD Collector
