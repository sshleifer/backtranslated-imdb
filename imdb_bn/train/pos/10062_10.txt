How nice. What a wonderful film The script is almost perfect, it seems to be the only movie written by Minglun Wei, I hope he has more stories. <br /> <br /> The acting is amazing. As Doggie was restored Zhou was amazing - very natural talent, and Zhu Zhu was a joy - Zed is very credible as the old traditionalist. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was very effective, too much disrespect. <br /> <br /> If there are more such movies in Hollywood or Hong Kong, a family friendly, well-played, well-written, well-directed, perfect monkey is nearby, but more such movies were made.
