CB4 was awful, but it might be best given Cundieff's best idea. More like Spinal Tap than anything else, the film is cute since the beginning. People were surprised to see this in the mid-nineties. Performance is played to laugh but not so much that they are more like cartoon characters, Marx brothers. These guys are real and little diverse. They respond to situations like us. Well, when our performance cap is delayed, we can not throw guns, do not pull guns, and kill a record company's death, but you get the picture. N (as n ***) W (including) H (HAT) takes it very seriously to slap yourself, then you hooked. Rent or get all of this, even if you're not really rap music, this still leaves you gassing out loudly. Compare this to CB4, compared to George Lucas 'Star Wars Gil Guards' Buck Rogers. I think you see my point
