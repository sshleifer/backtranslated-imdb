I love this movie because it's a real story set in Amazon, which is a part of the world which has always tricked me. I believe that a synthesized form of the book was published in "Reader's Digest". Actually after the incident <br /> <br /> Because I'm a "baby boomer", character and actress are my contemporaries and this is why I related to this movie. I believe that the film is valuable for teaching survival skills, if the audience follows the character's river and coastal colonies where they can get help, as well as follow other survival strategies. The most important was to maintain his survival and a positive attitude. In conclusion, I hope visitors can learn something from it, as well as to see it for entertainment. <br /> <br /> I want to publish a movie in my VHS and DVD soon. It is shown more often in the satellite movie channel.
