Problems with books by Agatha Christie, Dorothy El Sires or SS Van Dine (who rely on the work of this film) are less of a performance or diversity - when Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe exceeds the average LA route. , Class tenants, bars, offices, rich palaces, and all kinds of exciting hazards and violence, the Golden Age fantasy is usually in the case of positions, murder scenes, usually a chaotic country house, and limited investigation for action investigations and suspected interviews This is a very static method, reducing the plot to solve the puzzle. <br /> <br /> It is, of course, something many ideological as the other, the story of Golden Edge dealing with unfavorable societies for the change and movement of stories; A harsh warm colonial event recorded in a minor reality is moving away from a growing center (both authority and a city), which divides itself into discriminatory, unauthorized and lawless camps.
