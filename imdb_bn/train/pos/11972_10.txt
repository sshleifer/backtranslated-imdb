I grew up watching the full house as a child. I closed it off for years, but almost two weeks ago I started to see it again. Now watch my kids show and they love to see it as well. My kids can not believe this DJ, Shoke, and I'm the same age. <br /> <br /> I really love this show because it is a show that can meet your family. It is a good lesson you can learn from your kids. There are also no medicines and violence there. Also, when kids have problems watching them, they can always go to their family for help. Children should now get the message from TV, not into drugs, turn around in your family for help. Children now watch more shows on TV than Hughes, instead of half a mess. <br /> <br /> I love Shock because it lets you laugh and it's under the earth. It talks about real-life problems and family issues. What you learn from the show is always there. <br /> <br /> I voted for 10 votes.
