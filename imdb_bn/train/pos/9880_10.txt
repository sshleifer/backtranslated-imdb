This image was created in 1943 when I think Judy was her peak (looks like). The people of his previous film For Me and My Gaal often say that he disrespects. Well in this film he looks perfect. She looks beautiful and she has a mood for the comedy. <br /> <br /> I think this film is pleasing, especially at the beginning when he is trying to arrange an audition with John Thornway. One of the interesting views of my opinion is Judy's Lady Macbeth's presentation and when John was looking for her party to give her a fantastic (lull). <br /> <br /> I have a criticism that John and Lily fall in love when a hole in the plot. I mean, that one minute he hates him and the next day he will go out on a date and next day he will meet them next day. <br /> <br /> Another thing that I do not like, If I was Lily, I would be excited with the public but she is not ... it is not just sensible. <br /> <br /> I would give this image to everyone 10 because it's just wonderful and almost perfect.
