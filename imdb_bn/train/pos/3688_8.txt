Today is one of the best director of the industry. The film is throwing a little bit from everywhere, not just from the best actors of our time, but also from France. <br /> <br /> My favorite sections: <br /> <br /> 14th Expedition: Carroll (Margo Martindale), from Davver, comes to Paris to learn the French language and to maintain his life style. <br /> <br /> Montmartre: Romantic Paris was probably not a good way to start this movie than this segment. <br /> <br /> Lone Du 16 cm: A picture in Paris that we are well aware of since the riots in the city. Anna (Catalina Sannino Moreno) spent more time taking care of someone else's goat (she's a grandmother). <br /> <br /> Quarter Latin: Gerard Depardieu is so much delighted to see "Tannasier de Bar" Talking about their divorce with Zina Rowlands and Ben Gajra <br /> <br /> Tour Eiffel: Do not tell me that you did not like that wax! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Parake Monsaw: Nick Nolt is superb. Ludwig Sagniar <br /> <br /> I spent 3 days in Paris in 2004 and this movie wants to get me back <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> March 18, 2007 Vedi on date <br /> <br /> 84/100 (***)
