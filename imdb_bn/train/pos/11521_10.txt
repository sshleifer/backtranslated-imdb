Magicians are an amazing ride from the start, thanks to the great part of the magic generated by the big that. Alan Arkin has spawned one of his best roles in decades. Like any good movie, this is a tour which is the release of the theme and the result of dreams. I can not believe that this film is so difficult - I will buy it in a heart on the DVD but one outlet will be found out.
