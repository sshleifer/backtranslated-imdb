This documentary has been broadcast on both RTE and BBC in the past few months. It is now doubly seen, I would recommend it to anyone with interest in creating media and documentary films. <br /> <br /> This documentary was originally intended for the details of political life of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Irish crew set off with those aims. Seeing what happened when they came to Venezuela, they tried to overthrow Chavez and his government rebel groups (especially Venezuelan oil concerns). What we hear from the audience is how the media controls the situation and distorts Chavez overturning events that move as ambitious to the coup. <br /> <br /> It's really a great documentary and an unusual piece works by a couple of young filmmakers. <br /> <br />
