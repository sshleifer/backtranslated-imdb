Larry Facenden has been threatened with the majority of opinions in this forum. Well, the worst mistake, obviously, can be targeted in film marketing and DVD. Obviously, this is not a real horror film, at least, people are not expected to be proud and instantaneously satisfied. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is a film that seems to be the mind of young Miles. Those things which are not easily understood by children remain in their young minds and ultimately they can not dominate their fears and the terrible world. It is obvious that mother Kem is a psychologist, but there is no source of what is going on in her son's mind. This is a story of isolation. It is clear that Father, George, a remote image, perhaps an employee who seems to be living in a different world. <br /> <br /> Mile tremendous land reached the crisis at the end of the week. . The part of New York State, with the winter landscape, barbarous trees, hates the little boy's imagination. It does not help a strange person in the city to face it, it creates more suspicion in its young mind. Finally, Miles's world is crashing on her and she can not do anything, even if Winid's soul can develop. <br /> <br /> The picture is well illustrated and played. Patricia Clarkson is excellent, no movie where she has it. Jake Weber is perfect as a distant father, who has the opportunity to come to a son, he does not understand. Eric Per Sullivan, like miles, expressed inner turmoil inside her. I thought he was completely effective because the whole film is owned by Miles himself. Finally, John Spradacos is perfect like Minsing Otis, who is a man who satisfies the world for his face. <br /> <br /> Instead of throwing this movie, future visitors must contact it open mind.
