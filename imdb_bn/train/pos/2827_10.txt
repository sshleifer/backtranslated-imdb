This is probably one of the worst movies ever made. It's terrible. But it's so good! Perhaps you are probably going to be frustrated because if you see it is not a gripping plot and fantastically tricky and entertaining something is probably the best. However, if you want to see it, you can see 50 million floats and Gorgeous hair / bad English, you are in for a practical behavior. As much as you think about the film, the more bad it is, unless you are competing to spot the maximum plot hole / screwdrips, in the same way there are several hours of entertainment in front of you. I would recommend this movie only for annoying or dead-hard smam fans.

(He was not really, when Janani Kitagawa (who was an executive producer) could not do it.
