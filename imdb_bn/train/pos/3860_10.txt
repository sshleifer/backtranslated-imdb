A gay writer from Holland gave a lecture by Gerard (Jeroen Krabay). She is overnight with a beautiful woman Kristin (Rene Sandandjak) and has sex with her (she imagines a son). He planned to leave the next day, but he saw a picture of Cristin's violent boyfriend Harman (Thom Hoffman) and decided to stay for him. Then things get weird. <br /> <br /> A big X-Rated industrial house hit the United States in 1983. Why was it rated x? Let's see ... weird, full-fledged men and women nudity, casting, separation, simulated sex, a cross with a church scene that will disappoint most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt ... and it's all comedy !!!! ! Paul Verhoeven made this after "Spetters". Critics attacked "Spaters" for his extreme sexual acts and condemned it as a trash. So, thinking critics of thinking to fill this film with Verhoeven's very clear symbol would think it was art and appreciated. She was right! Critics do not love this movie that VeroVen is playing a big joke on them. Still, it's a great film. <br /> <br /> This is nicely shot by John de Bont (now director) and the dialogue has so many symbols and obvious "hidden" levels that you are never indifferent. All acting great - Krabbe played a thoroughly scorn character but (in no way) you have been rooting for him; Look at the southernendaries and dramatize his portions of his perfection just stunning - Gerard agreed to stay with him when he gave little smile to cool; Hoffman is very handsome with a great body - he deserves going with the Krabbe in credit and crypt for ordering in the church. <br /> <br /> It's easy for people to feel offended or heartless, but if you have extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! A 10 all the way.
