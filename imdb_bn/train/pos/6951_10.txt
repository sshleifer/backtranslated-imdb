Until 24 times for the first time I had never been a big fan of television. I got into a very late series. I saw my first episode before the end of session 5. This was an episode of Series 3 which was in my parents' DVR (Digital Video Recorder) box when I was sitting on weekends. For me this episode has narrowed down the hook line and Jack Bauer's world. And boy I was hooked !! I saw the next six episodes without eye tears. The next day I went to Blockbuster and signed up for $ 20 for an unlimited month pass and it does not need to say that it is the greatest blockbuster money ever. I saw the first three seasons in three weeks. That's 72 forty minutes episode !!! I have to wait for the whole week to find out what happens next to the DVD. I can only imagine the 6 weeks week to see the season !! I find it desperately torturous and cruel but I try to try it one and it will look like the rest of America! DVR is set and you can make bits I will be chomping at bit !!
