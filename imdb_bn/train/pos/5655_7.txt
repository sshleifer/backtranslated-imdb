I saw this event in the memorable memory of David Linch's Twin Peaks - a show that I worship. The program begins to showcase our original characters quickly and unequivocally finds the pilot episode as the best for me, it is extremely dramatic and the whole evil aspect of the show really ready to progress throughout the season. Due to one of my biggest criticisms, I felt a little sad - probably not by my own fault, it was canceled after just 1 death, it showed a lot of potential and it was more deserving of it. The acting is excellent, and this show has some good characters (good and evil) which I have seen sometimes developed improving in a short period. There is an odd chassis effect for the first 5 or 10 shows, which are dramatic but very rare, but it is corrected as the progress of the season. Well worth a watch, definitely some out of the ordinary!
