Being able to see more of the school shooting incident, the film has an interesting and different idea. Presented as a series of video recordings made by two annoying men (I can not mention people who killed at the age of boys or at the age of thirteen), on the day of zero day (the name of the day on which they will attack) present the situation from the opposite side of the gun To do They feel the pain of painting, but they focus on preparing for the preparation. The problem is delivered a little straight in terms of emotions. The only point which becomes emotional, as expected is the end. But progressing at this stage, it is not really clear why they are planning it. We are told mandatory stories that they are joking, but the film also seems reversed. It is easy to say without destroying the film, it was a great effort and was equally good intention, but due to the production of vicious movies it was reduced. All guidelines are amateur, homemade video ideas more, but the story and continuity weaken. The image seems to want to make many decisions for the viewer, but fails to provide information for such events. The end is all about a sudden, and it does not seem to have ended the beginning of the movie.
