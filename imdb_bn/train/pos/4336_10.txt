A wonderful movie about the relationship between my friends - the first and foremost child with an adult boy and his father, but his son, his sister and his mother. Paul Reiser wrote a semi-autobiographical film about his relationship with his father. The movie is funny, stupid and worried. It led me to re-evaluate my own relationship with both my father and my adult son. Excellent as the father of Peter Fauld Paul - the role could not be well cast. I hope that Mr. Folk and Mr. Both Reaiser has been recognized for the next year's film awards for their efforts - Risar for the Folk and his script.
