This show was on TV when I was 10 years old. Until it was my favorite. The actors were very credible. Alexandra Bastedo was just pretty .... I just ordered the DVD (episode 15). They did not have super powers. They only had higher human skills (energy, hearing, sight). Their role of 3 actors was very good, very well. Each episode was a good story. At that time, there was no special effect or explosion everywhere, so the script was considered to be good and the letters were great. Like other shows, there was no fancy material. They did not try to joke every 2 minutes to make a light show. I highly recommend this TV show to anyone that is good stuff.
