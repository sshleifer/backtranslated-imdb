Again greetings from darkness. Pain is painless for how it is for a film to test human soul. Adam Sandler, a star named Charlie, who lost his family in the 9/11 tragedy and lost his career, lost his or her reason for his logical reason. As Sandler's ex-dental school roommate, Don Chadle co-stars seem to have a perfect life (which was apparently 9/11 before Sandler). <br /> <br /> This course parallels the life of men, but the looks of men in the film exhibition are really refreshing ... feeling without desire and revenge. They really help each other on how they are painful and heartwarming. Writer / director Mike Binder (Sandeeper's accountant in this movie and the movie's ascendant) really brings a different look and feel to the film. Some of the scenes do not work well, but overall it is well-written and firmly guided. <br /> <br /> Both Sandler and Chadle are excellent. Sandler's character reminds some of his subtle performance in "punched drunken love", but here he brings more depth. Cheadle is always fine and he does a wonderful job of carrying burdens ... just by watching him work on a jigsaw puzzle. Supported by Jad Pinkett Smith (as wife of Cheadle), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Borough (a strange interesting role), Donald Sotherland excited judge and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein Sandler As father in law <br /> <br /> The picture really touches. The tragic events of that day were so deeply influenced by a man that he was originally destroyed. Apart from the fascinating stories and some wonderful shots of NYC, you have to love any movie that you want to enjoy, Bruce Springsteen and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddy Wader holding daltries. Not exactly a chipper beat-up film, but it's a quality film with an unusual story.
