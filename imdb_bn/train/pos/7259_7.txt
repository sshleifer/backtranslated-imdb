How can the rating of this movie be 5.4? When you fix your rating, only the lovely young man Alison Portter will automatically start you at 6. James Bellushi is such a good, his first good serious role, I did not like about last night so far. She was very good in the gang related with Tupac too. Kelly Lynch, you love her. Mu I just wondered what happened to Miss Porter. <br /> <br /> I gave Curley Schae 7
