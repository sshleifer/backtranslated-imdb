No, it is not supposed to be a high budget talent, but it's brilliant in its own right. For this, you have to look at it, a low-budget masterpiece that involves a 12-inch love rod that involves a zombie rapist, which he keeps blurring. Those who bring this movie for less reviews are probably looking for the next genuine classic or hidden "gem" search and just did not reach there. I love that every clear observation such as "5 percent of children is attached to the fish pole" Ahaha, well, yes. I do not think a movie can carry a "good" actor or effect with the budget so that they work with what they have done with them. Hats and entrails were actually very believable. The film was gradually shorter from sequence but overall, this is one of the best films I have seen recently that does not follow any trend or predictions. Very good for a smile.
