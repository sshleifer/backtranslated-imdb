After one night their daughter was killed, Allen and Julie went to a mountain cabin. Nobody knows who killed a little girl, but why they went to the mountains. So the couple comes to this cabin and kills them themselves and nobody in the neighborhood city wants to talk about it. <br /> <br /> This film has a lot of imperfection and it takes a part that makes me jump. Some parts are predictive but in a while I do not expect. This is a fantastic movie which was not the most horrific film in the world, but it was still scary enough to become quite good. <br /> <br /> I like the end because the audience decides how it ends. It's a sad movie as well but a good job horror movie.
