Well ... Vivah is quite good, but the movie of Suraj Barrataa It shows different aspects of Indian family, wedding ceremony etc. The film is a lot better, but not very good. <br /> <br /> The big plus point of the movie is instruction, music and martyr and Amrita. Especially the last scene). The film starts with a common factor in Indian cinema - a girl is disliked by her parents. The story is a bit general, but it's good enough, the film is enough to create blockbuster. <br /> <br /> The minute is the common story of Bollywood movies. Overall, I would say, the film must be seen twice, if you want to see the value of the common Indian family and of course love!
