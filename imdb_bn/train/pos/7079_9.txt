I really enjoyed it - I will leave you with a lot of questions and ideas for a big fan of the messy movies and controversy with your mind and it's a beautiful example. But then, Terry Gilliam is always good (well, almost always, let's forget Jabberky and Brothers Grim, what do we forget?) <br /> <br /> <br /> and refraining from the rebellion - past and future events The way to feed and eat and drink in each other. <br /> <br /> It was also beautifully done - the direction of the industry was really great and I want to. 'D is able to see it on the big screen. Future Scenes Brazil had similar feelings in many ways and even current scenes were often visually appealing. The most interesting thing about it was that I usually do not have much of a lot like two actors, such as Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt, and they both have delivered outstanding performance here. In particular, Pitt - I saw one or two films, which I could understand that actually he could actually work (in contrast to what I thought), but that's really crazy for them. I really asked my friends at one point, "Did you confirm Brad Pitt?" This is probably the most memorable performance of his career (although admittedly not saying too much).
