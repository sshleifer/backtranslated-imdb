Absolutely wonderful play and top notch groove ... I highly recommend this movie. My opinion, my opinion, was the Academy Award material! The only real tragedy here is that the public did not see whether the film was available in a video format whether it was tape or DVD. They are ignoring a very good movie. However, the Universal DVD does not have any respect for its library, which is unfortunate. If you see this opportunity somewhere, make sure that this is rarely run on cable only) See it! I will not go to the story because I think most people will have opinions on the film and spend a few hours about many "critics" stories, which can be found anywhere. <br /> <br /> 10!
