Vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. Who can ask for more? Moon children deliver all at one gorgeous package flick! Gackt's innocent show - those who grew up with a Vampire Kai (HYDE) friendship, with their relationship but as the Age of Sho, broke the heart of KE's immortality. It does not help that both fall in love with the same woman. Special effects are quite good considering the small budget. It's a tactful story that's ripe with people's emotions. You smile, cry, smile, then cry more. Even if you do not love their music, then watch this movie. It works alone as a Vampire movie. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
