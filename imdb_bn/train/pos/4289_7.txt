I have to be 100% honest with your assistant IMDB users. Because of the poster I wanted to watch this movie for a very long time. Charlotte Gainsbourg looks extremely sexy and ridiculous ridiculous in that way? I love the woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film is expected to provide romantic comedy or all the fun of sensual humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> Although I do not agree with another partner IMDB user that this film has been exceeded; I must admit that there are a lot of errors in "love-money". <br /> <br /> The main characters in screen are my main problem related to chemistry. Claymax does not have the first single scene that divides the main characters into "romance" moment or a formula that they are interested in each other. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> I could not buy dinner order. <br /> <br /> Yet the movie delivers a very interesting moment and has a powerful conversation that supports such progressive support. I mean, it would be very difficult to remove these people by the 43-year-old in these days. <br /> <br /> I understand this is a movie and so I take it as a fun situation. Plus, ridiculous versatile. The moments of S & M involved, the best friend of the chef, some lesbian references, the fun situation associated with the family women and more. [<br />] Charlotte Gainsberg's performance is a top notch and he is far too far in the movie. She looks funny, sexy, very thin and fine, and she shows a versatile and talented actress who can find a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat gives a fine actor and a very decent performance. I'm saying the supporter cast what they can do. <br /> <br /> Score, art direction, and other technical aspects are really good and give a dynamic look at the film. <br /> <br /> Those who like to end this end of the movie should be satisfied. It's a good example to think about the movie well.
