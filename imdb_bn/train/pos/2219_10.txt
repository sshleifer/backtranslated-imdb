My own two children have a grandfather's father-in-law, whose father is a member of Jens de Couluir Libra and a black leather woman whose parents were former slaves. He was married outside of his culture and married her, and her family was cut off except for a sister to suffer; Raising 8 children during the Great Depression of 1929; Whenever he can provide the family with food. Of course, he secretly feared this family for his own ex-communication. My daughter was fascinated by the movie. We made it a part of our library.
