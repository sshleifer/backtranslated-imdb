This is a great movie. <br /> <br /> I see a chick flick and some agree on how to end this. I did not hear of it or anyone's in it (Mike excpet from friends). <br /> <br /> But it's great! Eva, Lake and Paul give amazing performance. Humor is constantly dry and malicious. <br /> <br /> Paul Rudd has played Mike from most friends (which works great). Other characters are stereotypes and plot formulas (I mean we are not talking about 'apocalypse now') but the character is preferred, the story is attractive, soundtracks, production and direction work well. <br /> <br /> is a great emotional movie that truly gets more credits than it is. <br /> <br /> Everyone has their own taste but I do not really understand one star reviews for this.
