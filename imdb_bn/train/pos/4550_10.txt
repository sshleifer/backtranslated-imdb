The most versatile actors living in Daniel Day-Lewis English elite snob in a room with a view, an emotional Irish thief in the father's name, a condemnatory, violent slaughterhouse of the New York gang (ten times stronger than Adrian Brody in Piano) and the aggressive Cristy Brown (with only a few names) with cerebral palsy on my left foot. Its role affects each other, but each is different, and absolutely unique. He completely changed, he took each character. And I believe that he can work as something. <br /> <br /> <br /> As Christie Brown, she is stunning. She does not laugh at character, and she is not kind to the character. To achieve a difficult. And Cristy Brown comes to life. A smart person A humiliating man Human <br /> <br /> This movie, despite small view-transmission errors and similar, is an inspiration. Yes, it is predictable. But is this a fool image? No I got laughing. I waved. Cheese does not have single moments. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the scene of the restaurant, when Cresty is discussing with the artists Allyn, Peter and his friends. Here's where Daniel Day-Lewis reached the hiking act. "I'll stick you on your physiologically the only part of the animated." "Lame wheel out!" And its performance is never slow, never fails, and beautiful. Only. She has a lot of screen time here. I see it again, and I have never been tired of Christi's sightless eyes, twitching and gutral speech. <br /> <br /> must be seen. Photo shows, Yo!
