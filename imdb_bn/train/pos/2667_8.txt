I was not a big fan of horror movies. They usually try very cheap strategies to scare their audiences like loud and vague kids. They usually lack the fundamentals and contain plenty galore. My only horror movie about Kevin Bacon was Steer Off Echo. It was well played, and was a great story. But it has been joined and probably also passed by The Shining of Stanley Kubrick, probably the most horrific movie. <br /> <br /> This film follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family, who agreed to visit a hotel. It is closed for the winter. The rumor spread in that place and the last of the residents became mad and killed his family. But Jack is definitely okay and he can use quiet to overcome his writer's block. After a few months of solitude and silence, Jack suddenly became violent. Is it kibin fever or something in the hotel that makes him crazy? <br /> <br /> One of the Cristias parts about the movie is the Kubrick that creates isolation. The hotel is very quiet, and the rooms are huge, still empty. Jack's son drives his bike through Bayern Hallways when it's very cool. Jack Nicholson's performance is also his best, frustrating me from hell and making sure to get out once in a while. My favorite scene when he is talking to a ghost from a walk-in Refrigerator. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Witch project. It may be an oldie, but of course a goody. 8/10
