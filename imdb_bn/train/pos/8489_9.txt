I learned Japanese for an online high school and I could learn about language as well as languages ​​in the country so that I included cultural activities. And "Gong Ho" is one of the observer requirements. Students can buy or rent movies. Whether stereotype or not, it lets students see that other people look at the world and their life differently from us. Many of my students told me that they enjoyed the movie, they got a copy for themselves. It's really interesting to see what we value in this culture and what they value in their culture. I wish I could just get a clean-up TV version I'm not always in the irrational language.
