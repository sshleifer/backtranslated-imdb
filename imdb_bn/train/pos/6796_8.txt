Russian assassin (2005) is an interesting film by German director Woli Lomel. She directs this latest production, produced and co-star. Not only does she manage to make an attractive film on the cheap. He has reached a newcomer while working on footage from almost all the movie catalogs. I saw Boogeyman I and II, clips of war birds, wolves, brain waves, and cocaine cowboys (even Andy Warhol made a camio out of the deep courtesy of this film). Although he uses lots of old footage, he works well (and I can very creatively add). <br /> <br /> This film follows a young man who copies the original Russian assassin. He adjusts to a writer (Ulie Lomel), who originally wrote about serial killer in the late seventies and early seventeenth century. The author's friend (David Hess) helped him in this Wannabe Russian effort and find out. Can this killer be stopped? Will the writer combine the two and achieve his old glory? David Hess is still a man? You have to find out for yourself and see the Russian assassin. <br /> <br /> This picture is not about the original Russian assassin. I heard people hear about this image shot in video. So what. The director's old school's artistic style outshines that it is shot in the video. My only complaint was that earlier films of Stockton used to have more use of stock footage (but I can understand why "Vink" is "Wink".) Do not believe this campaign. This is a retiree and street level horror film. Initially, the state's wage was taken, this image does not kill glory. You want to like that statement. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend for Ulli Lommel fans.
