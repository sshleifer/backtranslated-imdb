This should be one of the best films out of HK in the long run, I was just waiting for my interest to see my title in this movie. This show loads of fantastic actors and I am particularly impressed with Sam Lee's incredible credible insane behavior and a killer device, which completely reversed the image of his normal statue. I would definitely suggest who are looking for a stylish and action-packed movie. However, I have to warn you, this is also a frustrating movie, because every character in the film struggles to die and their own problems and struggles to breathe. Really makes you think about what life is about.
