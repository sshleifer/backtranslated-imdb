A win for the third man with Joseph Katon in any film on the first day of Osanon Wales. He's wonderful in a touch of Evil. Please see them all! He got pompas and self-services on films such as F-Fake for Fake, Stupid Waste. Do not waste your viewing time. It's really unconscious. Orson Welles is a film icon and film studist who will refer to anyone who illustrated. All her leading women were splendid but eventually Wales became a fat drunk, a touch of eve like her character! For some reason, Orson Wells had a way with women, I could think of being attractive among his youth, not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton, or Curry Grant, John Wein, I could go but I could be frustrated ... and because I'm a Ladies, I can see her draw. She (Ocean Wells) is one of the last real-time filmmakers and if you do not count today's film makers: Tarantino, Scorsese, Spike Lee, most filmmakers do not measure up to forty-year filmmakers! I know today's many big filmmakers but in such a short time I can not name them all. There is no crime in this millennium great filmmakers! 21 August 2006. Remind me some current up and coming film makers, I do not want to be stuck in the past! I love some cinema now, but rarely will I put any "100 best" list. "Hostel and Flow" was very good, so "Fargo" and "Oh, my brother, where are you," from a line in Sullivan; Another fine film from the Forties! Can anyone give me the best list till 90s and 2006? I want to know who the clock! Thanks! Also this website props! Where you can plug a film or boo it! I like annoying and rubbing from regular people like me who can tell what I want and I promise that it does not hurt any movie that has not seen it yet!
