Phantom Lady (1944) Deer: Robert Sydmack <br /> <br /> Production: Universal Pictures <br /> <br /> Scottish Henderson (Allan Curtis), after a nasty war and divided with his wife, sits on it locally Sore at the water hole. There, he spied a woman in a similar mental state and searched for some companions, asked a club show to both of them to stop their problems. He agreed, but on condition they only keep their names. Surely, when Scott gets home, he finds the police there, waiting for the question. His wife was killed. Where were you at 8 o'clock in the evening Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez)? But Scott has an alibi, right? Only she does not know the girl's name. And think Bartender Scott is not a woman. Cab driver No drummer (Elisa Cook junior) at the club. Even the dancer of the club, who clearly saw Scott (he was wearing the same hat), he did not acknowledge that there was someone with him. Something is happening, but whatever Scott is helpless to protect himself in the trial, and executed for the murder of his wife (Flamestest 'evidence' in Hollywood judicial history). Before Scott executed his execution, his assistant secretary 'Kansas' (Ella Rainees) was released to find the real killer who later joined the sympathetic Inspector Burgess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Restoration, almost compulsively, works of Woolrich For example, schizophrenic antigenists can also be seen in black angles and leopards. In addition, there is a character that is black and the Bride works Blake, a sweetheart or spouse who is found to be mentally lonely by death. He can leave the feeling of a visitor like treading the good servant to the ground. But in the right hand, horror plot, sorry dialogue, descriptive inconsistencies, all by the point. Fortunately, the Phantom Lady was directed by the word. <br /> <br /> This is the first silent syadmak. Although he is not one of the prominent practitioners of The Style (The Hunters, Chris Cross), he goes to separate himself. Here he is fortunately associated with cinematographer Woody Burdell (they will reunite with Christmas holidays and The Killers). There are some great stories done to the camera. In one shot, the bad mental state of a character is shown that he is sitting in front of a 3-way mirror, suggesting multiple personalities. The same artist, who is an artist, has a dream of Van Gogh with his hanging ear in the apartment. But the Phantom Lady is really doing syodmac and bendle is actually making the look of the light. Released very soon in 1944, it's all here; Wet patent, atmosphere and awesome bag, acute contrast B & D, the baroque version of the reality (when Kansas Scott goes to jail), the boring shock of light, etc. It's a great picture to see. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, Cast, as well as subject and directors (and perhaps budget) related to relative helplessness, 'B' offers ambitions for the film. I thought the tone was a little hammy. Alan Curtis (Hi Sierra) is not too much, and in fact actually weakens in some scenes. Ella rain is mostly good (and quite beautiful). His "sex scene" with Elisa Cook junior is so scary that it can be believed. Another standout view goes after Kansas burtender questions. This is a Chase scene, because he stops at a subway station with a dog on the street street street. There are some real good tensions <br /> <br /> *** Out ***
