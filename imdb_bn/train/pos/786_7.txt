Andy McDowell's face expression is again cool in this movie. When you enter 40 and stay alone for a while (or all your life) you think you're losing away. The film is a sweet reminder that love can be found anywhere if your antenna is actively active. I like to face sex quickly, which should be out of character for the generally reserved school teacher (McDowell). His former student is intelligent enough, yet to bear a crash on his teacher. <br /> <br /> There are some parts that I did not think of, but rather unreal or irrelevant. For example, in a scene where another woman's jealousy overdued and Andy McDowell was set up to dump a young man, would a mature police officer (another friend of McDowell) allow her friend to perform such a sinful act? It is so easy to stop someone to somebody else? Of course, the accident can happen all the time, but I hope that the heroine will be happily married with the first person (there was a hard part of believing !! so beautiful woman should be alone for so long?) <br /> <br /> Perhaps the filmmakers I am aware that many romance between an old woman and a young person will not last long. On the other hand, they know that happy ending will not appeal to the public, especially for 40 years to envy women, who are awaiting miracles. If sadness ends with sadness, the sad woman will lose her true love, but if people live then what will end? For how long? No one knows Still, it's a movie that you want to see a bit later ... maybe after a year.
