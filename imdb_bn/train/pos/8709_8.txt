I recently discovered (May 2008) that this childhood favorite was available as a DVD. Although I have seen high quality films since then (in the late 70's (I was 10 in 1978), these three episodes, low budget items are still strong. <br /> <br /> What is the fun? Now I'm my 10 year old girl I saw it, and even then it seems like the same: the strange music (she had to hold my hand, though it was raised by Lotot and Resident Evil) in the role of acting and filming in Norway Prior to discovering the difference in Norway, who actually changed the criminal theory, and complained about the voice of an era's theater. <br /> <br /> This is the only and only good science fiction film (or series) ever made in Norway, and it is still watching Price.
