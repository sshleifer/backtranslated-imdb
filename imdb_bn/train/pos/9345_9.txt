Allan Johnson (Don Chadell) is a successful dentist who shares his practice with other business partners. Alan is also a loving wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her two daughters (Camille Lass Smith and Emmanie Hakim). He let his parents stay in the big apartment in New York City. But somehow, he thinks his life is just empty. A common day in town, he saw his old college roommate Charlie Fireman (Adam Sandler). Charlie is not seen for an allan year. Alan again tried to make friendship with Charlie. Charlie is a lonely frustrated person who hides his true feelings from his careers. As Charlie lost his family unexpectedly in an air crash, he was in a plane on September 11, 2001. Allan felt comfortable with Charlie. Allan mentions her past issues, that violates the violent violation of those who mention Charlie Allan or his dead family. Now Allan is trying to help Charlie and trying to make his life a bit easier for himself. But Alan Charlie wanted to find out talking about his true feelings. More difficult than that. <br /> <br /> Mike Bender (Blackman, Indian Summer, Wrath of Ages) wrote and directed that the moments created an amazingly sensitive human drama as well as sadness, truth and comedy. Sandler offered an impressive dramatic performance, which offered Sandalner his dramatic role more than Pond-Thomas Anderson's punk-drunk love. Cheadle is as nice as usual. Panket Smith fined as Alan's supportive wife, Liv Tyler is as good as a young psychotherapist, and Sheffron Boro is just as beautiful single woman, who is a wild crusher on Allen. Despite some great reviews, this picture was sadly a box office disappointment. Cast is the first rate here, the author and the director are amazing and the ribbons. Alsobrook's Awesome Wide Screen Cinematography This movie has a wonderful NYC location, which makes the film a beautiful city for New York to watch in the film. <br /> <br /> DVD's sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35: 1) transfer and a good-sounding digital 5.1 surround sound. The DVD also features a jam, a jam session with photo montage and preview Sandler & Cheadle. I'm looking forward to DVD features like an audio commentary track by the director and deleted scenes. "Kingdom on Me" is definitely one of the best films this year. I'm sure, this movie looked great on the big screen. Which is sad, I did not have the chance to see it in a theater. But it's a movie that is going on well in DVD. The film also has a good soundtrack and it has a lot of familiarity with the role and support of bit-parts. Even director actor Bairan Sugarman, who himself is an actor "Kingdom over me" is one of the most intuitive pictures of this year. This is my best sandalar film from "Wedding Singer". Do not miss it.
