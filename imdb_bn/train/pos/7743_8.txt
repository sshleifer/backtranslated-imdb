I went to see this movie 2 times, a friend of mine went to see it in the release party, and she told me that it was so great that I was hoping for a movie too much, I could not have enjoyed it, because I was in a neutral position Was not watching. I knew what I wanted to do the second time and I enjoyed it for the first time. It seems like a second time in a mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can save this movie as your first you must be talented. <br /> <br /> Acting is a bunch of high quality such as some of the great Belgian stars (Dirk Cloister) and Titas de Voghadat. <br /> <br />
