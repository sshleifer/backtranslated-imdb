I hope to watch this movie, just to watch another movie, but for the first twenty minutes, artwork and the main character, which is smart, does not talk much, really got me in this movie. <br /> <br> I really liked this movie, it was dark, beautifully played and really touched. It was a little slow but immersion was complete. It was surprising to say this by farewell to the story that the story is firmly in front of the joey and bar. The music was really great and the scene was very involved in the scene. Seeing the end was unexpected with a twist. We do not often see the movie.
