Sea Watching is an original Akira made from Kuroscript script, and it is actually a lovely and warm film. It will be a pleasure to see! <br /> <br /> As a director, Kai Kumai is certainly not the same as the old but permanent master (especially at the beginning of the movie, there is some terrible role in the mass scene), but the overall mood and scenery are very enjoyable. The other thing missing here: Kurosawa always guides the characters to give more, which they are actually seeing and doing. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was her magic while shooting; And maybe this script was not entirely different. <br /> <br /> maybe we'll just miss the eyes of the master. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful and sweet film, but it is no Kurosawa. It is hoped that it can be very stupid ...
