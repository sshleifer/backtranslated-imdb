It's a kind of movie that you want to see with a glass of wine, fire, and your feet. It does not need to follow the strength of the brain, so very good after so long. I want to say it is very unreal - if you hope for some serious, do not bother, but it is very interesting. Just think a businessman agrees to agree to live in a slum, and then can actually enjoy it ... I would definitely recommend it.
