My friend and I both had good work in this movie. We expect a light-hearted comedy but got a full leak-acting movie with comic thrusts. We both were thinking that this movie might not be so good at the box office because the previews believe it's a comedy. I was impressed with supporting actors and of course Dave Morsch always keeps an awesome acting job. Supporter Cast is not the first timer veteran and they were difficult. We both felt that the direction and direction of writing were the first rate and each other commented on the purchase of this film. Do not buy you rent it for a good time.
