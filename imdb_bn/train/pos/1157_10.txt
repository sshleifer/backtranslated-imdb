This is one of the best comedy ever! The author of this parody of soap shines bright and well, just look at the cast name and you will understand why it is so great. If you're a fan of Kevin Kline, he (always as) is a fantastic performance, and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect. If you do not laugh at this movie, you have no humor.
