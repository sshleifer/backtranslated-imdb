Good night Mr Tom is so nicely shooting and beautifully realized. It is not completely faithful to the book, but what will it be? Not in any way. John Thaw is mesmerizing as Tom Oakley. His transition was very well-understood to take care of cow, making it more credible than the Christmas carroll's screws. After Inspector Mosses, this is the best hour to stop. He was warmly met by a young Nick Robinson, who fiercely portrayed a separatist with objectionable relations with his mother. The script and the music made it worth the price and you also see the playing of the limbs. Amazing! The most moving scene, Willy Asked about Zac's death, and then Tom was telling him about the death of his dead family with a memorandum. Buy this, you'll love it! 10/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
