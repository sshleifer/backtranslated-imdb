I will keep it brief and brief, people who have written the story line for this show are gifted, actors are perfect for their roles (legacy of CGL), and their screen has so much chemistry that it creates, it is a very successful comedy. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the new episode probably going back for 6/7 months, I thought what Paul did. When I browsed Google was draining to find out that he died. He was so funny and his character is full of perfection, a protective father who loves to keep his girls away from the lightlit and keep them away from the boys. <br /> <br /> Comedy, I think, has gone from strength to strength, even in addition to Paul. <br /> <br /> Plus, I think most people will enjoy seeing it.
