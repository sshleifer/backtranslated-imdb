The Ghost Train is a fine and entertaining movie, which is one of the best British comedy chillers of the 1930s and 40s. Comrade Arthur Askey's antics are funny as they were once not visible, but it can be overcome by seeing him as a time piece or curiosity. <br /> <br /> A low-budget war-time production, the ghost train is atmospheric, effective, and it provides some genuine mystery. A dark (and, yes, windy) great fun for the night. Light up, take critic's hat, and enjoy.
