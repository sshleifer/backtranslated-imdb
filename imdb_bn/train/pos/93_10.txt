My first child was born after the program came out, and then I played a record album for every Christmas boy. After the CD was released, I bought nearly ten copies and started as their family as their family and relatives ... it always became their favorite Christmas album. I recently found several DVDs (probably made from DVDs from video tapes) to sell eBay. The one that I bought was a great copy, and it was so good to see the show again in more than 25 years. There are some songs in the album that are not in the album and some songs in the album show the studio versions of the same song. However, both the CDs and DVDs will be the best Christmas entertainment in our library.
