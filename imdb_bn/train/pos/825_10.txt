A long time ago, a galaxy was away, away ... ..................................... .................................................. ................................ does not seem to be the first movie, but I do not remember life before . Remember that he got the first "Star Wars" theme gift ... A stockable box full of action figures from the original set. He was very young to fully appreciate how that gift would be special. But a few years later, what he achieved would be available as one of today's best gifts: another box full of action figures, the last twelve ten needed to complete his collection. It is now legend in this boy's family, how did Anakin Skywalker stop being prepared for his last activity, and how the boy tried to track down a track for almost ten years (until he went to college) and eventually bought a bag of beer duvets From someone on his dorm floor (Do not ask ... it's a Northern Illinois University The thing). <br /> <br /> I can not review "Star Wars" as a movie. It represents me well, fun and magical about my childhood. Growing up in Christmas, birthdays, summer and winter does not make it different in my mind. In the winter, my friends and I used to build snow castles and used to assert we were hands (I was always singled out). The parents of my friends made them a kick-ass tree, and it worked as the village of Echo. They had a large pine tree, whose branches below had enough to build a cave below it, and made it a great place to pose that at Yoda's house. When I talk about "Star Wars", I'm not lazy and I think people just do not understand this thing. I do not get the request of "Ring of Lord" or "Star Trek", but I can understand the wild horses of their followers, because I'm a barbaric fan of George Lucas films. <br /> <br /> No need to protect my opinion about this movie as the greatest of all time. Whenever I put them in the DVD player, I think I was again eight years old, when life was easy and my biggest problem was how I was going to take pictures of Anakin Skywalker. <Br /> <br /> Grade (for the entire trilogy): A +
