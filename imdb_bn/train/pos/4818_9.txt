Before watching British films, I was always unbelieving because I usually found their copy and annoying screenplaces (like Vanity Fair or other Bullin Girl), but a great production design, European landscape and thick British accent that gives movies the idea of ​​artist value , Which they do not have. Fortunately, The Young Victoria does not fall on that situation, and it is its impressive story, with excellent enthusiastic recommendations Emily Blant, Paul Bettany and Jim Broadbutt, and unexpectedly rich scenes of scenes in scenes and costumes and performances from space. And because I say "unexpectedly" I usually do not pay attention to those details. <br /> "The Victorian era" (my modest opinion) is one of the main topics of contemporary civilization, and not only in social perspectives, but also on scientific, artistic and cultural issues. I did not really know very much about the sources of that era, and perhaps because of that, I have enjoyed this simplicity of political and economic events that made the landmark of modern times much higher. I liked the way I liked Queen Victoria. Illustrated as a young and intelligent princess, whose decision was not always good, but at least motivated by good intentions. I think the picture of romance between Victoria and Prince Albert is very interesting because it equally encourages gathering intellectuals as well as emotions. The only failure found in this movie is that some of the romantic movies in the love story of the original author Julian Feloy have used some clichés, which finds some space in his playlength. <br /> <br /> I like Young Victoria a lot, and I really had a great surprise about it. I hope more time films will follow the example of this film: Clothing and landscapes will certainly work to support an interesting story, and do it as a replacement.
