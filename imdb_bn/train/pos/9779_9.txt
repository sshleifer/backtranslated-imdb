Three horror stories that come back home based on a hindrance of Hindu religion, but some change. Our former religious members in the first story are now an insane asylum and it has been visited by a report that has come to know about what happened on this religion. Slowly moving, the story is said in flashbacks, when sitting in two chairs and facing each other. The researchers are particularly interested in the leadership of the participants of the death. What is rather annoying is that the story suddenly becomes very exciting with a wonderful twist. The things are pretty bloody. <br /> <br /> A violent young criminal in the second story visited a psychiatrist for compulsory therapy. The patient seems to have some kind of agenda, but the psychologist works. Again, things get a bit slower and weird. Then there is a wonderful turn in the story which is very good writing and surprising. <br /> <br /> The final story is related to the spiritual healer, who claims to be able to eliminate their illness from their hands. The patient is a former religious member, so successful healing gets more complicated. Again, we are surprised by a wrapping. There is a beautiful scenic view there <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I got the stories written very well and the director was completely successful in setting up each story with his wonderful twist and Gary later. Note: German DVD Review.
