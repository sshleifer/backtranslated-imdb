"Spaces Invaders" is a fun movie I've ever seen. I do not understand why this movie was not good for critics, it's funny, innocent and sweet. I first saw, when I was 11 years old, and I really fell in love with it ... 2 days later, I got VHS: - To date, I have shown it to many friends, and they all liked it, but none of the movies before Knew about I think, almost no one knows the problem, so almost no one likes it ... there is no real opportunity for this movie, sadly that "SI" is actually a comedy like "Monster Incorporated" "Or" Spaceballs. "Well, enough dissatisfaction - I really wanted to say, that if you ever want to ridicule your head, see it! Even if you are not crazy about it, it's valuable! -> Ready to smile, taking the world away !
