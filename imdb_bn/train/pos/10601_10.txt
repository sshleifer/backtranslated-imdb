This funny British comedy shows what can happen in a section of London, in that case Pimlico himself declares himself free from the UK and its laws, taxes and post-war restrictions. What happens to Mary Mahmud? <br /> <br /> <br /> A wartime bomb blast explores the ancient document that was given to Duchi of Pimiliko Bergadi centuries ago, a small historical footnote that is long since forgotten. However, this is an unexpected opportunity for the new Berggandians to be free from Whitehall's intervention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The world's smallest country Dame Margaret Rutherford as a professor of history is a joy with those who are with Peilco. Stand-out cast other people such as Hermian Badley, Paul Duplice, Knotten Wayne, Basil Ruddford and Sir Michael Horden. <br /> <br /> <br /> Welcome to Welcome!
