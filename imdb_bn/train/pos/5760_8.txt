My roommate closed this web site and after a while I found it. It's fairly rough. It is cheezy. It's a fool ... but it's a lot of fun. I mean, it was the most fun because we saw such a movie before the "movie of the walking dead" age. The old drive-theater was like again! You can tell the person who made this movie that it liked all the awesome dubbed zombie movies. One of these movies has all the movies and tricks rolling in, and it's delicious because it might be that way. Chase factor is high, horse flows and laughs! The effects are better than fugitive, where the man is about to shoot half a hole, and where a man makes his heart wonderful by his chest! Actually, the actress actually gets pretty terrible. There are not many plots, just plenty and lots of gore. It has been patterned after Zoomi movies in Italy and Spain, because they remain firm in the permanent scene like this movie. If you like Troma movie, Cheezy B-grade stuff, then you can make any mistakes in viewing this one. A nice way to waste on a Friday night!
