Do not expect an illustration of "true". However, these fighters' fighters in Iraq and Afghanistan demanded thoughtful consideration. <br /> <br /> The main strength of this film is that their war-fighting struggles clearly illustrate the words of this vet and the wounds of war and the reconstruction of their war's naturalness and some degree of effectiveness. My biggest criticism of the movie is double: it is one-sided and it supports the anti-war activity, but there is nothing more to correct the serious errors of military and veterans' affair and still suffer from war injuries. This photo is not a serious error. <br /> <br /> As an experienced myself, I know that the terrible atom of war is real, and this young man expresses it very well. These vets definitely require physical and emotional pain and pain that most veterans experience and common people need to understand because all war is horrible so traumatic and annoying.
