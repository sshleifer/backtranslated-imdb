I give it 9 out of 10, because I have to see it again, in order to create a new perspective, more current mind-frame. I think it's an amazing psychological thriller that I saw in my brain and my eyes when I saw it. I will see it repeatedly (probably 1990 or so) HBO came back. I might even record it, but that recording has long gone, I'm sure. <br /> <br /> I wrote to the Greenstone to try this title, they currently do not carry it. I hope I find it in the local video store. <br /> <br /> If you find it anywhere I will try to give it to you. It's very less interesting. If you enjoy Edward Sistorhands, Bitlucus, Gamo, or other strange movies, try it.
