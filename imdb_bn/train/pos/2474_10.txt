<br/> <br /> First, I was a general high school senior, I did not really like Shakespeare's class, I rarely understood. Half! Shakespeare's almost encrypted plays were nothing more than unintelligible without all my concentration ... Encrypted with its extremely difficult for language understanding .... and then I still do not get most of it. <br /> <Second, it was 4 hours long! I thought that I could never be the best thing. <br /> <br /> Well let me tell you something. This movie was so nice, so beautiful, I really understand all languages ​​as it is being done. Now, the script was followed in this movie's letter, the same script which was unknown to me in the Shakespeare class. And here I was open to my mind and I understand it. I was suspicious of watching the movie! But look and see ... when Shakespeare's life comes at the time it takes place. So this version of Hamlet shows me that Shakespeare is actually a master, who wrote a great story. When I saw it on the big screen, especially the high speed motion picture style (with beautiful cinematography and photography), and starring with Branhag and Cast ... I understood what I understood. What is being said. Language is awesome and enthusiastic. It allows for more raw emotion ... When words can not describe anything, Shakespeare's words may be <br /> <br /> I still hold that the fountain of the North Star (animated, English dub) is the best movie of all time. No movie offers more sheer amusement. But the location of a movie bursting for a movie (which Hamlett - it was closed) is really amazing .... Inspirational Inspiration This is not a movie. This was an incident. <br /> <br /> Even more amazing, it makes me appreciate Shakespeare. How nice. Powerful Strong words There is one of the rare, truly powerful movies in it. <br /> <br /> It gets 2 trillion trillion from unlimited stars. Yes yes <br /> <br /> Your kids will all forget Shakespeare's class! You're wasting time. You have to see the drama performed. Then they will be judged.
