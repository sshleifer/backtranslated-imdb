A nice documentation. I personally remember this growing up in the NYC early 80's. For those movies that were not close to that period. It was the only thing in Africa's American gay underclass that they had in mind and the love and camera that you see are real. Some people are real and sadly still alive as this being written. The balls are still preserved, but not at this stage that they were in the nineteenth century. The time has gone forever. This is a good pre-"homo thug" movie. When Queens were really proud to be exroverts. Goodbye to Storyville has gone this other era but is widely documented in all the heel film!
