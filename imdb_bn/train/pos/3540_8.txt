I bought this game to buy an impulse from Walmart. I am happy i It was very entertaining to hear Shan Connery and playing the game. I thought that the movie was never seen in a movie / remake of graphics. Bonus levels were very difficult! I think the sniper was tough, it made me so disappointed that I did not play the game for one and a half weeks. There is nothing in life to hide behind it or to manage it, many people have shot to you. <br /> <br /> The only thing that I could change was the upgrade system. I have not noticed any differences from upgraded unnecessary tools, such as purchasing a armor upgrade does not seem to strengthen the armor or make my life meter more filling. I really like q copper. I did a good job with the developers.
