I've seen this movie in several different shows. One of the funest things I see is to see the reaction of different kinds of people to see it. <br /> <br /> type 1: old people Most of the old Japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a genuine mercurial movie, with lots of swords and medieval Japanese dialogue. As soon as the two heroes enter randomly inspletives across their sentences, when the horror movie debates start, the elderly people, generally hate out. <br /> <br /> Type 2: Film SNOBS. These people think that only a movie carries an "independent" label because it can automatically load hard-to-follow, which may or may not be in English. Despite this, they can sing it praising it soon so that people will think that they are intelligent and Sanskrit. They are really surprised when they see these pictures. As soon as the blood begins to circulate extensively from the war of animation-inspired sword or the top villain pushes the dog with his dog during a phone conversation, these people will be so frustrated, they will leave. Some people will just see how bad they will be "and then they will get annoyed with what horror movie they have with their friends." <br /> <br /> Type 3: live action ANIME people are waiting for viewing or like MATRIX-special effects. Sorry folks, quite strong in martial arts movies, but director Yamasato is not really the budget for such things. <br /> <br /> Type 4: No unexpected people These people really enjoy this movie. They only listened to Samurai's blood, randomly picked it, or pushed the hawks of alcoholics into the theater, these people who would ridicule all jokes and ultimately would praise the movie for it: Entertainment This movie was not illuminated or deep spiritual thoughts were created for revival, it meant (if I could borrow a line of dialogue from the film) "really kick some donkeys". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you rely on people like this, you may or may not enjoy this movie; However, if you appreciate the movie and enjoy it more than blood and acting, then watch this movie and do not forget to bring your friends.
