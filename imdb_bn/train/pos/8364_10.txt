Robot does not enjoy the story or bad effects of Jox. I mean, this was 1990 if you knew what I was saying. RoboCop 2 has still used stop animation because most of the movies have been added in the '80s. If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this time, most of them can do that with special effects shots available at that time. It was not until Terminator 2: The progress of technology that was revealed in the next year's Judgment Data was realized and story managers started using that purpose. But if you look at this movie, you will also have the darling memories of transformers, gang wings, and even power rangers. Enemy robots are very annoying. It does not really want you to face people without a good back-up plan. And there are some great moments in this photo. A traitor / spy is working in their middle. What you think of yourself, supports you in every way, that person you can not expect. So it's so annoying to think, do you agree?
