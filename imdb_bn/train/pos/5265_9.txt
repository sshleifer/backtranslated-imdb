When I was 9 years old, I could remember it for the first time. I wanted to be a "barbarous brother". This movie is still great. There was a basic aspect where the war scene is very small. Implies that "barbarous brother" is so good that they ended the enemies there soon! Plus, you have chase, fight a cage, a dragon, and yes rebellion even a bar! <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, so why is not it ten, the story line got many criticism. I think it's quite original. Many of its genre do not have the same original story lines, or color conversations. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this picture.
