Since I saw the first Anchor Avi in ​​1945, I have many nostalgia to watch it in videotape. At the age of 15, the great MGM Technikola musical instrument for me was easy to pull. Now I'm probably interested in thinking about the future career of leading players. Although Sinitra had played as a solo singer after Dorset's day after his rise, it was his first major film appearance. As mentioned by another viewer, it seems to be a warm up for almost on-town. Maybe it might have worked hard in the synagogue, but its dance with Kelly is believable, and she will do better in the next pairs. However, its physical observation is easy to see, why it is caricatureed as a string beans. Who would imagine that in a decade he would win the Academy Award for acting, and play a lot of role as a tough detective or leader in the war. Gene Kelly's personality and dance influence on this film, however, does not seem to be a major creative force for her great performance magazines, where she develops a supplementary form of Fred Asty's dance. Finally, Dean Stockwell was curious to face with fresh faces, and remember that based on Leopold-Loeb's murder in the 1920's, he will be compulsively playing the "thrilling" killer. An additional note: A critically acclaimed love interest in the cane garter Senatora. He later starred opposite On The Town, but Pamela Briton acted in this film.
