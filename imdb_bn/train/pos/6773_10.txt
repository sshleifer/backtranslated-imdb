I grabbed this movie on TV last night and you know that Danny Mastersson was a nice actor in the film and it's great to see him in something other than the 70s. The film is not rated, but in my opinion I will rate it (and), nudity and lots of adult content. But I love it all, I thought that the muck wiccracks were quite fun. It's about a person who does not get any job, girlfriend or money, and eventually gets a job as a personal investigator (a messenger's real.) He becomes the frame for the murder of a Rock Star and is one of Rock Stars's girlfriend. People that really need help him out I give it ... *** 3 stars.
