It's a wonderful movie in many ways. All of my family enjoy it. Animation is excellent and easily shows that there are plenty of producers to create visually bright movies as anything coming from Disney studios. <br /> <br /> A difference from the usual Disney fare is that there are some wise-cracking side-kick features for this DreamWork movie comedy relief. And, there is no sudden moments where the characters break into the song. I'm not sure that at the beginning of the film a scene will not appear in Disney: the birth of the soul. But it is tastefully done and not all objectionable. "Soul" was a great breath of fresh air. Do not make me wrong I've liked Disney for many years and do so. <br /> <br /> Another example of "animated" great animated fare. As soon as it was, my kids wanted to see it again. I had the same feelings. I recommend it thoroughly.
