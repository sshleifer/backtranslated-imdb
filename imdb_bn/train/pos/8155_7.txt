I am very old (or cared for) what is the difference between very soon rap and hip hop And, being Canadian, maybe I did not see MTV, but I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> But I thought this picture was very funny when I saw it, a brighter little mockery. Hip-Hop culture is so wide on these days that it is not difficult to hold over over it. (If we can only say the same about bagpipe music.) I've got most jokes (at least I think I've). Sure, it arises from spinal tap, but there is a lot of goals that can stand a tap treatment. Not just carpenters, they are sacred.
