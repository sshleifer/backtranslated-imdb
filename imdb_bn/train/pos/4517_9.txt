Not here - Adrian Pasadar Gerald is a real person, you do a great job of creating a deeply caring person and as a result you are trying to live both Gerald and Geraldine. Not only, but as Geraldine, he looks hot! And her chemistry electrical in and Julie Walters. These two characters who feel loved for each other, and even they look at each other at breakfast table in the morning. Even corporate takeovers are potentially credible to the Chess sub-story lines, and you find yourself pleasing to the end! At least I did!
