After watching the movie of the movie last night, I realized that most of the style of Dokak's style was done in this movie. Here are the same elements in our RINGU series, especially the media idea of ​​the supernatural source. Instead of the cursed video, we are instead appearing in a fierce studio and weird movies. In fact, the strange images displayed in the film immediately bring the cursed videotrap to mind at Ringung. The emoticon of water powered by Nicet's next film was the only thing missing. The final scene is quite tragic, quite a bit, requesting Murno, after opening the door, I entered the room and entered into the room. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A cool movie that needs to be doubled about going up to a catwalk.
