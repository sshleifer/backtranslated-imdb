Visitors will probably see a film like Osseini today and when it comes out it does not consider how immensely it was. Is the film structure really isolated from the Sap-Hewley Hollywood Convention ?? As well as other major theater components. It relies more on filming reality in a very serious and quiet light. Films of this nature? Neo-realistic films? During World War II, the darkness was created to reflect. Ossessione probably tackled some provocative problems which were probably invisible on the screen before the war, including: adultery, conspiracy, murder, pregnancy, etc. Along with a crane shot and some musical lung moments, the aesthetics of the film are very raw and great. Location over shots, natural lighting and probably using non-popular artists. All of these elements help to reveal the topics discovered in the film, providing the following theme: Negative action responses that will deliberately offend the immoral. <br /> <br /> Lead two ?? Guino and Geovana ?? Constant constant, yet bear both mentality: we are disturbed and we want to entertain. Gino is a drifter; A lonely traveler who embraces life and its constant warmth. Giovanna has a bored housewife wife in the relationship of married stability: She does not want to leave her home and husband, but it is safe because she rather lives where she lives. Gino Life Style represents the crazy lifestyle Giovanna; The only difference is he is afraid to save himself? So he loves Gino: he represents what he wants but he does not have the courage. Does he want to live with the world of unity of living with his wicked husband ?? Gino is the perfect ticket in the world. In the sense of 40, most of the left-hander viewers have some uncomfortable relationships. I mean, movies before the Neo-realistic era did not show such behavior in the screen at any time. At least it could have been a little risky. <br /> <br /> The neo-realistic style shows the negative reaction of the adulterous behavior, in line with the theme. Obviously, the immoral behavior (as shown in the movie) depresses and ends up living dead. When Gino and Giovannas schemed with each other to "eradicate" Geovana's husband, Karma came to Hunt like a plug after the end of their work. They return to their homes: the atmosphere is dark and bitter (as expected from the neo-realistic style). They are not happy; They are actually more depressed. They thought that they would live happily with Giovanna's husband, but they were kidnapped. The photo ends with the death of Giovanna? This is the functional similarity of her husband's death. I think this is a very satisfying finish for various reasons. Here's why <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it is very important to defame evil and only if evil is portrayed is not glorious, but what is the negative consequence of evil actions It shows what it looks. Osseini is asked as a subtract, what is wrong with fornication and murder? I think the picture is laughable! Both of them show how uncomfortable the behavior of adultery is. Surprisingly, at the end of the film, when they seem to be cured of their depression and show each other under the car, the film's authors show that their happiness is actually a symptom: car crashes, and killing the Giovanna in the river; Police arrested Gino I think it was the author's purpose that, even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, the action will eventually get them trapped. I agree I think the two are coming to them because they were both incredibly selfish? Always want instant gratification and do not want to endure hard times. After the first sign of their relationship experience with Gino and Giovana, it was specially cleaned: She can not control the pressure of living in Shawdo's husband, Geovana, so she can sleep with Giovanna and another girl. Such an insatiable, ridiculous personality traits Finally, the film seems very risky for its time. The audience, however, was ready to watch such a movie, because the war started. Those pre-war, happy-going-lucky movies are not believed. The movie's viewers were ready to see and think tough movies with complex characters: They wanted to see the characters whose lives were divided into so-called 'sins' because it reflected the problems of their own life. Then, Osseeta works as a great catalyst for the future of the film. That is to say, the nature fragments we see today can be thought to have been influenced by the neo-realist film movement.
