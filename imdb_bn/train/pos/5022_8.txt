Frailty - 8/10 - It's a non-sensic title and "Bill Paxton's Director" on one side, it's a beautiful old-fashioned rip of biblical thrilling crystals. In the end, it can only be the internal South Gothic cousin of "The Shining" of Kubrick - but hey, this is a fantastic entertaining idea. It got a doozy to twist a plot ... and a very confused moral message. This is a movie that people will be caught in the main cables at night and year after year, they will be afraid of Bijesas by taking care of themselves. Too bad manager Bill Packethon had to hire himself as a star ... oh well ... still a good fare is a devil.
