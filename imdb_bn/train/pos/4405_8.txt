Among America's history was probably the darkest hour in America's history; A fight that is against the brother and family against the family against the brothers and scars on the left side that even today has not been healed, and all possibilities will never be. And since any historic significance beyond any historical significance of any war, it is a personal contradiction behind the larger conflict which creates emotional stimuli which it involves. It is a human element that represents the context in which the point of view is presented, which provides director and le 'Rebel with the Devil', a civil war drama where he concentrates on personalized travels in his wide range of wars. , As well as one of the bloody chapters of the war, Lawrence, the infamous attack of Kansas, was included in a test by Quantell and his enemies, which he succeeded in performing quite a few motivationally from Confederate Point of View. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the union had influenced the state of Kansas and even with confederate loyalties across the adjoining Missouri border, it became difficult for Undertaking respondents to feel particularly special, especially to be considered as a 'regular' confederate soldier May And when things start heating around their own city, Jack Bull Chiles (Skit Ulrich) and Jake Rhodes (Toby Maguire) form their own band and damage to the union wherever it is effective. Jack Bull and Jack do not like war and do not like to kill; But they are standing to believe they are right. <br /> <br /> Others, in their midst, will even use contradictions as a car for men, personal twin as men like Pitt Maxson (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and express their own violent nature through unnecessary cruelty as nothing without an excuse, Resist in many cases against innocent victims. And so, for Jack Bull and Jake, as well as many, it has become a time in which loyalty and moral decisions will be strictly tested; At a time when their souls will be tempered with blood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The human aspect and moral perspective and illustrations Is doing And in this way, Lee realizes his viewers with understanding at least a few things, which goes beyond the real story and, finally, deeply grows on the motivations to use his characters and the plays. It is a tradition and customs that relate to the father and his daughters ('drinking liquor women'), class differences (`knowledge and sensitivity '), honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies (` Crowking Tiger, hidden dragon' ) Or moral ambiguities encouraged by the lack of all the above (`Ice Storm '), Li inspires his movies with insights into his human condition, which inspires him The higher the level. No exceptions to this picture; And (as she works with all her movies), Lee presents her story with the help of exciting cinematography (Frederick Elmes in this photo, who has brilliantly 'The Ice Storm'), which is a visual poem under her guidance. It's a special Li touch, and adds a strong, reactionary sense of what it says, which is one of the things that can make her films so memorable. <br /> <br /> As Jack, Toby Maguera initially expresses the feelings of youthless innocence in a film that maturely expresses so much contradiction, later on with the story of development and also revealing it with his character. Most importantly, Maguja strongly and reliably responded to the events surrounding her, which relates to the credibility of the overall film and illustrates the reality of the presentation: her strict confession of death and 'murder' and war between various murders; His moral acceptance of what he encounters, even in such annoying times; Betrayal, which is almost common cause of conflict nature; And adhering to obedience and faith in which he and his companions cling firmly. Magu√±a has achieved all this through her performance, and this is not a small success. This, though, is the type of study, reducing the often given performance, which is unfortunate; Such works deserve praise, and it should be recognized. <br /> <br /> Skit Ulrich is effective, as well as Jack Bull and Jewel (his debut photo debut) Suu Schelli. It is Jeffrey Wright, but along with Daniel Hollt, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers has played a significant supporting role, who brought disappointments like Christopher Walken in the role of Pitt. Also, how much is the role of Camo (one scene), Mark Raffalo has an unbroken impression during a very small screen. (John Cowden), Tom Guerie (Relay), Tom Wilkinson (Orton Brown), John Ales (Quantell), John Jude (Auto Riddle) And Kathleen Warfell (Mrs. Chiles). Civil war will be an open wound for ever; It is expected, however, that, when the time comes, it will be done by film producers like It and Lee and filmmakers' Ride with the Devil, which will ultimately help in the healing and healing by closing the conflict. In light of recent events, it is something that is strictly needed worldwide. The film is a powerful medium; It can be educational and entertaining, and perhaps more like future filmmakers, and Lee, events and attitudes that we create, embrace and promote the feeling of unity through the sensitive illustration. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
