Small Spokler Warns !!! !!! <br /> Good movie ... very good movie. And I'm surprised to say myself, because I'm not a big fan of vampires, and the name of the director is Daryan Seraphian. Most of her films are below average action films like Death Warrant and Gunnmann. It was one of his first films and perhaps he should have made horror films instead of action. This movie really impresses me. Good success, was involved in seeing any famous actor or big budget. It really is the story that keeps you focused. Especially the original Dakula mythological fans will be satisfied. Sarafian illuminated the other side of the famous Bram Stoker story and believed to be truthful and truthful to the truth. The Romanian count explains Dracula's life and how he fears the Turkish army with the help of dead bodies in front of his fortress. Of course, where is the reality and "based on a true story" stop. Drink blood and stuff was invented by all Brem St oker. <br /> <br /> In this film, Count (Vlad Teppish) is exiled to the US and seduces many women. And they are all beautiful girls, I will give him. Overall, acting well by unknown faces, enough blood and bulls are more morbid awful fans and satisfied with a funny tale. This picture was really unknown and it was hidden in the dark shelf of my local videostor. However, it must be done to clear cover dust and keep in VCR. Hack, it's much better than the famous title of Nicole Kidman with the same title. The other two of these movies are not something common, but I blame the film for stealing attention from this beautiful picture. Check it out ... to die for my gentle opinion = 8.5 / 10
