I do not realize that this movie has been fantastic success where they failed: "a scanner darkly" and "amort add vitam". If you are excited by the ideas of these two films and sadly frustrated (like me), you probably will enjoy the renaissance. It submerged you to the world of Paris in the future. It's not quite dystopian. They made the animation so good that I thought it was rotoscoped, but from what I can say, it was not, it was just speed capture. The facial expression is amazing! Since TRON I have not seen an animation / live hybrid in a fantasy world so it is not seen. The black and white medium is used to draw your attention in a gradual scene; My favorite effect is what they did with headlights beams, watch for it. The director plays with your attention and confusion, but you are satisfied with the thread that you want to look for. The overall effect is filled with a rigid and convincing small world of urban world. <br /> <br /> The plot is second, but it is not terrible. It's silent-eyed. Most major characters have a backstory to give their depth. There are weather. "Set" so that you can feel like you in different parts of Paris. There are some actions, even a car charger. I will see this one again to get everything. I recommend a very big screen to see the details as "set" and the credit is small.
