Nina Foke delivers an amazingly powerful performance as the character of this funny little Gothic nail-better title. He took a position as the secretary of the London Society Dosage (acting in an unreasonable manner by Dame May Wei) and his unclear son (ruthless and annoying George McDaddy). Before she knows it, she is awake to find herself in the beach beach manor that she has never seen before herself, where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and girlfriend and near dude that she is trying to satisfy Macready's crazy wife. Of course this pair can only plan naughty work, and even though we know that Julia will eventually escape from its snare, director Joseph Lewis has created a real mystery in answering his question about how to handle him. <br /> <br /> "My name is Julia Ross" There is nothing to stylishly separate from any movie that came from the same period, but I was amazed at how good it was despite the shoes-string budget and B-movie descent. . Within a few moments, you can be on the edge of your seat and I see myself transforming myself into Julie because she fell in school and began to rob her captives. In any other Gothic thriller, the heroine wiggles, shouts and screams, waiting for her hero to come and save him. So I can refresh myself by using the heroine's brain in this movie and learn how to save yourself <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > Grade: B + +
