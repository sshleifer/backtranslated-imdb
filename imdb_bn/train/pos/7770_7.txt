"Lithed on the Wind" Douglas Cork's Meldrum Douglas Sirac was re-discovered through "Cailliers du cinema", Fasibinders etc. He congratulated him as a director - I think it's due to the sophistication of his cinematography - "Lithin on the Wind", a colorful color picture and a fantastic Dico Rays. But I ask myself: is this enough to carry a film? "Wind written" performances are weak to fair (apart from Robert Stack - he believes as weak and spoiled playboy). Lauren Bacal, usually a strong presence on screen, is a misconception in this movie. As the temptation of Dorothy Malone, the careless "female phatle" is okay, but its role is not strong. Rock Hodson is skilled but vapid <br /> <br /> The plot has very interesting elements. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Nilophomeni's daughter Mary (Dorothy Malone) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Formerly a secretary and now married Kyle. <br /> <br /> Mitch (Rock Hudson) - Loved up with Anna Kyle and loved by the father. <br /> <br /> Secrets outside the door, love triangle, frustration, boxing, smile, death etc. - Well, when I read the story behind the DVD, I thought I was a behavior. My mistake Why? I will try to explain: "Writing on the wind" takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. I said before acting, in general, not good enough - lack of intensity. There are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an efficient job. I think those scenes will be fully searched with Italian or Spanish actors - they will end up with us (sunny) or tears (for us). <br /> <br /> What we have left is Douglas's beautiful painting Sirk. This is not enough for me. If you want to enjoy a good melodrama, then see "Abendra Ra".
