This romantic comedy-adventure is a lot of sunny moments and very entertaining. Luca Wilson is a stupid role, Ana Faris is very sexy, and Uma Thurman is a brutal neurotic superhero who plays Glenn Close in "Deadly Attraction" or "Evelyn Dropper", "Play Misty for me". Vote seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Mina Super Pre-Nomrada" ("My Super Former Girlfriend")
