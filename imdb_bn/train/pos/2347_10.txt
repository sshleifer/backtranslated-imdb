I have been a fan of Pushing Davis since the very beginning. It is astonishingly thought, and Brian Fuller has the most wonderful ideas for this show. <br /> <br /> A creative, like Pushing Daisies, the main show how much television is needed is incredible. It's a huge relief to watch a show, which is not something else, where you compare with new shows like Scrubs and House, but you can see the same match and it gets tired at the moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With a nice cast of every episode, wonderful scripts and laughing out, the Piesing Daisies are far away, one of the most amazing shows on your television.
