I wait for each new episode, replay with each expectation! The new look of science made by the Stargate SG-1 is astonishing that I hope that will not end. Past is a new twist that is interesting to me. Season # 9 should be a thrill in itself. I want that Richard Dean Anderson will show more often in the new season, I love his dried wit as much as his character tantrums as his Jack Onnier. Other character exhibitions make it a winner, season after season, that is their own uniqueness. You cancel this program in the next three years and you make a serious mistake. Also, you need a big role for Asgard - they are very cool.
