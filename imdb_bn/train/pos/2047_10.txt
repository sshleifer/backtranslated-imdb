This movie hit home for me. At the age of 29, I remember 80's and my dad working in a factory. I think, if I used to work hard, if I was proud and never left, my American Dream, house, a few kids, a car could call me all by myself. However, without any degree (except for my dad's nine grades) and without a deep feeling of greed and laziness, you can not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> I want to know if anyone has this movie on DVD or VHS. It's made for TV, and I saw it an hour ago. I can not find it anywhere! I love to show it to my friends, my pseudo-friends, family and other relatives, seeing what they think and reminding them that once the Americans work to feel respected and I'm proud to be able to do it !! I think there are still feelings, but as a lot of things are going abroad, in the very downward spiral ...
