Buster Keaton's first feature film is the first time I've seen and I admit that I liked it and only I could cover it a couple of years ago. Initially, the Rohouhhar blurardboard warns that the three-era single nitrate print was rediscovered and it was preserved before the burn in 1954 and many frames that were thought to be split together in glass. So, it looks rocky at places, but I have seen and survived a lot. <br /> <br /> It was just like 3 short films, but with intolerance it is inventive and fun finish from the beginning: a stone in the stone age with body Wallace berry and a pet brontosaurus riding doll Buster ride; In Roman times, adapted for running chariot and sledding with belters, Latins have no parking signs; In this technical age of need of speed and greed, his car is beautifully housed in the first hinge bits. Both the girl and the boy after the age of the girl, never ending. Dear Bit: As the cave he gets behind the bum on a steep edge but still hits a kiss in the camera - an amazing second or two! <br /> <br /> Great thing, reaffirming my love of silent film comedy.
