It's a romantic comedy which emphasizes the comedy for change. Naturally lovers - Sally Field As-O-Hill soap opera Queen, Celeste Talbert; And Kevin Clayne is the smallest employer and lesser talented actor Jeffrey Anderson - working for cross purposes, thinks he's crazy about love, etc. Bate Davis Mago Channing in the Hole album (1950) and the tradition of complete snapstick theater, Sally Field topped the hilarity side of love and happiness as malaprops. Kevin Clayne, one of the leading undergraduates in recent years, is very good and very victorious, as she managed to be handsome, weak, arrogant and loving at the same time. <br /> <br /> The Unfortunate Center was afraid to lose its viewers in Celeste, when she entered her PC and reached the crisis with the arrival of her nephew, Corrie Craven (Elisabeth Shue), who is not her nephew with the upcoming plot complex Had been. Prior to discovering the real relationship with Sereste (and Jeffrey Anderson), Cori Soan managed to get a small part of silence as a deaf as a small deaf in the opera. But <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Foil David Barnes is very hot for her, but she only takes care of one thing: to get rid of Celeste so she gets brighter in the set. At this point, he allows Barses to do all kinds of work to destroy Celest's career, but by the venue and / or reverse logic, all his attempts become very frightening to the audience's joy. <br /> <br /> Hype Goldberg played the lead author of the Show Rose Sharvaj and Schwart's arrogant and believable, while Kerry Fisher is a modest part of the hard-nail producer. <br /> <br /> I think it was more fun than I saw that soap opera is the only other spoof in the world (the young doctor of love burlesqued and very good at the TV General Hospital in 1982). Sopdish is a funky script and a lot of fun with a sunny liner and a wonderful performance by Field, Kine and Downey, Junior. But it's outstanding for Sally Field.
