It was simple and still so beautiful. I think the whole concept of gender discrimination in society, which can be bitter, was shown very subtle. It was a worm type Hummer. Most actors are not professionals, they make the movie more realistic and more realistic. The film was also a "documentary". The best scenes were the girls who were banned from the observation, who were forced to listen to the soldiers, who talked about them to watch and broadcast the game. If you are an Iranian, after winning a game, the familiar cheer in the street and dance fills you with national pride !! If you are not an Iranian, you will love it all!
