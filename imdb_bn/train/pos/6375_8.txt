Although I have a great respect for Disney's animated films, yet they are not late that I want to "definitely see". Atlantis looked forward to the first movie poster and trailer, and gratefully woke up to my expectations. <br /> <br /> Atlantis is more focused on action and discovery than a "mature" Disney film that was lacking in this song (it's a very unusual feature for Disney movies actually), and any other recent Disney offers. The world of Atlantis, hidden beneath the space, is unique, presented as a solitary hole with debris and then gradually developing in real ecosystem, which usually contains some reminder of hardness, until the tropical heaven itself is reached. Except for some expensive screaming songs, the Atlantis landscape and setting will give the state a more beautiful and playful look. In addition to incorporating an Atlantan language, it adds to the efforts of attaching it to the mythology of ancient civilization in real life and works fairly well. Also, the practical joke involved in some scenes of moles, a "baby" element that I do not seem to normally associate with Disney movies. Instead, the main ingredient was the struggle to go to Atlantis and constant discoveries in Atlantis, such as Milo's outer people discovered parts of their history, and learned everything needed to help Atlantans. They did not know about it. It involves Atlanton "surgical", which is used in a very functional climax which is quite exciting for the lack of a good word. Uncredited, all the stories are full of senses, and the film does not show any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but in addition to the Toyo Story movies, it's the most entertaining Disney film of the year that I have seen.
