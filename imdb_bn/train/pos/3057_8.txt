Wow I really like this movie, William H. Macy's Cool Hit Man is as great as Alex. <br /> <br /> Run here is really good, interesting and entertaining plot. <br /> <br /> Alex, who is married to a little boy, is hit-man (like his father), going through a middle age crisis and wants to leave the family business, so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and where he is free to join the youth Meet up The soul which Sarah will fall in love with. One day Alex does not know that when he knows what he can do to kill a person. <br /> <br /> If you like mature funny movies I recommend you to watch it. <br /> <br /> 8 stars = very good
