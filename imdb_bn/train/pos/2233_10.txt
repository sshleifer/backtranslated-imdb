I first saw this movie in the 1980s and now it is one of the best movies I have ever seen in 2006. I would suggest someone to look at this movie. You will not be sorry. It turns out well, so real and not a dull moment. The acting is superb and the position makes you feel like the movie. From the beginning to the end, this movie is a type that will lose your attention. The actress did a wonderful job of portraying this girl, who survived the terrible crash in the Amazon and it shows how she could live alone in the Amazon. It is incredible that anyone can live under this condition. Why is this movie so attractive? This is a true fact that makes the film more attractive and it seems that a young girl can survive from this anxiety. I have seen this movie once again which I can see and I will never be tired. Like hundreds of films, this is really worth appreciating! I would probably say this is my favorite movie and the best I've ever seen!
