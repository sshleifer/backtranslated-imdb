Holy Shit This Violent! Why is American comedy written like this? Anyone who thinks that the comedy has to be fooled - this series has more intelligence and intelligence than the six episodic novels! Hugh Laurie has a complete hoot I could not believe that the same guy as the house! This series has many great lines and gags, you can watch a few shows each time and choose new things every time. Rowen like the words of Atkinson, hey and Butler lay on Edmund. My favorite of all these Blackback series And surprisingly as the "rebellious mass" Baldrick as the somewhat frustrated heart of the Tony Robinson series. Some of my favorite lines: "When someone matches Wellington, he really keeps his foot" and explains how Bellardrich received his name and catechu McDader "top copper salesman" and Scotland's Homesidal Torroly.
