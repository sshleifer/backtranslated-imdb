This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. The footage is extraordinary, mesmerizing at times. It also got an Oscar for the best photography, and so deserve. There are many movies to collect and I have seen many more alongside them, and many of them are not very nicely or even equally nicely shot. <br /> <br /> This is unique and overall great movie. Throwing is not awesome and a great job illustration of their character. We follow their destinies with devotion, and get them very mentally attached. Along the way, we learn something about ourselves and our life. I think for what this image represents and how it represents it. I warmly recommend it
