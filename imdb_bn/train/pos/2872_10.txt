In my opinion, this is a completely romantic Disney Masterpiece. If you ask me, Grandma Ma (Lucile La Verne's voice) was really unclear. You want to know why you want to see movies. On the other hand, despite many housekeeping in her house, Cinderella (Ilin Stanley's voice) was very beautiful woman. To me, the scenery was nice, it was good to throw, and the writing was strong. Before I wrap this up, I want to say that everyone involved in this film is very good. Now, conclusion, I highly recommend it to romantic Disney Masterpiece who you have not seen it. If you go for a better time, go to the video store, rent it or buy it, jump back with a friend, and see it.
