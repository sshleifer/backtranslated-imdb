The outstanding discovery of the film "Sirevoy to Human", probably not duplicated. I rank it with "The Wizard of Oz" and "African Queen", although it's a completely different movie than "African Queen" "Searaway to Henen" is a psycho-drama that is completely unique using the performance of my knowledge and the technical effects. For example, there are combinations of B & W and Colored Footage - like "Oz," but the contrast simply crosses the significance - but the "Oz" has a nice effect. The opposite purpose and effect in "Sierway" can only be described as strong. <br /> <br /> Another idea of ​​"Sierway" is the "time" and the idea of ​​how it is used here. How has someone still conceived a better way to stand on the timeline ?? Literally? And then there is SierAway itself! <br /> <br /> If you have any imagination, then you agree with me. "Stairs of Heaven" is a real jewel.
