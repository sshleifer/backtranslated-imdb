I saw a few movies, Marion Davies and really did not understand his appeal. He could not dance to peanuts, he did not sing and tried for his performance - he was doing a trance. But I did not see his silent comedy, and this picture is astonishing. Instead of entertaining his proposed picture here, here's a mockery of my proposed, Gloria Swanson, who started at Slopstick comedy, he goes to the most emotional women film and ends with counting. Meryn, a top imitation, when he wanted to be seen as a grand imitation of a funny rabbit, that was Gloria Swanson Spot !!! <br /> <br /> Colonel Paper (Dale Henderson) has been motored all the way from Hollywood to Hollywood, prove to be her daughter Peggy, (Marion Davis) ever to be the greatest star. Their hope is reduced and they are under their last 40 cents when they meet Billy Boone (William Hans), who work in sledastic studios and promise to get Pegy's job. Peghe thinks she is going to be a big drama actress, but studio thinks she's an extraordinary humor. They satisfy him for making movies, and in the past he is a great success. Charlie Chaplin asked for his autograph but he did not recognize him and behaved him very cruelly. "The little guy who was there" - when he finds out he faints !!! Peggy and Billy received calls from the High Art Studio, but Peggy just wanted it and suddenly she was on her way. He saw a star where he saw a star - he does not think much of it - it's Marion Davis !!! Finally he gets the chance to be a dramatic actress - but he can not cry! !! This is a ridiculous scenario because the director tries everything to cry and when he is successful, he can not stop !!! His new leading man, Andr√© (Paul Rally), strongly believes in his comedy past and believes in being elite and sophisticated - he also accepts the new name - Patricia Pepo! He forgot and forgot his father - he has developed a "star" personality !!! When the slopstick studio likes "Patricia" in the same position as the movie, Billy is thrilling to look after her but is unprepared for her in-laws attitude. When she calls him a cheap dress, she realizes that she did not know that she knew it. <br /> <br /> After a studio launcher (a fantastic panning shot of the biggest stars of the day) "Patricia" receives a call from the boss. It seems that his films are a flow and no theater wants to book them - the public has tired of his methods and wants to get the old Peggy back. She and Andre have decided to marry, she is dreaming of being a council (although Billy says that Andrey would serve spaghetti in the cafe in the city and not counting it). After visiting her wedding day, delivery and after a sunny custard pie war, she realizes that Billy is one for her. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> William Henes, another actor whom I always wanted to watch, was fantastic - especially in the cafeteria scene, she did a wonderful comic timing. Harry Grebben comedy was ridiculous as director - there was a lot of sunny scenes in this film and Marion was above them all - I'm giving 10 out of 10 of this picture. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, high.
