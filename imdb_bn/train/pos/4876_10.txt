I do not know why some people from the United States, Georgia or even Bulgaria have the courage to express their feelings about something that they can understand. Do not see this movie - see it. Do not expect too much or do some framework because it is Costurtica Look at the impartial movie, try to understand the whole humor inside - people of Serbia DID are actually getting married when Bill Clinton bombs in their villages, in all Balkans, GPC can always do with you anyway, love is always unexpected, pure and colorful, and Balkan is very creative. For those who claim this is a bad film I can see that Americans' sh * t (Mitch Dave, Smart Drink etc.) is worse than a pure, authentic Balkan comedic story, which promise me. The comments should be useful and should present the personal perspective of the author in second place. I think the movie is great and people will see their respect for the director and the story. It's simple, but true. It's brutal, but gentle and makes you dead smile.
