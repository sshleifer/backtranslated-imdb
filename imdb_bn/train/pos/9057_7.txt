Let's keep it simple: My two children embrace this movie. It has its flaws from an adult perspective, but to buy some jelly-worms and just enjoy it. <br /> <br /> And Pepsi girl was nice! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cambery Williams became very naturally hot, although he was not too much in the picture, so do not be too excited here. <br /> <br /> <br / > This is not really a bad thing, but it's a kind of movie that you watch once. Do not Buy DVDs <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Did I mention Kimberly Williams? (That was for parents.)
