If this film is not better than Gavinath Paltrow as Emma, ​​then Kate Buckinsle is good, although I like Guinness Plato in the other Emma version. They are both good in different ways. Though think Kate Beckinsale is more interesting as Emma, ​​though. And I liked Harrith Smith's performance in this movie, he too ... She was more credible and sweet and sensitive. There are some things I like about the Gwyneth Paltrow version, though, the ridiculous side is more clearly how it is.
