Of course the "Sci-Fi" war galactic fan will hate this. That kind makes me happy. I do not see that Chesie Saifi-Fi, especially the bat-star Galapacica, and that's why I love this show. <br /> <br /> The makers of this event received lots of heat for heating (obsolete science-way way) and it was worth it. I read in the Wiki that they wanted to apply for women, not just the scientists, but also for the scientists. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The show has the most interesting, cute, and deepest scripts and it's really unique. <br /> <br /> I like about this show that it's like a great anime! Shooting guns from young teenagers from running, running and running near highly balanced and complex scripts, it reminds me of anything coming from Japan without much better (most of the animations are very confusing).
