I was really annoyed with the comment that I commented on as "annoying" and the scenes were fierce by black and white footage. It was created in 1925 !!!! I think it's absolutely incredible for the time! <br /> <br /> The journey that people had to go through was completely extraordinary. It took just a week to cross a river. Women carry their children in a heavy wooden cradle on a rocky hard winter, sometimes taking barefoot in snowfall. I want to see that now! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a wonderful wonderful shot and a wonderful movie with an incredible story.
