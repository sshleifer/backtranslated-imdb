The film starts somewhat like the Hyper-Kinetic, the more Pascal Dead or the Alive: Strange underground activities are performed while detecting the body of the police officers. But when a police officer dies, a Tassouto is involved ... and when he discovers that his brother Shihito is also involved, he becomes quite bloody. <br /> <br /> Mike's previous work, the Shinjuku Trud Society, is still filled with its usual 'All-in-the-scenes discrimination and wicked sexual activity, though it is not a more promising or exciting piece. Rather, it has dug its way through a beautifully beautifully fabulous variety of fantastic bits, the Tsitsuhito Underground, a scourge that sells body parts illegally from tuning as a local tragedy leader and often keeps the young boys brutal. Especially those who initially killed police). Tasusiouto's brother has been involved with society, so Tasudhato forced himself to become a dirty cop and used similar violent and rogue tactics. This <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tatsuhito relates to her heroism, Wang. Tatsuuto, a Japanese born in Japan, later returned to Japan and got separated for her. Wang was a Chinese who felt disconnected in China, killed his father and created a crime wing in Japan. Wang is also a wonderful Shakespeare character, which is as weird enough, that you actually feel sorry for her by the time of the final showdown with her Tatasuhito that much less. And Tarsuheitto himself feels the same sad picture when he is compelled to fight with his brother's lack of control. While Mike's films will most likely find it successful in their shock genre, it is true that sometimes Mickey is so easy to lose track of how to make the nasty, vague character. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
