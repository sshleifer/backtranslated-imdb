Treatment uses voice over creating an acute mood. Although Vio calculates it for all the lines of the film, it does not go away from the story of the amazing scene. Add multiple textures to story using multiple film stocks. B & W and color combinations choose to work nicely to enhance the leaps during the choice. Despite the expected end result you will finally have to jump. I had especially enjoyed the thrill of the film's mystery. Close-ups for love scenes are also lovely and reflect a tasty eye. The piece accomplishes quite short but much. Tight editing really helps to show what a small film can do. More than worth watching!
