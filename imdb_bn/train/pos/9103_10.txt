In life, we first organize carriages, family, friendships and love stones (Pyadras in Spanish). In this way, we will find space in this small stone, fit our small requirements. If you work the opposite, you will not have enough space for big stones. This movie has five heroine women who have not been able to organize big "stones" in their lives. Spanish motion picture director Raman Salazar defines his first feature in this way. The film describes five women as parallel, contradictory: Anita (Monica Servers, 1975-), Isabell (Angela Molina, 1955-), Adela (San Juan, 1961-), Leyer (Najwa Nimri, 1972-), and Merikerman (Wiki Pena, 1954 -). All the stones are trying to remove the stones that appear in their way or firmly, they have shoes. They are five Cinderells in search of Prince Charging and a new opportunity in life. The best story of these five Cinderelles is Anita (Monica Servers) who are "20 Centimeters," "Basque", "Crime Fare," "Entry Vivir Wei Gold," "Hongs," and "Octavia".
