I have never seen it on TV, but as soon as I found it, it is available to rent DVD via NEXFLox. I had high expectations, and were not disappointed. It's fun, and the animation is excellent. The quality level I was expecting from feature films only, so I'm surprised to see some bad comments in it. Maybe the DVD release animation was improved? DVD was fun to see both versions of a bonus pilot. I am an adult, and I am truly grateful that it is for adults. It's the only kids who like cute animated characters. Some have claimed that this is not near "cook", but I can see that some parents do not want their kids to see it. I am very disappointed that it has been canceled. I'd like to produce more episodes they have. Or maybe a movie.
