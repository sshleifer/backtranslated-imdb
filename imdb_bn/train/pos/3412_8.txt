Doctor Patient, actor Michael Sarralt, a cruel story about a cruel man. A physician who cures sick people in France, even if they have the power to pay compensation. Yet he liked the weak people in the population. Imagery and cinematography are fantastic, and this extraordinary story lends the feeling of extra Macar. He is the perfect psychopath. Impressive and altruistic, intelligent and caring, counting and killer. A movie will not be forgotten by certain visitors soon. For its cool illustration, Mr. Kudos to Serrault.
