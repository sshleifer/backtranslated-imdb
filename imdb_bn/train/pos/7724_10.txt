Sure Star Wars (I have seen at least fifty films) lets everyone else to have special effects, but there is everything else in this picture! <br /> <br /> It is awesome (non-graphical), romance, robots, wicked repartee, intelligence, special effects, and drama (surprisingly well). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie a resurgence a few years ago with a stranger print, and I held so much better today that it was held today. I think old 40's style will be seen in electronics hockey, but they were looking at the future and the future in the future. <br /> <br /> Here Anne Francis is here (mostly) small skirts and barefoot with a feminine innocence which is still difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many models of "Star Trek" from the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> This film is fitting overall that all other science fiction films have to be measured! <br /> <br /> Honorable mention for all the pins and needles on the honorable electronic scores.
