I'm trying to find out about this series for ages! Thanks, IMDB! I have not seen it as a child and have never been able to find it from my mind. As a 6-year-old, I was particularly hit by the episode of Cyclops, which was very cool (I talked about it so much that my elder brother made a cyclone from a plastic cave, which I still have) Anyway, I remember, There was an atmosphere, which was unusual from the beginning - mysterious, unstable, and extremely authentic. When I read the original after many years I feel the same sensation. It's a very difficult thing to capture - and probably Hollywood is impossible. Since I saw every 'ODC' has been a great departure. The characters in this series are genuine, real people - ancient Greeks - and not in any Hollywood star dresses. This is a real masterpiece! But why is it not known? And why is it not available in VHS or DVD? I just want to have a chance to see this again!
