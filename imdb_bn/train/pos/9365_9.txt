I saw this at a screening yesterday. I am fully aware that this movie is much better than I expected. Many movies can not combine the dark comedy and the current event drama and it does not collapse in conclusion. <br /> <br /> I will not be reluctant to reshare this plot because I think you know less about this movie makes it much better. But I would say that the performance of Adam Sandler was really refreshing and real. She was funny, and her most recent comedy was the most fun. Don Cheadle was always as credible as ever. <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny like Borat or Billy Madison but it has a good pace about it. I would say that 90% of the audience is mostly sunny for the movie. Slow motion to finish the middle of the film in the drama and it works great together to make everyone together. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the whole black friend / White Friend thing they just ignore it and choose to focus on relationships themselves.
