Dina Durbin, Nan Gray, and Barbara Reid, from this 1936 film "Three Smart Girl", in this universal film, which is known to the audience with debt Debben. It includes Ray Millland, Mischa Auer, Charles Winarr, John King, Binny Barnes and Alice Brady. This is a sweet story about three young women, who are now living in Switzerland with their divorced mother, who are remarrying their father (Winner). He has not been seen for 10 years and his mother still loves him, with the help of a housemaid / aunt, he goes to a ship in America, which is scheduled to stop the marriage. The purpose called "Pryesius" (Barnes) is nothing but nothing but the excavation of gold with the help of his mother (Brady), and it arranges to get acquainted with its rich calculus. It is arranged by their father's accountant (King). The person who chooses that person is full-time (income), but the girls make mistakes for him for the real wealthy calculus (Million). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Of course the emphasis is on young Durbin, a natural actress and a well-trained singer. Actually, as a young man, his voice is much more than an adult - after that there is no problem with the high notes, because he used to later because he had a lot of weight in the middle of fear. She sang a delightful "Il Bacio" song on a police station. <br /> <br /> The fantastic thing about this movie is played by Charles Winarra, looking at one father, does not want his children near - until he sees them and learns them. Barnes is not young at all as a gold digger, but the mother's mother is watching there, so perhaps the idea is that a young man is looking for more attractive women to his young man. In fact, he was looking for the young man to find his girls. <br /> <br /> Universal Durbin offers big buildup here - the final shot in his film. At this moment Ray Millland was still paying her debt and would be surprised how young and attractive it is to the audience. <br /> <br /> Highly entertaining and of course, it is a continuous and big stardom for Deanna.
