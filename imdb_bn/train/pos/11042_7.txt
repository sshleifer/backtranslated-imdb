In one of the convictions, four prisoners occupied a cell: Carre (Gerald Leroche), who used to cheat his company and betrayed his wife; Drake Lasele (Philipp LÃ¼denenbach) and her perspective, disabled trafficking (Dmitry Rataud), who had a sister for six months; And intellectual Marcus (Clovis Cornelac), who killed his wife. One night, an ancient journal, hidden in a hole in the wall of the carrier's cell, was found. They realized that the book was written by Danvers (Geoffrey Carey) at the beginning of the last century and about black magic. When they found the truth about the fate of Dancer, he decided to read and use his contents to escape from the prison. "Maleficent" is a real, playful and horror movie of Clostropophobic French low budget. The story is useful in the same position, no clips, and the viewer's attention to the last scene. I'm a great fan of French cinema, generally romance, drama, and police stories, but I noticed that recently I saw some good French horror films like "You Zee de Enfants", "Belfogor" and "Dead End". My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Sinaius Mal Mal" ("Symbol of Temple")
