It's a good story, good story, great actor and great song. Cinematography was unfortunately bad. One of the weakest aspects of the film is the annoying chain of copies of the celebrity women. Why? Is this some basicity, it hurts Abbas? Mustan? anyone? <br /> <br /> This picture is a new married couple, Raj and Priya (Salman-Rani). She could not conceive after the pregnancy she had done during pregnancy and she finally decided to use a tenant who would carry her child. They like Madhubara, which played Preity Zinta. The film is not actually realistic, that is not easy to accept? Even if they pick a girl, then what does that mean to sleep with her? Have you heard of pregnancy? However, if I heard these writers, the film would not have been created, so the idea is apparently deliberate. <br /> <br /> Salman works very well. It's nice to see a serious character playing. But his character bothers his wife about her love and unnecessary and cheaper conversations, and how distressed she is to sleep with another woman. Come on, it's sugar and unreal. The queen is just right; He is generally effective and trying to do something about the role, but Preity is completely shadowed by the zinta. <br /> <br /> This picture belongs to Preeti, who stole shows with her stupid performance. He makes transformation from prostitution to a loud and easily transforms a sensitive woman. She makes the film emotes her life, and her love, partly because of her role, partly because of her magnetic and positive personality, praises her at the same time. This is one of his career-best performances. He is more gifted than his contemporaries. She should just play such a role as more often. <br /> <br /> highlighting what the film's last just mentioned above. It's tear-jerking, exciting and very well played. See it for love. <br /> <br /> 7/10 for the picture! 10/10 - for love!
