After seeing the 6.99 dollar bint Dick Tracy at Future Shop, I decided to give it without any prior knowledge and as a big fan of Mafia and crime film. I was very surprised to see a very funny, smart entertainment movie with strong performance throughout my life. The film is running alongside, it is certainly another tough performance of Warren BT, but the original standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna. I was happy that Casino was nominated for his career to try to get the top gangster down the city. Madonna was as great as the daughter of trouble, she really impressed me and added depth to her performance. If you take great strangers and a funny, smart movie with a difficult script, try to see Dick Tracy. I do not think you would be disappointed. And look for Poul Sorvino, James Kane, Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffmann's Kymos.
