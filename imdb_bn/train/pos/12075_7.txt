Nina Foke emphasized that "My name is Julia Ross" in the 1945 film Noor Dame May Witty and George McDride. It's short, and because of it, the film is suffering from it. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, stamina on TV, a neurotic woman, cheating husband's wife, nervous wrecks He became great actor teacher in Los Angeles. Here, she plays a beautiful young ingenue playing the title. Julia gave an advertisement for the secretary and was hired immediately by Mrs. Hughes and her son Ralph. He rarely knows - even though we learn immediately - the employment agent is a front, there is no family to get the right woman for this appointment, there is no family and no lover. <br /> <br /> This is live-that's the situation; Once Julia entered the house, she was addicted to drugs, and when she got up, she said she was Mrs. Hughes and she was not allowed to leave. <br /> <br /> acting is very good. Low budget but still entertaining - some things, especially in the end, can happen very quickly, so I said the movie is very small. Yet, I recommend it.
