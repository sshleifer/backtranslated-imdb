At least one plane misled by Zeus on the city, and pulled the camera, just a few seconds before the plane crashed into the Tower One Day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zeus asked Captain to follow him in the tower. The first thing he saw was two people in the fire, some he refused to film. He stayed there for the next few hours, photographed firefighters and others. <br /> <br /> Brother Naydat took great care of this film as very violent, tropical, and not poor. But the firefighter's language is a bit thicker, and CBS shows a lot of balls so that it is unfamiliar. Music footage together with brother Naudat that they portray with one interview, in which firefighters can explain their thoughts and emotions at certain moments of crisis. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Very well, emotionally, moving, and completely eliminating the political campaign, Sorting date is the best documentary.
