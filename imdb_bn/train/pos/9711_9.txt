Well, I discovered that a show is more despondent and frustrating than "Little Britain" and I like it! "The League of Gentlemen" is a sick British comedy, the most dangerous, insane and despicable small city in the UK. This place makes Doublili and Craigie Island ("Dabli's Vicker" and "Father Ted") seems quite normal !! The format of this event is very much like Britain, only this is the center of the city of a Hellenic city. Both shows repeat the same screen again and in each episode and some clearly inspired "Little Britain" features (especially job seeking job skit). But the show is different because although it is crude as "Little Britain" (hence not a show for kids), the show is a sick and spoiled quality that makes it different from these shows. Especially, repetitive themes across the show throughout the animal cruelty and serial killings. <br /> <br /> Now if you do not guess then it is not easy for kids, easily offended or normal people, and this is probably why I am. Like it. However, you really need a thick skin and maximum of a love to enjoy this. Funny and incredibly irreverent outside of faith - see if you will believe it.
