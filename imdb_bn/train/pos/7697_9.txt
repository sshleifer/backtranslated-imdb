This was another great movie I was fortunate to see for the first time on the big screen (thanks to Rick Baker et al.) At the end of the 80's I was a relatively new actor and was really new about three JCs, SH and Yeeb. I'm not sure what I can expect when making my hard-working money to see it in the "Classic Triple Bill of Classics" at Old School. I do not have to be worried, I was left breathless by this movie. If you are a fan of Hong Kong Action / Kung Fu movie and have not seen this movie then do it now!
