A powerful pilot, this two hour episode does a great job of setting the character and background for "Enterprise", "Stick Trek" series "Preview". It stumbled on the "Trek" Convention and Clubs several times - Candy color space stripeers do not seem to come out of style, and I can already predict snickering references as Tipell's "Seven of Violence" - but great looks are strong, characters are well-drawn and somebody Already these instructions can be seen that this particular crew is more useful than the series (later?) Will be on. Scott Bakula, with the intensity and boldness of Kirk, hits the right note like Captain, but without his skin disease and quarrels, and I want to look at the way that the series is as an engineer, an arms master and communication officer (not just a glorious phone operator)! The author seems to be raising a big mistake on the "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Deep Space 9" and "Viegar" created: It starts with a big shoe throw and with a small stream of letters, it starts with a small Characters that can be added later on - which I hope, because after about half a dozen episodes, more different types will be needed.
