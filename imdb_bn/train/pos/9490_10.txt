The first time I saw this movie was in the eighties, but it has now been reviewed that this thriller is still real. Some new movies focus on similar topics, but they do not match this French milestone. <br /> <br /> A President - certainly JF Kennedy - shot in an open car during public appearance. As a result, this huge film "Lee Harvey Oswald" has been convicted, but a member of the jury insisted on further investigation. He has published some wonderful evidence ... <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone's JFK - a movie of the same plot - it can not play with passion, but the exciting description of the conspiracy and how everything fits together, drawing a new picture of the murder . Even for this interpretation of crime scenes, even a real psychological experiment is used. The film is more reasonable, intelligent, and thrilling than JF. Parts of the plot can be found in most of the new movies, sometimes there was a type of DJ Vo to sit in the movie. <br /> <br /> "I ... must hardly see" a "must see". Its unique and brilliant, and the music by Ennio Morricone is wonderful. This movie is very good for the ranking, if it is a Hollywood production, it will be famous for sure. <br /> <br />
