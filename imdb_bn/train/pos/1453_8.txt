Well, there are so many ways to loot a political thriller. Generally they are derivative or very ambitious, often they feature a conspiracy which is completely awkward and incredible. But the City Hall is not mentioned above. The plot is cleverly designed, the story is credible. As far as the characters go, I say this movie is a difficult average. No character finds the place and Al Pacino is always as bright. A charismatic NYC mayor is impressive in his illustration and again proven that Al Pacino nowadays belongs to the absolute top of American actor.
