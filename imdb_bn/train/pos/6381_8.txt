"Atlantis" is a new and accurate step for a Disney feature. It's a good choice to make a film of a mysterious legend like "Atlantis". I had no expectations for this picture, but after watching it, I did not understand why this movie got so much bad reviews. Even critics in my country are not positive. <br /> <br /> "Atlantis" is not a perfect movie, but Disney is the greatest of all time, even I suspect that this movie will achieve the "Disney classic" reputation. Well, this is another case. This is the director of this fascinating film directed by "Sight and Bust" and "Hanback" (so Kirk Weise and Gary Trausdale trying to get away from the fame of their giant film) I'm just kidding. <br /> <br /> All right, enough meaningless. "Atlantis" is a watchable, exiting and very enjoyable film. Even this picture is a PG rating rating feature, it is also suitable for my kids (on the contrary, parents do not kill me for writing this). <br /> <br /> The story is a little predictable, but it does not destroy the movie. Comic book-inspired animation is suitable for cinematography and it has been abandoned from the usual Disney-style. It's colorful, dark and detailed. The deep canvas sequence is pretty impressive. The film is sometimes funny, even more giggled than I smile through the movie. (Speaker) The character of this picture is very similar, but unfortunately there is not enough screen time for everyone to know, so some characters are back (SPOILERS). <br /> <br /> James Scout Newton Howard is absolutely great. It's brave and exotic. (Speaker) The most fascinating about this movie is how they make the term Atlantan the language very natural, ethnic and authentic. This is really awesome (speaker's offer) <br /> <br /> The script is tight and well-written, but there are still questions that are missing in the story. But thankfully they do not have so much. <br /> <br /> So please do not listen to critics, and look at "Atlantis" because it is waiting for you ...
