I am h More. Piffstff and the great talented Jack grew up with Wild and now my girls are enjoying Jack Wild's fans too. What this movie should be: fun and entertaining This movie is not limited to kids. Some of the conversations indicated by adults and the performance of Witchiepoo do not want to miss you. In this film, the song has beautifully decorated Jack Wild and Mama Kas. And as Jack Wild Fan, I will not miss the chance to dance or sing to him. Jack now makes this movie even more surprising, especially when he sings the song "IIFI par" for the Open song. It annoys me to love her for giving excellent childhood memories to my children. Let's all live in the island where friendship and fun! And keep the Jack Wild's memory alive on the Pufnstuff side.
