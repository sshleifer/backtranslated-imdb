Akinawan Karate is the world champion twice before, I like movies about sacrifices for sports. But this movie is so much more. This movie is so good and so deep. I have recently been plagued by a very dismal lack of serious injury and emotions. Lite out for me almost. And this silly little movie touched me so deeply that like a pillar it reminds me of the idea of ​​life. This is a movie about living. Respect for your life and others for yourself. Empowerment God, bless "Bound like Beckham" I believe it is a real jewel.
