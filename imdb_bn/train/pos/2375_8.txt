I honestly believe that it was the best version of the world that I saw. It was funny, but it was educational. I learned the movie completely and if I could give that movie. My favorite part was when the soldiers killed robots and others came from behind. In the world's last film war, I think it should have been more than the first and it got better. But by any means I have 2 thumbs up this movie. <br /> <br /> And if they make any other movie then I will definitely see it. <br /> <br /> Thank you
