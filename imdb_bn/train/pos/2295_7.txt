There are some cute captivating humor in this movie, which is both a parody of the actor and a tribute. However, it seems to be an exercise in style shortly after (though Balasco was running Dosollia's part and everyone was involved very well) and I wondered why Blair made this film. Everyone is finally published, when Bluehorn tells of Cloud Brasur, he receives a phone call from his father (Bernard Blair) from heaven and gets the chance to tell how much he misses him. An effective mental capper and obviously impressive. But there is not enough dramatic tension or emotional involvement in keeping the movie attractive throughout the world. But some really nice scenes and sequences, and anyone who likes 'Messentress Burns' of this French movie, can enjoy it fairly from this movie.
