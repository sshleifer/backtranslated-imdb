A tough B movie <br /> <br /> I like Jack Weber. Its different delivery is refreshing a time during peak performance. I liked the relationship between father and son. I like family dynamics. Wendigo looks folly, but it is a representation of kids toys and dead deer. Is it a cooperative, see? It's not a mental story, a Freddie slash flick up immediately gratification. Check it out and reflect your inner child and what the movie can tell you and you'll be better. <br /> <br /> Excellent job.
