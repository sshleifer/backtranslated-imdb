Two and a quarter hours, this is an intense running contemplative film break through the huge sword fight. The fight between darkness and light is indicated by the burning sun's constant motif and an asteroid appears magnificently by the three battles between 'demons', bandits and soldiers in a forest during the time. Prepared: After a stunning sword war under the sky full of the sky, the end of this picture will make you gulp on your head.
