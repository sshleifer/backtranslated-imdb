Parker and Stone replace their pet expletive-ridden humor from a feature length live action film with naturally good results from their animated masterpieces. Most movies are running trays and mats with its new toy box. The plot is simplicity itself: two average individuals invent new sports, combining driveway basketball with baseball scoring, which becomes a national madness. As well as they face the cliche of various sporting movies and send them with any popular culture in their philosophy. It's like a stretch of South Park episode, which is running with ordinary machine-gun conversations, toilet humor and homily from the heart. <br /> <br /> If this movie has weaknesses, it is a combination of the group that "us" and "naked gun" series series. This effect is clearly seen with the presence of lum eyes in the role given to Priscilla Prasili and shine and instead of the presence of two-dimensional jasmine bilith. Although Robert Von can only make his own team "Bullet" and Ernest Bargnin, his part has become fragmented even then, works well for corporate use, but one must admit that it is appropriate for the role of Patrick's team owner. <Br> <br /> For those who have not yet noticed, rock star wannabes seem more comfortable as compared to Parker and Stone comics. It reveals all the things that they made in the soundtrack. Naturally, they provide a good selection here with the compulsory track of their own ultra-non-PC car DVD. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br />, it is held back from full capacity by a complete reliance on an entertaining comedy which is "full naked gun / aircraft". Formula Parker and Stone can really do something great (or absolutely terrible) when given full control over a future film. In America, these guys lock up or charge them.
