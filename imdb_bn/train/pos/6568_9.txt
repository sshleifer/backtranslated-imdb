When I came out I enjoyed this movie as a child, and I still do this day. A simple story involving the search for a kidnapped girl and an adventure is literally straight out of paper payments. It was more recognizable that the actors back on that day. This viewer should not have to give it a spin. Wayne Crowford starring as the main character Jake motion Of course, it may bite some of the elements of Stone Romancing and Indiana Jones. But this movie has been done enough to keep the movie out of the cellar. I am too surprised that people do not know about it. It came back to '86 by other movies in theaters. I then saw the TV. VHS and DVD can be hard to find from both print out. Less than 8 taka got DVD from ebay! Cool Flick
