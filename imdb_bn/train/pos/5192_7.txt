I'm a Kung Fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies that are filled with top-most gun-game. Now, martial arts; * That's beautiful! And John Woo surprised me by creating a very entertaining kungfu movie, which * almost * wars a lot, if such things are possible! This is the best thing. <br /> <br /> Many scenes of war are very good (and some of them are less good), and the main characters are fun and favorite. Bad guys are a bit too incredible to be bad, but no one has less entertainment. You will see the sleeping wizard !! He can fight only when he's sleeping - it's violent! <br /> <br /> There may be a little annoying and long wind for chin repeatedly, especially because many scenes of war are not that good at all. So, I rated it "just" 7 out of 10, but it's about "8". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main movie of Kung Fu. With the exception of some significant exceptions in the late 1970s and early 70s (and early '80ies, to be fair), all really well-known Kung Fu films were from the late 1970s.
