This movie is terrible - kind of a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. <br /> <br /> The story has been reprinted from many movies of this story, which I am not even going to describe. It is a picture of a sword / astronomy, a child can understand how important he is in this world, an "unusual" explorer, an evil companion / a magician, a princess, a hairy animal .... you get points. <<br /> <br /> I was in the very cold winter for the first time to catch this movie. I did not know why I decided to watch this channel for more than five minutes, but when I grabbed the site of Golffix, I decided to stay and see it till the end. <br /> <br /> Galfac is not like a white, furry animal like Chewbacca, but almost as useful or entertaining for viewing. It looks like someone has broken a white shirt together and forced the actress to wear it. There are scenes where the actress can not go inside, or she's almost reduced. Although he does not have so much in the movie, but some of his views are valuable! Try to talk to B Sawenson about smack, take Solo-Chebakahara comparisons to even higher level! <br /> <br /> I really bought this movie due to this character, and still there is nowhere! <br /> <br /> Golf can look like Shankar, but he is in the movie !!! The only reason I never saw a seagull, I even wanted to find it, because in its absence! Probably to be a final film, completed trilogy, golfing will return to an expected one!
