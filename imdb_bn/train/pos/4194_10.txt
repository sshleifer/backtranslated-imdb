Samuel Fuller came up with his traditional playful and stylish aspects towards this series, lovely story, and led to create one of the gems that were sought in the 1950s movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ) Walat hijacked and most wanted microphilms. This is 1953, so the microfilm committee spice property will not stop to get it back. When Wimmermaid gets sent to Witmark's waterfront for the film's recovery by an abusive lover, Wimmermas gives him and his "comrades" a chance to reduce for big money. Plot germs, people are dying, and fall in love with Witmark and Peters. <br /> <br /> The story of Fuller Love is handled a little, but worse than ill-sense or dictatorial instruction. It seems as though he had included a love story calmly, and so deliberately made it incredible, because love stories were so frequent and still in Hollywood movies. Peters is a tough new Yawk cookie, part of gangster moll and gives an extraordinary performance as the daughter of the part in the teen. When violence takes place against him, we actually take care of his love, and the restoration of Fuller, this is his earlier style which is not an earlier conclusion of a happy ending. <br /> <br /> The final success of the "South Street pickup" stands on the tired shoulders of Thelma Rittera worldwide, who plays Mike, who is a mean woman who earns money in any way, or sells it well or acts as a police inspector Do it. Ritter gives her career performance; In an exciting relationship, he has directly expressed the whole sad experience of his character's life and directly wakes up in the morning, feeling the awakening in the world of crime and suffering. It seems as if every character Ritter congratulates one for all moments for a moment for a moment, but they have not been given the opportunity to act in other movies. The scene highlighted Fuller's film, and 50's movies, a highlight of the period. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
