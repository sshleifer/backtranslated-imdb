'Ned Kelly' is a nicely produced Australian film honored by the hero of Australia. Explains the film and probably refers to Ned's actions as fair, we are taken into the world of Ned, her best friend Joe Joe Beren and other Kail Gang. <br /> <br /> There is an exceptional cast present here, all star performers, which brings life to the film. (Great work, Hit!) Orlando Bloom was pretty as Joe, keeping quiet, devoted female-based role is very good. I was up the soup at the moment. For a moment, I almost believed the war in the gang glenon would have won, woe, that would not have happened. <br /> <br /> Some aspects of the film are fictional, and a sleeping Kelly fan (and supporter), was a little disappointed by this. Perhaps the film could go on for more time to cover the life of Kelly Gang / Ned - I did not feel enough. <br /> <br /> Although there are some flaws, it is an ongoing film, which is all kinds of stirs emotions (And hey, I think this picture would be better than instead of trying to portray Nede instead of McJugger ...)
