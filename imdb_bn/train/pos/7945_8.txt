I'm a fan of animal cinema. If you can take a plot and keep the animals as the main actor, you usually win me. Homeward dam is just this. They took a plot as old as the time and made it a new spin. It was a complete success. It's very an archetypal movie. Your group (shadow) group (shadows) are intelligent and logical, you have a loving but intense and incredible possibility, and the famous princess who thinks she should be joking and appreciated. These three personalities bounce off each other very well I liked how I created such dynamic characters in Chance and Sassi and they did not finish it. Most people say that it can not be good because it is too much of a child's film. Anyway, they forget that it is considered to be a child film, and it still does not go away from the movie. This is a good movie when you get annoyed and you just want to watch a movie. Without a cartoon, it is a Disney movie, an air shoot shoot with a good plot. I, without doubt, advise you see it.
