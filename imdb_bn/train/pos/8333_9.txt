IQ is a surprisingly original romantic comedy that has been named the greatest and deepest thoughtful scientific mind of the 20th century as a champion helper. The central theme of this light-hearted but thoughtful movie is in touch with the heart and the mind. You do not know how to respond to it, because the time you see is a great scientist doing innocents to uplift the emerging love, but at other times, you discuss the few things of their age / places. A fun movie with surprises across the end result. Walter Matthew is a perfect Einstein, Mag Ryan has created a radioactive, sloppy intellectualist mathematician, and Tim Robbins has created a conflict of interest for skilled educated people who fascinate science. Together, they created an adventurous trip through love and science, mind and heart.
