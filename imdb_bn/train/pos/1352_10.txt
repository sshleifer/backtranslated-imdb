This film has never been seen and it is considered a great classic with great experienced actors. During the time of the film's creation, people in America were different, without any radio or television, no TV or all the modern things we have today, except for the great films made in Hollywood. The sweet innocent stories of young romance between young girls or people are seen differently than today.

It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if something happens then it can be found within minutes of the whole city. A down-earth film with a perfect decent people are trying to help each other with a very easy way of living. Today, it sounds very gigantic and stupid, but I believe in the 1920s, the American people were like this. & 30's and they are a great generation who like family films like.
