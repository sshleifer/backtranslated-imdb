This spectacular movie is one of the most wonderful movies I have ever seen. It shows a China that I have never seen or imagined, and I believe it shows the 1930s China's most real light in a movie. It was heart breaking in so many situations, saw how difficult life was for the letters, and yet the story and the last incredibly happy. You see the depth of human existence and the Higgs in this movie. All of the actors are perfect, as you feel that you have really entered a different world. <br /> <br /> I can not adequately recommend this movie. It can change you forever if it is viewed once.
