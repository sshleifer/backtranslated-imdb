One of the best comedy series to come out of Britain. Mark Gattis, Race Schreithith and Steve Poberton feel great actors and actors who appear to be in the house with a comedy drama. Supported by their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they have presented the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Little Britain pales in incompetence as a poor imitation of their ideas Continuous origin and ground breaking I am sure many people hate this series with their love, but I am sure there is no opinion in LOG. I still can not see the length of feature film, but I have heard good things and bad things, so I reserve the justice. The real radio series that LOG came from became innovative as a TV series. I do not know whether the TV series was made in the United States, but I would be fascinated to see how American viewers are seen in humorous English.
