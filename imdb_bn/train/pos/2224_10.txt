A female executioner (Sexy Jennifer Thomas played the second role) has fun working to fill the imagination of all human beings in a row of death before meeting their Creator. And what a way to go. This lucky movie is not real, or we will allow many more people to die in this world. <br /> <br /> It starts at a really slow pace. Low light and bad acting, like most (B) movies. It gets better as it moves along it. And end with a bang. <br /> <br /> I have a very sexy movie of 90%, at low cost it will rate very high. Once the kids are away or on the bed it must be seen.
