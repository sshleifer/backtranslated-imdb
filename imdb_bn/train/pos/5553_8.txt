The slow but neatly mounted story of the American Revolution. Griffith's storytelling seems to be a much less heavy tool than his previous historical epic, and his tablefucks work is fully integrated into action. Lionel Barrymore is a curiosity swine, Neil Hamilton is poor but dashing and carroll damper .... Well, Carroll Dempster What has happened to Griffiths in this period, but most of them are not seen slowly enough. And drama. <br /> <br /> Remember that the intensity for this movie is more than 2 hours when the first release is available, but there is no cut-off that will last for more than 90 minutes. However, the DVD release is gradually presented at the FPS rate, which increases the tension and gives it more than two hours. <br /> <br /> Better stories than stories than stories-patriots far better than stories While in Griffith's best league, Way Doood and Broken Blossoms are not a great way to spend several hours in the league.
