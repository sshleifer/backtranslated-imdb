This is one of the best movies. It's one of my favorites. A movie with good acting. The story is very sensitive and touched. Good camera work <br /> <br /> Actresses and actors have no names at the top of the American Star List. However, they give equal or better performance compared to the top of the list. <br /> <br /> No one wants to see a movie about true love, romance, friendship, but there is no sticker in front of anyone. <br /> <br /> If you do not like this movie but you have no heart or feeling Not there. Then go watch a sports movie. There are no killings or fears here. See the movie. This is mandatory. T.H.
