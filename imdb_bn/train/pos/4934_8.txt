"Panic in the Streets" was directed by Elia Kazan, a fairly unknown little film and before his classic masterpiece, like "Streetcar Named Desire", "On Waterfront" and "East of Eden". Prior to this movie Kazan had already won Oscars in 1947, so at that time he was not completely unknown. Still, "Panic in the Streets" is a movie mostly taken under the radar. <br /> <br /> The great thing about this movie is the Oscar winning script. It has a very good idea and its excellent tension thriller element with a sniff / crime-film element. The film's dialogue is absolutely fantastic and gives the film a sense of reality and credibility. <br /> <br /> Throwing is fairly unknown (especially during the Liberation War) but it is still one of the first movie roles of Zero Mothel and Jack. Especially Palance influenced, as a solid gangster boss with a very strong look face. <br /> <br /> Still some points on the movie drags a little. The film starts very well, but after the start the movie gets slower and does not always make the right decision on speed, and the story is called from the perspective of the scene. However, "Panic in Street" remains a completely visible film, mainly due to its difficult scripts and powerful conversations that make the film look credible. This is a great movie for fans of the thriller genre. <br /> <br /> 8/10
