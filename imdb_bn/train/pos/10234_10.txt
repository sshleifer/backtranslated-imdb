<br /> <br /> "Burning paradigm" New-Shaw Brothers Action and Rango Lam's urban hostility. When someone sees this movie, they may think that the battle scenes are only moderate but it does not matter, its attitude and the environment that counts. This is great film both !! Always trying to be different from his contemporaries, Lam gives us the traditional heroes (Fong Saiuk and Hung Shai-Kawan) and places them in the "Lost Ark Riders" settings. However, these are not light-hearted comic avatars that you can see in a Jet Li film. Instead of fighting death with these boys cruel consequences. The film makes it even better that anyone can die at any time, there is no hold. Too bad, they often do films like this.
