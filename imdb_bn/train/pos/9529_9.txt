This is one of the best films of 2002. Perhaps it is not the best movie, but it looks the best, plays great and is equally managed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'. <br /> <br /> It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hans), who saw his son (Tyler Hochlin) in one of his work. Michael Rooney (Paul Newman), a resident of Michael, thinks that everything will be okay, but his jealous girl, Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig), Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and his father and Michael set both his mother to death. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney must choose for himself, and Hetane Maguire (Jude Law) will be sent to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected person in the organization, he tries to win some friends, who can help him, with the viewers, including Frank Nitti (Stanley Tuchi), view <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> But it's so good that you can not see it around. This movie is good in its production design, art direction, sound, music and most of its film. The results are pretty fantastic although these elements can create surprise and suspicion. That whichever is a boring baby and not a handshake, Law and Newman certainly know how to work. <br /> <br /> Based on a comic, this movie is much better than your expectations and although it has its flaws it is consistent with a good movie. Sometimes there are incidents in which you can see that you have seen it long ago but for some reason it seems fresh at the same time. Scenes of adult hongs and childhoods in Heleen help the area. Check out this movie which will be known occasionally, but it is quite new in many areas.
