After the creation of it for the audience comes a long time, "Winchester '73" has a little Casablanca with it. When you see it, you get the feeling that you are going to see a consistent string that happens consistently; Then you realize that after copying from this particular movie Clich√©s became cliche, and this image was so big because they copied so much. In other words, this is a basic task. <br /> <br /> "Winchester '73" is a pleasure to see. The broad lines of the plot are somewhat predictable, but in most cases you have seen many copies in the next movie, and despite this it still has several twists that surprise you. Dialogue, pacing and quality aspects are excellent. Stuart especially shines, and if you're a fan, it's a "must be seen," but he is not alone to provide a better performance. Significantly, most thoughtful and / or malicious lines go into small letters. Because these characters make a lot more than the nut (it), it gives extra reality in the film. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, and it's good to keep an eye on it. There is an interview with DVD Stuart that provides some backgrounds to the film.
