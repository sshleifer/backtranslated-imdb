Seeing this movie for the seventh or the 8th time only, Blockbuster has seen and liked this once, I showed it up to 4 people and they also enjoyed it. Avoid all the Hollywood glamor, "special effects" and pressure of "Shock Factor", Paul F. Ravan's independent film hit the nail on the head after affecting the depressing situation. After high school shooting took place, Alicia (Basi Phillips) and Dan (Erica Cristenstein) formed two unlikely bonds. Alicia, the stone heart girl, Goth who has a discouraged spirit of life, helps to overcome the issues of life and death and subsequent living. Meanwhile, Dina Alicia again tried to help to see some softness and light. This threat of shooting has not been emphasized, but due to correlation between those who survived, this film is different. Despite its low budget and short filming, the film is far from Chesi. Ryan reverence for any situation that he has never tolerated and tries to get into the mind of man. Amazing up and upcoming actress Phillips adds the necessary plays to the dialogue and adds the overall feeling of the film and helps to find "performances and sadness" to experience this movie. Overall, I recommend this movie and if you enjoyed school aggression and violence and learned more about it, then I recommended the documentary "It's a Girl's World" by CBC in 2004, which discusses issues of social piracy, Montreal, Quebec And comparatively comparisons of the other two girls in Victoria and discriminatory Buddhists After being religious, 14-year-old daughter compared to friends of friends and acquaintances of Mary Mary Wellesley.
