The stories of many mysteries follow the path of the standard hadith: Inevitable procession between the most deadly murder, collection of formulas, the possibility of tearing the red fountains, and the smart criminals and even more clever criminal solutions. <br /> <br /> "Forgot" love and gives us complex characters who can do terrible things or not. At the end of the three episodes we have no easy answer and no nicely packaged package can not disappoint anything, but for me this is an intriguing fictional story that explores, annoying and hunt with the question: How does a wicked person feel? <br /> <br /> Unusual acting and production is not a combination of easy to forget ... forgotten.
