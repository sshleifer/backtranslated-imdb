German midwifery drama Maya Nebulaungen of Freit Lang: Crimildous Rush (1924). Crimehild (Margaret Shooven) wants to take revenge on his murderer Siegfried. Hagen is very weak to face trial for his brother's murder. Kremlin got married to Etel. King of Hoon (Rudolph Klein-Rose). He gave birth to a child, and invited his brothers for a party. Etel and other Huns should be made to Hagen, but he is protected by his brothers. We see a huge battle of life and death begins, and he sets the whole place in the fire. Often Hagen dies, and so is Crimhill. These movies work with great themes, such as revenge and inhuman love. We saw some good movies later, but this was the first one.
