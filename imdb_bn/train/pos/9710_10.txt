This makes me proud to be British. By the most fun thing on this TV. The league includes Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gattis and the lovely Reese Scissors. Completely intrinsically, this horror comedy perfection. Characters iconic and catchphrases bizarre, "Hello Dave". This is a comedy which everyone will see easily. <br /> <br /> The best thing about civilization is that it is always fresh, and always pushing the border. It does not have to rely on crophrases (little contrast in Britain) for it to be fun. The League is willing to debate their most famous and symbolic characters, it shows us that they got the steel ball.
