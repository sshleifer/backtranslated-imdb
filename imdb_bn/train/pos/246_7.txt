How could I possibly have the opportunity to see Orlando Bloom and Heath Laser together? Well, I could not do anything, I hired this mess of a movie. <br /> <br /> I have never heard of Nell Kelly and I am amazed at what I found about this young man's legend. I was surprised at how mediocre this movie is. Perhaps it was too late and maybe after 4 hours of the film's marathon it is a little slowly, I find it difficult to follow this story. The story is not complicated, because it is slow. Even with a slow story, laser and bloom operated to create striking, dimensional characters. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this recommendation, it is a great story in Australian history (how young the country is, it is very rare and should be appreciated) and the film has some good action sequences. <br /> <br /> See this for the 6/10 historical value .... (Yeah right ... and the only reason to see it ...;))
