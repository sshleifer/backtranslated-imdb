If scientists behave in such a way that HG Wells believe that they will happen in the future, but history will not completely change as it is coming. About 80 years ago, Welle wrote that based on this film, the film was based and they were not previously described in any way near the Earth, in some ways they went away. <br /> <br /> Players known as Raymond Messi, Ralph Richardson, and Cedric Hardwick are cast, they are even more interesting than genuine characters. This is the main weakness of the movie, it encourages philosophy of Wales, solves all problems and the rest of us are stupid. <br /> <br /> Messi's two generations of the same family are the most optimistic scenes. Cedric Hardwick seems to be a suspect who rushing forward to people too far. And Ralph Richardson, a war criminal arising out of the war with modern weapons of war for thirty years. As the nuclear bomb was not discovered, the toxic gas is considered to be a weapon that almost destroys mankind. <br /> <br /> According to Wales, science and victory can never be mixed. As a group of scientists involved in such things, politics is much more in the world. Scientists in Wales's life must have escaped Hitler and the right-wing fascist government of Mussolini. But to defeat those same people, they were engaged in alliance and created nuclear weapons in modern times. They liked them when they behaved like Wales, like Albert Einstein, after a World War II, a junta led by science could establish new orders. <br /> <br /> <br /> Wells understood the time and development of Wales. He apparently envisioned the computer as well as nuclear power. Computer programmers are more likely to be the ruler of the new world than the scientists at this time. Instructions made by William Cameron Menzies and sets made Steve's to make HG Wells interesting, certainly a respected thinker of his time, though he did not get the shape of the upcoming things.
