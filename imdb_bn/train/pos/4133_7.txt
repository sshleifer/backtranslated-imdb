For many reasons an incredible little English film. At first it's a rare look in a light comedy a Lawrence Olivier. Although his performance does not depend on the criteria, he will be established as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, but he is fully trustworthy as a Hydinked Barrister. Historically, the film was a hit and was very interested in both when it was shoot. This was not a big budget for Hollywood filmmakers of the same age in English, and it often shows, but this film was portrayed just before the war and it shows England that will soon go away. When we look at it today, we think that in terms of modern morality and this film and its closest American opponent 'This Happened One Night' was in their days, as was the 'deadly institute' in our time. But after watching this movie and enjoying it, I can not feel sorry for the first time when I can not see it. Prior to 1950, film shoots went with half, preserving the rest of the film is a difficult choice, and unfortunately these films are often sent to save movies, which we think are important. Color changes, the lack of contrast, and often the poor quality of the printing machine is often heartfelt. Along with 'I Happened One Night', this film is curl up with a love under a blanket on a cold winter cold winter and is good, but why not have a double feature.
