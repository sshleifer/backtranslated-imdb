I have seen this film more than once and after that there is always someone complaining about the "clear construction" of the plot. But then - it's part of the game of petzold. He plays with consistent rules as well. <br /> <br /> It is very nice, how two girls (Timothy / Hummer) meet their unlikely story again, another replica, more impossible stories, girls made for a cast. This movie is a journey between truth and fiction, it's feasibility, it may happen in the past or things that may happen in the future, it is more than real boom. It's a reverie, kind - enough enough to have so many objectives, Freud found interesting for his dream analysis, such as all "doppelganger" -sample. Also, I think, "Gaspenster" can be interesting to look at than the great Asian cinema: Petzold's daily urban architecture is scary in the absurd, weirdly familiar way. This picture is not about obvious. To describe it, the story of two girls has finally become friends and lovers, or as an orphan clay story, who searches for Europe for her missing daughter, clearly describing the story of "Gaspenster" is not saying much about nature.
