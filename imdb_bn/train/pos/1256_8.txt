This is a very dramatic and suspenseful movie. There are many plots and active. The story or director expresses the question-answer question of death row or the crimes committed by black people. This image is very well-directed by Ern Glimer and James Newton Howard's fine word is excellent. San Connie and Ed Harris's strong performance. If you like it, do not miss "real crime" or "hurricane". My wife and I gave 8/10.
