I played the whole picture nicely with fresh images and interesting cinematography, the whole way through it. The actors were at the top of their character's back in almost perfect time and looked great. Music was a happy and well thought out. It was even a decent bow at an end. So everyone is voting by voting? The story was not completely fresh (like the remnants of "Running Man" with the idea of ​​the entire television program), but attitude towards Christianity and Judaism seems quite true that how people like their Messiah. It is understood to follow the person in front of the modern crowd and follow him to keep him tied to his chance. <br /> <br /> It is possible that Christians or other religious people take it because the film has the word "God", but it shows that what the filmmakers are trying to do, teach people such a possibility, Those who have never seen this world, especially in the modern world where Christianity is more acceptable and forgotten. <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave 7/10 big big girls to IMDb. I thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original, in most cases. If you are not very annoyed about the possibilities of the upcoming Messiah in a nearby TV from Madrid, see this.
