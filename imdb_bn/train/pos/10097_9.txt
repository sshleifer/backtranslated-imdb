One of the first OVA ("Original Video Animation") I ever bought, this would still be one of my favorite anime titles. A cyberpunk science-fie action comedy is an unlikely (a comedy, which is) set against a background of pollution in the near future in a dopopian society. <br /> <br /> The Dominionian "heroes" tank is made up of police, formed "If we can not lose the crime, we can get a big gun", and those who like this name, instead of driving, go to the city in the tank And those who are really far more dangerous than criminals. Trying to catch Most, if not all, the boundaries (?) Of psychologists and neurotics between these polices, the word "loose canon" makes a new payment. <br /> <br /> Similar opponents of their colorful and ridiculous, terrorist Buku and his group (one) men, twin cat sisters, which always seem to be involved in giving difficult days to the tank police. <br /> <br /> is not the state of the animation industry, but it is otherwise very nice; Colored palettes and cartridge look and characters fit nicely with humorous environments of the Dominion. <br /> <br /> English dubbing again a lot of fun. The English version soundtrack is very good. I wonder if they've ever made a soundtrack album ... <br /> However, the Dominican Tank Police are very cool. It is mostly Japanese cyberpunk SF with comedy, fully filled with the leading characters and situations, it ensures that it never takes seriously. Highly recommended.
