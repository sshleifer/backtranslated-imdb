If I saw this show's pilot, I could have given it 10 ratings. I immediately entered this fantastic new world. The next episode has not lived fully in commitment, but I'll be watching and hope it will be better. Production quality is incredible and the first rate of acting. I do not think it seems to be completely aligned with BSG because I'm so excited by the prizes and facing it, they're two different shows. I'm glad that Jesus Morales and a group of all my time, Eric Stoltz, came back to my life (if only weekly) I missed them both. This is a show that needs some thought from the audience and it's always a good thing. You have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show; Things do not always seem to be, and of course, gray, literally and metaphorically both, plot lines, characters and, of course, are in the virtual world. We all know how to end, but the journey is quite a ride.
