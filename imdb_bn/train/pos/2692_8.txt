I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. It is a great direction, already BIGAS was born in Luna, Spain. And it is obviously in Spain that the movie is held in Katalunate, to be more precise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story, such as refusing to accept the birth of a great son's brother. In this movie, the young boy suddenly saw that his mother's milk was all seen by the recently-born son. So he started trying to find a breasts able to eat him. She recently found it in a woman and from here about the movie all this. <br /> <br /> This film is a lot on the painting, the story itself is more, the espectator captures some moments (unforgettable moments) and some symbols (the movie is a disorder analysis on almost everything because it usually means something ...). The surrounding areas, especially the characteristic of the region, as well as the spiritual behavior of the characters, also symbolic, and the great fluttering soundtrack by Nikola Paivani transfers us to another level, which is not parallel to the real world, but it intersects it again and again. Occasionally ... this movie is worth watching, this movie is worth seeing, though we finally and the tired of the moments and a little sick of excessive obstruction, which is probably beyond the limits ... <br /> <br /> I I enjoyed the performance ... 8/10
