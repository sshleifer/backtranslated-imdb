This is often a movie that can not literally make the audience humorous, and after five minutes their eyes fill them with tears. Many movies try to do this, but some of them may provide the psychological effects that this film can produce. Adam Sandler makes you panic with his hectic and often violent explosions, but you can laugh even if his past shadow does not drag him. I'm not going to destroy anything, but there is a scene especially that your eyes need to drink and bind. Even while watching this film the maximum macho of men will be heartless bastards to even experience something. Don Cheadle gives another great performance, but is shined out by Sandler. Liv Tyler and Jada Panket Smith have performed strong performances, but there is nothing in the two main role lines. Sandler's humor is still present, which in reality has saved the film from the sadness of the boundary line. There are lots of smiles, but do not you think you stay there for a long time, because it gets worse again without much warning. <br /> <br /> I got a good hit on this movie about every emotion of the human body, but I would cut this short one. I think you do not need to say anything more. Take a look at yourself and watch this movie. It has to wait until it comes to DVD even it is 100% worth. A deeply moving film is sure to tear your eyes and make sure you smile on your face ... If not, you are unselfish soul.
