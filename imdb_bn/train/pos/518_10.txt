Also known as the "stairs of heaven" in the US During WWII, the British Peter Carter (David Niven) shot the plane in war, but he survived. She fell in love with Sweet June (Kim Hunter) and reads. But there seems to be a mistake in heaven - he's dead! A French spirit comes to get him but he refuses. He soon demanded his case before the Heavenly Tribunal that he should stay alive. <br /> <br /> seems ridiculous but it's really incredible. Movies play a complete face-to-face role and it is handled nicely - this script is good - the world's views have suddenly been technicolor (I have never seen a pretty blue sky) and the scene in heaven is black and black. White! Although solid at the time of solidarity, Hunter is very cool (and very nice) and Roger Livesi is trying to help Nivens as a doctor. The whole imagery is amazing (especially during the stairs and final trial sequence) and the special effects are really great (considering the age of the film). There's a completely strange sequence when Nive runs into a completely naked young lad shepherd sheep! This is a very beautiful, thought provoking movie - highly recommended. This shame in the US is unknown.
