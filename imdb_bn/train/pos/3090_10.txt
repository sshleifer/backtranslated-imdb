I am so annoyed that ABC is releasing another program which has the chance to become a true winner. This show is so good, writing and the story was great, instead of the other boring reality show, the original original concept of the show. The cast was spectacular! Not just the characters and actors, but this actor is a very talented set. The concept and idea is really a new and cool concept for a TV show, many of us share this whole concept of "connection". I really love Steven, Laura, Whitney and Damien characters. But to be honest, there is no person involved with this event that I do not like, even for a few episodes (even Sherry Appleby). Acting and characters are so easy and so talented !! I hope the ABC has given this event more opportunity, and the show did not interrupt the midway, it was not enough. Really wrong! for everyone!!. This show showed great promise. For one, I will know ABC how I feel and sending emails to keep this show alive. Join me, I know we can do it. It works for Jerico (Where's the episode 13? I want the last show!). Support this show and send ABC email, we can do it !!! This show is a good value !!!
