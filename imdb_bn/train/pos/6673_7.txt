Most of the IMDb user comments I saw for this movie are not justice. After all, tell me that this movie will not be taken seriously. It is not necessary to think about it for which it is supposed to be a funny, yet stupid movie. You will be very disappointed if you watch this movie to see a great composition in filmmaker or comedians. Still, if you want to watch only an incognito movie with some gifted actors / actresses and some good catch-phrases you will enjoy it.
