"Movies are dead, live long movies!" Last year's Romanian film source, Anneimul's most innovative and productive contemporary director Peter Greenwere reached Danube Delta in a third edition. This year's award went to Jaffar Panheir's "Offside". I got to see this before the festival in Bucharest this evening. The movie is dead but still very vivid. The panahahi image tells how Iranian society looks in a compulsory way. A story inspired by a real-life event, "Offside", happened to Teahihani's daughter: Problems and risks when deciding to participate in football matches. It is banned as we are forbidden as Iran. Panni is directed to do something that is rendered in several ways, but perhaps many work, intelligence and humor are cultural phenomena in a society which keeps women in a different level. The disobedience of the law becomes ridiculous. This film is a happy ending because the Iranian team went to the World Cup. The idea of ​​what I most admired, was the idea behind this film. I would be interested in watching other films of Panahi which were also banned in Iran. I think he may be considered an active worker.
