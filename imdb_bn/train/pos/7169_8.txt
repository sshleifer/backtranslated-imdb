Generally, there are some annoying features in "kids" movies, which make them very unhappy and intolerant for over 13 years. But again, Holus hit the scene. Of course, this is the same moments that often give the child's film its previous quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from the conference. The acting was honest, and most of the movies that Stanley had in the uncomfortable mobility with other campers were more realistic than filming. I particularly like this movie because this picture does not try to break your heart or cry. The mental power was a bit more natural than most imagination, it is in many ways like the release of Shawshank (which is similar to the hole, as well as the end of the recovery). Just below? Hookie looks weird After all, 8/10.
