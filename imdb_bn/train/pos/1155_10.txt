It's very fun. It is a great cast who gives every great performance. Especially Sally Field and Kevin Kline This is a well-documented screenplay by Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon of Vegas). I do not like soap operas, although I never see them. But I love this picture because it is so crazy and out of the wall, that it comes out of a stupid soap that has television on their day. In my opinion, it was the best film of 1991.
