It is a trick of morality, so sometimes a gentle touch of ugliness happens, but a laktah will stop all your heart and change everything until all the sarcasm and irony flow softens. <br /> <br /> This film, surprisingly written and directed, is a gem that shines perfectly, with all the beautiful acting. Jean-Louis Triangent is fine as normal, and Romi Scannider is a pearl, perfect and burning, which can not be missed. A really amazing film !!
