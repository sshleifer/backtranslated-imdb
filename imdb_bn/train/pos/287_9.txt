We liked the movie. I am the mother of two little men I love to have a movie where I can see with them the fidelity and character of the men. Movies where money is not the most important thing. And the family is forever and means more words of love. <br /> <br /> I would like to see more of the Davis family. But the love that I have made me feel the same feeling, others "Please do not finish". We wish both actors will change. New actors were good replacements. <br /> <br /> My 9 year old boy liked this movie too. I asked to go buy them all. He is a movie critic, so he told me to tell him. This step of family will buy it for all friends. Help bring value back to a time. We will now be reading the book that we are hooked. Hope to see more really. Happy moving will be happy
