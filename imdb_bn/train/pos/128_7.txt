Van Triay once explained how he created such strong partnerships with his film from the audience in the real world and in the middle of the imaginary world. Visitors feel that we see a "true" story, but we actually use it completely, often making the movie boring (dark dancer) or painful (idiots / idioteren). Of course, Dogme-films have acted like a car for this theory (besides welcoming some to Van Trio). <br /> <br /> The story is ideal for Van Trier: Our protagonist is idealist, his balance is related to others, but soon becomes the victim of the problems he has created for others. To be idealistic and to become terrorists, the idealist must reject the society. Mankind has perished and pureness only (self) leads to destruction. (This element was very universal in breaking the dark and wavelengths and dancers). This war played a role in German postwar Germany and even modest (even ridiculous) studies about the role of the Americans. The film is astonishingly designed as a technical achievement: the transfer and fading washed color, screen overlay, various overlay action (with the mayor shooting as soon as fun). In this movie we can see how Van Trier's handles are as good as a technology medium. In his subsequent work, he feels deposed (as he is not interested in technical achievements because they are so easily available).
