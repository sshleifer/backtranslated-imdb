I could not agree more with the quote "This is one of the best movies ever made." If you think Vanilla Sky Cable is a "re-created" then you may not be more wrong. The film has a lot of depth: apparently, with musical instruments and emotionally. Apparently, because the film is sometimes soft and subtle (visible scenes with sophia) and at other times strong and intense (post-climatic scenes). <br /> <br /> The song and words are completely added to this movie. Without the song, the story is just half called. Nancy Wilson has created such an emotional, yet eclectic film, which may not be more appropriate for the theme like this dream (although not released, I was able to get my hands on the main square for about $ 60. If you work hard, you own one Copies may be able to find). Croh is also suitable for other musical selections such as Beach Boys, Josh Rose, Spiritualized, Cigar Rose, Monks etc. (There is great song in CROW). More importantly, the psychoanalytic theme (ie love, sadness, sadness) in this film is very strong, and is enhanced by visual and musical experiences, as well as by impressive dialogue tenfold; I acknowledge that the lift scene again comes in tears in front of my eyes. While the best part of this photo (it can be even better), it is so intelligent that you will catch something new when watching each movie - so keep an eye out closely and be ready to think! Sure, a theme becomes obvious after the first or second watch, but there is always more to it than the story. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best works of Cameron Croi, and a work of perfectly brightness. Most of my films and musical inspirations come from this work alone. In fact it has touched my life, as is the true artwork trend. It makes me amazed that there are many people who can not appreciate this movie (I really understand the art). <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Vanilla Sky has a league of its own.
