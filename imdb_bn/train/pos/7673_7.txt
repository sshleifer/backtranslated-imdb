The film "Holi" is a story of a young girl who sold her poor family and smuggled across the border to work as a prostitute in the notorious "K11" Red Light village in Cobodya. In the film, Holly is waiting for her virginity to be sold in premiums when she gambled Patrick and beat her over money and friends repeatedly. Patrick and Holly have immediate ties on their "germs", but when Holly sells a child trafficker and disappears, it is all interrupted. As movie dolls, we are again thrust into Patrick's pursuit of Holi. Holly then leaves her lifestyle but shows her confusion about what is right and wrong. "Holi" carries us through beautiful and tough Cambodia when Holly is not just a daughter. He exploited and violated millions of children every year without any right or protection. <br /> <br /> Holi is less extreme than her content, such as 4-year old documents and sex trafficking, but prostitution drives enough light on Cambodian / Vietnamese trafficking in children. This is a moving story that helps many children to face and focus on their struggle and focus on the terrible conditions that can understand right and wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> During the journey, his motorbike came out of fuel, and forced him to rent a room in a prostitute. During her stay, she came across a twelve year old girl Holi, who sold her parents and was kidnapped in slavery and prostitution. Holly and Patrick started a friendship with trust and understanding. He invented a tricky, lethal girl under tremulous exterior and was determined to save her - although almost everyone with strictly platonic relationships interpreted them wrong. When he suddenly disappears, he starts a journey to follow him, if he really can help him, without worrying. <br /> <br /> Holly could run away on another prostitution, when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mine. A mine is set by a cow and the truck driver believes that he is dead, so Holly has left his own. While searching for Holly during Patrick's trip, he joins a social worker, who tries to make some ideas about him and shares his information with the victims of Cambodian territory. The idea of ​​paying for his freedom only burns the demand, he explains: 30,000 children in prostitution in Cambodia - next year it can be 60,000. "I'm not trying to save 60,000," he told him, "I'm trying to save one." Patrick discovers that the idea of ​​shining him for safety will get a quick break when a social worker tells him that the US will not accept him, and even if it takes five minutes to 'preserve' the child, it will take five years. Patrick is not influenced by the information in society and he continues his search to find Holi. <br /> <br /> The audience is shown that it makes a small town and is enchanted with food for other homeless children. Then, with him, the local police members made friends, who feel a little better than the badge than the criminals, when they sold him in another paper and then signed a deal with the Vietnamese businessman that took her virginity. Holly then thinks that this is her fate and when Patrick finally finds her, she wishes to make her remote friend "Yam Yum" and "Boom Boom". Patrick is completely confused by this change of behavior, but he is not disturbed by his plans to take him away from this world. In the end, he stole them and brought them to a comfortable place in a social society. If Holi is given fresh clothes and brought to a dance class, she is banned from seeing Patrick. With this strong desire in the comfort of Patrick's friendship, he returned safely to the street in Cambodia. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Patrick is facing a decision to leave the country. Be in the United States or Cambodia Her thoughts are returning back to Holly and continuing during a visit to a bar; An elderly man makes a comment about his sexual appetite by viewing pictures that accompany him. This patrick enrages and he hits the man out and runs out of the bar. Finally, Holly, who is hiding behind the pole, was caught by police. <br /> <br /> The movie "Holly" wants to donate money to the audience who can improve their life for poor young people, even campaign to reduce the number of prostitution in the region, but to reduce the dramatic weaknesses of the film, enough people will be less likely to meet May Overall, I think the concept was as good as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie. Actors have done a great job of showing their real emotions and real confusion of the youngsters influenced by this lifestyle, but ultimately they have nothing to help their parents' appetite for thinking about the terrible lifestyle of the region and selling their children to their children.
