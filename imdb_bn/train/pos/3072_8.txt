Panic is a stylish little gem of a movie - you think that you could only understand the first half hour that it is very satisfying, that Henry Bromel is a much better writer / director than that. <br /> <br /> The movie is gradually extinct, with another quietly devastating scene, William H. Messi, Donald Switterland, Neve Campbell, Tracy Woolman, John Ritter, and the most extraordinary child actor I. David Dorfman has seen Messi as the son of Messi, who delivered the line of completely unauthorized thinking in his mind. Rich and rewarding, these film credits will be with you for a long time after rolling.
