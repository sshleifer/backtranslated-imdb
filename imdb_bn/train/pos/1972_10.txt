I do not understand your objection to this movie. This is a fresh, thrilling extension of the "Basic Institute" created character. The only part of the story that is at least a bit unrealistic, actually the character of Sharon Stone is still alive and not in the prison of this late date. Spirir Alert: Like the movie progress, we are presented with three theories of what is happening: 1) Sharon Stone's character is killing these people because he is crazy (addicted to risk); 2) David Thewilis's hypocritical policeman is killing these people to frame the character of Sharon Stone; 3) David Morris analysts are killing these people for revenge. Most people object to the film seem to think that none of these theories is ever explained as a "real" story. (Although analysts have a mental care facility to kill police; the only murder that is happening on the screen). <br /> <br /> I think it is a "great plot device in the space of 2001." Who knows the real? The blonde is really crazy, the police really crooked and the analyst really wants to revenge. What is important and interaction between other characters in this story? Like real life, everyone thinks that the film is more complex than the film and the reality is more complex. Drink it!
