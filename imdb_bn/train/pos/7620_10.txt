Lost is the best tv series. First of all, it has great actors and wonderful directions. Writing is a very controversial topic, because the writing in the first two seasons was remarkable, but after the season 3, the writing became very complicated. For example, who is Jacob? Why does the smoker have a rear on the island? What is fog How does the island disappear? Who is Richard Alpart? Many people think that the author is lost and they raised many questions and mysteries. That they can not explain. I believe these people are wrong. I trust the writers. I think that if the mystery is revealed then all the kisses in the series will go away. However, the lost best TV series and it will continue for a long time.
