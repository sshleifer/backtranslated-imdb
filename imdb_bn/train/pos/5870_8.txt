Jacqueline was sensitized by Stephen Metcal's play 'Strange Snow' (scriptwriting was also written by Metcal), which is sensitively directed by David Hughes Jones, who often explores the often forgotten effects of the war of warriors who are permanently damaged by the brutal cruelty of the war. We are particularly stupid to come back to this film in 1989, because we see the recovered soldiers who returned from Iraq's war and the raw treatment we received at our veterans hospitals. <br /> <br /> Three Vietnam fighters have gone to war together and only two survivors come back: The problem is that both men are suffering from the war, but a David High School 'Flanigan (Ed Harris) is so badly affected by posttraumatic stress syndrome that he Drunken vacuum with his plain, 'existing' school teacher Martha (Kathy Baker). David returned to the city to help his friend Yusuf 'Jackinif' Megasi (Robert De Niro) to help his friend. Incidentally, Jackinf first helped Martha and finally, on two dates - must be present in a promotion Martha - and in that love, drunk David completely separated, destroyed the debris at school and threatens the residents and students. Jackinf reviews this time in Vietnam when they lose their friends and thus brings David to the point where he can begin to climb towards recovery. And with long trouble Martha Jackinf has found her needs. Three actors have performed exceptionally well: Ed Harris played his most complete role, while De Niro and Baker set up high standards set by their staff. More people will help to revive this forgotten movie because it is a harmless reminder of our wars that fight with the people at the end of the war and fight with their family. Highly recommended.
