Although I liked the spectacular films like Amitiville and Poltartist, this is a huge punch on the horrors of Hollywood created for TV adaptation of the Susan Hills book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " There are all the right material to hide. <br /> <br /> There is no need for blood, violence or grave to send cold on the shoulders of an audience by Herbert Wise. Using your own imagination, Black Woman in Black fears and scares, and whose presence is not absent after the first appearance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its mission to set up an estate. The widow dies and Arthur spent several nights in his house from the house, where he noticed some oddities, which may bother him for a while. Some of the scenes are very uncomfortable and clustrophobic, especially the locked room that opens itself, that closes the generator and closes Arthur in the dark. The film became more harrowing to you more Arthurs shoes itself, and its effort to shake off this scurvy. The author keeps many cool additions in the story, an example as the appearance of the tin soldier. One eager to know it all means. We do not really learn so much about the widow, make imagination more and it creates more trouble. <br /> <br /> Most of the cases are widowed, terrible and terrible. The generator's jogging scene sent me cold, a woman who is nowhere in isolated soil with a blown air ?? Being on such features as myself, I can appreciate how it is isolated. And the moving scene was probably the worst thing I ever did, I do not want to show early watch or to elderly relatives. I wake up at night thinking I was often behind me in my sleeping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm kind of agreeing that the internet campaign for this movie has completely disappeared and it can be seen Why people were disappointed after spending 50 pounds, but I think the net has defeated secret gems because it creates films like these. . I think it's still brilliant and fabulously played and I consider it the story of the greatest ghost of the last century.
