I can not say that this movie is available by some critics anywhere near the amount of Vitriol. Yes, it is bogged down by an over-reliance on an over-padded running time, hamfisted edits, and special effects. And it lacks most of the power that your average audience member will sit without having to check their clock in a comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Messi, Styler, and Aziera do a great job in combating the diversity and diversity of the "core" party, and the bright and gorophalo and studio team. I can not say Rabindranath or Mitchell with the film, although everyone can show some light. <br /> <br /> Plot, as I said above, your classic "Underwood-make-up" stuff. No surprise, since you know that they're going to win. This is not profitable, weird, proud hero and villain, but dialogue and interplay between characters. All of them below, these people are children of heart, who want to fix it. The film's best scenes give this movie its emotional ground. Look at Azerbaijan's relationship with his long-term mother; Messi is unwilling innocent to accept his apology. Amazing's secret identity; Stella's anger (a strange, spaghetti baby that you once knew that is not covert, like the oppressed anger of the playground); Garofulla's desire to retaliate his father. This childish belief that a sense of justice and goodness is always a good place in the world, superhero comics will appeal to the true; And under the parody of its parrot, "mystery man" shows us why this hackneyed comic-book troupe has so much importance. <br /> <br /> It never gives jail in contented content, because it is a great half-baked substitutes (romance, family life, conflicts between teams), but the main plot is the lupe fun that it creates for it. It seems to be good, it seems that some critics have lost some of the fun here, so I will issue a warning: If you are a philosopher who enjoys his intense harmful and scratchy cartoon, it is unclear and unreasonable ("I believe It's a kind of ... * snort * ... _magic_xylophone? "), Then you're much more literal and mind-like for this movie. Instead of renting a sandler film <br /> <br /> (7/10)
