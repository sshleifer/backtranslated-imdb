Halloween is one movie that gets you deep in that leather! It is in my opinion, always the horror movie. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was so terrible! It makes Halloween so special that it was not a special effect where you can say that you can animate the computer, it was in a low budget and it was a note score, but it still encouraged Hell to fear people. For 25 years and the film still has the same effect, like '78. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is about a boy Michael Mayer, killed his sister at the age of 6, and ran away from psychiatric institutions many years later. . Dr. Sam Lumis is after him and will do something to bring him back, because he described Michael as "... the evil evil, the eyes of the black eye, the devil's eye." Michael is a mission, though his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis, killed. He'll have to make him banknote, his friends are partitioning and of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie gets the chance to be her virgin. <br /> <br /> <br /> He has paid a lot of respect to the psycho, and we have another character, Sam Loomis and Jenny Lee Curris, the daughter of Jeanette Leai. Halloween is a horrible movie that breaks the boundaries and closes the door, bounces your windows and closes the lights! "They're going to get you! They will get you!". Halloween, extreme horror movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
