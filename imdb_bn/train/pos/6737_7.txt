The director and Laura's two stars (1944) reviewed these rigid policemen: Dana Andrews is a criminal boy who had been a policeman to deal with all of the past but could not verify the violent ways of succumbing to the suspects, and one night, he was too far Goes; Jean Tearney is the leader of his hunting rebel wife, the war veteran who is involved in the city's leading disruption and Andrews No. 1 Nemesis, Gary Merrill (who himself was inspired by Andrews graduation)! Naturally with the premimation, this is a well-opened credit sequence and a well-planned film inspired by a well cast which includes Carl Malden (as Andrew's senior title), Tom Tully (as Tiner's motor face taxi driver's father) Neville Brand (as Merrill's main thug), Craig Stevens (violent, female victims), Bart Fried (as sympathetic partner of Andrews) and Robert F. With significant support coming from Nalan (as Andrew's toughest outgoing). Later, his methods have been warned to correct otherwise, Stevens has been disguised for several hours after the murder of Andrew Panick and Merrill's wrong track (in this case) killing police; However, Tully became the main suspect (by which Andrews and Tiarni were romantically involved), the police were fully accused of trying to get out of Maril's lair to kill himself for his own murder! Clearly, the drama is a complex character and Andrew's first-rate characterization challenge, which is usually complementary by the style of Fox Nir.
