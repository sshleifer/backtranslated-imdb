Like this Mart, he wrote, one of these shows, that after school days I was sitting in front of TV and watching. Why? Because I really enjoy it, and it's embarrassing that it's no longer in the air. Dick Van Dyke is amazing like Dr. Mark Sloan, who is a detective with a doctor, who resolves to murder his son. The son of his real life, Barry Van Dyke, which means he is joined by a largely unknown but very capable supporter cast. Victoria is good in Paul, but I've noticed that his series changed its serial. I like Scott Bai and Charlie Schlatter, but I love Michael Tucci as Norman, and suddenly he disappears suddenly. This exhibition is very entertaining with the guest guests, it is somewhat transparent like Colombo, but for every episode it always remains a bit shiny. In conclusion, a big series, two thumbs up and a 10/10. Bethany Cox's Bazar
