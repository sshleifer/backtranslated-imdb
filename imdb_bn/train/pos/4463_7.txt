The recent philosophy has inspired me to see many of the classic MGM music in the Fifties and Fifties. Anchor AWEIGH is certainly a lesser movie than Town. Do not like songs, not chemistry in characters. But the film nicely interferes with classical features like Tekovsky. And the Hollywood Bowl scene is raised from the thighs above the top of Cinnetra and Kelly, and then step by step step by step step by step step by step, step by step step by step, step by step step by step, stepping in from step-by-step, which is more famous with Kelly Jerry Mouse. Classical music enthusiasts have no doubt that Pianists are playing. Sinnatra is so miserable, "I'll fall down very easily", before she loves her epiphany. Color is beautiful, Hollywood looks beautiful with its mountains and pollution free air (Can you imagine Hollywood in the twentieth century, can go alone in the mid-1940s?), And piano music is absolutely magnificent. MGM certainly had a mood for creating such a songwriter moment.
