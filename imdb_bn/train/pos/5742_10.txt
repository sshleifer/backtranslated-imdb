Tom Hulos * has become another Oscar-worthy performance by Dominic Luciano, a brain-damaged junk man who helped keep his brother (Ray Lit√§t as Eugene) through a medical school. <br /> <br /> It must see all movie lovers and all lovers and people of life! <br /> <br /> = From small audiences to Iraqi dance, "Oh, jiz" in repetitive words whenever Nicki is in a dam, Tom's performance is incredibly nice that you should remember that it is an actor on the screen!
