This is a small fan film that proves to be a new movie preview, which includes Batman and Superman! This is a movie that fans worship at places like Comicon and watch the clock and make the same person who created Batman: Dead Indy, Sandy Collora. <br /> <br /> As far as this image goes away, I can easily pick it apart. Not sure the effect of CGI is perfect and the costume is far from perfect. However, it was made in a shoe budget and it is incredible for a fan film. I was particularly impressed by Bob Superman - he was not a little boy! If this is only a real movie preview, they will be seen from here to the audience up to Omaha. Great job
