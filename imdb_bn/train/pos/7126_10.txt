This movie resonated with me on two levels. In my childhood, I was brought out of London and was hired in a village unwillingly. Although I was released from the bomb attack and had experiences that made rich memories (for example, singing a night for the first night in the night) and I could never have stayed in London, I missed my family and were worried about them. Tom is an old man whose wife and child both died and lives alone in a small village village. Like an old man who is not married now, whose children have married and lived far in another province, I am not alone again. Religious Studies with a very strange idea of ​​raising a child's mother. Due to the deep affection between the older Tom Oklow and this little boy, Tom went in search of him and finally he was rescued by him in a very strange and dangerous situation. Due to some bureaucratic regime, there is a great tension at the end of this story that the child will lose a person who has developed a loving relationship with him.
