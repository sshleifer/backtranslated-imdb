When it comes down to the fairy tale, Cinderella will cry most of you. Poor Cinderella is a girl who stole all her life with the evil and ugly classmates and slave driving step-mothers. And thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, we could testify to the animated Cinderella. <br /> <br /> Before the story begins, Cinderella and her parents are lonely, and richer than their needs. To share her wealth and give her daughter some sisters, Cinderella's father married a woman, but soon died soon after. Mother, the dollar sign in her eyes and her lady smoker sees Syndarla slavery. <br /> <br /> For many days, Cinderella is the slave of her parents and her sister-in-law. But thanks to her hope, thanks to her friends, the house mouse (sounds like Cinderella is not with the whole deck). She hopes that one day she will get her princess. The state's prince needs a girlfriend when the opportunity comes to an end. <br /> <br /> 9/10
