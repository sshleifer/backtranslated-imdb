I am Italian and I have seen this picture recently when I was amazed at its beauty: for the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it, but today I can be grateful to the adult's mind and feeling. Now I understand that it was a wonderful work of the special season of Italian cinema (Pasolini etc.), that time has gone. <br /> <br /> Hollywood epic movies are good for fun ... Perhaps this 'Odyssey' was not an English version because not enough fun ... pop-corn and coke is not suitable for the listener. But Homer's Patos and Existential Reflection <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < You can find it to share some files, but it is only Italian and without subtitles. Very bad: The dialogues and voices of this movie are also great.
