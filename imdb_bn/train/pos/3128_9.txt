Grainy! I love it Corny - such TV shows almost 40 years ago! Adam and Birt awakens chemistry on the same screen which never seems to be left! They revive old memories, as well as in the 1960s, their performers show some back-scene scenes which are quite interesting In the 1960's, the television was open to many of us and this DVD is no exception, if you are familiar with the original TV show. Written boofs and battle scenes with the left or whatever superb !! The movie theater shows the clues of forgotten villains. Finally Frank Gorsin creates a look. I did not take much time after producing this DVD, I believe, so he came back to play a villain near Adam and Bart, many of his achievements, as he did with Batman and Robin many years ago. He does not lose his touch! Thanks to Julie Numar, a villain role was played again. In conclusion, I think this DVD is a memorable memory and I thank both Adam and Bart for their memories of coming back and remembering us - !!! Thanks guys !!!
