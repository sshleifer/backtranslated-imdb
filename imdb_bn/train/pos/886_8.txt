I recently bought a set of six sets of "FrenchFilm" in one of the DVDs to brush our French before our planned holiday in the beautiful Provence this year. So far, along with our progress in French, we are increasing our perception of French cinema. <br /> <br /> New winds in the story of Hollywood, expected, strangers, crash bangalop drifles. Screenplay is a good example for writers, actors, directors and filmmakers to follow. It was also stimulating to see two identifiable characters in lead role without being impressive magazine cover statistics. <br /> <br /> I slowly build up other characters about this image and build up the character and plot which guides you how to end it. Is there a genuine love in this selfish slave that he will show his former helpless adviser continuously with the humiliating behavior that any former ear will show? Does our poorly depressed little half-deaf heroine prove the answer to her dream and the fate she gives to her? Visitors are stimulated by these questions and the actors express their answers slowly and firmly, because they face events that challenge and give each other their feelings. <br /> <br /> Once you see this movie you want me to see it again. I still have to work for the director's mental purpose for sub-plot in the role of parole officer and work fine on camera to look at some second-hand look. Plot asked for a little imagination when our hero's office is given the opportunity to help us abuse and overworked heroine. You will be spreading his bright lips and believing in how some action takes place. But if you go for an exciting journey with this example of French cinema then there will be more than your satisfaction. Five out of four stars for me
