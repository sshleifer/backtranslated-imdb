I am most remembered about this movie that it was used in air in the local KTL TV (cir. 5) in the middle of the 70's in the mid-70s, especially the true story came closer to Christmas Eve. . It was always annoying to see that this girl goes through the hell as the only surviving person to crash into the Peruvian forest. In this graphic scene of this young girl, there is a great impact on young viewers by highlighting the lee out of their infected leg. Like most Christmas cheerleaders, I did not use it for the time being. Definitely do not produce a Rankin-Bass.
