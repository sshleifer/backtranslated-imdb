The infamous pre-coded movie, is a film that really strengthens the Haas Code. Barbara Stanwick is the star of a young girl, who has no problem pimping him to sell his wine to the father's customers. When he died in an accident, he could get his new body whatever he wanted, with that knowledge he was released from the world. He went to New York and climbed the corporate ladder, riding one bed at a time. Although apparently no actual sex was shown, the film is quite lazy. Unfortunately, after the initial shock value fades (almost a Stanwick inspector screws in Stanwick, so she can travel for free), the film became a tad repetitive and dull. Stannieck is the only thing that holds the movie that is sitting. As always, he is fantastic.
