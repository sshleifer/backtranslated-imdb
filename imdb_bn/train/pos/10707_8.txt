For a movie that gets little publicity, and some people have heard it was pretty good. It is one of the modern British criminal films quirky ("snap," "sexy beasts," etc.). It is not wild like "hijack", but it is interesting and has some rough characters. <br /> <br /> This is a little more precise finish but at the beginning of the show - not late - there are some obvious twists on it, very interesting for the first time viewers. Basically, it is about a low-end British man who sent Russian "mail order deaf", who provided some great surprises by supporting two Russian male friends. <br /> <br /> The co-star of Chaplin and Nicole Kidman, and Keenman's Russian quartet is very similar to Vincent Castle and Matthew Cassovitz. It's a different type of film and well-played. Kidman again proved that he was much more than just a beautiful face.
