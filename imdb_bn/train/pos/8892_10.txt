Great, great, great! The movie I can talk about, but I want to send at least four lines so that I will describe it in detail. The cast was awesome (Jerry Okonel was pretty!), The music was excellent (the cultural music was the best music ever, the emo), the historical content was interesting, and in the same way, the '90s actors seem to be in fact they were 60's. And most - the story of the main character brings tears to my eyes, and the greatness of any drama. But in one word: Great!
