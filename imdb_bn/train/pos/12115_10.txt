Another comment about this movie is a shy word. The given pictures were so new - I think the script was well-liked and played. Davis was so young and fresh. She still found out her own style that we had anticipated. Yet it is good to see him like this - still learning to learn. <br /> <br /> A lot of clich√©s came from this picture, and it seems that this image has shown some direction for the next 70 years. My vote to see it and remember how young such films were. Since 1934 and how we see the first part of the last century as shining, the characters are surprised how disappointed the characters are. I love it and hope you do not affect your mind about it. Negative and one note comment by others.
