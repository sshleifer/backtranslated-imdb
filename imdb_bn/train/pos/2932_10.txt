I've seen my fair share of comedy and standup movies but it's a very real, so fresh, it will surprise you why you've passed straight to the video store. Murphy has some fantastic raunchy jokes but this pass is very funny. If only each movie can be fun. It should be called "107 minutes of the incredible comedy". "Murphy is a gimmick in this movie and will tell you" This guy said. He is talking about ice cream man, throwing a shoe mother, his aunt, racism, and what you might think and what other things can do. If you see a comedy in your life, that is, if only all movies can be confusing.
