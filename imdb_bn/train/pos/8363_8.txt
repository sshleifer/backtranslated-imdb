This is one of the best classical Edgar Wallace films in the German series - it's the most enjoyable Wallace Crickle Flick film of 60 years, in the original way, all the basic features are highlighted: Although his majesty, Mr. Kinski, still you are missing Joaquim 'Blackie' Fuksberger, yet again Acting as the 'American' cute American, her oldest Eddie Audeot is her best (A Just as color standard) role - cool, sophisticated British Butler - and you have (it is a little bit longer), so radioactive Lowitz still dry, ironic (and thus: highly entertaining), the police investigator. In addition, you will get a weird and very relaxed 'evil guy' offer behind a frog mask (hence the movie title!), You will get a crazy-out swing soundtrack, classic B-movie action scenes, partially closed wildest views (Grace Remind the time of its source!), Screaming quinns shouted and ... all elements are authentic German Edgar Wallace Cam A sweet Tastein cocktail in the pane drops well - highly recommended !!
