"Coach" is a TV series that does not really fit into any section. Part horror, part comedy, some social awareness, and what we have is that I think people were not ready. It's really embarrassing that I started watching these shows in Chiller Networks (I never really saw), I realized how different and interesting it really is. <br /> <br /> Calling Daren McGavin as the reporter of the International News Service, Calcutta and Salmon Oakland, as his always angry Buddhist, Tony Vinceenzo, the show follows the exploitation of the Chicago News reporter, which often does not happen. A part of his story, as he searched for the wind city for the modern day crepe, which became bumper in the night. Macgavin's underlying charm really sets aside the show. Some fools, who always wear the same suit, you can not help him but love him. Her trick is great, and her and suspect editor, forward behind in Oakland, humble hilarious. <br /> <br /> The story is quite good in most cases, and the acting is very good. There was not a great * time for 70's special effects, and the show is suffering for him, but if you suspend unbelief, then what you have is a fun series that was earlier.
