I did not know anything about this movie and it is similar in Billy Eliot (2000). Both movies are built around a troubled father / son relationship. In both movies, the boy does not want to follow his father, below the dream of a good life away from the mines and their home town. Both boys face ridicule by their classmates, and both of them are powerful female role models who teach them. <br /> <br /> The main difference between these films was found in October Sky is an infinitely attractive and sensitive movie. Laura Darne performs an ongoing performance and Chris Cooper played very well because the disrespectful father went to American Beauty (1999). Joe Johnston surprised me with his fine instructions, and was different from his other guided characteristics such as Zumanji (1995) and Jurassic Park III (2001). <br /> <br />
