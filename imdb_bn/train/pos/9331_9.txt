This picture was last week and although at that time (about 6) the quality of the movie was almost never good (at least here on Mexican TV), I could not stop the TV. Madeleine Moore's story really touches you. She did not come across as a very sympathetic character in the beginning, but saw the whole movie, you just want to make her so successful. This picture really leaves you thinking. And I think mainly because of Brooke Johnson's great acting. I have never heard of him before and did not know him in any other movie, but it was a great acting. Complimentary to Brooke I hope to see him in another movie soon.
