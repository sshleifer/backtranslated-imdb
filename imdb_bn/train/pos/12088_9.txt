Hardcastle and McCormick are an excellent TV show. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is predictable like the Dwarfs like Hazard, Hunter, A-Team, etc. <br /> <br /> This show is just clean tidy television. The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite fun. They often take jabs in one of the other ways, which adds a great deal of listening to the show. It has several car chargers in almost every episode, but do not enjoy a good car's chase? Especially with the quote! <br /> <br /> I just create clean television just like them, I highly recommend it!
