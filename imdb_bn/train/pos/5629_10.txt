I like this nice movie Farrah Fawcett played part with incredible and good heart. After attacking a stranger, a woman played by extreme steps to protect herself and her friends plays. After refusing him, the police realized that he was on his own. <br /> <br /> One day when he entered the house alone and entered his house and attacked him again. To call the police or to find him, he was forced to spray his eyes and was arrested in a fireplace. <br /> <br /> I think there is a need to call the laws awakening the land. They are very easy on these criminals. It's time for more harsh punishments.
