I noticed that many people who posted "karqing!" The board seems to hate this show, which I actually find very amazing. I think it's a show for the best British kids. It's embarrassing because it's so funny (if there are some chassis sometimes) and has great characters. The main character is a little bit like Dell Boy, but a lot more smart. He started online business with his best friends and took the nickname "Rudby" and tried to make one million pounds for his soil. His friends Semu (who likes to cook) and Danny (who is a simple psychic and comic relief character) Over the show, some characters have left and new has come, but it has always been the entertainment and improvement.
