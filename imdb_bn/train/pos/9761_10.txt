Now a film from my childhood is here, my family tape is used; But it overtapped over types and lost over the years. Now I was fortunate to see the full picture of YouTube.com; I love this wonderful movie when I saw it as a child and once again (online), I still do. My favorite song from the movie "Candy Heart and Paper Flower" (I always remember that sweet song forever). <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see credit for the first time (who was animated), some of the animators who came back in the 1930s (like WOW! 47 years old).
