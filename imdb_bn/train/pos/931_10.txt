I enjoy all the editions of this story but this one is my favorite time. George C. Scott Scrooge gives the depth of character that does not give others. It shows more about why the film becomes so bitter. Changes in the slogans are shown slowly because they face various ghosts and events that they see. <br /> <br /> This picture contains the best Tiny team. She is more like the other film, rather than acting as a teenager, rather than the right age. Anthony Walters still has most of his teeth in the tooth. <br /> <br /> Wonderful as David Warner Bob Crutchit. He is such a versatile actor. He portrays a man who clearly loves his family. He does not play the role of honor, warns an intelligent man under Scorgasam, but a man who is satisfied with introducing his family. Susanah York and other actors make a delicate job of bringing life to the characters. Edward Woodward is the greatest ghost of christmas present at all times. Often he is acting as a jolly Santa type character. In it, he showed anger on Scrooge's attitude and really reconsidered the scugge. <br /> <br /> Dress and set really brings time to life of the Dickens. A wonderful movie
