... heads, hands, and feet - just like a band from the past, just as weird fruits. There is a triple whammy. Those who did not like this picture are frustrated and under 40, and have no experience with the real thing. Sorry for them This is a harmfully well-known small picture which is a great way to cross one or two hours, and probably will not fade too much on the second display. Steven Ray, Tith Splal to Fatty Drama (most of the most enjoyable images in many ways) and Bill Nayyi - a new name for me - Neurotic vocalist and front man turn superficial and open eyes for some sharp acting like Juliet Ober's beautiful Karen Visually trying to hold the band together as self-reliant. <br /> <br /> Sid Barrett / Brian Wilson Echo is loud and clear, the back of the total haunts one after another, their sunny sunshine, and the script is never shocking for more than a minute. Do not compare it with Spinel Tap or The Roots or The Full Monty - it's unfair for all of them. The nearest comparison promises, and that's no worse thing. And the memories of the Bloodwife pig can remember any movie - a band I never remember, but the name lives - well, it shows that no one knows what they are. <br /> <br /> Thanks for a small joy, and memory. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and I have another stiff little finger; About one and a steel eye spin ... Spooky tooth ... who's ten inches? (You see the movie or the road)
