Hire and see this short (<90 minutes) work. It has got the best treatment in the moddy film - and its creator, Peter O'Donnell, agreed to participate as a "Creative Consultant". Character, and we love him, is managed with respect. The side of the spigel was the best of the day, and the casting was done very well. Alexandra Staden is physically perfect as a match in Jim Holdward's model specimens. Anyone throwing him out to find an awesome! Rafael Garcia's young Raymond Cruz is also excellent. I hope with Tarantino and also. Looking forward to doing more - I want to be particularly interested that they would like to be the extraordinary Willie Gervain!
