I've seen this movie many times and I'll tell you, I've enjoyed it every time. This is my opinion Belushi's muddy movie. Belushi and Lovitz are very likable and recognizable with the general public that you can not help but once you start seeing once involved. There are big stars in these movies, some were already big and the others were just starting. It is considered as a good movie, and it's exactly what it is. This movie teaches you that life is not always so bad. Sometimes you've been obliged to do what you already have to look at the stuff in a different perspective. When you see done, you will appreciate your much more and you will smile. You can not ask for more than a movie in my opinion, it does not mention a ridiculous movie and you do not lose interest. Here is a very scary movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings from me: 10 I'm out !!!
