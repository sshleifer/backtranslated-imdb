I completely disagree with other comments posted on this movie. For example, if the film is a gay character based on the book and the author can have a gay character in it, then how "Hollywood" can be a token in the movie. And besides there were two gay characters and I think they reflect each other. One was normal and the other was more feminist but it was not at the top. And Diane Keaton has given a wonderful performance and if other critics actually have the right maker to watch the whole film, they would see their character interact with other characters through filming. For example, when he and Adam looked at the car by vandalizing cars in Jonkkard, you could come out of his mother's house and later you saw that he was also very unknowingly. But if you're defective about gay characters and characters, guess that this movie is bad. But if you think more openly and I do not know what's really good, you will enjoy this movie.
