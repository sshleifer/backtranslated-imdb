The United States is still fighting with World War II (this movie was released in Vi Day and VJ days). Any of his studio salts are also making war movies where the fearless American soldiers defeated the enemy, or generally the Americans were singing and dancing. When America was on the day of technicolor music frustrating, everything was shocked. Most of the musical instruments of the day were just a bunch of musical numbers that together waste the time to fill the next song with the best available plot! I realize this feeling that the person who reviewed this film was born after 1970. How fast we will forget <br /> <br /> This picture was called "Jos√© Itbari's Quest" but now everyone is wondering why. Allow me to explain. His arrival in America since 1929 - until his death in 1980, Interbie was one of the great pianists on the stage of a concert. In 1942, she agreed to make several films, but Hollywood was after her for almost a decade. Not only was an excellent pianist, but a successful guardian, Itabby had been a house for more than 40 years. <br /> <br /> The scene that Itttarabi and 17 Pianists play in one of Lizget's mockery was initially planned - and did anyone ever see that the other Pianists were all children? Joe Passartak, who wrote this film and many other MGM songs, made it attractive to the American youth in credit music. There was an audition switched with Ietabur in Grace's movie, but it was not unlike in real life at that time. Everyone wanted it again. The joke among the soldiers was "GI" meaning "Gettin '" (he did many concerts in the military base). <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly was a wonderful dancer and Frank Sinatra was a great singer, but during this movie, Sinatra was 30 years old and under the contract with Columbia Records, only four years ago. Kelly was already well-known as a dancer, but then it was a global sensation for 20+ years by Iturbi. <br /> <br /> And as the lack of a conspiracy, Americans did not need plot. They were tired of war, they were sick of fear for their loved ones and were worried about the future. Their happiness, hope and confidence were needed that the work would end in the end. They need music and smile and joy and romance. It was needed like this movie and others. <br /> <br /> enough talk. In the mouse dance, the film's best scene is accompanied by "unconscious" songs to others, including Sinatra and Itaboo. <br /> <br /> If you have interest in Jose Iturry, Spanish who has won more, keep America together than De Soto, Cortez, and De Leon, drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you have a plot summary You can get quotes from the "Day" review from the movie reviews, and this picture and some other MGM 1940s musical instruments, as well as it's a biography and Itibber's Diskography. <br /> <br /> Trout
