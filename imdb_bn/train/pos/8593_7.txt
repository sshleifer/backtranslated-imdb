Sentinel shows a kind of matching and clayed suspense / mystery, but it is extracted with some good acting and taut pacing. Most of these stories have already gone through many incremental actions that we can bear, so what we have kept is how good the performances are, the setups and how bad the boys are smart, the main plot etc. are designed. ..... So the Sentinel is a difficult task it provides content. Both Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland maintain some good screen courage and attitude. Eva Langaria (the first time I saw her on screen) brought some satisfying support. The whole story of the story certainly undoubtedly pushes down, but it is frustrating. If you like genre a viewing price.
