I am disappointed that the Reiser (who wrote this photo) felt the need to use so dirty for any reason. Perhaps the idea of ​​his "adult" film, with a smile of a bathroom, was thrown into a lot of ugly words? I think better than this and think of him less for this movie. <br /> <br /> Some of the potentially important themes, as well as some moments of acting and some moments, gave me such a high rating. <Br /> <br /> It can be a good movie for adult children to see and laugh about their own folks and their foibles. But the lack of consideration for the audience of the family can be a family movie which is severely hated but fails. Of course, the money is not worth the cost, although it can be a free watch for television.
