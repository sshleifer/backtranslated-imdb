The "Undo Forum" seems to have expressed many opinions among contributors in this forum. Imagine, this is a movie that promises negative on gay life, since most visitors expect and anyhow it goes from a promise to the spontaneous outlook of the young's soul. There are ways to stay with us even after the movie is over. This is a characteristic study about a characteristic study that involves how a young person is involved in a relationship with a different person than that, which, in the end, confuses, hits and depresses when he does not do anything according to the expectations of his relationship. /> <br /> <br /> If you have not seen the film, you probably want to stop reading. <br /> <br /> Photo director Sebastian Lifting from his story tells Matthew's view. Most of the viewers seem to be unaware of the film in different times, but there are some instructions which are not clear, as anyone can see, retreat in retrospect. The story is said in flashbacks which will be seen by some people in the movie. This story feels lost to Matty Cedric, and a story about ending their lives together. <br /> <br /> First, Cedric, handsome young man follows Matthew, until he succeeds in believing in him. Likes him Mathieu too feels the attraction for Cedric. We can understand how Cedric Mathew teaches the family how young people are not for him, just how young people are different. On the other hand, Matthew, who wants to be an architect, looks at the abandoned place where Cedric has taken him. As Matthew, we see, reading from the guide book, Cedric's attention is needed. <br /> <br /> When Motiur comes to his mother, he wisely talks about the importance of continuing his career. He also mentioned about what to be both together in the future, which is proven to be true. Mathieu seems to have learned its lesson, hard way. He took an uncertain life with Cedric and tried to take his life. We see him in the hospital who is talking to a psychiatric patient, who treated his injured soul. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> That is why when Matthew finds Pierre in his home, it seems difficult to imagine. Nevertheless, Matthew probably found the way to be explicitly interested in Pierre. The last scene in the beach, when Pierre and Matthew roam the sand, there is a sign of hope that some of them would be better when they saw a small boy, apparently lost, but then he understood the father. <Br /> <br /> Jeremy Elkim makes Matthew one of the most complex characters in recent movies. This is a young person who is easy to understand on a simple level. Matthew has suffered a lot, first with his parents' separation, with losing his depressed mother and Cedric. Stephen Rideau, similar to the shallow Cedric, is also well-known on other important French films. <br /> <br /> When "Oon Ayean" shares the opinion, filmmakers claim to see it due to complexity. Care Sebastien Lifshitz tells the story.
