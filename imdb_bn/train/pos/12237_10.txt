Mating games are a charming, wonderful wonderful movie from an era. Hollywood needs to consider a charming remix of this movie. My wife and i want to see it <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful romantic comedy which my wife and I saw AMC. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall is his best in this movie. Debbie Reynolds is always as great, <br /> <br /> Love it. We're planning to order the DVD to add to our growing collection of movies. <br /> <br /> It does not make much of Hollywood and such a movie. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for some of these scripts from old safe while updating them, updating them somewhat (how you've been involved with remixes other than original movies and scripts), and keep a casting call. <br /> <br /> On a remix silver screen, DVD and cable / SATTV will be a big hit. <br /> <br /> SN Austin, TX
