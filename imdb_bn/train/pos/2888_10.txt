Any adult aged enough to sit in front of the screen will be completely influenced by the beautifully drawn picture and wonderful music to write this heartwarming and ridiculous rehearsal of Grimm's Praise. They will start singing 'BBT-Bobby-bu' even they can even form a complete sentence and sing it till their death day. It is a classic for all children, especially the heart of adults who are young.
