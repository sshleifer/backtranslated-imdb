Aggie (Diane Keaton) is an acquaintance and award winning author with a lovely face and an independent spirit. Hugh smiled. She convinces Aggie to become her fianc√© But, in the politics of the world must devote its principles to the world, where things do not always seem to be? And, will he be able to prevent bleaching of strict media? This, mostly, is an excellent romance for those who love fond tales. Hugh and Aggi are absolutely love and a good look at their barbarous and conversations. However, although the film tries to show political life in reality, it does not succeed completely. Do not miss anything. Production standards are high and scripts are written very nicely. With these benefits and handsome people of Keaton and Harris, those who sit in the film can see good entertainment.
