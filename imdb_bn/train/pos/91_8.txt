Usually it was a good movie with a standard ending; The acting was spectacular and the letters did not deviate from their people. I especially like the plot, although you know what's going to happen, it still has the element of surprise through the whole movie. Anyway, I'm coming to the end it may be a bit more (possibly extended) - I think it's a bit bigger; As the author tried to take line off line before the rainy season. For example, what happened to Tristan's brother Hayden? We know he died in the hospital. Maybe he was the one that setup the whole thing ?! Who knows! Maybe a signal? may be? If so .. I can not wait to see it.
