This is one of my two or three favorite stews shorts, and undoubtedly the best performance with three of Christine McEnter. He is good in a number of other shorts, but here he is absolutely bright. His singing is not funny, in fact it is humble, but the plot has been created in such a way that it laughs rather than singing. We hear in MacIntyre that the voice of Spring is not less than three times, but it does not get old, because we do not tire her voice, and partly match it with the stigge. In a comedy, the use of the operatic Soprano is reminiscent of the role of Kit Curliss in the Marx Brothers "A Night of the Opera", but much more part of the comedy here than the song "Opera" and McInterrey. Here in other performances) Carlisle never showed a ridiculous talent of her own. Stooges' buffoonery, singing of McIntyre, and a well built plot 5 out of 5 stars.
