As I started out just "byte" one night, I was thinking, "Yeah, why not?" I'm glad I gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> "Bate" is not perfect. It is unnecessarily scorched and sometimes stupid. But overall, this movie works. All the elements are okay, and they pulled off what's otherwise been a beautiful ugly film. <br /> <br /> Most of the sounds, due to the jammy fox I do not know who has tagged Fox for leadership, but anyone who made the film a great benefit. Trustworthy and surprisingly preferred, Glide through Fox Films, Smooth like butter and fun than hell <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Again, they could burst without any of them, but it only makes things better. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught the right night on this night, or the opposite, but I'd give it a 7/10. Bravo, Messier. Foxx
