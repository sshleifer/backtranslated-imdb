First of all, no one can understand why this movie is so bad. This is not the first real horror movie for me since a very long time, which is extremely difficult with the horrible decades of long history of driving through a dark road (ghost train) driving as a child. Second, the main actress Cherie Christian is a face that hopes to lead you to the main photos of the future. Thirdly, this woman is very nice that I recommend that the directors of Cameron Diazes, Eva Mendesas and how these names of these bulky light bulb retire forever. Mrs. Christian is not a light, but a sun. <br /> <br /> However, "bold remains" is a remarkable meritorious value. They believe that the photographs show the creators of the intermediate state between their non-visible reality and "imagination". But I have never seen in a movie that the animal is visible only for certain people and for some time in photos. This means that the image is not merely a symbolic representation of the reality (no reality becomes a sign), but becomes an alternative form of reality that can change as a "real" reality. As a sign, changing the picture means that it affects the photographs, such as the sign that acts like an object. Now, perception is our normal world, it is common to see signs that change. F.ex., if someone grows up a bird, his picture will show him with a beard, except as it was before. But on the contrary, the change of object by the signs means that the beard is the first with the beard and only then the beard grows on the human being. This film is very easy to publish pictures of main characters in prison. It's new, and we must be thankful for something new in New York, which usually repeats and revisit only the well-known cable influences and features from silent times.
