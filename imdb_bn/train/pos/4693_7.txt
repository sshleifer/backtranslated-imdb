Johnny Dangerously completely falls into the Hit or Miss section and gives no idea what a complete script or complete lack of story. But that point, right? <br /> <br /> Cast is preferred; A great comedian by Michael Ketan, before taking himself very seriously over the years. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Pispopo, Marilyn Hannan and Danny Davito all work with enthusiasm and at least get lots of smiles from me. But here is the place to steal the whole scene, Richard Dimitri ("Ihollos" in the history of the film, shouting the word) as a gangster who hired the best in English language murder. <br /> <br /> I've associated many childhood memories with this movie. So I've seen it quite often so I tend to enjoy it much more than others. Johnny Dangerously, at least a completely harmless Gangster movie, which also releases some good message about the dangers of smoking (and sex). <br /> <br /> I like it but it's hard to recommend <br /> <10/7 out 7
