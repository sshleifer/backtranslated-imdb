Barbara Streisand is a tour de ball in the story of this Hollywood. His performance and song are of one type and great movie hall is special. The scene presented by Christopherson against the wishes of the public and his unexpected audience is just one of the best examples of a great movie, with the view to turn them into a "Women in the Moon" with amazing performance. Actors can win over an audience. It's real. The scene where he recorded the green color with the best of all time .. all live, no lip-sync, very special. Streissand is often criticized for deviation, but he delivers it. He has also watched you with a royal singer ", who was eligible for Oscar and received Paul Williams forever, Crisparan was much longer than most of the film's appearances." This version of the "Franchisee" was first released in 1937 (Janet Gonor, Frederick March), I will enjoy the repetition of Judy Garland and James Mason musical in 1954. I have not yet seen the DVD and do not know its quality.
