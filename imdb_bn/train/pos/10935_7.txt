Well, I must say that it was a fun movie. Even though Dubbing was very fat, there were some strange moments in which the movie began to darken for a clear reason, I was not frustrated. The story was really interesting: the last member of the toxic dynasty will have to find out five other members and who among them can discover who is using their skills for the temple and who is using them well. All those groups who were trained at the time of training were masked, and all came back to society in disguise and changed their names. <br /> <br /> The joy of seeing militants as every member Dynasty has a different battle style: Todd (my favorite), Snake, Cat, Incognito, and Centiped. Actors are jumping all over the battlefield, and thanks to planting the camera and using a wide enough shot so that you can clearly see all the tasks. <br /> <br /> There is an error in the movie that the story continues to stretch until the first half of the first war sequence. But stick with it, and you will not be disappointed!
