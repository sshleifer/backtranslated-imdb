I participated in a filmmaker symposium, and this film was shown that we had not already seen a great movie and participated in a 40 minute discussion. Although it was incredibly late and we were tired, the whole audience really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> I personally felt that this movie was ridiculous in all the right spots, They really grow on you film.
