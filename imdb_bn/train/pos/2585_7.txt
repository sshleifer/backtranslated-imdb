Here is a rare jewel that you have not seen or even heard about it. Dennis Kaida was a hot product in the mid-80's, but in the early 90's, Dennis Quaid disappeared from the scene. In 1993, he returned to the big screen with three films, all of which unfortunately had a bomb attack. I like two movies very much, and let me tell one of them to describe in detail. <br /> <br /> "Wilder Neplum" is a crazy flashing about two brothers, Wallace (Quaid) and Wilder (Arlise Howard) ... Fire Starters: Yes they have the power of pyrokinetics. <br /> <br /> <br /> The fraud has decided not to use his power after the deadly incident, where he and his brother blown a deserted room, anyone who is unknown, Nowadays, Wilder is a firefighter and married Vida (Debra Wingar), who is under the arrest of the house, estimates, firing (see this film better understand this). Wallace did not talk to Wallace within 5 years, because Wallace burned the hair on fire during his Bachelor party. <br /> <br /> Wallace likes his piros and uses it for entertainment. She takes a carnival and is head shoes. When Carnival came to the town of Wildar, Wallace decided to reunite with his brother and found Vida, who loved Wallace! The arrest of Vider's house has been her last seen, but the wider is discussed. So, Wallace step and start fun. Brother vs brother ... fire with fire! <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some big firearms in this flickr ... eat your heart, Drew Barrymore! <br /> <br /> There are some weird, yet fun stuff in this picture, as well as song acapella singing after Wilder Fire Unit Firefights and Ward. Jim Verney (known worldwide as "Ernest") as Wallace's Red Corner Carnival friend. "Wing's napalm" shook brighter ... and shining together ... ... very far from the walls of the wall and the ashant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> See this ...
