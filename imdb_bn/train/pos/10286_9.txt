This movie is amazing! During fun and entertaining, it is deeply deep and the eyes open. I will meet it again and again. Bruce is a man unhappy with his life. She has her job and life, but she does not think that she has to bring happiness. Bruce is bitter, unhappy and annoying that his life should not be the same. As a result of this mindset, Bruce ends up losing his job and he makes mistakes with his life for what he thinks. God comes to Bruce and grants him godly power. Bruce uses this power to get everything he always wanted. After all his life, he thinks he'll be happy ... one exception. In the process of acquiring everything, he lost the person who really loved him. As soon as the film was released, Bruce learned that the real change needed in his life was not the situation, but he had real realization. This movie was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it shows you more deeply humorous life with your life which is much happier than we accept. My wife says, "Since someone knows what it takes to make them happy?" And my modest addition, "We are trying to find ourselves and those who are important, we can not lose."
