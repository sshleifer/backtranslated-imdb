Although I think the film may get raped as Anti Vietnam, but I do not think that such an incident was as honest as possible from the perspective of the trained youth who fought for this film in the film that the people did not support ... It is their fear, their Frustration, drive them ... it showed all open, open-ended, As a soldier itself, I found to be truly true in my experience of themes - especially boot camps. Whilst this film is completely shot in a very small budget, it looks great, it is very well arranged and has excellent acting and guidance. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for another Carline Farrell film. 10/10
