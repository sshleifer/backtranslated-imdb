I grew up in a Belgian and sixties. Most of the US series is shown here (original language with subtitles) and I was interested in batman first. Unfortunately, here it created "Panic Hastia" among the mothers because Batman was considered very violent. Geez, innocent comparison of that series to see today's series of punk kids. So I was able to see only two or three episodes of more than 60 years of protective mothers! I got so frustrated that I started collecting comics and bubble cards (they still got!) To compensate. I also got a view master slide ... I was interested to see Captain Crusader. All children need some kind of hero. <br /> <br /> After a few years I finally got the opportunity to see a re-run as a teen and I enjoyed it. I played it in a tongue-in-cheek when I saw it as a child, but I realized at the age of 17. Yes, I have seen the Spirit of the times in all of them now and on the internet post because they did not publish the series in the DVD (my knowledge) <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the "Return to the Cave" this evening ... the pleasure of seeing it Because it was full intensity and inside-joke. It was a delight to see Adam and Bart, and this TV movie is simply awesome in every aspect. They play their part in the series and play themselves. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to those who created this great nostalgic "festival" ... I'm going to see it again. My suggestions to all Batman fans are: see it !!! Rent it !!! Give a loan from a friend !!! Buy it !!! I do not expect to lose myself as 9/10 ... very good work!
