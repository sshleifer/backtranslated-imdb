Suddenly, with Harry Kalhan for a few years, the story 'Essential to have a chip on the shoulder' was over. Kalhan, occasionally fragile and out of place, his emotions were still steady. Thankfully, this film takes some time to develop a different kind of story, which can be read by Wendy Harry and the whole genre. The film was shortened in such a way, though it was still an excellent addition to the series, even if it got a little space from time immemorial fashion trends and New Wave music.
