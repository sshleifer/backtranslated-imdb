Not a bad film. Although I do not know anything about football and I'm not a fan, I've really won the game in Iranian movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite this law, some women try to steal, but many of them are caught and stuck. It is astonishing that any society can still hold old ideas of sex. In an interview, Panahhi said that his films are the history of history and its injustices and in the future we can see these movies and see how Iran once lived. Hope to come soon one sooner rather than soon.
