There is a beautiful and sensitive movie which is likely to be a bigger viewing capability than it. Semira Turan, second generation Turkish immigrant, Aikka, who tried to break the mold, she plays. Not entirely with her gentlely conservative Muslim family or with her generous Danish friends, Aikka's martial arts experience became a struggle to find herself and despite her family and friends, she got the strength to strengthen herself that she wanted to be. <br /> <br /> Director Natasha Arthi manages to maintain the balance of autonomy and narration, so that it does not take great philosophical conversations, and the skills of the Jian Gao dance industry stop drawing in spectacular war sequences. Ultimately, this is the stunning early performance of Semra Turan, which gives the spirit of this movie. Critical charisma and the necessary martial arts skills are acclaimed by the heart to make their personal playable. <br /> <br /> Your time is good.
