In the 80's I saw this movie again and it almost forgot it when it was on TV again and saw it. It looks like this little sleep when I saw this first, and I liked it even better on second viewing. <br /> <br /> All actors, especially Robert Duvall, Glenn Off, Wilfred Brimley, Frederick Forest, and Jason Pollen (twelve year old son who is responsible for the death of his older brother's sudden shooting), fantastic. The film has a very real feeling - a small, quiet, deeply moving family wounded with sadness. The conversation is clear but saying, and nonverbal acting outstanding. The general public psychology is sort of a simple, rural version of society but equally impressive family mobility. <br /> <br /> Stone Boy It's time to see and value emotional energy.
