The original Vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. I was interested in seeing how one of the real characters used to be working on a single cylinder. I was surprised how out of this acting. As a rule, the sequels are not as original as well with some exceptions. Although it was not a great movie, the authors were keen to keep the main themes and pawn from the first theme. John Bonner was initially an error, but he proved to be a semiconductor's decent slayer. Although I could suspect above the performance of James Wood's first one ... if you did not bring Buffy! <br /> <br /> All in all, this was a decent watch and I would see it again. <Br /> I was left with two questions, anyway ... What happened to Jack Crow and how did Derek Blish kill? Guess we just have to imagine that will give up.
