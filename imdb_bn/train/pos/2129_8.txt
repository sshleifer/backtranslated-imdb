Sweet romantic drama / comedy about Stewart and Sullivan, writing letters to someone other than the other. Naturally, they work together and can not stand up to each other. You can guess the rest. It's a complete cast (especially Sulv√°n, Stewart, and Frank Morgan) acting beautifully, it's a diverse, intelligent script and looks absolutely stunning. It was held in Budapest and shot in Hollywood, but I believe I see Budapest! Everything looks so perfect and looks like a dream. One such film is one. Do not miss it!
