An extraordinary movie depicting the cross-streams of multi-ethnic mix of ordinary people in the rural Pacific region. Fine performances, especially with the guidance of Qawmi Tahya and Dan Stove's strong instructions and writings. Interestingly, this film was written and directed by Paul Haggis, a very successful "Crash," in the same year. The pace of this action can not be as terrible as urban in Los Angeles, and the characters may seem to be better familiar with each other than "more than", but the character's personal relationships are faulty and annoying and in their "crashes" as the story of the night. For those visitors who appreciate "crash" will see this a film. Also, fans of Jim Jarms and John Causewat will love this movie.
