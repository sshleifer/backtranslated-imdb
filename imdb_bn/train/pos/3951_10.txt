I just saw this image on TV once, and it has not been repeated. It's weird when you think of the junk you repeatedly and again. For me, a horror movie is a source of entertainment, but it really scares me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Following the pretender that the dancers take his wife almost dead to death (they make him poison). He asks who are you? One after another they give their true identity. The girl who said to be deaf to her deaf was telling her, "I love Lilith, before Adam goes to Eve".
