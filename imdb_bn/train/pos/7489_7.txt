This film has a lot of strong points. This is one of the most horrific attacks outside the Logosi-Karl-Chanie Circle: Lionel Atvill, Fay Roy and Diet Fry, and the leading male Melvin Douglas. It got all the right stuff: Bat, a lot of fortifications with stone stairs, a mad scientist, dude people torch and predator vampire, the type of "Egg", a beautiful girl, even a fool-shaped Burgomister. Soft-focus camera work Moody and fantastic. <br /> <br /> But this is not really a giant film because there is nothing supernatural about "Kleinchals" ("little castle"). The plot revolves around the generic mad scientist (played by Atwill nicely), who feels his work more valuable than human life. <br /> <br /> This is not a top-level element, because the plot of Hu-Human resolution and some embarrassing bad dialogue for Dwight fries. But if you prefer B / W horror pictures initially, this is a look.
