I saw this movie when it was broadcasted on the Inactive Trio Channel a few years ago, and recently seen it again - Sans Commercial in Sansons I was fascinated for the first time, and in the second view it was even more compelling. Yes, some parts are far from perfect - the violent version of Amoit Gatiai stands like a tired body - but collectively received, 11 09 01 total success. Best of the show: The amazing final segment of the Shauhi Imamura, which incorrectly criticizes Mick Lashel as an attack on contemporary critics as an attack on 'terrorists', but now it appears as a deadly anti-war criminal; Samira Ukhamlobf's opening piece is a worrisome concern for Afghan children to maintain deep sympathy for victims of 9/11; And for the Osama bin Laden, Idris Wudodo's funny children's crusade - often a serious and successful initiative for real Osama. If Youssef Chahain's segment is fantastic, the test failed to at least remind the audience that bin Laden and Al Qaeda were originally American foreign policy and the creation of CIA, and although Shan Penn's character came out of the research, still an effective bittersweet piece of filmmaking Oliver Stone is the most important of the reactionary world trade center, and a great view is good.
