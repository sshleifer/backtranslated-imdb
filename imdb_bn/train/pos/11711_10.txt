Struggling with the life of Mrs. Patty Duk and struggling with manic depression was like my life struggle. I saw myself acting like her. We both were amazed at the resemblance of our lives to include sexual assault as a child. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the first movie premiere and I love this movie so much. Anyone who has struggled with emotional depression may get a lot from this movie. Do not think about it if its rewards or what they have been shown for. That's not the problem here. The problem was that MS Duke had an illness and fought for survival and was defeated. Mrs. Duke has many reasons to be proud of her struggle to survive the disease, which often leaves many victims without hope. <br /> <br /> They do not know until a person is fighting this illness. Hell they have lived with. The movie was successful for me because it showed the real things and how a person did frustration and mental work. It was so real ... so, so real. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Bocka
