Perhaps the most instant installment of the first season, there are ups and downs of 'Shore Vacation'; Some parts tend to stretch for a long time and others spend an unexpectedly short, but no one can deny it, but they can throw everything at all, but the prominent kitchen sync refuses to create an entertaining episode. After the extended journey of duty to the crek and crew, the rest of the rest of the people have left the rest for the rest of the day as the perfect planets are available for the holiday on the shore. With beautiful scenery and an ideal climate, it is present for all purposes and objectives as a deported world. The first directive is to follow Alice (from Wonderland) in the lower part of a large white rabbit when McCain leads a leading team. Kirk beams down and other similar findings and encounters reported in other findings. The only common thing among them is that every crew member thinks about the person / space / things he has discovered before discovering it. This does not immediately sink with Kirk or anyone else. The philosophy of Don Juan, the Siberian Tiger, the WW2 fighter aircraft, etc. has been more curiosity; Kirk Ruth, a fantastic old girlfriend (of course) and her academy day, met with a rap from FINENGEN. Chess / battle scenes with Phenenganan take a lot of time, but at the same time, McKay is run by horses with a horse and apparently killed. Finally, an elderly person is shown and explains what is happening. The planet is a futuristic 'amusement park' where visitors have some imagination to show it. Nothing lasts; McCau really is not dead. As this is explained, Kirk decides to order the shore for everyone after all. In the first season of Star Trek's first episode, 'Shore Lev' is like 'It was all dream'.
