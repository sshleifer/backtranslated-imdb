I was hooked to the end from the beginning. Comes from the Great Awful Boring Imagery and Organic Shocks which are not made that are not ready for you to jump, but what do you see "F * ck?" All other commentators have summarized this movie, so I will not publish what I have already said. I was telling other people after this movie that I still saw it because it still scared me. I saw a bad dream after seeing it, and I am not easily disturbed by the triangle like the real horror fan, "The Grange" or even "Silent Hill". Did I give those bad dreams that I thought I would do if I lived with that son in that cell? What will be my personal horror? My subconscious took me there, and it was not fun. That's not a good horror blow to my friends! The best part of this movie is fine. It is not about Bogeymen that you, foreign attack, or jump out of pieces. It's the opposite. You make your own mind awful. The hatred for four characters is that the horror does not come from an external force that gives them strength. Only men want one thing they want, and they get it ... but they do not imagine. So on the one hand, they can get what they want from a secret book, but ultimately they do not want to. Sometimes the closest to a prison cell is the best place!
