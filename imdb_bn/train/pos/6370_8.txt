To my surprise, I really enjoyed Disney's latest animation installment. The film was greedy, but overall I felt the story was strong and the letters were easy to relate. It was also pleasant to see an animated Disney movie which was not a musical instrument. I was about to push the limit with Tarzan. Thankfully they gave a rest to the music thing. Another interesting feature of the picture is that the comedy did not bump completely (a la herculus), but rather fine, so it still makes the kids laugh, although adults are not easily shameless or easy fools. <br /> <br /> There was a disappointment animation. When all the great animated films come out of Disney studio, you think they move along and catch a little. Have something to say about tradition, but imagine the possibilities of the Atlantis story! Overall the movie was entertaining, and of course a trip price of multiplex. <br /> <br />
