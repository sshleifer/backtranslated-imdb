I ended up watching the first disc in the 4-disc (26 episodes) associated with the UCLA Film and Television Archive (Sara's Entertainment, Incorporated). So far (along with 1st episode), the quality of the picture is quite good. The DVD box is shown on the IMDB title page. <br /> <br /> Just as I saw, the charming (then 5-year-old) and Wali Cox truly respected this role. If you are in a mood for a silent joke, which opposes to tearing you off, you will reduce this opportunity to enjoy all the wonderful characters you can remember from your childhood. Although some gags are a little bit more impressive and work efficiently ... and even thorns are fun. This is a TV series that lives up to the memories of my childhood memories.
