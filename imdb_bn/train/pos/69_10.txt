I was late for one night and started this movie about 10 minutes early - every time I used to think about going to bed, I had to say something to see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie can be another simple slam dancer anti-gun film, but instead they chose to test the response to the bullet. Even better, the film keeps it with real life - only when you think that it is going to take a simple and clearly transformed way, a gap comes along and changes the whole scene of the movie. This picture does not follow the formula, it shows how other events often turn and / or affect what happens next. <br /> <br /> I am just filmmakers looking for problems with depression and much more - Columnist children were firing at them and every time the nightmare started, the wings were afraid to see him pop. Until recently they are distributing stuff like candy and now they start to realize what the long-term effects are even drugs. The story's mental illness was given several pictures, it was a mental illness aspect, it is a relative who enjoys a mental illness, I can say that the film was rusty in every aspect of mental illness. Bravo is a director and writer who obviously did homework on those topics. And for those who think of something, I can not be in a hospital (I do not want to give any details), you have also mistaken for them - I was there. It was amazing that the script was so real. <br /> <br /> Buy this movie and show it to your teenager before it's too late. One day they thank you for doing this.
