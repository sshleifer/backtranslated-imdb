Fido is a story about the more well-mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. Although everyone falls as much as the young Timmy junkie Fido eats a neighbor's neighbor. Since then, disaster happens (well, not disaster, but some chaos). Most people behave fairly with their jambi, and such a character sleeps in his zombie (very funny part of the film, not very annoying). And we can lovingly fido whatever he can. This is a very funny and unique film, especially for the genre of junky. This is probably not the least violent (no denial in this statement) of Zumbi movies. I recommend it to those who are very funny and looking for something different. I rate this 8/10. R rated for Zombie related violence
