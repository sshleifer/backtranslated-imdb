The sweet conductor manages this picture, which publishes a rich and famous lifestyle and today gives a comment on the integrity of journalism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indeed, this film will believe that these exposures expose celebrities from celebrities and have huge hand in newspapers. IMO is much more similar to celebrities and mass media and it is a "I need you, you need me" relationship. However, there is no need for celebrities in the media. However, in this millionth of the constant party social column reporter (newspaper 3) reporter Konka Sen Sharma was fired. He is shown as this celebrity maker, very popular in social gatherings. Her homosexual Abhijit and the model of struggle, Rohit (Vikram Saluja) is a good friend. He room with an air attendance ?? Sassy Pearl (Sandhya Murdul), and a struggling actress - Gayatri (her Sharma). The newspaper editor Boman Irani and the firebrand criminal criminal Thul Kulkarni are managed by The film has many changes and characters but it works in a certain level. The rich parts are thought to have become the main part, the film's power shows the most lazy along with the couch footage, the exploitation of power, and the exposure of media exposure. There is a gay face-to-face conflict or plot that faces homosexuality in all homosexuals, excessive drug use, podfilia, and police do not seem to have much to do with "face-to-face" death. The desire to be a very wealthy husband of Perl, a social dancer is involved in sexual intercourse in a car, a bad woman, all seem to be an intelligent mistake. <br /> <br /> The picture plays very well. Kankana Sen Sharma, Atul Kulkarni have no role? In my opinion a sorrow. But supporter cast is more qualified (Boman Irani is very good) This is the film that stores for me. Mr. Bhandarkar spends more ways than chewing or processing celluloid and releases the film for all bashs. I hope he focused on one or two aspects of social disaster and searched it more effectively. He emasculated social exploitation, but exploited all the spices needed for the successful film. We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood Theme Party, drugged out kids beat a Western dance dance dancer perfectly. I hope the next film of the sweet shopman will dig more of the stototed elements of the Hindi film. The film is a bold (though defective) attempt, of course a clock value.
