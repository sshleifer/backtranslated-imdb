I just saw all the movies of Miyazaki, and they are all beautiful and fascinating. But this one rises above the rest. This movie completely influenced me! <br /> <br /> I fell in love with paju and winter, and their sweet, caring friendships. They made movies for me. Of course, the animation is superb and the music completely captures the feelings of the film. But in this film the characters are burning point: they are very advanced and full of personality. Now, tell me clearly: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (including English) Subs. Although English dub is good (mostly), it is easier than the original language version. Voice is good, dialogue, everything So I suggest suggesting movie (and hearing) the way in which the movie is basically.
