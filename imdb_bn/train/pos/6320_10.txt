I wanted to see the movie because the main reason was the wonderful cast. It's astonishing to see a ton of my favorite actors in a movie. But this movie caught me off guard. It was not what I expected it was. I saw it a little later but remember I can not laugh !!! And it just was not that throwing it for me. The script was amazingly written. This did not happen every time you were about to happen. There were many twists and turns, but instead of being shocked by the whole voice of the film. Cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful. I really can not say anything bad about this movie! Spend, I have a little more screen time with Andrew Davoli!
