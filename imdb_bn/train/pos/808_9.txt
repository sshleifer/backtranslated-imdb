I just want a vigorous return, driven by somebody else, that means a lot more Yokk view, completely unnecessary. At the same time, our heroes are seen as different people: the princess does not fight with Lia and Solo, Luke feels annoying, Darth Vader is not as bad as before, and Joda is dead. <br /> <br /> But there are many wonderful things on this episode that I just can not hate it. <br /> <br /> Some spinner 1- Jabba hat 2- Order of order badge attack. 3-Emperor (now evil) 4 - Chasing at the endor forest of the spiders. 5 - The last war. 6-dark side seduction scene. 7 - Akain's return to the north of the army. 8- and celebrating the end. <br /> <br /> Some of them are good that they can tear your eyes. If some scenes were cut, and other directors were hired, this episode was perfect as 4 and 5, but still awesome. 10 out of 9
