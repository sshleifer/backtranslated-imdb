Although the film sometimes feels a bit more, it is good. Gordon refers to a style that reminds you of the styles of vignette writing. Foolish, thoughtful, satirical, quirky, and dark, this is a film that will remain with you quite a bit, begging for answering impossible questions. Nolt, Goodman and Armin are all incredible. Sheryl Lee is good as well, a role that will remind us Lynch fans of Laura / Maddy day. Do not miss it!
