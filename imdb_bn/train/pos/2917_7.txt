Although this film is not a classic by any stretch, but it is very entertaining to remember. I watched it HBO almost 15 years ago and liked the movie. It was written by "Arthur" and written by the same person directed and although it is not as funny as the movie, it shows the likelihood that Steve Gordon has reached "Arthur".
