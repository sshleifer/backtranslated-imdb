I will not claim to be Ralph Bakhshi's fan, because I am not. I only saw five animated films: Canskin, Wizards, Fritz the Cat and Lord of the Ring, and finally "Fire and Ice". Can I claim that I have found "fire and ice" which is quite enjoyable A straightforward fantasy story of the sword and museum along the lines of Conan the Barbarian, but beautiful artwork, realistic animations and animated film scores effectively give a very classic charm for this movie. <br /> <br /> The first notable animation is itself. I do not care what people are saying about rotuscoping, but in my opinion Ralph Bacchus has used this technique very effectively here. I was surprised how character movement was realistic. The type of management and photo-realistic character designs "Fire and Ice" have been made to look like big budget fantasy blockbusters compared to cartoons. Sadly, the detail level of the industry gets slightly disproportionately, especially at the end of the movie. In some scenes, only the detail of the body contours or the fabric folds and the shades on the sheets looks slightly flat. <br /> <br /> With realistic running characters, realistic steps will be followed normally. Dances were not only good works, but it was really cruel. I would be so brave to compare the cruelty of performances in the action films of Jack Snander. I thought that although there was blood shed, blood splatters were kept the lowest. Again, a great choice by the creative team that makes the viewing experience even more "not at the top". <br /> <br /> Although I can not recognize any "big name" of Cast, the actor manages to provide a satisfactory performance; Indeed it defeats the distribution of each line, and it only hamgings for bad people. <br /> <br /> What are you saying bad ?? Yes, I did. Because that story is just about right, the evil story vs better than a quality. Something really original about the story is that it seems to be a mix of pre-existing fantasy films that includes immediate combat warriors and slaves. Anyone looking for "depth" will be disappointed sorely. These characters do not get much development, and some of these are Nikon and Darkul-like one-dimensional (I've heard some rumors of some scenes that explain DecoWolf's Nikon and his mother's assassination.) The scenes are completely recoverable and they should be a level of show depth Includes final cut to add). In fact, I would not be surprised to see that the whole film was only "Tech Demo" for the extraordinary animation and art exhibition, combining the story and it was thrown out as a cake to pass. A correct "movie". <br /> <br /> The true classic of a pre-era, "Fire and Ice" really captures the burning passion of the beautiful rendering courage and mysteriousness of beautiful creatures and charming characters. It is a unique aspect of the world created by Ralph Bakhshi and artist Frank Frazzeta, which is full of appropriate steps and suspicions. <br /> <br /> can it hold on today's animated film standards? Of course not. But I usually call the fans of animation to "turn off your high horse" and give this easy but beautiful movie to you. It's really worth checking out a gem of 80's.
