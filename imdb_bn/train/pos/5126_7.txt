Urban Cowboy John John Travolta starred in one of the strong alpha men pictured on the big screen. She is a suitable child who abandons her parents' residence and attacks Dallas's big city, where her uncle Barry Corfin promises to work in the petrochemical industry. In the USA in 1980, there was obviously a growing place in Texas and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She met Debra Winger from the same background and married, but she has some ideas that women should shade their men. And when he strikes him in the mechanical play of Gilly, then a man's game, it's for him. <br /> <br /> Scott Glenn is a former criminal who is working for Geilli and this film was his breakout role. He is a real snake in the urban cowboy, he gets Travolta's goat with a sheer appearance and he moved on the winger. Travolta brings the rich girl Madeline Smith Osborn, who travels around Gillie. Despite the character, the city cowboy was really a huge commercial for the world's most spontaneous mints. The Texas community is no longer off the coast of Pisdane, but the memories survive. And the best thing about urban cowboy is the wonderful score of Country / West song which was featured in the film. I'm not sure that some songs have been written specifically for urban cowboy, but only because I remember why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially like Johnny Lee's Link for Love, if it is written specifically for this movie, it disagrees that it was not nominated for the best song. <br /> <br /> I liked the best of Debra Wing in this movie. She did not lose a trace of femininity, but she stood up to Travolta and did it in style. And this review is still dedicated to the unknown woman, who will be the first female bull-rider on one day of professional bull riders.
