I had to put together this movie very well. Over the voice was also great. I like how they overcame all their conflicts and reached their goal. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was definitely worth the time and money to see it. Atlantis has some comic scenes that make me laugh The other scenes made me sad. And others made me happy. It can enjoy a movie. Meet the crazy moment "Professor" or until the crew is collected for a fantastic journey under the sea. After watching the movie, I read the book. It was good, but the movie keeps good pictures in your mind. It's just like books. But go ahead and watch this movie!
