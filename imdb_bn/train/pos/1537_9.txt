The film takes place in a little Swedish town where everyone knows each other. Here Mia meets her parents for her father's birthday, which is sometimes a tragedy, the question will be exactly this year, and you will be surprised ... this is a very safe movie. A story that has a perfect balance of humor and seriousness, which is rarely seen. You're happy, you get hit, and basically everything in between. Finally, you can not help to love Mia (if you think that any son (main actress) is a very well-liked actress as one of the actresses / actresses. <br /> <br /> Enjoy
