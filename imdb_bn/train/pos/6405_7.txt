I thought racism and bias against Carl Brasier were fairly obsolete for the impact of Hollywood. I do not believe the US Navy is never a racist racist. I can not imagine the legendary officer, the whole commander, sometimes telling someone to deliberately throw his chief. Of course not risk his life. And above all, Chief Petty Officer was never a competitor, but WSPS as the character of Daniro. Like the main role played, a head like drunk and drunk did not reach the master chief in the first place. Cuba Gooding saved an otherwise otherwise poorly caged movie.
