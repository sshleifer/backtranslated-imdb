Very long, we can see Gandhi cinema. And in most cases, the light always portrays Gandhi as a man with freedom fighters or principles. But when I heard that a movie is being created which puts pressure on Gandhi as his father and his relationship with his son, it will draw my attention, because it is the only area that is looking at its own dark direction and at least a few people in search of it. It shows the courage to live in. Fortunately, Anil Kapoor (producer) and Firoz Abd Khan (director) did. <br /> <br /> Gandhi and white people working in South Africa and the beginning of his relationship with his wife. Charter (Harilal) joins his father to be a barrister, but when his father (Gandhi) inspires (or inspires) him to become a freedom fighter, his dream breaks. It shows that Gandhi believes more on institutional education rather than. Harilal tried to walk in the footsteps of his father, but soon failed, his inspiration towards the dream of his wife, child, and his big dreams changed his way, and then started to bother with his son and father. Finally, he defeated his father following his dream and kept his position. He returned to India but then started his unsuccessful story which grew bigger and bigger over time. I am going to read more about watching movies to catch up on the story ... <br /> <br /> Performance First axial He has given the best performance of his career till date and has completely confirmed his script as Harilal Gandhi. The scene where he reached the room where his wife reached the corpse is one where you can see a subtle actor who is hidden / developing in characters. Philosophy of philosophy is as good as MK Gandhi, and can lead a life of such a big way of life. She performed well and with quite a convenience. Shafali Tea (now Shah) has proven her metal already in bright actresses and TV serials like Kastura. Bhagaika Chawla has played well, but her candidate actress spoiled the role. Other actors also support their performance. <br /> <br /> Technique and make-up are very good and movies, especially Duo Tone paint painting was very good. Costume shows and matches in the context. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " . Also, the progress of the story and the connection to the scene can be worn for some people and critics especially, but the average film like me is enough for the audience, it is still enough to grab me in my seat.
