This production of Oliver is efficient in demonstrating the level of evil of human soul. What a wonderful story is a brilliant, invisible character that breaks the darkness, because it safely brings innocent son to his own relatives through serious dangers. Yes, although Oliver walks through the shadow valley of death, he does not fear any evil. A stick and staff have comfort to him. Finally, he is saved from the dregs of humanity. Fagin at the bottom, much worse than most. Fagin once thought of repentance in his way, but doubled, still refusing because he is reluctant to pay. Fagin Bill raises little pickpockets because he is slaughtered because he is worse than Sikes. Olyver in the middle His innocence is unsullied, but as well as untried The best is to nancy. In the absence of justice, he ignores the violent nature of Bill Six, beyond the deeper need of love. Yet like Fagin, at the potential cost of his life, he rescues Oliver from the bill and regrets his sin. The things they think are not. In my opinion, this quality makes the industry worth - unpredictable. I'll give this picture "10", but the soundtrack and ambiance of its 70's made TV were confusing. Overall, a spectacular story and a thoroughly suitable story for all the audience.
