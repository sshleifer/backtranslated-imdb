Smith again distributed a movie on his shoulder in a film about the weight of the world and his crusade, which can guide his mistakes on the right path, which will touch even heartfelt heart !!! Author Grant Neonport and Italian director Gabriel Mukino have come together and created a homepage which I highly recommend for your movie collection because you will not be tired of seeing this movie !!! I have the highest honor for Will Smith because he is not just a brilliant actor, but some may say that he has given true love for human and life, which is no doubt that he has played the role of the character (IRS agent Ben Thomas). You will feel your pain and anger, his frustration with Emily, played by Rogerio Dosanne, who was naturally fantastic. I found myself falling in love with the truth that my love was falling. Woody Harrison is also the star in this top note film. I find it difficult to write this review except plots ... See what I can say, and when you are certain that there is nothing to interfere with you, hook the phone off, sit back and drink the IRS agent Ben Thomas Ready to start the mysterious life and unveiling the past ... I would like to thank Will Smith for another great movie !!!
