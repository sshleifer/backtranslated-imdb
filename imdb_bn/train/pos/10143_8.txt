This is a fantastic episode, one of the best of both seasons. Right down for change, a story that is more than average MOH episodes, if there is anything. A man's wife is almost burned to death around a tragic car debris, which she was driving. Do her airbag, do her job. She is burned beyond acceptance (great makeup btw), and is not given a lot of opportunity to live without a complete skin corruption. But, even in coma, he dies but comes back with modern technology, and when he dies for a few minutes, his ghost appears to be very vengeful. Of course the absorption ensues, and some extremely serious killings, and, some extremely sexy scenes. What can you ask, can you ask? Well, not many things, because this baby has everything, and a very satirical end, that most visitors face should leave a smile. I just love the love of Rob Schmitt (wrong way), afraid of his fear. Excellent episode, this one I'm sure to buy.
