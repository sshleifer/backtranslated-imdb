At this age, I liked more than Naosika in the Valley of Winds when the voice of the story was very serious for me. Laputa, whose title appears to have affected the influence of his release in the United States to avoid confusion over his extended Hispanic audience in the United States, seems to have been the director's first production, Conn. Cartuish Naak. In fact, there is a dead body in the paw and immortal life - who, carrying his daughter with his arms, threw out thousands of stories and stood up on his feet, then started moving. This makes him the most vivid and delightful character to see. Fans of Nausika technicians can be frustrated by the flying bugs and the opposite technology through Laputra - the only exception is the robot. Unlike Prince Manoho and the Valley of the Forest, the Laputara theme does not directly link environmentalism. This is if it has any anti-war theme. The importance of living naturally - it is related to the flying castle, is dismissed soon to be discussed, and is not really followed. Overall, I now feel like a piece-good and a manuscript in the maze.
