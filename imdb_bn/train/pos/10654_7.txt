Hunting is a film that is really vague house, good work effect and disciplined work, it is a cast that believes that everything around them is real and that house I think the horrors of the scenes that make you jump and what happened in the past Hill House. The film has real vague moments and I like the way of ghosts in Satan, the screen and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave the right atmosphere and the sound design made voice around you. I could have done something for a little more intense. John D. Bont had a dispute with a PG-13 rating and I think he kept a little more. Poltergeist fooled me, and still holds up until I saw it many years ago. Hunting can use some more scenes of pure terrorism. The end was for me, a little anticlimactic Overall, I enjoyed it. The acting is good and you have moments that make you jump. I just fear it more to me
