DOLF Lundgren is back! Detained nearly two years in the Dolph's first film, and that delayed hidden agenda is followed. This film still marks the development of Dolf's development on his cheap trilogy of Jill Rips, Agent Red and Stormkachery. However, this movie is under the hidden agenda criteria, which was good for almost all respect. What's this picture on the side of the dolph from the previous side, it's a sense of cheesy fun. The film revived DOLF again in a high performance and it is good to see DOLF again doing its own stunts. <br /> <br /> Movie stories are ridiculous and the main B-Movie element. A former military person is now a teacher and on the last day of education, while taking the detention class, he moved into some Slovakian bad guys who went to school for a big drug contract. The film does not have any basicity, but in such a movie you need to have fun with all the cliche. If you take it very seriously, the audience will be able to enjoy it. Thankfully, filmmakers do not take it very seriously and you can think of all the activities and with prediction, this movie is so bad that it's enjoyable. <br /> <br /> where the film is given below is missed using a fairly modest budget. Better spending about 10 million budgets. It is mostly on screen with genocide and big explosions but lacks many shootouts. The opening action is okay, but then the better moment becomes more spas. There are some good moments. For example, there is a fairly good shootout for carrier and destruction of your car through school building. The rest of the shooting-out is fairly mechanical but there are lots of onscreen. <br /> <br /> <br /> The secret agenda is proud to have worked with the best Cast Dolf age. The actor was a good value for a DTV film. There are problems with this however. The most part of the actor is bad. Bad guys are terrible, but the bad guy has an enjoyable feeling because Alex Karsis plays it so much and without any hints that you can laugh at pure evil. The pieces are really good but the teenagers are playing such clichehed characters as they are. They all hate authority, behave badly against each other and of course they can learn important life lessons, but generally they are honest and specially have the ability of Chris Collins. Although this movie is all about dolph. This image is not near its best, it is not near its worst. It marks a turning point in his career. He will now return to the good shape, and his next film direct action will be even better. Dolf looks enthusiastic here, he makes all his stunts and he likes to see that he is exploded again in the movie as an ordinary man (slowly slow-mo, a lane and a large weapon in the explosion). Less mood and imagination compared to clipped films like Army of One. Looks good to see dolphs are good. For the last 8 years, Dolph was seeing a lot of fatigue in his film and using doubles a lot (although he is still struggling with himself), but new organized dolph seems to be for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is not a single surprise but it's a ridiculous extraordinary charm. **
