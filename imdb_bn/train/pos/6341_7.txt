Although I really enjoyed the latest "serious" performance of Jim Carrier ("The truman show", "Man of the Moon"), I always thought his true comedy was in the physical comedy. It is not saying that he is an extraordinary, talented actor: Those who ate academy awards seem to hate him, he did not have any (really worthwhile) nomination or award. Well, a sister named "Titanic", nominated for the 11 Oscars, should not be taken seriously. <br /> <br /> review. "The Greenwich", "The Nightmare Before Christmas", is the sweetest, best-looking, best-performing, more enjoyable seasonal movie. Both films seem to be very similar, with their highly adapted sets and christian grandparents. Both of them regard their main actors as villains (one in higher degree than others), both pack a rigid moral lesson and both are truly enjoyable. <br /> <br /> means that unless you are a doll of Jack Skillington, and Grinch is a man. But so many people are so incredibly publishers, so much fluid in their movement, like cartoons, so extraordinary, which never gets in the way of film. He may be ridiculous, he may be a sad spirit, he may be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3 dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he sings, and finally he preserves Christmas. I like this film bit, and it can not wait for the DVD to come out. This is a movie that you really enjoy for 10 to 20 years. As timeless as they are coming.
