I'm really amazed to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie. This movie was not considered as a "deep thought" film, which seems to be considered a big majority of critics. In fact, it would appear that if a movie does not change any insights and does not create a deep, rolled, minded bugging plot, then they can cost it 1 or 2. Do not delete a movie because you do not like the custom, people. <br /> <br /> This movie was an action / comedy flick, and that was its purpose. And for an action / comedy, it was a very good job. I was really surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed, never had a jammy fax fan, and the plot used was more used. <br /> <br /> This plot was not spectacular, usually when the criminal comes out of the prison and trying to clean his job, the evil person is thrown into the plot (see blue stroke, Hudson Hawk, 48 hours, etc.) but it's a little A technical curve has become hot Now "bad boys" are actually "good boys" and a "bad guy" is a uber-geek. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jamie Fox plays a wonderful humorous, at the same time intelligent and serious main character, and does not try to overcome the humorous part of the film. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep intrinsic plot of a drama like "The Matrix" or "Drama", then this movie is not for you. But if you do raw work, excellent fast-illustrated filming and a rare Enjoying a bizarre beat, but this movie will not disappoint you. I usually rated it about an 8 (the same level as the Die Hard trilio), but Instead it tries, and it should be a 10 to his score. <br /> <br />
