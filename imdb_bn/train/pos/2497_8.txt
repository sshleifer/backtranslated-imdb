In fact: drug use, warehouse shoot-up-compromise, matrix-esque bullet dodging, a future city with a mixture of Asian race and a solo vampire - all in the same movie - a story that seems to be just a Japanese pop / rock star Be envisioned by And that's just what 'moon kids', and more. For the week-long Campi B-Movie, these elements may be considered to be the perfect subject, but 'moon children' close it, but some of the expected obstacles and injuries along the way. <br /> <br /> There is a firm, definitely independent feeling, not to transition smooth from one scene to the next, rather to provide spodic leaps and bounds, to give glimpses of character life and scraping barely a true plot. But the film does not create an excuse, but instead wipes the story by betraying all the sugar-coated elements of the aforementioned elements on friendship, love, faith, and future societies, the fight of gangsters and the vampire's story. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lee-Home Wang also became friends with Sho a big up who shines as retaliated 'son'. The story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family, and through their various lifestyles and simple friendships can easily become sad and treacherous. <br /> <br /> Although, from time to time all the works are unreasonable and special effects are seen only to show that the film does not do any work, it is considered as the feature of the popular Asian singers. The superstars have their flaws as actors, and so do not have their characters. The movie gets rarely annoying, and where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. 'Moon Children' is rather enjoyable, ridiculous and even very sensitive: it is worth your time!
