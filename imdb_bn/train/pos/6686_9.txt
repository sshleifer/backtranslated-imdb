This movie was a brilliant idea. It was the original, clever writing and those of us who had higher appeal, who really do not 'film' conformist movies. Do not make me wrong - there are some great movies that have huge appeal, but when you move towards viewing a movie based on "everyone else watching it" - you know you're a twin or really an opinion. This was a lovely fine humor - probably most people are probably just looking obvious. Actors portray their characters with hiding and I think the film has a lot more "personal" personality. There is an application for children as well as for adults. ESP. Nice to find a good movie that is not filled with good references and drug innuendos! A great film, based on public spending, will not be ignored. This one will buy
