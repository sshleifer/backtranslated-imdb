I was one of those who was proud, Yankee-Doodle hoped for a day's painful photo publication (as quoted) should have been rather infamous instead of glory. How i was wrong These guys were there, in the middle, and the pictures they returned were amazing and heartwarming. And yet it happened on an opportunity tour of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a New York firefighter, especially from the point of view of young youths. At the outset we see most of these footage, only reminds us that there is no worry about a film about terrorism. It was considered as a movie about regular people who were helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it does not lose the edge. <br /> <br /> While investigating the suspected gas line (I think, that's a little lazy in my memory), we suddenly hear a flat fly upstream. The camera releases commercial commercial jet torpedoes in one of the towers. Cameraman think of this time? The camera recognizes the importance of the footage that is going on and probably understands the same thing, allowing FDNV to follow the camera in their building. <br /> <br /> See a true from the front line. We see FDNY's commitment, their responses (silence being silent after the first person's death of their dead), as well as the collapse of inner indoor buildings as well as second-camera events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Quite simply, the footage is eligible to be saved for all time. But in reality what this film sets it brings true humanity to the audience. We see the charge sheet without any hesitation, people of different nationalities help each other in the desert waves and even movie makers to express concern for each other (they are brothers) because they can not communicate with each other in a confusion. This movie has amazing sights and amazing human stories, some Hollywood may never be duplicate (though it is trying). <br /> <br /> No movie about 9/11 politics. Or is it a movie about religion, nationality or even jihad? 9/11 is a movie about the public, and the best and most bad indication of what we are capable of. 9/11 is one of the most important movies I've seen and if I had it, then the only movie to be born from this event will be. You can not duplicate this.
