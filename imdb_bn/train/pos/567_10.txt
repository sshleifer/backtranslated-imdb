Jimmy Stewart and Anthony Value have gathered together to do some of the best Westerns ever made and this is the best one. <br /> <br /> The real star of the film is the spectacular Canadian Roxy, which acts as a backdrop to the story. Sometimes some of the best cinematography in film history. <br /> <br /> Five Westerners have cast a cooperative role together with Stuart and Mann. There is no exception, there are only few lines in which the letters are firm with those lines. <br /> <br /> This film is a cruel hard-bit lone, whose only real friend is his sidekick Walter Braunen. Because of the death of BenNana, he wants to be released in exchange for the gold of the villains, and eventually, to free himself through this process. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was an under-actor with a vast range. He can play the delightful old codgers, figures of figures and a particularly nasty and clever villain in this case. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
