Fierce, well-documented documentary focusing on Mardi Grass Beads. I always liked this method of filmmaking - contact a bigger, complex, and often unknown phenomenon by increasing the problem, by breaking some of the familiar and intimate things. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understood the basic purpose behind profits and capitalism, and the global impact on poor people (though people think about it). Instead of explaining these topics and going to a subbox (there is no harm in which any such document usually promotes to be converted), this documentary shows only mangoes, wizards, how they are made, how people, and on any condition and then at the end of the process How customers use them It openly and strictly investigates the motivations of workers, factory managers, American importers, and finally, the customer involved in the process including the end of the chain. <br /> <br /> I think it's a little sick; Critics of Mardi Gras are equally, but Chinese workers have made their situation normal and adopted for the course equally (even if they have some objections to how they are managed). Street sweepers made a special impression, cleaning off the road off the end of the footage. But that was my reaction; I can see how anyone else can read this documentary a little differently. <br /> <br /> Contrary to other documentaries about this, I do not think any political opinion will be affected by you. This is ultimately a story of our relationship with mankind and the products we produce. If you've ever bought goods made in the East East, then you have to think about it. <br /> <br /> Extraordinary and highly recommended. More documentation like this needs to be seen. All the Kudos who are involved in making this film.
