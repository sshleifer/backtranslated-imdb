Indian movies identify police in two broad categories: they are honest or bad people. The honest people always shout at their voices and fight with the system when the bad guys enjoy most of the time, but they end up enjoying it. <br /> <br /> This movie breaks down this usual formula and gives a refreshing view to the police and their lives. The side who takes an internal look at a young ambitious police forehead. The music is interesting and the trend is as long as the Indian film goes on. <br /> <br /> The film gradually comes to Maya slowly when it is slow. But I can still give this 9/10 because many of its credits are first.
