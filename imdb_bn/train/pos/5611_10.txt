I saw this picture at a time when I was afraid to go to my own apartment and start my own life. Maybe I took it so seriously. I believe in the permanent building site, the dust, the thrust, the selfishness, the foolishness, the wickedness and the erosion in the mental decline of the poor character inside Paris. I give all the credit for Polanski's artwork on his behalf, playing it and in his impossible script, but I was frustrated at the terrible final scene and was revived by cognac in the theater manager's office. Thankfully, my own life has not become this destructive (for so far), but I am always respected for an artist who can perform such delusions and completely immerse himself in (fake) reality. Trying to publish. Simply tell, people are the first order a talent and a credit to the human race. This movie has many acting, great acting and great examples of great cast. Some performances in English (such as scenes with Shelley Winters and Melvin Douglas) and others (with most of the characters) French and Polanski have dubbing themselves in English and French, I sincerely recommend, if you want to be bilingual, when looking at the excellent transit in Paramount DVD suitable scenes Time switches from French to English and vice versa T. This film is part of Polanski's so-called "Apartment Building Trilogy", which includes "Barricade" and "Rosemary Baby". Unfortunately, "distortion" still did not create a suitable DVD transfer in 1 region. It is not necessary to say that three films will create a great boxette.
