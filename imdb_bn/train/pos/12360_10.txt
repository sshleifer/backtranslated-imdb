I like the film It nicely analyzes the Italian small bourgeois society, how the leftists of the 70s left their ideals and brought happy systems that they do not want to disturb. For example, an elderly psychologist who jealous his own son and does not want to remember his more fundamentalist young man. <br /> <br /> After watching the movie, long wanted to buy videos. On the big screen and on TV several times, but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market, even in Italy, none of the books in the bookstore knew about this picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />
