This is one of the best movies from Bulbul of the year. Of course this year is the best. Originally Indian, geographical, visual, heart-loving dialogue and musician and soft music makes the movie exceptional. A true illustration of Indian-based and cultures seeks the audience for its roots and awakens the mind and spirit with a new lease of feeling of pride and life. <br /> <br /> This movie enjoys a call to their imagination and philosophical sense for viewers. If you want to watch all your nerves to be animated by on-screen action, sex or violence, this movie is not for you, because you can see that this movie is not full of 90 degree twists. It's a story that can get it as easy as a movie. But where is the movie really right? One gets the real life experience, and the best thing is, this experience is one of the best in quality and hope. It is against the positive aspects of the people, against the people who have rained on God's sweep, against the revengeful films showing the contradictions, terrorists and underworlds. This is not about things and people that have gone bad. It's about that still salutation, and that keeps the world running. Of course, although every type of movies is respectful, it comes with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the people in the hidden truth and the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is an arrangement, marriage and couple only learn each other through their parents, and learn to love each other. 6 months gap between instinct and marriage is a long time, "temptation" is not full of the event, but one that the growing love and devotion of the couple uphold each other. They will learn together with the importance of their relationship and this invaluable period of their life and will work to strengthen the marriage bond. But has this been strong enough? Their relationship will be experienced only in time but the fate will be examined. Will they pass this test? That's about "Viva".
