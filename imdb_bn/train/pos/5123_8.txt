A unmarried, prominent hick (played by John Travolta) leaves the farm and goes to Houston, where he learns about life and love in Hong Kong's Texas. Face value, it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There are cowboy hats, pickup trucks, neon beer signs, and big belt-buckles and rodeos. If music is not a Texas user, then Texas is adapted for courtesy of Mikey Gilly, Johnny Lee, and Charlie Daniels Bands. And that twang Texas ... "Y'all". <br /> <br /> The story and the characters are almost as fine as five alarms pepper made with olive pepper as the taste of Texas. The civilized viewers may have enough to cancel the film for a brutal classic, an actor Lawrence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman. "Hamlet" is not it. But "city cowboy" is spicy and clear, and I like it. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is generally good. Dialogue, production design, and clothing are all realistic; Editing is efficient. And both casting and acting are commendable, if not Oscar worthy. I did not throw Trivalta the role she played, but she did a good job ... Dito Debra Winger. Among others Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson, very well, the role of support. However, cinematography seems to be weak. The film copy I saw was the vase, and occasionally was suffering from a red / orange colored edge, from the same period I saw a visual feature in other films. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the film seems to offer no social or political "message". But I will argue that when "city cowboy" was released twenty-five years ago, it was rather predictive effect. There were all kinds of problems in the United States in the 1980s, at least the US did not have US prisoners. In the minds of many people, the United States is being pushed by pushing, <br /> <br /> This image gave something other than its time, The leaders wanted to see. .. strong "Urban Cowboy" is a very physical film. The characters in it can not be the brightest people in the world. But, they are difficult! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a vehicle for cultural expression, this 1980 film has been restrained by a new tough-tough era for the United States. It started with the Reagan election in 1980. And that era is still going on with a President who does not remember for his intelligence, but will be remembered for his strengths and aggression, Americans think that Americans must be proud of five alarms, such as chili peppers.
