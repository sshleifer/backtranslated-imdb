My 2 year old Doodlebop likes to show, it seems to keep her attention for a while. Characters interesting with vibrant colors and all are interesting. The target audience does not have many educational materials that can benefit from the audience, but each one seems to have a theme and try to teach kids about sharing and respect and other basics, so I like it for it. It is produced with good production value. But these days, just like an average show on TV, only an average show We do not buy merchandise corners and we all have to wear Dooblebop. I do not think they want to spend money on live shows if they come directly to the city. Going to the zoo or the science center is a great experience for everyone and my opinion is better than money.
