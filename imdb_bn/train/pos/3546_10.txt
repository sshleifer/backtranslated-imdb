One of the best songs ever made, this is an example where producers and directors are not afraid to choose actors for their competition, rather than expecting people. Light and unique set, it gives a very interesting effect (it's a special name that I can not remember). Any contractions that are used in dialogue are unique. The movie starts well, starts acting beautifully from start to finish, interesting A real pleasure music. Finally, an array of first-rate songs that are fully edited and archived. Also, the music is very original and very memorable, and I think it is better than many musical instruments from the thirties. It certainly has more original and beautiful songs than most musical instruments, which can only be two or three. Not that bad for a director who has no experience in this type of movie. Another quality is that it is fresh fresh every once in a while.
