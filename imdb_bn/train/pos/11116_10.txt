"The Godfather", "Citizen Cone", "Star Wars", "GoodFellas" does not compare to the complex brightness of "The Soprans" above. Each and every character has the absolute truth level, level and layer completely on three dimensional layers. We are sincerely careful about Tony Soprano, true that vs. the worst model, he is evil. This point in Soprano history has created the most exciting, complex, and impressive hero. If you are in a highly challenging mood as a spectator and are forever changed to your feeling of entertainment, see "The Sovereigns". I do not want to sit and see the first episode of the first episode of the season, and continue with the series. Each season is fully bright in its own way. DVD is essential for anyone's collection **** out 4 *
