In the early 1980's, Steven Spielberg ordered Hughie Goldberg in the 1930s to adapt Alice Walker's "The Color Purple" adaptation of the fierce existence of African-American women. Seeing Goldberg's Game Selly, it's incredible that this same woman who acted like "Sister law". This is a movie that can be easily done - no, it should be - part of the curriculum of black studies and women's studies. There is a scene that can be the best editing work ever on the screen (know when you can see it). I can not believe that it won a single Oscar; It could be Spielberg's second best film "Scandalers List" (perhaps connected to it). Also Danny Glover, Adolf Caesar, Margaret Everi, Oprah Winfrey, Wilde E. He starred in Tung, Aksuya Bussia and Lawrence Fishbarn.
