John Voight Midnight Cowboy is brilliant, but Hoffman's performance reminds Rainman's memories of his next bar, this is the kind of performance that shows me the movie. As the screenplay of the New York character, New York's Ganges Bill's Biblical version of Daniel Day Lewis seems relatively comparatively, and the day does not give emotional depth that does not give Hatman its character. <br /> <br /> This is the ideal of Huffman's acting style which we've played most familiar with Midnight Cowboy. I think Hoffman has brought people around him in such a way that he showcases their performance far more than their normal levels, or 4 or 5 best actors in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> Voices is so naive that she will completely get out of the film, Ratso will drag her down - pull him down, but teach him how to survive and more importantly, how to survive. <br /> <br /> Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape and it becomes a movie to find herself. I think, since it shoots as a movie, it's a very nice message, that does not matter to any harm (ROSA clearly defines "damaged"), if you find yourself in a way to be true, you are the mystery of life, and You'll be able to share that insight with anyone else. <br /> <br /> I can not compare Cowboy to Claute in the middle of a few minutes, which seems to be like a movie to find herself that becomes a movie to escape.
