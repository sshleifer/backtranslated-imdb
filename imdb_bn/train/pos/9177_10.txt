I want to say that these small artists were the best explanation of the favorite novel "Jane Eyre". Both Dalton and Clark are credible as Rochester and Jane. I've seen other versions, but nobody compares this. The best one for me. I can not imagine anyone else playing this character anymore. Last time I saw in 1984 when I was only 13 years old. At that time, I was a bookstore and I just read Charlotte Brent's novel. I was completely enchanted by these miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episodes. I want to see it again because it is very good. :-)
