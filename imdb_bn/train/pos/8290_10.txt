This is the only example of the genius of Gen. Wilder. She wrote and played this awesome mystery. Nobody could do it well. The sensation was restless throughout. I wish Mr. Wilder please us with this one another. I enjoyed what I saw Mr Wildor, but I do not know how genius it was until he was "killed in a small town" and this follow on. What he deserves and how his writings can be reached and, of course, he firmly grasped his brilliant performance. His eloquent intelligence comes through spades. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes the mystery and / or filming of Gene Winger. Her star just gets brighter and brighter.
