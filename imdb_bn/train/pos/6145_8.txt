Mary Poppins is definitely a lot better, but still it's a lovely film. Angela Lansbury has done a lot of fun as DTT and David Tamlinson Mr. Brown as England's proponents. Their chemistry was brighter as well. Although the children felt a lot of spark, although Paul was very funny and clever. The songs were not really bad, as some would say, "Beautiful Brunei Sea" is the best, actually all the songs are outstanding. The special effect was wonderful, that there were lots of magic, and the story was quite original. Highlights, like Mary Poppins, had an animated sequence. The order of the water was beautiful, but my favorite football match, which was absolutely sunny. The only other criticism was that when I first saw it I could not finish it at all. All in all, a lovely film, that's never over. 8/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
