To find another "hot property" to adapt, PERHAPS thought of successful success of NewsPram's comic strip with the production of The Sealer (Flesher Studios / Paramount) in Pope of 1933, Pope Francis. Although it's a part of the Betty Boop series, Miss B. Short made a brief look; <br/> <br /> Today's common sense, gluff, squidy eyed, bravelin, 'Simon is perhaps one of the most successful cartoon series in a pilot episode. Existent and literally outliving Fleischers and their studio, these days lasted. <br /> <br /> Another attempt to return to the King features was no doubt there was a reason to try the very popular Henry comic strip letters in a Betty; The purpose is to find another series. Logic then surely felt the sound. Henry Hirst was the most popular feature of the PayPal line-up; Presented as both a daily and Sunday color comics supplement, PUCK, COMICS Weekly. You know, "This body is silly!" Remember, Shotz? The cruel, little, little boy, comic stripe 'Hero' and watching the antics on his screen, in relation to lonely and Miss Bettye; We were pleasantly surprised to see how exactly the character is managed. Both story and director Dave Fleischer woke up situations and eyesight, such as a comic strip that seems most appropriate for the character of comic hippies. This was the most silent vignettes to remain faithful for animated film printed pages; The Henry feature is often like a 4-color 'wax'. <br /> <br /> Cartoon title: Henry with Bennetrie Book: The Finanist Living American (Fleshia Studios / Paramount Picture Corporation, 1935) What we can see; Basically being a situational exercise; Dave Flesier fast fire, the machine is paused with the normal array of gun-like gags. In short, Henry Betty shows a puppy in the pet shop window. Henry tried to buy a little dog dog with coins in his pocket as a kind of love in Henry's first eye. She is made by Miss Boop that it is worth buying for $ 2.00 in the era of sadness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, to serve him, Miss Betty promises little dog back to him. Of course, they have a contract and betty leaf. <br /> <br /> Fleischer crew providing the opportunity to burn a whole new string of fire to clean the cage and feed the animals; During this time the bird's seed, featuring Henry's feather pot and thrust shower. (But certainly not at all, slates!) From the very beginning of encouragement to feed the public of the Avian population of Henry's shop, the seed was sown in his head literally, birds came in contact with the public; On the way out of the shop, open street mass prisons. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> BTTE returned to this point and expressed his frustration and anger with Henri's temporary custody of care. All the bits were off, no doggie for Henry He started to leave; Depressed; But soon after fixing things he believed in the owner to give him another shot. His head covered by bird's seed, he operates all the corral of little feathered animals; Their backpack bursts to their back. Happily, little fairs; But this time he has his own tender, little, face licking puppy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Our boy's lacking, power-filled, free-wheeling, Betty's kindness And the feeling of the situation and the 'boy and his dog' situation have suspicious results. Max and Dave Fleshishar gave us almost mini-masterpieces of an exaggerated comedy short. <br /> <br /> We were surprised that no Henry series followed. Judging by the fairly faithful treatment of the character, it can certainly last for some time. At any rate, this group tried to try the best pictures in many ways by Betty Boop. Although the first, Popey the Sealer (Flesiar / Paramount, 1933) was the most successful (and it was not a Betty Boop, was reserved for the Camio as a carnival hula dancer); Henry Short was much better than both of the following King features "Tryouts", Betty Boop and the Little King and Betty Boop and Short Hometown in both of 1936. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pudin graduation !!
