In his short years at Mail Torm and Victor Bourge, in his short years, the film has made an interesting look - and especially on a 30-year-old sunshine, looking at a young Sinatra and clearly stating that this is his "yes, I am a popular singer, but there is still an actor" stage Michael Morgan is an annoying, crazy presence and Jack Hally is an actor whose application has always been completely lost on me. Leon Erroll is silly as always, but fairly quite funny. 7 of the possible 10 are correct "grade", because of its positive aspects, with the lack of a lot of stories, and a stupid and antecedent concern in it - this is the best average overall. Most of the attractions are the first viewing of three entertainment icons.
