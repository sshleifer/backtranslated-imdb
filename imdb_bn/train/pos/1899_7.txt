Arthur Baach will grow up, but unfortunately he is not the only one to do. According to his very rich father, Arthur should marry some wealthy Susan Johnson or cut him off from family money ($ 750 million in value). The problem is, Arthur does not love Susan (although I heard he made some good chickens) and overweight and heft over part of the waitress and part time shopkeeper Linda Marolla fell. Arthur is an attractive colleague. He is really just born in a big baby, riches with at least one person looking after him every second every day. The work just guides Arthur on the wrong path - he likes to drink fun, nurture and, of course, drink. The drink gives Arthur a sort of Jekyll-and-Hyde complex; And that's when he gets all kinds of trouble, it's absolutely fun to watch on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dothy Moore is an extraordinary figure in Arthur's film, winning Oscar nominations and Golden Globe for her performance. Moore changes the funny line already in the fantastic, unforgettable comedic gold with curious aspects of the movie, but he is great to make Arthur come down to a relatable level and make the character the choice. Moore's co-star section has some help - Liza Minerallie is like Lina, John Gilgood, like Arthur's Batler Hobson, is not very scary. Gilgood won the best supporting actor Oscar for his performance in this movie, and why there is no doubt. Hobson has a stone-solid dry mind and stuck in attitude, but he is always looking at Arthur - and Gilgood's role is perfect. Steve Gordon's 1981 film Arthur is small and easy, but it delivers a lot of smiles.
