This documentary explores a story covered in Pigeon's latest book "Freedom Next Time" which was published in 2006. It carries the threat of native Nigerians of Diego Garcia in Chagos Islands of Hyderabad. <br /> <br /> Islands are technically British citizens, such as Diego Garcia's British colony, as in Mauritius, the nearby island where the netizens were banished. But the British government ignored their application to return to their homeland, because the island is now a military base of the United States military, which it used as a basis for bombing Iraq and Afghanistan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pigeon's coverage is frustrating, especially in the treatment of living islands and registering current poor realists. His interviews are all spherical, and his parliamentary representative voice, where he uses his information to the government, uses him as the best to plunge him. <br /> <br /> The use of dramatic reconstruction of separation of the pillar series. Recently published documents that completely illuminate the British conspiracy of the exile of the netizens. The footage weaving with interviews, and the songs of the island really enhance the effect of the film. <br /> <br /> It's not easy to see, but the "best to steal nation" is the best of Peger. Recommended.
