Bogmeister and others have quite a lot of nails. Shore holidays are really the first attempts at TOS 'lightweight Sci-Fi (which they will be perfect with classic problems with Tribbles later). It gives examples of a necessary respite from both the enterprise and its TV viewers as the result of the threat of the universe, for example, The Corbomite Manouever <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A seemingly idyllic M-Class occurs across the planet, and sends down an investigative team to take a closer look. Soon all the places of irrationality may start - some seemingly dangerous - but it seems to be a pain of the mental extremists of the wonderful combination of all the wonderful mysteries (gone through the glass shown glass), psychological thriller (kicks are striped) past From an uncertain guilty), and romantic comedy (no comment). <br /> <br /> All series of Trace Franchisees were highly serialized, so it is easy to forget among many episodes, focusing on the first season heavy transfers, potentially dangerous plays. Contrary to the next series of franchise writers, the production team of TOS was not afraid to go literally, where no TV series went ahead. And Shore Leave, her problem sometimes, is an example. My only criticism of this episode is that cast (especially Shatner - ridiculous his humorous ideas) does not seem to handle this new skeleton in the themes of ST. The last scene is probably one of the worst scenes I can remember from the whole TOS run - both logically and in terms of acting. <br /> <br /> said no. My recommendation - see it when watching the whole first season as it is meant to show - it's order
