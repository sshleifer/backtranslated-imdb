This movie was fantastic ... it makes me laugh, it creates a baul and most of it is talking about animals !! This movie should be seen by all the people! This is one of my favorite movies, and I love it so much that I had to comment on it !!! This is Rox! It felt very hearty and makes a wonderful story which makes up a great and heartening movie! My favorite character is shadow. Because I think he's the most interesting and charming. I had a golden retriever like shade, I missed him too !!! He was my best friend and I knew he would be in a happy place when he died, but I missed him with my heart! I love this movie and everyone should! Regardless of your pet's work, love for them forever !!!
