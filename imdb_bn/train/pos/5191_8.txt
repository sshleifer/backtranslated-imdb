Scott right The best two people have ever shot the dual movie in the movie, in the middle of this film. Most fight fights with combatants are not good though quite well. However, the best of Middle Warfare compared to Samurai movies in Japan. According to my opinion, the Chinese sword scene has never crossed Japan's entertainment pricing. Especially in the scenes where one man has to fight a group of enemies, Japanese movies excel, for example the Lone Wolf and the Que series. Although both of Japanese movies end only in seconds or a minute, the intensity of those moments makes them even better. But, this is one example where the Chinese sword exceeds the Japanese. The middle of this film was the five-minute long war with the most amazing dancing photography. Other fights in this movie are also good, but if this movie is sketchy, even for that scene 7 can get. If you do not see it, you have. John Wao man
