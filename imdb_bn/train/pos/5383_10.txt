I think this movie was fantastic because new producers of Corin and Sun's business It was involved in action and a little romance, but there were some points when Corrine did not speak very clearly (when she threatened Shane) gun) and she gnashed his teeth ... maybe she thought? The role of Joseph and Soni was very well illustrated and there was a clear contrasts. Also, I saw the next action star, I'm sure Corrine and Shan did their own stunts very well. I'm looking forward to another movie for this couple because they've created a great team, or maybe a beta to bet on your life - it's probably made in big apple. 'This time it may be about Carmen ... your life is wonderful!
