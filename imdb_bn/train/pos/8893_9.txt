A well-balanced mini-series in the 60's historical events and a good plot. In four debates, we follow the North American family with 3 members. But we just do not see them. We are a black reputable, leader of a extremist student and as a soldier in Vietnam, we follow many characters. Filmography is just awesome. In the first chapter, we see some shots of Vietnam War, in the scenes. The next chapter ends in the beginning where it does not start, then some time starts, giving us some secret about what happened. In general, the 60's mini series, of course, is not only for the Hippie Fantasy, but everyone will have to see a little curiosity about the subject.
