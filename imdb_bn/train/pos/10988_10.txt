Do not read anything about this movie (especially, that can not contain any spoilers). Just look at this great movie after learning something about it - and you'll really get a great experience. If you want to see an intelligent, twisted story: Go, get the DVD and you will not really be disappointed. "Cipher" is not really a science-film, but in the business environment of the world, another psychologist has established the Thriller settlement. It is about corporate privacy, how many big companies spy on each other's study departments and the methods used by them. The actor provides a great performance and a perfect mode of cooling the overall visual style of the movie. Cipher is deeper, more complex, and the ending of the story - Vinceenzo Natalie's other films are more satisfied than "Cube" and "nothing". Actually it is one of the best films I have ever seen. (And I do not call it about something that really made every fifth well). Sorry, you can not say more about this movie without the risk of hitting your experience. Just give it a chance. ;-)
