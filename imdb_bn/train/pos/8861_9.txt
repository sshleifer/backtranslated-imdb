Andy said: "Nobody gets hurt, everyone wins." Before he says it, we know the opposite truth: everyone gets hurt, someone wins. It is a new strand in American movies, or perhaps an old strand brought back at the end of the long run. Think of "east promise", "there will be blood", "no country for older men" These films are dark, serious, extremely well-made, and are not concerned about the happy ending. I love them Before the "devil knows you are dead" fits the general description but it creates a unique environment. Kelly Masters's first script is to reach the Greek tragedy, like Hollywood. To pay tribute to fellow veteran director Stanley Dennen, Sidney Lumet becomes an outstanding, old school character drama with skill and confidence. In the opening shot, though his drunk accountant has a look and feel of the Dutch master's painting, styling his trophy wife. In contrast, the drug seller's Condo Mondrians looks more like a string. Great performance around Only Albert Finney character Charles is a little more played, eye-wide and mouth agape seems almost all the time. But then he is in deep trouble, deeper than we are in any trouble. For compensation, Marisa Tomei super hot. But of course you do not need to tell me. Why do we want to live with a guy like her character Jina Andy, we are never called, but okay. Action character, after all. Carter Barrell's music is unique and the magic touch makes this fine movie a great composition. Do not miss it.
