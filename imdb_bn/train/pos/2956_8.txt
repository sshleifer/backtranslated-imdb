Today there are very few actors who can keep me throughout the film through their presence. One of them is Judy Davis, who has developed a successful career in creating an attitude that can look at attitude but is very weak in the heart. He took the role that most other actors would treat melodrategicism and provide a fiery, deep emotional intensity that attracted attention from everything else on the screen. <br /> <br /> Her skills are displayed in the film "High Tide". Which met with director Jillian Armstrong for a second time, who gave Davis his first major success with "My Brilliant Career". In this film, despite Davis's community and the crisis he felt, he played a young man, who was determined to make it in the world. In "High Tide", Davis's character, Lily is almost the opposite: when she was younger, she gave up any hope for her future and, after giving birth to the child, leaving her responsibilities and life without a direction or meaning. Finally, when he met with his daughter several years later, the thought of caring for her child became furious; He knows that he has got the opportunity to accept it for his failure, but how can he be honest and achieve his honor? <br /> <br /> Films of Jillian Armstrong generally describe the story about those characters who want to communicate with each other, but face their obstacles set by personal habits and addictive. For example, "Oscar and Luinda", a man and a woman who felt the need to love each other, but always represented their gambling addiction and became blind by their desire for opportunities. Here, we immersed ourselves in a family of families who have been separated from the struggle to save themselves despite the mother's helplessness to be disabled in a permanent life and to make herself completely sure for herself. This is not only a movie with a great performance in its center, it is also a rare achievement: a completely reliable story of release.
