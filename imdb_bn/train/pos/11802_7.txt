It's not the best Bigfoot ever made, but the latest maps of nature have gone into scary movies, which mostly show up in the SiPi Channel, it's quality material. It has some functions, some humor, decent F / X and Bigfoot. CGI is used, but so some real F / X, which I like. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> This is better than Saskatchera film and it's not a series, so do not be fooled. <br /> <br /> The performance is better than you find in a movie better and guidance is enough. Expect characters to look a little bit "developed", but will pick things up. If you are watching a DVD, you can skip a section or two.
