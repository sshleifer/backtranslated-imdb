From the very beginning of Simpsons, it was not a coincidence that I did not want to turn into a 2-minute case. It has been said that Simpsons killed Seattle. <br /> <br /> The first season was so early that when they became teenage characters they were not frustrated. They even sometimes went to school. The following season character carried out where. Eric, a satirical tweet, Donna, his level-headed girlfriend, Kelso, egg bulb, hed, conspiracy theorist and anti-punk, phiz, perverted students and finally Jackie, the rich wealthy Phloeni. For the adult characters Eric's mother was saying, "Can you believe that she is so upset" Suburban mother, Eric's father, the straight arrow was certainly not a solid ass, Donna's hidden father and her fool's blonde mother. Everyone is true to their character, but special Quds near Cartwright Smith, who finds perfect balance between energy and still makes his red decree very sympathetic with the unexpected glory. <br /> <br /> Top Grace course why this show is so good. It's a tough character, because it does not allow the actor to react wildly like the character of the character, it played with the skill of Ashton Kutcher. <br /> <br /> Enjoying the character of Hyde is a little difficult, because he is more realistic and we really want to see the orphanage story for the eighth time, though I would say that the author came with a brilliant tone for him in the last season. <br /> <br /> Jackie, played by family singer voice artist Mila Cunis and has a chalkboard type nail, which actually fits her character. The only sad part is that we did not see more scenes with him and Eric because they were f ... together with the sunny. A lot of stories have been lost due to the problem of their relationship because we have already found it in the frustration with Eric and Donner. <br /> <br /> The last thing I would say is that the casting of guest actors was always great. Few favorites: Fez 'comfortable girlfriend, Passer Dane, completely unusual in the mid-season, played by the same awesome horror, Thomas Chong, one of Phase's friends who watched a special appearance as a fully certified and teenager magician Sabrina. slutty catholic girl <br /> <br /> Fox, whatever the next.
