When Braveyart was coming out for the first time, I was fascinated, and confessed I was one of the most cunning fans of the film. When Rob Roy came out I was curious, and although I enjoyed this movie, I do not think it's a great movie. However, time has gone, my appreciation for Rob Roy has increased, and my source has reduced for Brahheer. Braveheart sure, great entertainment, but there are errors as well. Most importantly, in my eyes, the obscure screenplay of Robert de Bruce, who suspected Scotland's greatest king. The historical mistake of another film, which spoils the film in the proportion of many historical distortion. I think I was also in the film that I only saw at least (at least through me) that the first aspect of Mail Gibson's opening can be clearly seen. In contrast, Rob Roy has grown over me for years. Partly because it can in most cases avoid mistakes I mistakenly think of. But Rob Roy is like a good wine, because everyone is becoming more mature and complicated with each visit.
