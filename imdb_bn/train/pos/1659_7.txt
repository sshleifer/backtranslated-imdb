A part of the life of one of the first female painters to achieve historical fame, "Artemisia" tells the true story of a young Italianian artistic expression and the real story of the unusual expression of her face. The film is lavishly costumeing and set and features a well cast and acting. However, it is confusing to try to describe industry and time confidentiality and to draw artistic emotions in canvas and to explore the search through its involvement with men. A good movie for those who are interested in Renaissance painting or time movies.
