This movie, about me, about the family Jimmy Morris's dream was not only for himself but also for his family. I can not start to tell you how I can tell my little girl that Dad is going to Kansas City to cover Prest Homes and Kansas City Chief. He thinks it was a great thing, as did the son of Morris. Dream about living with the family is about this one. I think only a father who has a close relationship with his family can really understand what Jimmy Morris did.
