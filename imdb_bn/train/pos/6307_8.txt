I have never heard of this flash despite George Clooney (whose company is produced and he appears in a very funny supporter bit) and despite his connection with 11 Ocean Steven SÃ¶derberg. Worse, what we picked in a discount discount for $ 4.99 (Canadian Dollar!) Is a grand and delightful surprise. But then I wonder if William H. Macy could not disappoint you. This was very memorable for the eling comedies of England in the 1950s. OK, with more prejudice. This is a weird and sometimes hug-split funny movie. True tribute makes me feel so sad that I cry. Perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history Perhaps it was less expectation that I'm going but I saw with a group of people and happened to us an explosion. The best $ 5 I've spent in ages.
