At the time of his death, Ann Lord (Vanessa Redgrow) named the name "Harris" and he was a curse singer at the age of 50, and from New York, his wealthy friend Lila Wittenberg (Mummy Gammer) Newport. Ann Grant (Claire Danes) Lilar welcomed Wittenberg's hut on the outskirts of the ocean by the alcoholic and helpless brother body (Hugh Dancy) and he told her that his sister was actually his friend and slave Harrison Arden (Patrick Wilson), who fought in war and graduated in medicine. . Later, the bride admits her true feelings about Harry's Ann. However, when Anne meets Harris, she has a crush on them and they have a brief relationship at night and a tragedy with Badie. Meanwhile Ann's daughter, insecure and unstable Nina Mangal (Tony Colette) and happy wife and mother Constance Herverford (Natasha Richardson) are worried about their mother and can solve their differences. <br /> <br /> I have seen some of the best feminine castes in a movie with "Evening" magnificent performance. Marie Gammer's greatness with his mother Marily Streep is amazing and she has a role that honors her mother's name. Location, clothing, set decoration, cinematography and soundtrack are also great. Unfortunately the plot is confused and I did not understand the message of this film clearly. Why is the story of motherhood so important? Constance Anne and Harris stood on the night and would she be her dad? Why sometimes he encounters a man in conflict with New York sometimes, if Anne and Harris did not stay together? Anne Lord has solved any problem after the Lilo Ross tour? Did her love for both Buddy Wybron or Harris be a brotherly love? Nina Mangalera finally her thoughts about maternity change? It seems that the writer or director of painting has failed because they are not able to appreciate and complement the story of a beautiful love. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Even Entertainer" ("in the event")
