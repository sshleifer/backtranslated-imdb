As a pioneer, I must say that this movie has no magical significance. It is a "funny" film of witchcraft and it is not intended to teach us anything, it is also the most powerful magick of love and it is not used in control or revengeful ways. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mentioning movie credits) Miss Novak was absent - yet capable of being a superior neighbor queen was extraordinary.
