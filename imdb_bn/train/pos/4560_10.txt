I just returned from a display of "My left foot" in my public library. What a mental experience - I feel drained and raised. <br /> <br /> It is based on Christie Brown, Irish writer and painter, and author's autobiographical "My left foot". Christie's birth was born with a form of Sevrral Paley, just as her only limb was her left leg. The doctors advised her parents that she was mentally disturbed with depression, but her mother did not give up, and as she had done with Sullivan Helen Keller, she helped him achieve a success where he learned the alphabet and then read, write and paint. . <br /> <br /> This movie was earned by Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor) and Academy Award for Best Actress for Actress; It has received Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adaptive Playplay. <br /> <br /> As a retired clinical psychologist and family therapist, many films can entertain me, many often leave me ignored or imagined or incomplete in realistic mental reactions.

There was help (and some of the Irish lectures); If you see it in the DVD, then you can make that choice.) <br /> <br /> One of the greatest, creditable acting works I've seen is the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis: really fantastic, outstanding, best. <br /> <br /> "My left foot" carries more than just the compatibility of a recent movie, "Diving Bell and the Butterfly", each of which is a real Represents life prison term and a very serious physical problem successfully be reduced. <br /> <br /> By doing this, it is resurrected with William Ernest Henley's "Invictus" which starts: "The night that covers me, // from the black pole as a pole, // I Thanks to the gods // Thanks for my helpless soul.
