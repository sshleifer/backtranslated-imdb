Sequel from the "Kingdom" is bloody and even more rolled. I only saw half (I was tired and could not sit in all 5 1/2 hours) but I like what I saw. Scratch, blood, murder, toxic, substituted kids, voodoo ... it's all there! If you have strong stomachs and have fantastic movies, it's for you. <br /> <br /> To understand this, you will not see Part 1 ... you find it out! <Br /> <br /> Does anyone know if the Kingdom 1 and 2 are available on DVD? Sitting through this marathon movie in a theater is tiring. The sad thing is, probably will not be "Kingdom 3" - it died a year after the shooting of the movie. But you do not know!
