This film (for some reason the alternative title "Marshall Law 3") introduced me to Jeff Wincott for the first time. And it was a great role. Although I had never heard of him before, he started becoming a wonderful warrior. The action scenes of this movie are great! There are a lot of them, by the way. The battle for the job at the peacekeeping headquarters is particularly good. Only a single person's cat is lost outside a bunch of fun people. And for the rest of the cast: Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for villains. This role fits her like this (but not others). Matthias Hues is also a good job, as always. She was a great warrior and character like macho, and this movie was a good competitor for Wincott.
