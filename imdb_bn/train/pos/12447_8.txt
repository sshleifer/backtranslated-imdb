There are plenty of content from Modesi Blaise comics and novels that will be great in the movie. Unfortunately, a number of attempts have been made and they have reduced the great feasibility between the characters. So, no, it's not a sample that you do not know from comic strip (now reproduced in the finest versions of titan books). This is exactly the right from the first 5 or 6 years of the strip that you can split it together from the sample and its back-story. <br /> <br /> The role of Miramax's character was as a quintin tarantino advocate and technical advisor. The primary draft of the Miramax project tried to adapt to one of the best novels, but always left some important elements. Tarantino was not happy with any of them, and offered to remove the name from the project so that they could proceed. From studio credits, they wanted to keep him in the process, because they knew that he had "got" and his world. As soon as the film rights expires, they decided to try a different approach. As a result, "My name is Modesty", a small direct-to-video video that introduces the character. <br /> <br /> The film does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important for Blaise's courage in most of the published stories. What this movie produces shows the power of character by itself. He will never face her and you will never doubt that she is gunned down in a room full of gangsters and even unarmed. Most movies take place in the casino, which undoubtedly stores production money. It does not matter. The film does not come across as cheap. Instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and credible) back-story for the character, and thinks of taking it forward. Miramax should now follow any classic story or novel, they keep the character's background beautifully and do not have to spend a lot of time on its "core". I understand the "direct-to-video" words do not inspire confidence, but this film is a good look.
