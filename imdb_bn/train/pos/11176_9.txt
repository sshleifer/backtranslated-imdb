All right, first I will show that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old. For the first time I saw it two weeks ago, but perhaps it's just another cheap-made-cable-TV horror movie with well-made scenes. But when you're not 9, you just do not worry about those things. It was again afraid of hell from me, especially before the Gilda-scene (and they still are there). Nowadays I kind of hooked in this picture. I can see it once a month, and on the eve of every new year I see it with a beer pack of 12-packs and friends. It's like an appetizer for a good team! I agree to those who played incredible here who played here. Midwife and Crosby wanted to look like Luis and Rachel, but they could not see much devotion or feeling in the face. Hughes and Guin have preserved "Crides" intimate scenes in most of the scenes. I really want to tell about that there really is not a film that has similarities in the pet semitic and I do not mean zombie stuff here. The insulating of this film must be a feeling and a kind. Actually, you saw a movie that looks like a cable-TV at the top of the surface, but has you kept a cold compared to only the most horrible? All right, I was just a few minutes before the cast ball was blurred, but I have to say that all the pieces of that level can also play completely. But hey tell me if you really know some pictures like pet cemetery! I really want to know ... and I do not mean living dead here ... way out of the way compared to intelligence than this thing.
