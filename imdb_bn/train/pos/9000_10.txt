During the Hawaii International Film Festival I saw the first blood samurai blood in the premiere. How nice! Blood blows us with our sheer ugliness, pride, vitality, thunder, excitement, pride, crying campus, even more cattle, and all of this is great joy! Especially for those who love Japanese chambara Samurai and Nizna, you must see blood!
