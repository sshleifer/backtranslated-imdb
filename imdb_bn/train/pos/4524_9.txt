It is a very rare example of a movie about transvestitism (heterosexuals). The film behaves in a forbidden theme so that a general audience would not even know about transvestitism firmly sympathetic with its main character. Very credible as Adrian Pasadar Gerald / Geraldine and this will not be forgotten for a great acting. Christopher Manggue's guidance with very sensitivity, very well to use a difficult problem that has been packed in a good story. A big movie, not an "art" film, but a little, lovely motion picture!
