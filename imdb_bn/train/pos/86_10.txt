I remembered this in Ohio at the Slime Movie Theater (where I was present almost every Saturday on "Kiddie Matinee"), in Ohio when I was young and never forgot. It just surprised me and my friends. There was some way I could see again! I have tried to find some of the shorts or the compilation that no benefit. I recently discovered that it was a Costa film and it blown my mind even more. How did he accomplish this out of my understanding of the hack If the fish correctly thinks, at one stage the cat is actually in the mouth! But I would be extremely grateful if someone could help me find a way to see me again!
