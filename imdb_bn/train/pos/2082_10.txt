I first read the novel Parlie Squeak's fantastic novel in class 9th class, and I enjoyed the thriller page. Hollywood was almost essential to hold it and it was thought that it was created in 1937, the results are excellent. Some things to accept: In 1937, there was no question of countering the Asia in Asia as a major Hollywood film actor. This way it will make the last product more interesting, if they are able to use more proven-described cast. <br /> <br /> Builder creator Ering Thalberg and director Sydney Franklin (occasionally) others) took a fantastic and star-throwing hand-take trouble. Paul Munie played Wang Fu. During this period, Muni was at the top of her power as an actor and she could have played almost anything in her mind. Once you get the makeup (it's good, but no one can make a mistake for a Chinese person), its performance is all the precision of his greatest work. <br /> <br /> Then there is Lewis Renner. The Oscar win last year for his performance in the Great Jiggle, the Vietnamese actress's star grew up and despite her lack of experience in Hollywood, O-Lan's final role was given. His performance won him the second Oscars, for the first time in history. <br /> <br /> There was much criticism of Renaar's performance and her Oscar won here. He is called wood and one note. That is a small grain of truth. However, that's being said, you have to go back to the book. For Renaar, though not a Chinese, Beck wrote him a lot and like a lane. It's actually a fantastic performance, and the best transfer of all time on screen from the book I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the cast, it was good MGM. They were the big stars and character actors of Hollywood and had a great budget for their best payment, and eventually they got the best. <br /> <br /> The film makes Wang Fung's marriage mild-somewhat o-lan. In the novel, the desire for body with wealth comes and he takes a concubine, a step that destroys his wife, but his feelings do not worsen him as a woman only. In this picture, a reputable Wang Fung returned to his wife after the death of two wives who had taken two pearls from her two years ago, she realized that she was truly loved. <br /> <br /> Hear, yeah. But that's Hollywood. They feel the opposite of upside down, the film is open for laughter screams. But despite the original Asians' outlook, this picture has been wonderful for seventeen-three years. Actually, this is the most wonderful thing about this movie, when it can easily be a disaster.
