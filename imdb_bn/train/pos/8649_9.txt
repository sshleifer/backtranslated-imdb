I bought a little while ago but neglected to see it till last night. I like Juliet Lewis, though I'm lacking Brad Pitt. After watching this, I must play perfectly well - his character was completely credible, and I do not think "Brad Pitt". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I can not say the same for David Duchovny. I'm an X Finance fan and I want to double check this movie's date, as I thought it was created a few years later. I love Dukovi, but here its character is found a bit dual, where he is voice-over. That part was strong, there was a good feeling in character, etc. Otherwise I was thinking of "Agent Mulder", which is a sad. <br /> <br /> Michelle Forbes was a treat. Why did not I notice him earlier? (I'll see what he has played and seen them). I'm a bit worried about Luis, the film and the "Natural Motherland Killers" (strong darling). Although interesting to look at the characters, he is a willing partner in the NBK, but here he is victims of violence and tries hard to believe that he does not accept the dark side quickly until it is sharp in his mouth. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed it film almost unreservedly In addition to Duchovny's character, it seems perfectly consistent (and probably seems to be "washed" by Pitt's), it was perfect. I was finally satisfied - innocent innocent heroes did not die, but they had to suffer first. This is realistic, tense, annoying. <br /> <br /> If you like NBK you can choose this movie and vice versa.
