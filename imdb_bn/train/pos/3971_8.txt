<br /> <br /> Have you ever seen that like you watched, as someone puts tabs on each of your steps? Well, before breaking the law, keep in mind that the FBI will always be there. At least that feeling is sure of you but after seeing a little gentle crime drama, the FBI story It marks the root of the organization from a small bureau by telling stories through one of the world's most modern benefits (1959) by an agent of Chip Hardesty (James Stewart). <br /> <br /> The chip was with the FBI from the very first day, and he happily kept his work throughout the world, even sometimes his family. The FBI Story tracks her life by describing what her life is as an agent and how it affects her personal life. This is a spectacular task that FBI conducts and how to manage them. Visitors see the chip stop Ku Klux clan riots, go secretly to solve Indian killings / estate scandals, carry custody, rescue operations and help in WWII warfare. He also helped bring communist spies to justice. <br /> <br /> Stewart, in a fuzzy complex, stellar like her little neurotic agent (as always) loves her work. One of the best parts of this picture is that we can see the chip's family life and its work both internally. We enjoy him through his best friend and then the death of his son. We also saw his wife abortion and his marriage rocks. All his personal problems are caused by the love of his work. The sheep Miles gives a fantastic performance, but it is very believable, no less than anyone. She was never a brilliant actress, but she was always very attractive and alluring about her. Well that's right for me? Sadly, no other performance is significant, but the attention-grabber story has led me to be very interested. <br /> <br /> This movie was fascinating, especially in South American jungle scenes. All of the colors were really a texture that really set the atmosphere of the film. Perhaps the greatest part of this film was the fabulous aspects of Marvin Leroy. Each scene was so fluid that they just rolled together to tell a brilliant story. It is full of shiny camera shots, with some very Hitconci feel. <br /> <br /> All, the story of FBI is a spectacular, but identical film. Visitors may be scared for half an hour in the morning, but if you get the chance I suggest jumping on it. I enjoyed Jimmy Stewart's spectacular performance, and captivating stories.
