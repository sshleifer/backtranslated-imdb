The thriller idea is that if the car is driving, explosions and dozens of people are thrown by gunfire, "House of Games" is certainly not a movie for you. If you want and understand the psychological drama and mystery, then look at it at all. <br /> <br /> "House of Games" is an honorary psychologist and writer. Tell the story of Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crowes). , Who tries to help a patient and is involved in the galactic world of Conn Mann under the leadership of the charismatic Mike (Joe Montague). To tell more about the plot, the mystery will be destroyed. In fact, those who believe that they saw twists are hard to believe. Like a cute concert artist, this movie takes you to the web and takes away your attention. <br /> <br /> The story is fresh and disciplined, the conversation is smart and lanikic, uniform acting good (Mentegana is a great charisma). Someone has complained that Ford is not very sympathetic and wonders why Mamet Lindsay sees the Crows as physically unreasonable. But Dr. Ford is considered to be cold and isolated; Moreover, its similarity is needed in a way to plot (at one point, I believe his sexual self-esteem hit is a key part of his motivation ... I will not say it again). <br /> <br /> "Games of Games" is a dark look in the nature of human nature that ends in a note of uncomfortable ambiguity. When you are watching it will keep an eye on every second and then stay with you for a long time.
