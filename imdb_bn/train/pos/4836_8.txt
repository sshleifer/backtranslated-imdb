I watched the video a few days ago in a video tape and although it was difficult to consume it (due to its length and story), I like it very much. I first realized this script, then it is affected by the script. The film takes you on a journey, but it is not a simple, fun journey; It goes through time and various political regimes and shows their influence in the lives of ordinary people. What I liked is the film that followed the inner logic; Logic, which was like logic in life, but was sometimes illogical and confusing, but in the end, when I thought about it, then all the facts and twists had learned. Although it does not have any meaning to try to tell the story of spreading for more than 50 years. I liked Nikita Mikhalov's character Alessese and the way she acted, because some critics had abandoned her unhappiness. I do not like it, I think he later played characters that remind me of Alexei in the film "Zoo" (Zhestokij romans, which I really love) and some "humiliated and hurt" ("Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye"). "Sebrieda", I think, before moving to Hi-Fi, was a great filmmaker Andrei Kanchalovski and forgotten movies like "Tango and Cash" and less forgotten like "Runway Train" I would love them "Kurochka Ryaba" ...
