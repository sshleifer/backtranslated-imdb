After seeing Jeremy Bret as Sherlock Holmes, no actor can ever imagine that he was "one of the most striking characters of literature" Mr. Brett's script can come near. Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes and anyone in my opinion might be. The great actor Basil Rathbone, I must admit, second stop but second, still. Mr Rathban's screenplaces are better than the top genuine productions. Brett's ability and I agree that this might be the argument. However, when all is said and done, Jeremy Brett will always be the only actor to ever be and "Becoming" Sherlock Holmes. The book should be closed in this regard and we, the public, Mr. Brat's left to enjoy the unique performance. <br /> <br /> Bill Rogers <br /> <br /> (sonarman65@yahoo.com)
