This is a very well-made film. Acting, scripts and camera-work are all the first rates. Music is good, though it is mostly primarily in movies, when things are relatively happy. There are really no superstars in Cast, though many faces will be familiar. Do a great job with whole cast script. <br /> <br /> But it is difficult to see, because there is no good end like the situation presented. Now it is fashionable to blame the British and Hindus against each other, and then mercilessly divide them into two countries. There is some qualification in this perspective, but it is also true that during the unfortunate distribution of each other to Hindus and Muslims in this region, they forced each other. The British easily saw tension between religions and it seems that they were quite smart enough to use them in their last stages. <br /> <br /> Because of this, the situation is more cruel and inhuman, and remember this and it is very unpleasant to watch on the screen. But it is not painted as a black and white case. There is also the expectation of the neutrality and ambition of both parties and the change of young generation. There is a chance to get rid of the old, in the end, the old one has to make a difficult choice between a person who has destroyed his life, but really loves him, and his family has denied him, then looking for him later. But at that point, there is no pain for him, he has no choice. <br /> <br /> This picture carries messages that both Muslims and Hindus have serious consequences, and both are honored and cared for. The reality of the partition makes it more realistic, since India / Pakistan can never have a real combination at the border. In this sense, it's like "Mr. and Mrs Eyre". Finally, we were happy to see this movie, although the resolution was frustrating. If they can deal with racism in their own history of racism in the United Kingdom and the United States, they will certainly be better off.
