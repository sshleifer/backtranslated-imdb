"Spellers can be a great movie." All dogs go to heaven "is a great movie. I saw it in 1989 when I was two years old. I did not understand it well, but I saw it that I love these songs My favorite songs are "I'm surprised" and "Soon you will come home." These are beautiful songs, only one thing that bothers me, Charlie is dying in the movie. When I was young my sister The film is wonderful, on the other hand, this movie is astonishing. <br /> <br /> While the favorite part of my photo flying around Anbal and Charlie is beautiful in the movies and "watch" is very clever. I love Ichchi, I actually have 3 dashshards of my own. <br /> <br /> Overall, I love this movie and everyone will see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
