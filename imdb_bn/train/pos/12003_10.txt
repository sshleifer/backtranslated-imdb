As soon as the conversion of Jesus Christ of Church of Latter-Day Saints to the church, I tried to exploit the history of my new religion as much as possible. I was invited to an exhibition of this movie with my sons and other young men and women along with their families in our ward. <br /> <br /> In the beautiful spring evening, we went to the historic village of Kiratland, Ohio. We had reservations in the center of the visitor to see this movie. Since some of my church documentaries were limited to viewing my movie, so I was curious. The Church's only "full-length motion picture" I saw "Legacy" and "My Best to Years", which I thought was very good and well written. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the missionary interpreter passed the tissue saying that through this film many people were deeply moved to tears. I thought, "OK ... but it takes a lot to get my tears." Imagine my graduation when I sobbing myself! It really is a very moving and inspirational deal for Prophet Yusuf Smith. See it and believe its strong message!
