While operating a film in Steven Spielberg, people do not expect less than brightness and this film is no exception. Some of the movies that I liked do work badly at the box office, but I'm glad to say that this movie is not one of them (more than nine million dollars I do not think was worse then). The characters were funny, the animation was not clear and unclear, and the music was also modern, which is unusual for an animated film. I do not think Professor screw eyes or his "Scary Cirus" was very scary for small kids (targeted audience for this film), but I finally thought the unclear professor was too dark for a child what happened. Movie Overall, this movie is a fun and wonderful classic that I've been in love for many years.
