Pufnstuf do it I have seen this movie at the age of 4 and I am very dear and lively. This is the way that the target audience on the target audience gets caught as the reference - such as Jimmy's gray wings are closed and Wiese Hazel (Cass) sneers "I had her brownish roots!" It is of course influenced by the power of flowers, and in some ways quite progressive. The track is different, for example, young people send clear messages about themselves, not walking with the pack, and about what is different about themselves. It can be a song for the gay community, it should be a great track. <br /> <br /> Martha Roy, Cass Eliot and Billy Hayes are awesome as Documents, and Living Island gave it to all of them. Limit their character suites (include Billy Bar, Felix Silas and other famous names). There are so many lots of acting to do in this movie - it's really nothing nimble, and when Jack Wilde has to express his concerns for the abducted residents of Living Island, it's really very loud. It is a troll spread with drama and comedy. Although I think - I have never been able to stand a flute. <br /> <br /> I love soundtrack, especially the above mentioned variation, but if I could touch the magic of Japan the World, Puffstuff and even Jack Wild. What's more, it has now come out of the CD from the delicious people of El Records in London. For more information see: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm
