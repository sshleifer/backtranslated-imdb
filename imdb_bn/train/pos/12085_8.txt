Shirley MacLaine made another door-made role. In 1962, as an aunt for single mom in Chicago, an experienced character actress works as a depressing woman who will not defeat the soul of a set-back success. The child, a pre-teen son and daughter, brought their spirited come Jockey, although he learned many magic tactics and practical jokes from them, and applied all wrong opportunities, eventually being expelled from their school. <br /> <br> This plot is cleverly tied with all social effects in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The construction of men's bomb shelters, people seem to be the only TV set, seeing news shows, general fog of discomfort and fear in the air. When a "harmful" miracle is out of measure, the climatic conclusion makes the audience feel better. Yes, Virginia, tomorrow the sun will come! Obviously the production of a small budget, it is still filled with a sweet small film, Magic Matinees that are made on Sunday. Some choices throw "Olandies" into an effective soundtrack, the whole family is sure to enjoy it. ****
