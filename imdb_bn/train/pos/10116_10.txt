An extraordinary and accurate film ... McGaveston suffered a great deal of pain and pain in his writing and documenting. He is not afraid to tell the truth, although it can draw clear and sweet and shiny feedbacks and comments that favor some stories. <br /> <br /> Again, McGrawan came to Christopher Eicleston, though he did not play a role in Helsberg as an ambassador of a profile. I did this film as well, well played and well-represented as Hillsborough, and I appreciate McGowron for his stupid incomplete writing. Well done and my hat writer, actor, production crew closed. A great film!
