I really like this picture. All three stars (Connie, Fishburn and Underwood) offer credible performance and Harris is enjoyable at the top. In some scenes of Harriss, the light and the shot angles look really nonsensical in his face. At the end the plot's wonderful turn makes it interesting. A great movie, but an enjoyable one. I gave it 10 to 7.
