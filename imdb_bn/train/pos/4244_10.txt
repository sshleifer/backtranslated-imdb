This film has been thrown through the crack of film history. It is much better than any other New York film of the same period: "French connection" or "The Taking of Pellahm 1-2-3". This film is a great reality that leads to the use of humor to move the plot line further. It starts from the beginning and is not lost with age as it happens with the two examples above. <br /> <br /> Ron Libman changed a barbaric performance as "Batman" and his career was shameful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Gordon orders the park and comes after "Shafts", it seems like it's a strange choice first. Yet it is the opposite of that previous effort and the contact with the peacock on your face. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie was not made available in the United States DVD or VHS. United artists really have a jewel in their hands and it's a shame they are not doing anything with it.
