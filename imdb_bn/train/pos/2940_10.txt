For the first time I'm in error, I just heard it. I have heard the whole humorous performance and I have never been so disappointed in my life. Eddie's ability to paint funny pictures in our mind and make great imitation is captivating. I finally found him performing this job, I had it. Deliarius Eddie Morphy shows his talent in performance! With the new millennium, in 1983 his work was just as much as it was today. My parents love it at the age of thirteen and I love (eighteen years). From that point, I had to see other morphi movies such as Coming to America and Harlem Knights. There will be no other comedian like Eddie.
