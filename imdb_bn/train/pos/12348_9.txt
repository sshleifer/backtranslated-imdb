It is very helpful when the film is familiar with the culture and duration of the event. First of all, these women are not Gaisha, they give or take Jessiara-type "green house", about 1860, oran (prostitution), or it will help to clear some details that may be confusing inadvertently. The film deals with loyalty, love, and, perhaps most importantly, how people deal with problems themselves and others in their immediate environment. Insulting photography together with that terrible beautiful music, for a lovely ride. Just plug it in, suspend your mistrust and write their world. You will not be disappointed.
