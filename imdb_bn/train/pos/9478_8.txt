It is a beautiful little movie with a wonderful story, which plays the most important role of the whole film. <br /> <br /> This is a pretty playful story, in which romance is present. The story is being called slowly but it works very well for the build up. Characters are beautiful and portrayed nicely by its actor. Usually I do not have a very big fan of asian acting style, but this movie was easy to act. <br /> <br /> Of course, the style of the movie is different from the other style of the movie in its approach and style to the west. In this case, the film is already more advanced than its western counterparts, compared to Western films made in the same era. <br /> <br /> I only made the film's impressive style better. For a movie which is considered an art house movie, this film must be missing in some well visible sequences. It's probably made a pretty cheaper movie and it's made quite generously. This is not a bad thing, it only prevents the film from being truly sound and raising itself above the genre. <br /> <br /> But oh well, this movie is in its well-designed story and characters. In this context, this movie is certainly not frustrating. <br /> <br /> 8/10
