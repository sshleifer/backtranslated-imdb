Mardi Grass: An excellent film made in China, which illustrates how common among the two cultures, but is not always aware of the impact of every society. David Redmond opens your eyes and how China's workers produce mats that sell at a lower price and sells up to $ 20 in America. When the Redmond Americans ask where they came from, they had no formula and they established the statue. When he told them that they were less then made China for nothing, with terrific pay and unacceptable work environment, Americans looked sad, hurt, and a little repented but did not really feel that they stopped purchasing carpets after finding the truth. When the workers were questioned in Redmond China, they did not know that the Americans defeated them in their neck and gave so much money for this jewel. The workers laughed behind the back of the wax and could not believe it. This movie is a great film that lets us think about anything other than our own. <br /> <br /> M. Pits
