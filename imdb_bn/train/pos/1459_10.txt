How nice! How nice! How nice! I have never seen a non-promotional documentary in Globalization until I saw Mardi Gras: Made in China This film has zero descriptions and adds strong footage to four Chinese teenage workers with sensitive interactions within a sensitive compound. They play with toys, jump, and dance. Yet, most of them work, work and work in the day and night - but the footage of their work is enlightened and mild to see. China's factory owner is surprisingly open, so he increases the effect of globalization while "punishing" workers. Following chicks from Marne to Carnival from China, the film reveals how the locals get connected to the two cultures worldwide through humor and interesting, compelling footage worldwide. One of the most interesting parts of this photo is the cross cultural role of workers in the factory through the photo and consolidate the marsa one by one. Here, the film comes in full circle and shows how the images can be a point of communication and transformation. The film never gets broadcasted, does not drive crime and lets everyone's view appear. In the end, we - We create our own decisions about spectators - film complexity, and globalization.
