I stumbled on this series rather than by accident. After half the episode, I was hooked. A dark, weird series with American Gothic Gary Cole is mysterious, perhaps the evil Sheriff Bock who is trying to gain control of his illegitimate son Caleb, managed by Lucas Black. I was fascinated with Gary Cor's violent Sheriff and I was more impressed than Lucas Black. Caleb Sheriff of Lucas Black was able to stand against Buck, it was one of the most awesome characters made for a TV series. I rarely seen a child actor with presence or talent as Lucas Black. If the American Gothic Lucas is not lucky enough to see him, see him on a sling blade. <br /> <br /> This was an extraordinary event that was accompanied by many ambiguities and mysteries which were never explained during its short run.
