This is what I call an increasing movie. Each character is different at the end and well- and it's all because a woman knows that the place they chose is "love tube". Jose Lawrence, who is known as Comrade, shines as a woman who really brings about all these changes. Even the men of this film are going to be self-centered. The book was very true to the novel, which is my book plus, because I am a librarian. Visible breathing and love messages are true.
