At the beginning, this is from England, so of course, I had a 98% chance that it would be cute and very good movie. I have never heard of this picture before. From the minute I saw Helena Bonham-Carter, I said to myself: Oh! Here comes the feminine version of my left foot. I was right, but I was wrong. The wrong reasons are very differents because of two movies. My left foot was John Ford's solo film, and it's Chaplin's solo film (This is not funny, but this wonderful feeling of Chaplin came tears in your eyes.) I was right because in 1990, Daniel Day-Day-Lewis turned a little ugly to play a lame person. And he did it with a great feeling of reality. Here, very nice Bonham-Carter is exactly the same thing, but with very feminine passion. The story is well written and it is very cute. For me, Miss Bonnham-Carter has given the greatest woman in the 1990s, Breaking Emily Lloyd The Waves. Ghee! And look at his eyes! There were the most beautiful eyes of the movie since Jobin Ralston, Luis Brooks, Mitchell Morgan and Awa Gardner! He has seen many other movies, as a true genius. See this one, you will not regret it! And Branagh's very good job!
