If you have read the Mother Night and enjoyed it (as I have done) that you only have to see the film, it is understandable that you have to understand Vongut's basic element - Vongut himself, beyond his story, and you can not keep the mind of the person on the screen. Its white and humor can not be replicated by just a screenplay or even the best performing performance. I believe that this movie wants to ask the main questions of Vogue dress in its book, but there are not many moments of ridicule found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the film has been successful because it does not try to restore the book reading experience (it is not too lazy to launch a page). This is successful because it accepts basic elements of a story made by the true artistic treasures of America and it represents in a framework without any structure. I have seen other movie editions of Vanguat books where the directors try to attempt Vanguat's genius channel and lose the firmness of their own craft. I can not show this movie as best, but it stands as a good value to stand on its own feet. Despite the attempt to capture or insert Vongut's "voice" from the film's description, Mother Night brilliantly describes her story and preserves the basic lessons of the story without confusion, confusion or frustration.
