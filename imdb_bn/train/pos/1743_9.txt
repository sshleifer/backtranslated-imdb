After seeing many Greek movies I was very skeptical against most of them. But after seeing this, I was surprised. The movie is great without a great effort. You can not claim to claim that the image is so great or photography is perfect or something technical. This is a real story and it is happening in God's forgotten places in the Greek countryside. The film is like a punch in the stomach and I really do not like this thing. Evidently the Greek people (ignorance) have been discussing something different about xenophobia. The problem of this man is that he is not a former criminal. The problem is that he is not one of these people. He is different and they do not want them (that is why he does all the good things he is doing). And also talk about the indifference of the people, because there are some people who are against the raiders, but they do not have the courage to say their opinions. In the end, you can clearly see the hypocrisy of religious religion and try to do things like God, but at the same time, the king is acting so badly. It shows how easily people make their feelings or their beliefs justified by the established system. In the end you can get positive education from this very bad story, which means that you can be a partner of this society and if you want to be one of them. If you want to be separate and even live alone, you have lost (and it is not far from reality) I think it is tragic that the story is true and it should be a bell for everyone. There is no comment for the main actor because he has already received a prize and I believe his game is superb. Short comment for Hatzisavvas (police drama), he played a lot like a dinosaur, and I'm sure that this role for him was very easy, but he can play it so great that you can not deny him a big bravo. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good Greek movie.
