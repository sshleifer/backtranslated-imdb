My animation check started with the entire tradition of animation by John Savankjazar's film, in which Jiri Trunka was a pioneer. His Ruka is one of the most technically-impressive animated movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> A queen woke up and her plant water. Then he goes about making a pot. But the huge arm crashed the pot and claimed that Kumar made his statue. He hands out, but soon it returns and a bird cage is forced to jail him where he sculpt a stone hand. He set about it, fainting from tiring, but eventually completed the job. <br /> <br /> A wonderful sequence of Metachan, the Kumar uses a candle to burn his visible doll string, which kept him cold, and he escapes back home. He closed himself and when he fell on his head, he was accidentally killed by his own favorite tree. <br /> <br /> This movie does not hide the true animation,?). Hand, for example, clearly a hammer of some hands. The soil of everything else. String visible and detail part, making it a precursor of the string. The atmosphere is weird: in the hands of the little Kumar, many horror movies have led to more fear in me. <br /> <br /> The film is clear but its simplicity is avoiding being completely manipulated. It is a novel about artistic freedom and torture that can not help to win the heart and soul of natural rights.
