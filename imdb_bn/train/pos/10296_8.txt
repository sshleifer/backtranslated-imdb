A fairly funny Jim Keri car that temporarily gets God's power as a news reporter and destroyed the debris. Carrie returned to the familiar land here and looked at a good time, and Jennifer Aniston is being seen as attractive and influenced by her girlfriend as well. The story seems extremist, but cast (as "God" with Morgan Freeman) is awesome and makes the film attractive. Grade: b
