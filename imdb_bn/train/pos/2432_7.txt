I think the comedy comic book, but do not remember any cartoon. Maybe they were not memorable; I do not know, but at my early age, I saw this very little comedy animated shortly. Then, I was surprised to read user comments here. Do people miss the end? <br /> <br /> I want to know again that the Caspar is not like other ghosts, who want to go out of the night and fear C-PK from everyone. "He does not see any future," according to the descriptor here. Instead, one night he goes to the rural area of ​​the village, unknown to some creatures, and no one can find a friend. This brings him to tears, until a little Fox fools him and makes friends with him. Two friends became friends but soon, Fox was walking with a Fox Hunt for his life. <br /> <br /> Other reviews mentioned all what has happened, so I'll touch it too. Fox hunting victims are killed by dogs (not shown) and Casper "I was the only one in tears to lose the only friend." But, does not mention the happy ending of this story. "Firey" Fox has become spirit-like like Casper, has jumped into his shoots, mocked his face, and commented on the statement "They have lived happily ever after." Both characters look delighted. <br /> <br /> What's so sad about? This is a nice story with a beautiful, happy ending.
