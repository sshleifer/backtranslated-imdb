"Freddy Cats", the fourth of these cartoons is a good one. At least I like it, so I was surprised that it got mixed reviews. <br /> <br /> This is a more Macau story than a ridiculous story, though it is in Comedy's moments. The atmosphere is dark and pounded. Suspense is another powerful element here. For laughter, it's mostly dark humor. <br /> <br /> At this moment, Tom gets an obscure radio show at night and is absolutely scared because it believes in something about ghosts, some believe. Afraid of Tom's death, Jerry sees everything and can not help but laughs all the time. In fact, Jerry quickly finds ways to torture him more. She made a big "ghost" with a white shirt and a vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> Tom enjoys the most horrific experience of his whole life. Although Jerry is afraid of Tom without any good reason, the story is just as funny as it is. Plus, again, there is no violence here because it is one of Tom and Jerry's oldest cartoons. However, I did not breathe the joke of Tom's 9 people around in vacuum cleaner. <br /> <br /> When Tom finally finds out that it was a fairy plan and Jerry made a fool from him, Jerry «caught with the hand in the cookie jar» (he deserves to be discovered). Nevertheless, Tom shows incredible patience before a response. He saw anger in the world for almost a minute. The funny thing is that Jerry invited Tom to wake up and spent about half an hour with Tom looking at his very serious face. Jerry tries to be funny, but Tom does not smile. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a different, extraordinary and extraordinary Tom and Jerry experience.
