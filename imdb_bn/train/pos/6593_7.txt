I have seen this picture twice and it seems pretty good for the limited tools used to make this movie. (Illustrated in 1947). Hieradahal explains his theory of benevolence under the big trees under the direction of the South American pre-Kluian Indians on the path to the Polynesia islands. This is the documentary. Following the hairdressers and crew, they select the balsam trees of Ecuador and throw the river into the Pacific Ocean for rally in Peru. They started the brave courage of the 101-day sea, which is the power of their primitive repertoire only to the people of that era. See for yourself, a real adventure!
