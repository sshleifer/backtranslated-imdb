I first saw this show, I think it looked attractive. I saw it, saw how Sarah roams, the character sees the world ... turning around it. I got it, but there was no smile too. <br /> <br /> On her stage and in her voice, she is racist, candid, insensitive and very self-centered. I did not get him at first, and took all at the price of the face. Then I found his movie, Jesus is Magic I think he has worked for me as Sir Silverman Primer, he explains to me what language he is saying. He is like Marilyn Manson, working so hard to face terrible ideas and images, but eventually realized that this is not an attack, it's a statement. And once you realize that you are happy that you are giving it directly to someone <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not want to say that only smart people can understand or prove that this show is hate Make your fools Although I like many 'smart' shows, to this day I still can not see the ridiculousness of your Enthusiasm Curb. I get the impression that it's good, but I do not get it. Many people will not get Sarah Silverman program, but I'm glad I finally came around. <br /> <br /> The creators of this event work hard, each episode is not loaded only with conversations and intrigues, but the number of songs, or dreams, production numbers These people do not collect anything to fill the time slots, and please the advertisers, they appear in a mission to make the best shows that they can keep together. If I want to predict the future of this show, then I would say that it will go on the way to arrested development and the frequency and geeks. It will be canceled earlier and will remain in the hearts of fans and in the DVD. But the heart, the SSP creator, your audience is there, and as long as they give you the show, we will see.
