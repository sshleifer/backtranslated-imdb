I'm 60 years old, a guitarist (lead / rhythm), and for the past 40 years, I've been in four bands, it's all there is, fights, foul-ups, bad food, bad accommodation, always traveling, little or no money, and Each was drunk or high. But, clubs, fans, and music, it's worth all! Just like weird fruit! I am old for this now, and the meaning of swallowing in hands and hips is not diminishing any more, but it's all for the length of the video, and it was all there! Birds, rebellion, and torches! And I was young again! It's just like Billy Connolly's voice, God loves 70 things! Rock forever!
