"The father still went to the business" was the title of the review after the premiere of his "promise to me." I understand why many are thinking similarly, but Kushurik's unique expression is still present in his new film and some of the critics can not touch him. I had two hours of pure strength without rest. Even when the coworker is suffering from density of density or the empty space, he is still unique and unclear. Stribor Kusturica Wonderfully good performance. More intimate and less landscapes in "A miracle of life" Marija Petronijevic femme has a potentially world-class probability, please do not loot it. Of course, I recommend everyone to see this picture.
