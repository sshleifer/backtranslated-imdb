I saw movies with two big kids. Although not as good as Shake, I thought it was good. There was not a word in a movie theater surrounded by children in the break, so I liked it all kids. There the father also appointed. Characters bring about appropriate gasps and comments regarding death and clear death. Hope people have made this movie for kids. As such, although it was successful I liked it very much. Personally I prefer Scrat !!
