I just want to add value to my two cents, and forgive me if I repeat it a bit, but I think it is better to remind people of Damon Rooney's talented people. Without the wonderful road, this film was not created by the comedy of Damon Ryan - it was not even before the 1960s, along with gambling and other great classics like others. Damon Ryan worked as a newspaper man and he was from Colorado, but he definitely did _get_ the Street View of East Coast. If you are not a dedicated supporter of the old Hollywood comedy, then I would recommend some of the writings of Damon Runeon; Both "Lemondrup Kid," and "Little Miss Marker" were both the characteristics of Bob Hope, who were far from his politics, he was always funny person. (As the West Coast liberal, I find his politics fairly funny, too!) Damon Runian bus!
