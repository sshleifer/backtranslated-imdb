This movie reminds me that some old black and white films are of course valuable. <br /> <br /> I had some reservations at the beginning, but I was silent from the beginning of the film to the end. I was very impressed with the drama, mystery and comedy mix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " For your movie night movie.
