Clint Eastwood reiterated his role as Darthy Harry, who was killing a man who raped her and her sister in Carnival several years ago in a terrorist (Sandra Lock) case. Eastwood made his role, and the film mainly spoke after doing more, I'm not complaining. The sudden effect is really enjoyable entertainment.
