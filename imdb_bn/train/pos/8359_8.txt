Bertrand Blair was actually a terrible fan of French film and he could always shock the public for seventeen years. His fable twins (Depardieu and Daisier) and the normal level of sex (mu-mu play its common role, at least seventeen to less than one, we know that he could never be the best French actress after a decade). One of the first "Les Valliusius" is one of the first streets to be taken as a visitor to some of the only two minor offenders. Those who are not only satisfied with family life or simply do not know anything, the film is quite frustrating, but this movie is more than just that, it lets you remember all the normal things of life (working for the car) etc.). It is criticized for the hypothesis we are living in society. Great job, and this is what you want two things: Dviere died at a very young age, because she is a leading person and of course, Depardieu, as a good French movie, she proves that anyone can beat her. Durable classic and after 20 years it will still be some shock ...
