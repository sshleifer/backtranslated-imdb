Soylent is a classic of green. I'm waiting for someone to redo it. They seem to be re-launching science-fuzz classic today (World War I) and I hope some directors / producers will be able to repeat Swell Green. With today's computer animation and technology, it can be a great picture. Anti-ostrich films that can not be distant. Like the Russians without any effect like the flow of human breeding As a human, when we are out of hand, there is an option to install kibos on the production of low species, but there is nothing to control the reproduction of other humans except for us. In spite of all diseases, war, miscarriage, birth control, humans are still multiplied as a bacterium in a patry dish. In the classic Malaysian economics, it has been said that any species of people will be able to overcome the means of livelihood. 6 billion and growing ... that is indecent.
