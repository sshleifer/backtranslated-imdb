Freddy Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) The latest movie to play Freddy Krüger in solo acting (not as an entity or co-star). The year of the murder took a toll in Springwood town. It has become a virtual ghost town in the small town that has gotten points. Many years ago, Father gave everyone a final price to kill Freddy Krüger. Just live in crazy cities and survival is scattered all over. But Freddie does not stop trying to take his final revenge. They do not matter if they try to stop him, he always comes back for more. But this time he found out more about his old life. Can kids finally stop Freddie for good? What is this secret mystery in Freida's curved mind? To find out Freddie will see the dead. The last one was originally pictured in 3D. <br /> <br /> The best way to finish the franchise. Freddie learns about himself and his perverted life and he goes out of despair! Starring Lisa Zen, Youtet Koto and Freddy Kruger, in this final installment. Rosanne, Tom Arnard and Johnny Depp special appearance. Better than the end but it's filled with a few date jokes. You enjoy the series but you will not miss it. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie for Freddie fans.
