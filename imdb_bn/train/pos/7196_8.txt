Continually "Zoro's Legion Legion" is one of the best performing serials of the 1930s. Once the studios are still built in a large cast, then there are walls of the walls wall across its 12 chapters. <br /> <br /> In 1824, the newly formed Republican President Benito Juarez (Carlton Young) was trying to establish his new country on a firm financial footing. In the end, he arranged to send a rich gold ship from the San Mandolita mine to the Capitol. <br /> <br /> Local council members plot theft of don-dell-oro for ships. The gold ardade god, who was hoping to establish himself as Mexico's ruler with the help of the local Yaku tribe. His opposition was to Done Francisco (Guy de 'anari) who formed a local force to help Juanarja. When Don-Dell-Oro men kill Don Francisco, a stranger arrives in the town of Foopshi Don Diego (Reid Haddley). Diego Ur Joro took the army with the help of his friends Ramon (William Corson) and Juan (Bud Buster). Tomen's heroine Ramon's sister Volta (Shila de Arcy). <br /> <br /> Both the Diego and Ramon seats are on the Local Government Council. Soon it became clear that other members of the council have a league with the Don-del-Oro. First, the Chairman of the Council (Leander de Cordova), Militia Manuel (John Martin), Chief Justice Pablo (C. Montage Shaw) and Gonzalez (Edmond Cobb) chief. Joro suspects that one of these men is Don-Dell-Oro, but which one? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> We always have current falling rope bridges, deep sharpness on the two arches, which can only be forced to safety, and the usual storage of explosions, fire, coaches and wagons can crash or go over the hills. The legendary Yakima Cantt and the great team of Stunt Men's Republic, organized by Egigens, Bill and Joe, is here. He performed his signature stunt jumping on a group of runner horses, and in the same year John Ford's "Stagecatch" was repeated in the film under other coaches. <br /> <br /> However, Zoro finally resigned to the valley by don-dell-oro and riding the 12-inch sunset in the Valley before the Valley by disrespecting false gods. <br /> <br /> Cast others included Jim Pierce, Carl Dresden and Charlie King as Male of Don-Dell-Oro, and if you look closely, future serial star and Lone Ranger client Moore and Bits to spot bits by Stantman Cantt You can The best "Jim Pierce" novel for her wedding may be best viewed with "Tarzan and the Golden Leoom" (1927) of 1927 and Taranan producer Edgar Rice Burrus's daughter Joan Barreuse. <br /> <br /> Completely enjoyable
