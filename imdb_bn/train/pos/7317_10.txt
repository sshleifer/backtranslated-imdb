This is a movie that I have heard about growing my whole life, but it has never been seen until a few years ago. It's fame really forward to it. I knew Michael Mayer, saw the mask, saw all the commercials for growing sequels. But during the ten years, I seriously hold Jason and Frederick's terrible game and did not think of Halloween franchises. Boy, how I was cheated with cheap counterfeit closure <br /> <br /> Halloween is a real horror movie. According to today's standards, it is not as a graphic and visa, but the film distributes in all other levels which fail to achieve the most horrific movies today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter created is so vague, and it is set in an intelligent, mid-western city that its power is a rule. The effects of the light are downright awesome, with "size" seemingly appearing and invisible in deliberate shades. Simple but ruthlessly effective music score only adds to the mystery. <br /> <br /> All players' performance is well-received, especially with Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Plusance. Mrs. Curtis is so good Laurie Stroud because she is very fond and weak. The director and the audience invested so much because when Michael Mayors called him, it became more dangerous, we want him to live and go away. <br /> <br /> Donald Pleasance. A man is a mission, and it works well. He added a sense of urgency about the accident that has found the city itself, because he knows what evil is standing on his street. <br /> <br /> Overall, Halloween is simply not only a great horror movie, but a great movie. It works on many levels and attracts the audience and does not give up. If you want to enjoy the real horror movie it should be ideal to see it. And even more terrible time, try to watch it alone with the lights off. Do not be surprised if you think you are hiding around "shapes" shades!
