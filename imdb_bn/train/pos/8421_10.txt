Joseph von Sternberg, silent Hollywood and the former Imperial General organized this great silent film in Russia, who found himself there. Emil Janeings received Oscar extraordinarily for his role as General by throwing maliciously in a silent film as a Russian general. This film is spreading in Russia during the revolutionary fall of Russia. William Powell made his film debut in Jane Johnson on his big screen as director of Hollywood. The painting of Tin Lluton's retreat of Russians in the first days of the fall and acts as an interesting role. Von Sterberg has yet another classic distribution, and is filled with great elements of romance, conspiracy, and tragedy.
