This movie is the triangle of the first triangle society of the Maya, and the quarter is a great beginning. 3D films are only thematic, and these themes are really clear in all of their movies, if you look very close. The Shinjuku Triad Society is trying to protect her daughter from being too involved with the extremist gang outside the struggle to the top of Tokyo Yakuza. The kid's brother is becoming a lawyer and a growing number of quarterly gangs due to the film's progress. The movie takes place in a very harsh environment, and is so pretty intense and difficult. Miike has been bad, but it's a serious movie because it hurts you too hard. Many of the sexually distorted sexes, this one is mostly gay. Film is a common gangster movie in many ways, but with a great drive and true grittiness. If you only see exotic movies of mmx (Achi assassin, Fudah etc) it's ok to check it just because it shows its aggressive over-the-top style in the film and its more serious mutual, triangle films. And always with Mitchel, there are at least two scenes that you will never forget (look at this and find out for yourself). <br /> <br /> 8/10
