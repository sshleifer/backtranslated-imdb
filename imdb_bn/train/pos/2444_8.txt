"George Lopez," in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I did not see each episode, but I still enjoy it. There are many episodes that I've enjoyed. One of them was a moving piece of amy (Sandra Bullock) device. If you want to know why, you will meet it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd say that everyone always gave a better performance, the production design was spectacular, the wardrobe was well-designed, and writing was always very powerful. In conclusion, though new episodes can now be seen, I strongly recommend that it will be caught if the air is stopped properly.
