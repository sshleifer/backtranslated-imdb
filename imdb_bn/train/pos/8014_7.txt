But if you like Muppate, then I refuse to dislike you. Originally regurgitated the same plot (this time in New York, LA) it features much fun coyo and muppet hi-genx. Many Muppets leave the film very quickly, just as Kanye and Miss Piggy are located nearby. I've enjoyed it extensively. Fun to see with your kids
