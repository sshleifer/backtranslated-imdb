Movie Rental as a joke. My friends and I made fun of that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself. Now when all my friends are looking for a fun movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters. It should be said that although there is a rule that will make the film even better. If no conversation is approved then the movie will not work until the words are repeated in a scream. I like credit as well as at the end of the movie. "Thanks for the zip, Tom!" Anyone, Tom, I say thank you because the movie without your zip was not created. If you are looking for something to laugh then short is a great movie. If you want a good movie you can look for something else but if you do not feel like spending a person in the monkey suit, take a copy of yourself.
