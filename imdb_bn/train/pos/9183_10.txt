The amazing 1983 BBC television production (no other movie is here, as it has been here), classic love story "Jane Eyre", Rochester Dumont as Rochester, and the best version of Zenna Zellah Clarke made till date. Since it is the most trustworthy of Charlotte Brent novels both in both ideas and dialogue. <br /> <br /> A classic becomes classic for very specific reasons; When the filmmakers began to struggle with classic lifestyle, the classics were destroyed. Thankfully, the producers of this "Jane Eyre" have basically contacted the story about their respect and fidelity, making spectacular anecdotal connotation many times seen, it can enjoy lots of sweetness and joy and mystery. Functional delight, music is just fine, even Gothic design houses and outdoor shots are beautiful, and perfect tone set for production. <br /> <br /> My little criticism, although slightly, this version, like any version of Zen Zen, creates Zen's character and ignores Christian influences that affect its ethical preferences. In today's modern world, a woman would not worry twice during Zen's life, but she found an insane wife to stay with Rochester and still married her. "Oh, just get a divorce", he would tell his people, or he would live in sin with her. But Jan Jane, he knew that he can not settle for this course in life and can respect himself. Why? The decision was based on the Christian faith found in childhood, rather than the cruelty of the Calvinist Load Institute, rather than the other true cheek, since the Christian example of true friend Helen Barnes. Sometimes I want to see that some versions have had a big impact on this adaptation. A classic novel that ends with writing the heroine "Even so, come to the Lord Jesus!" It should not be based on the basis of that belief.
