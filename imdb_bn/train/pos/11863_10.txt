Perhaps it could be the best movie of all time and if it is not, Brian de Palma is a wonderful part of the film painting, one of them burned on your students like a distributor here. Initially Brian D. Palmer's director has been touched, who can be the best director again, Al Pacino has a great acting that offers an immortal hero in the Big Screen (Tony Montana). There are so many different (violent) scenes that you will never forget (one with Censo, where Tony is sitting in a bath, which is bigger than most people's houses), there are many fantastic one-liners (count how many times "f * ck "The word is used), a pretty little story (Pan America - the world that is" the impressive earth ") or the Georgy Morodor's great inconsistent. No nomenclature which is not great here and it is easily one of the best Gangstormoians ever made alongside "The Godfather", "Good Falas" and "White Heat"!
