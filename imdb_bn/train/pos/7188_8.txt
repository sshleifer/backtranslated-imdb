Along with "King of Rocket Men", it is still being repeated on BBC TV in the middle of the detention. If I was loading a time capsule of this time, then this series will definitely be gone. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish for anyone to see it for the first time but it is a "serial" of the best examples. Don del Oro will laugh at you (when I had my little name for Mr. Dustbin Head) and he was saying, "Your bullet can not harm me", it was funny, then he returned, thought to be happy. I liked the way I debate with Sebastian in the first episode. <br /> <br /> I have seen it again because I had good memory for many years, there are some good stunts and good music, it contains elements that you expect, including Rock Flowers, runway carts ... with the first episode ( With the Ralph Faulkner) the sword was not nearly as good as I kept it in mind, and yes it's the inevitable "flashback" episode features! It gets 10 out of 10 because it is still suffering from gradual, padding and other strategies. If you are interested in these serials, then I recommend William Witten's book, "In Door In In A Fight, Out the Door, In Chase In", although there are only a small entry about this series.
