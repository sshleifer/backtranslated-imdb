I scooped up this title by accident with the Grindhouse Volume. Collection of pure Euro trash movies one. But this film has a nice stamp of approval and should be a better transfer than what is there. It's not frustrating ... it's satisfying! I could not be surprised to see this movie ... how did Sergei Martino do this flick? All of this has his signature and punctuated by Edwedge Fénech (he should be known as well but he got a nice camio in the hostel second). Dual cross and triple-cross underlines and cement starting from the beginning of Lee. Van Cliffe is cooled in under pressure from 1 second. Did this guy finally go to Italy to get his feasibility or to let the studio system slip this guy? Along with Lee's more recognizable movies, try it for the size of the filmmakers and see how Sergio Leon will turn out to be like this once in one time in America, once his time in America reduces his epic scale to half the running time (and 1/4 of budget). So refreshing, it should be taken home at home and should it be for a sofa matinée
