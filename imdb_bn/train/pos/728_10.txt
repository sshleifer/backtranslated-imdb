Ramones, whom I consider to be the founder of modern punk rock, talk about a scary rock fan (PJ Souls) of their very strange words, who are a cruel, joyful princess (Mary Vernov) rock. <br /> <br /> featuring a soundtrack pruning with unbelievable music, RRHS concept and execution. It's full of full chock by violent sight gags (like the mouse check), the soul of the teenage (probably opening my favorite movie all the time), and the weird, moment of the wall (straitjacket scene). If you look for a film that makes pure fun at a molecular level, see more But if you look for a nice, respected, dramatic epic, you probably have to see a bit more. <br /> <br /> "Hi everyone, I Ruff Randle, and it's Rock and Roll High School!"
