I've heard before Modie Blaise, but never got a novel or a comic strip, my wife and I love this picture a lot. It delivers an impressive way, character and a good role in its background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some action flick components, it is also an intimate game, excellent writing. Sadly, there is a big flaw in this movie. A close game has its actor's ability and unfortunately welding lives on only half the life. Adjustra staden Memesty Blaise, his opponent Nicolas Costaar-Waldo - did not do a wonderful job like Vielen Mickels. As a toothpaste commercial to make his way through plot, he fails to create an atmosphere of concern that the film produces a great composition. The supporting cast is somewhat similar, from Premier Pearson to Premier Lobe and some stereotyped gangsters such as Irena as Eugenia Yuan and better performance than slots.
