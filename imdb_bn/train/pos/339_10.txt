When I first published, I read the book of Shanibam (the same title as this movie) and was deeply inspired by his ability through "Otherness" (his own and the people of Amjon with which he lived and loved). A way of living a decent life His next book was not as strong, but his continued search showed. His description of his sexual relationship with the tribal man was advanced in the early 60's, but his honesty and openness were welcomed. This film beautifully expresses both the clarity and generosity of the person, but the inevitable destruction of solitude (which is not a morally positive word in this case) gives a glance when "civilized" men enter into traditional societies. Even, Saturday itself has been transferred to a higher level of morality, which indicates the possibility of protecting humanity from its own destruction.
