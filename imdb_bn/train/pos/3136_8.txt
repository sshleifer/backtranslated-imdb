Adam and Birt involved in a great enjoyable effort with the right distance plot and original TV series flashbacks. Most Flashback scenes were directly quoted from the book "Boy Wonder: My Life in Titles" in BootWorld, and I imagine that his book was inspired to create this book. Like the book, it has become hungry for fans of the original series. <br /> <br /> If you missed this broadcast, it must be valuable for a taped effort from a recorded friend. I'm now a copy for my kids.
