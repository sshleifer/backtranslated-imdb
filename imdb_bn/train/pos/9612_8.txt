Good thing about this movie: The idea is interesting and some interesting scenes. It also lets you think about the small things of life, which can affect anyone else's life by knowing you. This is a small world and this short film shows us. <br /> <br /> Bad thing: There are many characters and it's hard to tell the hard character, but it's still a great movie. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and many people compare it to Magnolia which I have not seen. <br /> <br /> Not rated. I will rate it PG-13 Short violence, some languages ​​and sexual situations
