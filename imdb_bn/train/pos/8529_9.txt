I ran across this movie on TV and could not stop it. Peter Sellers plays an unlikely colleague who falls for a very warm and cute Goldie Hawn (who?). The way that the character of the melody is ending itself from the beginning of the film is still unsteady. This movie gave me a different angle between human relationships and I found it very interesting. The role of Peter Vendors was a tough sale, but I think he pulls off well.
