Incredibly impressive and impressive, it is impossible to launch it once I start to watch. I'm usually one of the most serious critics, but for me, this movie was only brilliant, odd because the word I can often smell the wind and feel the texture of the position. <br /> <br /> From cinematographer I think there was a lot of use of light and texture. From the light of summer to the orange lighting, under the plastic wrapper sofa, I had an independent air of reality. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of a character, I was inspired by the fact that the concept of Victor Vargas was associated with almost eighteen, and because of the complete background of the other members of the family, only more conspiracies were created in the main character. Outside of <br /> <br />, one knew only as a grandmother and at the end of taking such a situation, I can say that the situation is particularly realistic. <br/> <br /> I think this picture worked for me because I started to see it without any expectation and it was completely submerged. And a watch value is good, bring back the memories of teenage passion.
