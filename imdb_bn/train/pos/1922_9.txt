Tell me that the show was top level when John Ritter was there. After his death, the event was a bit downgraded, but the producers did not leave the show, James Garner and David Spade regularly went to Cast from 2003 to 2005. <br /> <br /> <br /> Around the Hennessy family, Paul (John Ritter, he can stay in peace), his wife Kate (Kati Sagal), his daughter, Breedgate (Kali Kuoko), Keri (Amy Davidson), and Their son, Rory (Martin Spongers). When Ritter was in the show, I laughed laughing (and proud to admit it, I), but now she has gone, I sometimes smile a little smile with a smile. I am very happy that after the incomplete death of Ritter, I became violent for this show, because it makes EPS better with the rotator. <br /> <br /> The Rotor character is very well played and good round, which you can not help but love him. She is always bossing girls around dating, but she really wants them to be happy. These extreme parents hate parents lover entertainment. <br /> <br /> Kati Sagal is also good, and she is also a favorite character. After Rotor's death, his character only does not provide such good influence and energy for his children, but I believe that Sagal shaped the life of Quixo, Davidson and Sponger, because he and Rotor had been friends for a long time. <br /> <br /> The most fun of the show is to be Briggate Hennessy, played Kelly Cuco. She is Absolute Blonde: Fantastic, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. He has stopped the wall with his innocent 'blond' humor and how proud he is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emmy Davidson may become annoying like Kerry, but the motto of her character is. The only drawback of the show is that the show never lets Kareiro happy. She is always after Braggate, and her character seems to be left there only. <br /> <br /> Martin Spangler's only Hennessy son is violent, and when Ritter stays in the house, he is mostly laughable. After the death of Rotor, the program provided some story lines for Riri. <br /> <br /> All of David Spade and James Garner are not lively, c. J., the story of the story of Spad's character in the middle. Garner cat shows the father's background as a bit background information. <br /> <br /> To everyone, I recommend this shot a great review, because it is a great event that happened to be a tragedy that it has been incomplete. You will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> 9/10 - SP
