If the movie was not seen in the main stage of the liberation war, I was pleasantly surprised after the DVD came, since it was not widely distributed in this film. <br /> <br /> Denzel Washington's director debuts and finished products nothing more edited by the other shades of the same theme. The film has a very professional look. It shows that Washington has learned a lot in front of the camera. He came with a different angle in this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things in the movie, no doubt, is the fine performance of Derek Luke. He is an actor who will go away with correct instructions, no doubt. At the moment of his life, the young man suffering from distress, weakness, and the pain of the bad hands, has faced him till now, it is true. A good portrait of a pain in his antonoon, which is basically very good and can give a lot of it, but no one can see the side of his character. <br /> <br /> The worst time of his despair, Dr. Antioch. He has been sent to Davenport, who has played Washington, very quietly, if he is relieved in some way. Because of the angst in Antwone, he missed this opportunity to open himself to someone who wants to help, but due to the constraints kept in his office, there are only three sessions and then his patient has been dismissed. <br /> <Antonovan is able to convince the doctor to work with him. Antwone's past details are revealed. The abuse that he suffered in the hands of his father, Mrs. Tate, is at least brutal to say. At the age of sexual abuse in the house of Tit's house, Antoovan, with the hand of an elderly woman, has an annoying taste with her in her adult life, because she has become frustrated by the shame she has with her. <br /> <br> Antwone finally finds love with Cheryl, who is patient enough to show her a different world and she supports him. <br /> <br /> The main role really is very good. Dr. Devenport of Denzel Washington also has his own problems. He is not a happy camper either. She can help Antwone, but she can not help herself, or her relationship with an adoring wife. <br /> <br /> The talent in the film is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a fine Cheryl. Novella Nelson, who is a fine actress, Mrs. Tate, is as handsome as the mother of abusing mother. <br /> <br /> Anton's reunion with his unknown family is very sweet and sensitive, but of course, if one is finally believed to have found happiness in Fisher, then acknowledge that part of the film.
