I first introduced "AD" by friends across "pairs" who like me intelligent humor. I like the curious people who can feel excited when entertaining like George Curlin and Dennis Miller. The 'Draw to Two Kills' Eddie provides similar social audit humor which, while simultaneously splitting your party, stimulates all of your issues on one topic. These stand-ups have a wide range of issues and they are just violent. The decision-making piece of Engelbert's stage will drop you off! <br /> <br /> Thanks Andrew and Catherine! ... and "do you have a flag?"
