I must admit that one of my deepest guilty pleasures of purple rain is Purple rain does not break the border only, it's a decade, dress, music, behavior, and dance set! In today's days, my friends and I still jam the purple rain soundtrack and pretend to be prince and revolution. <br /> <br /> Now the movie, I just wanted to say what was said in the title, because in most part, this movie itself is made up of music. Acting? Please do not judge me because it is one of the pleasures of my choice because I know that it was not worthy of any kind of Oscars. But I think the movie that took both Maurice and Jerome, their statement about their password was just fun. I want to rate this movie in the concert sequences because I thought it made the movie. <br /> <br /> Prince created a musical genius and beautiful music. Although the movies and performances are quite bad, this movie is still one of the fun to watch over night and even to dance. This movie defines 80, so just have fun with it. Prince like this, only in the party! Oh, boy, that's the word of the Lamb. <br /> <br /> 9/10
