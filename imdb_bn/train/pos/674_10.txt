It will be reduced to most people to watch the film, but in some movies magic and witch can deal with one form or another, it is probably the best of most ways. <br /> <br> The film seems to be an integral interest in the film industry from The Fall to The Craft. Most movies that touch it, so children (for example, "Witchboard", a real part of the whole garbage in every way), or Chess special effects or cardboard-cut villians (cf "Inner Crafty"). More often the matter is published in a strange religious context (in various publisher-based films, Christians are in fact a lawyer of new type of style practice). Seldom, a movie seems to show at least some momentary experiences with magic, which is practiced in real life, but the presentation of the museum in this movie is not metaphorical, nor literal, or symbolic, or ... okay. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie again tonight. I saw it before VHS; It's a dark, moody piece and after watching it, I'll say if you have any desire to watch this movie then watch it on DVD, do not see it on VHS. <br /> <br /> Dark and mood is very powerful in VHS, but the DVD takes on very different separate light in the DVD. I think the style is intentionally pushed in the dark direction for weir, but when the lower color of the movie VHS is transformed into medium it goes on this edge. DVD again brings the movie and I saw it differently. However, for the first time I saw it, I realized that magic treatment is very good in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is very accurate at countless levels. <br /> <br /> And do not let anyone, you really waste many time reading at this time.
