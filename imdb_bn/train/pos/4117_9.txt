"Do Desu ka den" is Master Akira Kuroswar's first color film, and surprisingly not about Samurai, Ronald, Battlefield or Battlefield. This is a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo, where residents are homeless drunk, beggars, tramps, humiliated women, damaged. I do not know why Kurosawa chose to paint this tragic theme and the environment, but in reality they are very sad, some of them are breaking hearts. I personally liked the story of a boy and his dad that dream of his own home and built by them; The story of the disabled boy who runs a train; If the five children were born, they would have been their children! And the story of the young man tortured his father. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Dodscaden ?? and Camino de Vida" ("Dodscenane? Way of Life")
