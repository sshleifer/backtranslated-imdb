"Baby Face" is a preurban melodrama which plays very young Barbara Stanwick, which is almost unrecognizable George Brent and Theresa Harris. This is a girl who goes well to the city ... or I'll ask for the time. Stanwick's parents beat him for one reason or the other throughout his life, in his drunken, dull, dirty Erie, Pennsylvania. After the death of his father, an old father typed what he was doing and he really thought about his future, he advised him to go to big cities and take advantage of them - and not easily - and take the high road of life. (Note that I have seen the sensor version and not in vain - this part of the film has been rebuilt for sensors.) She and Chico (Harris) will go to New York where Lily (nickname: Baby Face) will make a much less smooth decision on the road and where she They want to go very fast. In the movie's most famous scene, the camera takes us from the floor to the floor of our corporate stairs, because Lily is sleeping on the top. He finally allowed himself big corrals of people and leaving his day work. Following the problem, and he is soon involved in a huge scandal. <br /> <br /> Stanwick wakes up a lot of makeup and most of the movies are cool like a cucumber because she does not examine one without any grief and she is playing a great innocent victim. In one scene, while sitting in a black dress, he looked at Zaheer's royal salute, which was decorated with diamonds. Then he asked Chikok for another case, and it was full of more jewelry, plus securities. All in one day's work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Teresa Harris was an attractive talent - she could play or glamor, and there was also a talented singer and dancer. Here, he sings or boasts around the movie theme "St. Louis Omman". He literally worked in dozens of movies and is very good as a friend of Stanwick, his best work is in the pre-era era. As an intruder tribal code, chronographs are often reduced after filming. <br /> <br /> The prakaka films can be more sexually and therefore they look 70+ years old, more modern. Even though these movies did not have the moral ending, Baby Face can learn her lessons - how it's life after life Many of the film's ending, all with the same message. There was an additional scene I saw, but apparently, the sensor did not pass the two other ends which had passed. (There was a code but the sensor was always.) At no rate, it is a handsome surprise. "Baby Face" is an important film in the history of film - must be seen.
