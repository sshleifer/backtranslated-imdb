First of all, I want to say that I do not spend time showing Portuguese movies in Portuguese and my naturally, every year or even somebody ... <br /> <br /> It is often the common idea among Portuguese people that national images are awful, really bad ! However, in the last decade, when we were in "Leo do Astr√°la" and "Costa da Castello" with their "Pulsekko Zero" films, it was a surprise to me to get back to the 40th fun curiosity. "Soto Nulla", director Fernando Fragata and some actors and music are both together. <br /> <br /> This is not the same, because it is not a real comedy; In fact, it is officially a drama, a woman's play has some unexpected fun part, which are ridiculous characters or ridiculous things happening with them, such as the Caribbean's fantasy travels. <br /> <br /> The plot works and can surprise us several times; Actor fine, regular position as score; But the truth is that it is all sensible, then we can count it as a great effort for the national film, which may start from Phoenix ash. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Portuguese movies, of course you can take good alternatives, but it can still be measured.
