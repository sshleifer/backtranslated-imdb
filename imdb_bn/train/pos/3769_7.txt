Oh, let's learn to have a little fun. When I was a kid, oh, this movie was Oscar worthy to me. I thought it was absolutely hysterical. One of the best movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Now, it's a little stupid, but come on. If you enjoy "great adventure," you probably have to be fun about "Bogus Journey". This movie was "Dude, Where's My Car?" Just one of these really interesting. Like to say, it's just a good time. It should not be taken seriously and if you enjoy the first you need to choose "Bogus Journey". It's just a fun movie with some memorable characters. Just for your enjoyment, watch it, go, and remember that it's a stupid comedy. All that <br /> <br /> 7/10
