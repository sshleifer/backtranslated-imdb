Hadi Lamarr and the entire front nudity are famous for launching the world, but it's so much more oh. In fact, it is one of the poems of cinematic poems, with a few basic works of the 1930s art film, same Paris under Paris, Tabu, Olympia, and even the same prestigious group under L'Atlant. It is almost silent, mostly depending on its miraculous images, and its superb, symphonic score of giuseppe baux. It is an excellent composition in cinematography and music, yes, and editing, directing, writing, and acting. A good 90% film comes perfectly along. Feel an expert using Machat√Ω motifs. Perhaps it can not be done as soon as possible and possibly even more used, but the presence of objects such as insects, light and horses makes the story better. The dialogue is small snatches, grateful, unintrusive. They do not have as much scarcity as they would have imagined. The final bit is weird to say, weird. Reminded Russian silence, we have a montage of workers. This story is certainly not understood, but it is so beautiful that I refuse to play too much on the error. Exstasy is a film that needs to be restored. This ever incorporated into the best movie made.
