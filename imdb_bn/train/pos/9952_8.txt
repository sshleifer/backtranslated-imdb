Before watching this film, I think that this movie, like FlashPoint, would be great because the FlashPoint was the last to watch the movie, and the first time I watched the first time in the movie, Zenna James and Brad Armstrong. As far as sex scenes are concerned, I was frustrated, I thought the sex scenes of the dream would be as wild as the flashpoint sex scene but I was frustrated. Apart from the sex scenes of Asia Carrier, no sexual scenes of this movie make me feel great (you know what I mean). Gen. Gen. Jameson does not have sex scenes she can do. Both the beautiful girls of Falossia and Stephanie Swift disappoint me and so far as sex scenes are concerned. <br /> <br /> Although this is an adult film, this movie is very good, if you exclude sex scenes. If the quality adult movie values ​​are concerned, then this movie must raise the adult movie values. Story, acting, direction, set, makeup and other technical elements of this movie are really cool. The actors of this movie have really played well, they all done a great job. Dreamquest is definitely raised in quality movies in adult movies.
