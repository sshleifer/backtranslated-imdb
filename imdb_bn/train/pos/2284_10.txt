It's a very cool, and most part, plays out a good thought. I am fascinated by the film not only for the plot and the superb acting, but also to create such a unique film. Most movies involving a spy or war are filled with a gentle talking Brit or a powerful fight, but this is not the case. It is not about such a war, it is about a man and the position of his life, the American spy in Germany, will never forget the support of any temple. When the war ends, Campbell thinks he will come home as a hero, but his true heroism must be officially secretive. While returning to America, Camellas met with Nazi supporters as well as Nazi supporters, both of which provide internal and external conflicting contradictions. The role pulls off more than Nolte, and it fits quite well for what the plot fits.
