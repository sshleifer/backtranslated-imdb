Riding giants is a brilliant documentary that brings deeper dive and patronage to one of the least admired sports with lots of people and raw emotions that can capture only the director Stacey Parata. From the structure, to the players, to the amazing stock footage, even the style that was portrayed strengthens the beauty and power of surfing. The surfing films I saw (Continuous summer, Bilaband, ODC, and step-in fluid) are among the most consistent and relevant. At the beginning of the early era of surfing (short history lesson) Layward's notorious journey has always been going on permanently, riding giants go ahead in sports, minds, and souls than any other documentary. How does it work? Our whole story, from beginning to end, without the jogging jogging from fiction or wave. <br /> <br /> There was a structured term to start this image. I have seen other films about surfing, sometimes you jump in a new person, new wave, wave, event to event, no knowledge why? In riding giants, we have a very small cast of veterans and newbies. This allows you to really go deep into each one. Also, instead of just riding a wave, we have been given more history and more personal insights than ever before. This is what really attracted me in this film. Instead of showing me such a big wave (instead of a big wave movie), we've been listening to stories and saw the first hand to overcome these surfers. I like the information about "beach bums" or dad surfing. I'm still floored in the harsh deep blue by Greg Pull and the amazing tale of his first episode. Then, seeing him personally, talking about what was going on in his mind, adding more fuel to the fire. Follow the parlata to follow the simplest framework and allow the game to move away with more knowledge than the previous films. Parata shows so much passion and emotions that you can not help but be surprised by what these brave people have done, and be amazed at where the game is going. <br /> <br /> Add some intense and creative painters to an intensive structure, and you have to darn around the perfect film. Using the techniques seen in Kid Stage in the film, riding giants create some scenes that seem like they are going out of the screen. Although it's not 3D, it's a flat dimension that you put two pictures at the top of each other. In this picture, it works. This created more depth in the scene, and in fact actually added the shock value (the man was huge at these waves), but the dangers that these boys constantly face. If they break down separately or they behave incorrectly, then this wave will kill them. Some died, but it did not stop the sport. It is only to create more excitement and better emotion. This is the ocean and the love of sports that took me to my final stage. <br /> <br /> The human element. Many of my travels around Surfing Documents around the world gave me beautiful waves, but very little about the people. Movies knew that people are waiting for the wave, so it can move waves from wave to wave, and probably a short second about the person. This picture was directly opposite. Parata has still created this best compilation by providing our wavelengths, but surfers and they devote more attention to the question of why Amar lives on this everyday. Which push them through their mind, which allows them to move forward, and create ties made on the wild blue wonder. After seeing this film I felt that I just did not know about big wave surfing, but also knew about mental aspects of sports. It is not as advanced as other elements and has turned riding giant into a whole new personal level. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was brilliant. I have never witnessed so much emotional, devotion, and love covered in structural sound films. From the beginning to the end I was fascinated. I would be very happy if this movie won Oscars for the best documentary this year and to see new regeneration in the surfing world and to open more doors for this type of films. <br /> <br /> Grade: *** *** ***** Outside
