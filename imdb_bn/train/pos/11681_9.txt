I have read a number of reviews and opinions about this movie, saying that it is an old film and performance by Clara Bow. Although the storyline was rather the characteristic of Clara's next silence, I still think it is a little heartwarming and incredibly funny. Clara plays a happy-Hawaii-lucky Hawaiian girl, the person who loves is not able to win ... This guy does not marry! Clarita's lack of humility was frustrating on this day, but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general interest of the film. Although clearly not a brilliant story-line (quite common, in fact), this movie is a beautiful exhibition of clerical skills to make audience humorous.
