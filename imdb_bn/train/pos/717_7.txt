Big Ramones fan I like the ramons, and I think if you hate them, however, you can not choose this classic as well as being busted with Bush. <br /> <br /> This is a lot better than sad Hughes teen movies. It's broken like 80 Better than American pie, which is now plugged in us. <br /> <br /> There are some other cool high school films: Switchbald Bones, First Times ..., Class 84, Three Wokk Hye, and Sugar Still Gripping (Not Feeling Possible) River Edge. But RNHHS will always be my favorite because it's funny and fun, plus you can go up and dance with it. <br /> <br /> I love you, Riff Randle. <br /> <br /> 10/10
