Yes, my love of Mario Lanza's fame was fame and is still popular. His voice was firm and steady, so strong that he decided to use it in MGM The Great Curtoso. Lanza himself thinks he was reborn in Caruso. After reading the book, written by Kostelanitiz's biography of Langer, he explained that constant practice and voice reading has become the spectacular carousel from Lanza. There is no doubt that Lanza has done a fantastic job, but the story is not entirely true; Hollywood blames it! I used to practice singing a year ago, and ten years ago I had to make myself very good before losing my voice due to emphysema / asthma. Reaching a high note of my love is not easy; But beautiful!
