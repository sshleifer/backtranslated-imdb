William Shakespeare will be very proud of this special edition of his play. This is not just its best movie version, but it is the only complete version of Hamlet. Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is simply gifted. Not only because it was written by Shakespeare, because it had the courage to do the whole thing, even if it only lasted more than four hours. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the Danish Prince and his plot to take revenge of his father's death, so I will not go into story details. However, I would like to tell you that the best part of this Hamlet version is not exciting set or amazing photography, but the interpretation of each character's actors. I doubt you'll find better Polonius than Richard Briers' delicious photo. Plus, you can not make mistakes with Julie Christie and Jack Lemon. Also, among the Shakespeare adaptations, a regular Derek Jacobi is a great opponent of Hamlet. <br /> <br /> Of course, we must talk about Kenneth Brangh. Henry V. While coming to the scene with his first tour with Shakespeare, he married the audience. He threw himself with Hamlet. Of course, the presence of Olivia was impressive, but I think Brangh's performance is amazing. When you look at him on screen, he often knows how Shakespeare wanted to play the role. The total mystery of how he was not nominated for the Oscars At least the movie got some nominations and even the curious choice for screenplays. Even though they see though they know they're well written. <br /> <br /> Finally, you will not get rich and profitable production for Bird's best game. The technical aspects would be awesome to say. If you love this game and are a fan of Shakespeare, you must check this movie. Even if you do not really care about Shakespeare, the scenes will keep you occupied for the movie time. You might not think that you will be able to sit through it once, but you will soon find that pausing this movie would like to see you more.
