Running Man is often dismissed as being the other thriller action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, it has a lot to do. Because people look at it and compare it to the terminator series, it is one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films. <br /> <br /> But, 18 years old, and you'll be able to appreciate it yourself. Different Lighting. Rather than being another brainless action film, it works very well as a reality TV parody. The book of Stephen King is really different, but I suspect that there is no doubt about whether it is a Hollywood, a seemingly ending and so-called 'ordinary man' who has been able to master trained commanders. Current form. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and the entire country is governed by the combination of government / mass media. Economics confuses people by creating tragic games for the sake of intensity, food less and state, such as jumping for dollars, where people jump for money on the dust dog hay, and by the most popular one running man, firecracker Kylian (operated by the entertainer Richard Dawson) A game organized where the 'criminal' theater, pre-wresting-esquire 'Stuck' by Shi The child is believed to be. <br /> <br /> Some, however, try and talk about the government. When a group of hungry people protested in the Bakersfield town of California, a helicopter powered by Richard's was sent to the 'quiet' (ie killing) protests. When Richards refused to fire innocent people, he was arrested and arrested for killing the public. He sentenced to a slave labor camp, but with the help of a Resistant Leader (Yaphet Kotto) escapes and runs on the run. However, his independence was long, and after the kidnapping of the employee, the employee Amber Mendes (Marya Kanchita Alonso), who tried to flee her, she saw herself again and again, but this time she would be seen in the running manager Is forced. <br /> <br /> And of course, the whole film kicks in the standard Arnie mode. Richards was launched in Los Angeles post-apocalyptic wortland (why did the LA always be destroyed in the Dostopian world?) And along with two prisoners fleeing labor camps were forced to flee from 'Stakk'. Amber became curious about Richard's protest of innocence and discovered that he was created. Then what will happen to him, then? So, Amber, Richards and two people are trying to avoid the stalls, we'll soon be aware that Richards is not a common police. He is Super Arni, an extraordinary army force which can lead to the collapse of evil corporate dictatorships and fight against thick men covered in Christmas lights, when he will become your average American man with Austrian accent only. <br /> <br /> Yes, the rest of the movie becomes stupid, high, classic 80's Arnie's fun. There are many exciting war sequences, trademarks were terrific puns ('he was my favorite'), and the final formula ended in final clashes and blessed. Kielan responds most of its 'geographical' games hosted by the West, and it turns out to be a few wonderful times to hear, in contrast with the crowd, visually appearing as a host among his relativities. For the old lady of curse!) And the cold, the royal man will actually go to do something to make a rating. <br /> <br /> If you expect a high quality, intelligent film, you will be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick, well, it's But the great thing about this movie was quite a prophet. <br/> <br/> If you look at today's entertainment, you will see how reality TVs are going on today - by showing themselves to show the five minutes of the show shown to interested people, and the producers are all willing to humiliate themselves on TV. People are trying to get the right to execute direct TV on TV TVs that are not laptops that are very laptops. We've already got it, however, by posting on the Internet, the ghostly al-Qaida hostage videos posted on the Internet. It seems that in the current weather, at least some people are fully fined with actual death in their television sets. Keeping this in mind, and all this seems to be combined with all these things that today's 80's revival, you have to be impressed by this film's vision. Of course, we have not yet reached terrorists as mainstream media, who have easily purchased the programs available on human deaths easily, but you will be surprised at some time before finding out how many times before he could find a way to make such a show choice The desire to entertain people and to await their terrible curiosity Who gather ...
