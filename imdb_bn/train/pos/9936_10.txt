It was one of my favorite series when I was a child. The Swedish Broadcasting Company has decided to broadcast several times in the summer when I finished the first semester of my medical college. I was surprised to see the limbs explained. Sure, some things are simplified, but most of it was right (though it was made 22 years ago!) And fully understandable. I would recommend that all the medical students should see it. For example, this is a great way to learn basic basic words. Now I'm in my seventh semester and I think I'll see the series again as soon as I bought the DVD box :-)
