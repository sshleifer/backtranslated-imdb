A show made in the world of hidden Frontier Star Trek. The story takes place after the return of Voices Delta-Quadrilateral. It has some characters from the official Star Trek show, but most of them show show. The show Star Base takes place on Deep Space 12 and ships in different places, which gives it the opportunity to not show an official show. There is a growing scope of domination of characters, which do not have any characters in the Shows with only one Ship. Spaceships have good computer animations in this show, but the acting appears in front of the green screen and it gives a green spot around the actors. Not all actors are equally good, but most fine. Episodes are character driven and develop on characters over many episodes. It's more than the Babylon 5, compared to most official Star Trek shows. The hidden frontier tab also takes that even the official series shrinks from using. All I enjoyed watching it.
