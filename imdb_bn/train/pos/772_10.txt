Love is very much ... in all its manifestations ... Excellent, absolutely fantastic ... Tudor Chirala, Maria Popstasu and Iowa Baru, a true dramatic story of love for its size, a story about the unknowable way of young heart, life and lost innocence Managed by Tudor Giurgiu skills. It's all about the taste of the yeast of love with a fantastic soundtrack featuring the fontlines and Chris Martin and the Vera Wake ... is really amazing ... it's really awesome ... Is it me or the Romanian painter gradually but definitely going forward and achieving respect? It's a brilliant film ... everyone involved in up to two thumbs up.
