National Lampoon Class is a classic comedy film from the early 80's, which adds unique characters, lots of laughter and some great music from Chuck Berry. When Walter Bellor graduated his high school graduation from his classmates with disrespect, he got the opportunity to take revenge for his class reunion. One after another he called his classmate, a innocent blind girl, a horny lean, high school beauty, all props kings and even ugly old lunch ladies who chanted all the kids during higher education. This film contains a terrible element and it has a few short scenes of sex, so I would not recommend it for young children, but it's a great movie for teens. You can not love class reunion if you are looking for a beautiful score, complex character or a film about killer special effects. If you want to sit for 90 minutes and get some great smile and lots of fun (and who does not) then this movie will see a list of your movies. ++,
