I was impressed with the beautiful photography of this photo, which was in Alaska. Although technically a melodrama we see Eskimos involved, such as hunting, dance, iglus etc., and their customs, such as their wives offering to the audience, in regular stories. Sometimes there were hunting sequences from the stock footage, because it was easy to recognize some backing projection scenes of animals, but even it was interesting. To be hunted for the sparrow fishing, waler, caribou and even smoker beer for salmon and a whale thinks it's sometimes like a documentary. There was no cast list, which strengthened the documentary smell. The filmmakers feel absolutely pure, it is only translated into the language of the Eskimo language or with the local speakers on screen or by the intertitles. In the introduction, the white businessman and Royal Canadian Canadian police, the film did not have an actor, but it was not strictly true. The two leading characters run by Mala and Lotus Long were Eskimos, but professional actors with credit for previous movies and you sometimes see their makeup. But they did their role nice and they have a Hollywood carrier. All in all, the film is definitely worth a look.
