This is a documentary that I have given to UK TV channel More 4 and I have to say that I think it is very interesting and exciting. I would seek out the book that was the source material for this documentary. Basically, some parts of this world society have been successful and Professor Jared Diamond theory about why others did not. The argument presented to me was new to me and certainly the fate of the right-wing crop and the right animal that may be capable of pets, is certainly reasonable. As the documentary itself described it as a good modern documentary loot that is not much of a re-created scene with good shots and well described. While trying to send a message to the people of the Diamond, many help the intellectuals not be able to blame. People claim that his theory is Marxist but I can not buy it and see it more social geologist. Refreshing to hear a theory based on the evolution of society, not based on religion. Highly recommended.
