To rate this movie, you must think about its supposed version: Children They had more guidance for creating this film (i.e., it can not move away from 1st to some humor and language), whatever was in this movie was all fun and enjoyable to watch. Sequels usually make me nervous, but this one is pretty good for myself. Knowing that as George did not get the Freezer Star, they were accustomed to humor and I believe that they did a great job as Shomeman Leadership. The plot is easy to follow and perhaps the camps fit fit for young audiences, but if you want to watch a movie and hope for honors for the Academy Award, it is not that, but if you want to see a simple, fun, powerful movie you will have a better To choose.
