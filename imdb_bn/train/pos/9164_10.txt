I have recently seen this production in the DVD. It has been since it was originally broadcast in 1983 and it was right to remember. As a first thought, it seems to be outdated and I think it's a short date and very sound as it goes back to BBC serials. (I miss the nice costume dramas that seem always on the afternoon of noon) but it can be as perfect as it is apart from perfect. This is my favorite book as a bit of a "Jane Irie" purist and I have not seen any other production that is a faithful for the book as this one. I recently read the book again and some of the dialogue is okay. When I finished the question about Rochester Jane about St John, I noticed that their words were completely reproduced on the Dalton and Clark screens and they were completely completed. <br /> <br /> All other productions are missed by any means, some leave the "river" family and their connections with Jane. I think that this "Gypsy" scene is the only product to complete. <br /> <br /> Welding is perfect, as described in the book "Little Plain and Dark" in the book "Little Plain and Dark", and I disagree that he looked too old. Timothy Dalton may be a little more handsome, but perfect as Rochester, perfectly illustrates every aspect of his character and stops his socks! I agree with another comment that he thinks from time to time is very scary, when the scene is interrupted when he moves slowly towards the church, his expression is horrifyingly horrific. But then in another favorite scene, when Jane goes to the morning and her arm after announcing their love for each other, they are very happy to see. Wonderfully illustrated and completely trustworthy love. Love love people! Although some scenes were weirdly absent, for example, when Jane roamed the bed with the deceased Helen and when Rochester bought Zen for her wedding items (I thought that one of them was probably playing my memory tricks) <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, if you do not see another production of Zenner Eyre - you'll simply easily see that it's just perfection!
