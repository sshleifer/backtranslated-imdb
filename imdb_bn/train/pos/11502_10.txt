As one of the forty-four city explorers / longtime fans of Original Coaches: Night Stalker series from my childhood, one aspect not really mentioned is that the character of urban search Karl is directed during the series. He always managed to get himself into the cavity or tunnel, leaving a great after himself. Just armed with the help of his trusted panlite (okay, so there were some flares in the forearm tunnel) and his camera, he did not take any other gear for his protection or any other search. <br /> <br /> There are so many, I recently bought two pilot movies and the next TV episode DVD Box and are reconsidering all the shows. And even though I first saw them in the 70s, it seems that it has gone for more than 30 years ... many of them seem to be new again. Campi, date and cheesy - but charming and extremely entertaining. They just do things like these days. Now all his reconstituted spin off with predecessor letters and plots. Thanks, my 16-year-old girl is sitting with me to watch the episodes and developed gratitude for her (she enjoys it). This hope and confidence series will bear a new generation of fans for years.
