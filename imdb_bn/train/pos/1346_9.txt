As a "rebellion" in the top 100 of AFI films, the British Film Institute has a documentary work with Martin Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Now. I am proud of seeing big films and many movies. But, I'm comparing to my statue. In this superb (though long) documentary, Scorsese watchers walk with viewers at various levels of American film. It is divided into different sections, including western, gangster film and noor. Full of animated enthusiasm, Martin Scorsese is a great travel guide as well as a fantastic professor.
