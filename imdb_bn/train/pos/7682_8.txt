Holi addresses the issue of child sexual relations across the world (about 2 million children are trafficked every year) and without sensitivity and manipulation - the priority film team is successful successfully. American actor Ron Livington starred in the film alongside new actor Thu Guenen, who played the actress Holi in Vietnam, and together they come to Cambodia's notorious K11 red talk district, which is common to the people. Although it tackles a serious issue, the film leaned towards the sunny moments and hoped we would know the closest characters, preventing the two-hour film from happening, which is very difficult. I am glad that such a movie is focusing on the problem of the world. Child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step. This is a great film and must be seen at all.
