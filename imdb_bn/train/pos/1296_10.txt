It is a very difficult movie to watch, especially it is focused on the intimate core of our life. But eventually it's a very nice and deeply moving movie. Anyone who seems to be unreasonable, I must say that they must have missed the point of the full message in the film. For those who actually see the film, they will see how problems are dealt with, and the result is finally lifting. Of course, it is very difficult to see, a difficult subject and even brutal. Yet it is highly relevant for society and everyone. At the moment, the world has taught what the movie is doing (I will not restrict that word to France only) and everyone should try to see it. I would say that it is good to enter through a clear mouth until it is driven by a conflictless outlook and let the film work for you.
