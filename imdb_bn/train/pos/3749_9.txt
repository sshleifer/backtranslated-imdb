I laughed a lot while watching this. It's a fun short concert with a fun musical law and disagreement. Characters are easy, but their simplicity adds ridiculous style. The dialog sounds funny and often unexpected, and seems to flow nicely to everything from the first line to the end. Max has, apparently led to an awesome life. And Edward has, he does not want to make sure that he wants to live life. My favorite character was Tom, Edward's crazy boss. Tom has a small role but a memorable one. Really recommend for anyone who likes funny ridiculous. And a bonus which you can find it online now! I'm a fan of Jason's cartoons and he can not wait to come out later.
