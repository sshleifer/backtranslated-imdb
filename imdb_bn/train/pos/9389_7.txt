Red Rock West (1993) <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage entered deadly crime without first knowing and Dominic's growing threat, adventure and misfortune in the 1990s wild savage American West. The Red Rock West is often brutal and sometimes sunny, and the cage pulls off with a mixture of its usual sardonic intelligence and with caution. <br /> <br /> What is the plot? Yes Dennis Hopper is perfect as a crazed, almost desired killer? Yes Stand a chance in the cage? Well, you have to see and see. It never gives up, and I saw this for the first time. I was surprised to see yesterday, how good it was, how well it was built, and at the same time how much of it was Macbro and fun. <br /> <br /> Director Ron Dahl (who helped in writing) is more known for his TV work, but with the rounders and this photo he shows a stupid hand with exciting plots. It is protected by its humor, and by caricatures. Times lazy, police suspicious. And do not miss a really inspired cam by Dwight Yoakam as a truck driver.
