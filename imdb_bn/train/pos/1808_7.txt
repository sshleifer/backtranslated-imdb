All dogs go to heaven, like an animated kids movie other. Gambling, drinking, death, guns and hell are all important in the plot, and even though the kids will find it very low, why adults would be forced to think of their film as gangster film, they would enter into their head. Actually, the film is not clear in any way, it is an odd combination just for the filming of a child. <br /> <br /> Charlie Barkin (Bart Reynolds) is a player who is half-casino owner Carface (Victor Tayback) with his partner. After being drunk (a dog .... being drunk ... in a movie, it seems weird.), Charlie was killed by cheating and caraphax. When in heaven, he finds a way to return to earth, but he will no longer be allowed in heaven. He still goes back to Earth and meets with his old friend Itchi (Dame Deloise) and plans to pay Karfax. Meanwhile, Carpax's little orphan girl Anne Marie was captured because she had the great ability to talk to all the species of animals, which helped to predict. Charlie and Icchi free her, and trying to help her find her family while learning a lot about herself. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the few non-disciplines that appeal to both children and adults. Children will enjoy funny characters and animated animations, while adults will enjoy beautiful, sweet plot and more than normal ones. One thing that puts it down, it's a musical instrument. Generally, this is a good thing, but here the music is virtually terrible. Along with almost any backing backing, they officially advertise the word of advertising. Actually, it's probably the worst song I ever heard of an animated movie, but fortunately the rest of the film is a bit strong enough to be separated for some of the bad notes. <br /> <br /> This movie works, but I hate it honestly. It is sad, but happy, but more sad than happy, and makes a sense of cinema a necessity. Considering how bad this serial was, I want to conclude that the finishing will not support a sequel and it is tied in a beautiful, beautiful happy ending. I think about it in some of the films, but I do. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a nice family movie, even though throwing odd themes, good entertainment. <br /> <br /> Out of my rating *** *** *** 85 minutes Yes
