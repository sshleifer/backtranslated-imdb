The 'Hippie', a wonderful jewel called 'Hippie', was set aside by 'Father Ted' Arthur Matthews and Graham Lion's next creation, although this pair was created - six scripts were written only by Arthur Matthews. <br /> <br> Founded in London in 1969 - Hippie Ray Purus, editor of an Anarchakata magazine. Her friend is her flat-mate, very back-to-back and smoking alcohol alcohol, her 'girlfriend' feminist jill and someone is very bright Hugo. <br /> <br /> Simon Pegg was pretty as Ray, but he is pretty cool in everything. There was a feeling of 'Citizen Smith' about this sitcom. Roy tried to defeat society, many like Wolfie Smith, but sadly failed. At the end, this season will be released on DVD in March, I can not wait to buy it. It was a repeat on the terrestrial television in 1999- My memories are not very good at Citcom, but I really remember two episodes, the first is the 'Protesting Hippies' opening I think a great start. - where Roy went on a protest against Sandeeper and the other episode was Hippie Dippi Hippie, which I think was 4 episodes, and quite a bit about the police. Sadly, Citycom's negative reaction has come from the audience (why I can not remember). The BBC formed another series commission, but due to negative reactions, Arthur Matthews will decide against him. Oh well, I can not wait the DVD. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Hippie Dippie Hippie - Series 1 Episode 4.
