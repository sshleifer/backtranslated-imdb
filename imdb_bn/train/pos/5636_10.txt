In "Blave New Girl", Holly comes from a small town in Texas, singing "The Yellow Rose of Texas" in the local competition and entering a prestigious Art College in Philadelphia. From there the movie grew into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I like this movie. It was great songs and was full of characters and characters that kept it moving at a very beautiful pace. Of course, acting was wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsay were outstanding, and the camera work was done well with Nick Roth and I was very satisfied with the end (it seems to be making a sigle). Kudos the director and others who have participated in this production. The film archive is quite a jewel.
