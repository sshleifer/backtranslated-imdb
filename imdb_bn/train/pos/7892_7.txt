Frandy has been funny from the horror, this 6th installment of the Nightmare series. <br /> <br /> It took two years, actually it happened 11 years later. And last childhood death at FREDDY Elm. On the street without a single, John Doe (5 Jacobs to Jacob, even this picture indicates that) he and other children came to the streets of Elm. Freddie does not want her only, but she also gets her daughter back to Elm's street. When he finds out what's happening, he and the other kids decide to kill Frendie once and for all. We also see Freddy's some weird background. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Who has been known for a long time in the nightmares. Many people hate this picture, but I like it. Friedie tried to get out of what he was doing with his ad ... COMDEY and the series make fun of the horror so this picture really speaks a comdey sore. It does not bother in the series, part 2 still holds it. <br /> <br />
