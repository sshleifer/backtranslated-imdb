I saw a real crime when it was first released in the mid-1990s and I saw it many times. This is a great mystery about Maryam (played by Alicia Silverstone), a high school senior in California City, who is tortured and killed by a classmate's younger sister. Mary Tony (played by Kevin Dillon) who is a cadet who sees how bright she is and how she decided to work together to try to find the killer. <br /> <br /> Many suspects in this regard. The real crime is very true to me. I read a Newsgroup review where someone has written that the total suspension of disbelief exists here and it is true. Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nun did a great job as another great actor. The positions are correct and the author / director, Pat Verdukki has highlighted the real life of the teen and the reality of loneliness (see the scene where Mary Tony saw the picture and then wakes up from the sequence of dreams). I want to make more movies in Varduchi. <br /> <br /> I did not see any other movie as a genuine crime. 10/10
