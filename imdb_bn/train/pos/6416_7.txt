Honorable star Cuba Gooding Jr., the real life navy Dale Carl Brasier who was the first African American Navy Diver to deny a man's navy. Sometimes beside him and sometimes his opponent Karl Brashear was a man really appreciated. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert Deanaro). Sunday hit a lot of shocks, the excitement that Carl Wilson wanted to become. <br /> <br /> I love Cuba in this picture. Here's his screenplay-free and strong like Henrik like Dancell Washington. Through every scene we can see his emotions, motivation and frustration to achieve his dream. As we journey to the glory of his father, we can see his struggle in him. I like how the director has created and what has created some tension in the diving scene. Brashear's facing heart with a submarine during a salvage mission is close and bright. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I can see is the supporting cast. Cuba and Dingo's characters are very complex and exciting to watch. Which makes you a little sad when they have a butt head with such a two-dimensional supporting letter. Evil le CMRR. Hendes, Sunday's wife (Charlize Theron), wonderful diving school colonel (Hal Halbrook) and Cuba's love interest were not found to be too deep for me. These characters can be more important and more effective, more time for their development. Why was his corner always his tower? Sunday's wife was so annoying and always drunk? <br /> <br /> Another strange question is. What happened to Carl Brasier's marriage? This means that if this picture is a chronic person's life then there will be no important event in her marriage? Maybe it's just me Honorable men, the perfect example of human soul leaflets and beliefs. This movie will be inspired and you will feel for this person's struggle. I believe in which this powerful story was told. My hat goes off to you Carl Brashear. I really appreciated your strength. <br /> <br />
