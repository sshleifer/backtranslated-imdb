I love Jack's jokes, 'The clich ... ...' or 'the man at the top, the black, the oily skin, the soft-witted ... "He is just sunny! Daniel caught on her! Good thing, Jack has no other team (otherwise) Or otherwise it would have been fierce! I just love all the plots (season 8, a little less, I have to admit), the characters are great, the actors are superb, I have a face from Jack, Daniel and Tylak. I'm starting to express (and more) ... it's just all theoretically possible and exciting ... oops! I go back to them again. Sorry, I started to take careter's features, and all this is driving my parents NUTZ !! !!!!! Well, in conclusion, I think it's good for more than three seasons, especially if they continue packing episodes with all these humor, drama, action and more !!!!!!!!!!! !!!
