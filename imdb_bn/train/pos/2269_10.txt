Recently I read the novel "Mother Night", I have now got a DVD ownership for some time, and it's often seen. The few films that I saw and watched as much as I thought of maternal and asked, I'm just surprised by the brightness of Vanguat, but I am surprised to see his text on the screen. <br /> <br /> Do not rent or watch this movie in VHS, it must be done in DVDs and it must be accompanied by a movie's direct comments. How they took a fairly simple story, its components and conversations are still complex, and it worked so well, I think that any visitors will be surprised. <br /> <br /> Movie mistakes are less text, and do not solve much of it, the movie can also be that book, and the best adaptation I have ever seen. I suggest both books and movies together that it is only doing a disgusting thing to see <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
