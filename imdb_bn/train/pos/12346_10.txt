This is a very fine and poetic story. Beautiful scenery. Magnificent music score I did twice in Japan last year and the film gave me this general Japanese feeling. Camera movement is fantastic, as well as actors. It's deepening your feeling without becoming melodramatic. The Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here. The director plays gorgeous with a color of light and shows the audience that it is possible to enjoy a movie with a fine and fine description. Once you see this movie you want to see more from the same director. This is a real movie and I can only recommend it to everyone.
