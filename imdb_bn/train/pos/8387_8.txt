This first part of the BRD trilogy has more passion and plot density than Lola, but the magic of Veronica Voss is less. Political statements point out to them: We lack the aftermath of the war, how Blackmarchar was able to control the daily life (when the fasibindor plays at a pleasant moment, then he tries to sell his entire set) Siligul Clest, who commented that burned books were very hot Does not: he really kindles the fire). <br /> <br /> There are some oddities in the first hour. The scene of Maria Rooms with black soldiers should be hampered by Harmon's appearance. When Maria meets Karl Oswald, the scene of the train falls into GI's insulting state - I cracked, it was very bad. But as the story develops and year after year, I used to paint more in this shiny, cold world.
