**** Includes Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> I have been a horror film fan for many decades now. Just when I think I've seen all the great ones, another one surprised me pop-up. I have not seen this film before. It was a treat, the beaten track was closed ... not just on the way to the swimming boat. There was a horror film made in the 1940s that dared to try something differently. Beautiful girl (change) is fearless for change and she protects people from love, from monsters! How to do that for a turn. This girl was totally opposite to most of the films of that time, she did not shout from her shadow, she was not afraid, she did not even want to leave a thin leaf. This girl is not afraid to live in a isolated house far away from the rest of the village. Not just that place, the area of ​​the trek was on the fog. Hack he even takes naps out of swamp grass ... Replay is like a regular 1940's version. No snakes, gator or ghostly strangler will dare disturb this gal. The books of early feminist films should be sure to include this contrary work. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan like me, look out among the wonderful atmospheric classic B / W Horror films made in the 30's only. 40s And do not forget to wear your cast iron turtle throat for protection.
