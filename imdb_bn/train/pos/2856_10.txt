This is a movie that is better when you see it. It's packed with many original and abnormal ideas that you can always find a new story. In Sabur's next film (I still can not see "lucky monkeys", but others as great) failure, opportunity and humanity play a great role. Cutting and Montage are innovative and artistic, without the "art" pictures of the film, but also a very entertaining one. When comparing it with "Run, Lola, Run" you should remember that "Rage Rana" was created some years ago and was shown on German TVs in 1997 ... so it is more likely that it worked as inspiration for Tom Tykwer Its movies, and other ways are not nearby. Other supplements to review I would add that I liked and loved the end too. This movie makes so many fun in many ways and it does not get annoying or alarming to send messages.
