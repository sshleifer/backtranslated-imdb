11 Oscar nomination and zero wins !!! Still do not understand why - the movie actors did not do anything better, then you can create it by offering awards for Hellboy and Denzel Washington - Hypie, Oprah, Margaret Everi, Danny Glover. Etc. - It was all amazing - I'm not interested in getting the discussion script in the Oscars of that year ... It will go to the crying-desire-particle section for the judges .... <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary book - but The truth of the style of Alice Walker's writing style is that there seems to be a way too much of her characters - so I'm glad they took some of the screen adaptation things. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was amazing - African scenes make a lot of lives to be desired - African parts of the book should be set in Liberia - somewhere in West Africa - but oh! Steven Spielberg thinks the world is so stupid that they can not think outside of Africa without Safari - so yes our complimentary zebra and wildlife scene should be seen when we all know that there is no one in West Africa - and why most people say Swahili - - Who speak Swahili in West Africa? I was just getting out of that way ....... <br /> <br /> But as a story - amazing, making movies - out of this world - classic yes !! <br /> <br /> When I need to own it and restore some of my soul I watch it
