I really love this show really! I've always liked Space's Ghost's 1990s show! This event was ridiculous and I can not believe it would be such a funny show as the adult swim in the cartoon network. I hope they will keep this show on DVD or anything. Show about BRAC (from Space Ghost Cartoonis, SG CC and Cartoon Planet), who likes to drop his mother and father and his best friend in daily life, the joke! My favorite episodes were where Zorac got the sound of this real song and his voice did not give him any money from singing Zorak. Another episode I like, where Brac and Zorac have not finished their homework, and then they return from Sunday to Friday and they just stop and then they go back to the day of discovering homework, and then when they return, the current homework did not exist! I like another episode, where Brac's father and neighboring Thunderkill's robot entered this surgery and then they could be eaten by a giant insect. I like another episode, where Zorc creates a deadly stand and then some new people take his position. I like lots of other episodes! Zorak is being beaten, bursted and zapped when one thing that fails to make me smile!
