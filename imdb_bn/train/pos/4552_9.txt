My left foot gives Daniel Day Lewis one of our best performers by an actor. He is credited with Christie Brown, who is Cerebral Palazzi, who has learned to write and draw on his left foot. Oscar is awesome for her and Brenda Fryer who plays her loving mother. Hui O'Nona is a wonderful and little Christie Brown and Ray McNally is like a father. Observer valuable for outstanding performance.
