I used to watch this show when I was a little girl. Although I do not think much about it, it must be said that it was a beautiful show. Also, I do not think I saw each episode. However, if you ask me, it was still a good show. I remember the theme song impossible. Everyone was ideally cast, costume design was great. Performance was very grade. I hope some networks will bring this series back one day so that I will be able to see each episode. Before I wrap this up, I want to say that I always remember these shows in my memories, although I do not think I've seen each episode. Now, in conclusion, when and when this show is brought back to the wind, I hope you catch it one day before it gets heated in the air.
