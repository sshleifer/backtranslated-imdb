The famous "famous" for their tension and cartoon release style, where semi-major characters are terrible dangerous, only the last second hero will be rescued. This particular Kasper can really remind me where death really has a hand. But even after death, there is still a happy ending. <br /> <br /> In the famous studio cartoons, the constant is that "good times always win". Popeye always gets her spinach, Baby Huey always foxes foxes, Little Audrey always "teaches her lessons". And some FS cartoons are really dark and depressing. <br /> <br /> You will pay their credit. Lonnie Tunes and "Tom and Jerry" as much as I love, I do not think anyone is pulling out more cartoon products at that time than the paramount. Color, animation, music (great Winston Sharples), editing, voice. They were consistent and suggested in the art form that the best was a shining example.
