Tom Cats, Jerry Mouse and Spike the Dog (Here, Boych, his third name, his second name 'killer') decided to sign a peace agreement to love each other. It's weird and a bit irrelevant to see all these friends like them and think their friend feels very much. But at the end thanks to the disagreements over Steak, everything becomes normal and how it should be. This spotlight will be the second of three in the new Spotlight DVD, and I have no idea why this was. This cartoon "Tom and Jerry" spotlight collection can be found in one of the DVD discs <br /> <br /> My grade: B
