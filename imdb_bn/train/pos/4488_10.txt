Here is a favorite Tom and Jerry cartoon for Halloween perfect. I knew it was not unsettling, but the 'technique' like "trick or treat", as Jerry did with Tom's dark darkness and hanging with a collar shirt to create it like vacuum-cleaner. A ghost; But still would like to put my list of Halloween cartoons In short, Tom was listening to the "Witching Hour," a ghost story on the radio and was scared of horror stories. In the Halfway Story, Tom is having dramatism (late hair, neck heartbeat, ice cream coolness). . . Literally. And Jerry is watching the whole thing and laughing himself, thinking he feared Tom and feared him. <br /> <br /> I love the end, it was a little fun. And you know, this short is the first of four cartoons where Tom mommy to attack the juice; Others are Lonesome Mouse, House and Mouse and Night-Witty Kitty. And this is the first of the twenty-five cartoons that Tom speaks. Others are Lonesome Mouse, The Jat Cat, The Million Dollar Cat, The Debugorder, Mouse Trouble, The Mouse Come On Dinner, Cool !, Trup Happy, Solid Cerated, Mouse Cling, Texas Tom, Munch Mouse and The Bit Chuck Jones Down and mouse.
