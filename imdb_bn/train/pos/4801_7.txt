In 1964 we saw my entire 9-year-old family on black and white TV. My father seems to think, "This is how it can be - Adam and Eve." When Adam found Eve, I remember the scene, his eyes became black. I asked my father why his eyes were black and he said he was tired and hungry. Although this episode has not been seen for 45 years, I remember it clearly - with the home broadcast television broadcaster, the headquarters of the headquarters, with the final view of two walks, Adam followed his pack and the eve. It may not be the artwork of the industry, but in these years it has an impression on me.
