This is one of the best comedies ever on television. One of the seasons was Hilary as the following season. The only reason I gave this show is 9/10/10 in the unfortunate final season. The only good part was in the final season. My favorite part of this event was the scenes of people's perspectives, which often featured characters from the 70s in famous TV shows or movies. This is a rare show that I liked each character (without the final season ... a new character was too late to develop and fez was not nearly funny). The comments of your ass did not ever get old's feet, Kelso's stupidity. To keep Bravo so good show Fox, even long
