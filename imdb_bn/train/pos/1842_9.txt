Start Series 2 has been a great start! I do not think you have seen Series 1 to understand what is happening, but feel a sense of some character like a series and take care of what is happening to them. And this show makes you feel like that! This 4 30-something woman seems to lead to faded and exciting life is still provable and realistic. So twists and turns are exciting to reach their love and sex life thanks but you also know that these problems occur in real women too. How we decide on women's opinions, and sometimes we throw some specific paths in our lives to make those decisions awake!
