"Nothin". There is nothing in the room 237. But there is no business going on here. So stay outside. Understand? Stay out <br /> <br /> This achievement of psychological horror has never been achieved like this movie. All this and correctly rated the highest rated horror film. Jack Nicholson is a great actor and one of the greatest performances in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's about a family that has been going to an isolated and serene hotel for 5 months in winter. Then the father (jack) is almost overwhelmed by the horrors of the hotel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is constant reference to danger, death and fear throughout the film. Each scene used in red is used. Red is deliberately done by Kubrick? Of course! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films. She loves to mislead the audience of all her movies. <br /> <br /> I will talk about this movie for the next few months. It has an infinite depth. <br /> <br /> Conclusion, this is the foundation of horror and excitement. A terrific composition of terrorism 10/10
