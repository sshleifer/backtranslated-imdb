Of course, the plot, script, and, especially in the cast, is firm. There are many beautiful things to look at. One aspect I like, especially the idea of ​​the opposition - Luiginni (Turrurur) - Former adviser is doing his evil work on the side. Her chess rival - an Italian radio in three pieces and rattan - turned out to be a real gentleie, and really fine chess player. For his achievements, "rival" ends the plan to completely finish the final game for the challenge (after many talents, Luizin is sad in a window, but he is released), after the death of the widow (Emily Watson), due to the iron box of honorable chess master Allow Luigen's defense (which he did in the last moment of cleverness) to play him It is. Praise the game of the Italian Mr. and call it bright. Talk about a dramatic "last game!"
