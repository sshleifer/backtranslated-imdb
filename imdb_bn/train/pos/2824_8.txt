An analogy of how Garcia Garbo's American film debut is how our life can be removed and how our lives can be removed by our actions, as well as on a bank, on our way a part of our own. <br /> <br /> Great Lionora, a poor peasant girl, is the character of Ricardo Cortez, Don Rafael, who is a zamindar. Ricardo loves her very much, but very easily influenced by her proponent mother. Leono became homeless and traveled to Paris, where she became a famous Opaque singer and developed fame to be a exploited woman. In fact, part of his attitude is boring on Rafael's abandonment. <br /> <br /> She returns to her home to meet her family and eventually beat Rafael. Wonderfully no one knows that the legendary La Brunna and Garbo have played her role as her real diva and in the next film she is very valuable with great pride. <br /> <br /> <br /> Valentino shows this part, and was prepared to make Valentine Clone by MGM, although he never thought he could be really And he was right. He is credible in a helpless part as a weak deliberate uncle's son, and at the end of the film himself, but surprisingly permits. When he returned home he failed to win Leonora, and after he followed him, his courage is undermined. <br /> <br /> This movie set with beautiful warm storm sequences and set in beautiful times, give authentic look. Old timer Lucien Littlefield, Tony Marshall and Mc Swann also have some subtle secondary performance. <br /> <br /> While it's the story of lost love and the possibility of missing, I do not think Leonono and Rafael were happy together, because she needed a more traditional wife and she was a very professional lady, and I do not think We were happy in a small village. Last life is true and no punches pull. See it as a pioneer of Garbo's American film debut and coming as a pioneer
