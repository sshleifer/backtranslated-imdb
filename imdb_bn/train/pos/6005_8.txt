Although this picture has been slightly sanitized (because it was created at a time when people did not talk about sex), it would be a very helpful small film to show progressive girls so that they could know what to expect during a menstruation. Not surprisingly, it was provided by the quote company, although many are surprised that Disney has produced this film - in the 1940s, the 60s, she has produced many educational films. Although the film was well-formed, I think the filmmaker missed a real opportunity. Instead of a beautiful female storyteller's voice and a relatively soft scene, it would be great if it used Minni Mouse and the rest Disney gang !! I know it gave a heart attack to the old Walt, but wow! However, although the concept of sex in the film is rarely indicated, it usually interprets menstruation. However, I lack a few details (especially about sexual relations) which I was involved in accompanying booklet. <br /> <br /> Now, I wonder why I saw cartoons about menstruation.
