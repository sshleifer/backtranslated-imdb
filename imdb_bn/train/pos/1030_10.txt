I've made it and made the Babylon 5 as the best television advertising series. Both are standing in my mind because like the initial star tray series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and letters. If you saw the original star tray and star tray: they were fine shows, but there was not a whole theme or plot attached to all episodes. In many ways, you can see the sequence of events completely without any difficulty in understanding what is happening. This incident was less than the DP Space 9 (its final wars, which were involved in the final episode) and in other trays, because they had more than one story that was united. This agreement seems to have evolved into an idea with Bablon 5 and has seen even more with SG-1. The following line is gradually taking shape in many ways to see this series as a family or long novel. Sure, there were some "cast" episodes that were not connected to everyone else, but these were very few and far away and were usually very fun. <br /> <br /> And when I said funny, I liked the SG-1 period that kept mood light and was not so terrible. In this way, I've actually enjoyed more than Babylon 5. Jack O'Elay was a great character in his love for disrespect and Homer Simpson - it's really bad that he gradually got frustrated with the series in the next step. <br /> <br> In order to truly appreciate the SG-1, you have to see it from the beginning and see how complex the plots work. This consistency shows the exceptional stable ability. And, if you do not like SG-1 after giving it a fair chance, the scientist may not be the norm for you.
