Disney, which was once considered innocent and suitable for all ages, stood up for the film, finally realized that it would be more diverse to survive. In the last few years, such diversity has become very clear. Films like "Tarzan" and "The Empert's New Grav" have tried to move from Disney's past traditional song-operated routines to new, unknown areas. "Atlantis" is still the most bold step, but we must keep in mind: it's Steel Disney. The first serious movie coming from Disney's Animation Studio is a great achievement for them - it's actually so serious that it becomes PG. Probably being afraid of many families seeing this summer's summer. <br /> <br /> But despite more mature content, it is still a movie that the Disney Cable does not want to draw with the audience, so the plot was easy enough for the children to understand, but to take away from "Little Mary" etc. Strong enough <br /> <br /> What we get is actually a possible detailed plot, unfortunately the 96-minute movie is experiencing a narrowing storm. Finally, it is an action film about Atlantis, not about the exchange before it, so we can see as much as possible without losing a screen bomb with the first half hour. Suspend your mistrust about how the characters can reach the point B from the point of view, you can not find an animated film that is coming out of Hollywood in detail! If you want the details of the epic in the plot, then turn to James Cameron's "Titanic". There are boats in one of the two movies. <br /> <br /> and talk about love, right? Yes, with most movies, lead males (one milo stitch, an explosive archaeologist) and lead ladies (Kida, Cleated Atlantian Princess) fall in love with each other. But what I was looking for was as much as I was hoping. At the end of the film, the character touch / feeling / kissing sequence has been reduced for more than once. The picture contains different points where the attraction increases, but it just does not say, "The Little Mermaid" (a good thing). <br /> <br /> You will probably understand that it is a rather clichéd film. Correct. If you have your leading hero and heroine, who continue to drive the back up by half-dozen crew members, the film is being given their moment all the time. Many other characters appear, screentime take a few minutes, then disappear. Does not it take a talent to math ?? There is not too much time to expand the characters with a 96 minute film with focus on action and visuals and a significant cast. So what does it depend? Clichés, and many of them. Each character imitates something that has been done thousands of times before. Do you have explosive scientist, attractive princess, asterisk colonel, rich brilliant, mental slug, Russian female cat? I want to go <br /> <br /> I do not know why anyone got it ?? I found the tongue-in-the-goal nature of this photo quite funny. All right, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really want to leave Disney every feature in their history? At least authors have tried to come up with malicious dialogue, and sometimes it is even a little inspired. <br /> <br /> But at the end, these large backed scenes lay on this cake. The CGI animation is really amazing in places, and does not dull the characters, which is an error that is recent "Titan at". Down Speaking of the characters, Disney creates a maker of comic artists to create designs, bringing anime style to the film. In fact, the visual presentation of the whole film gives many an anime, much more than any previous Disney auctioning. It created a conflict with Japanese anime fans "Nadia" for the overall harmony of the film that matched the cartoon series. If I do not see this animated, I can not comment. <br /> <br /> With the picture, there are words. Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! Sound stages from the first shot are alive and a treatment. James Newton Howard scored us a dynamic musical instrument, which always congratulates the movie, does not always congratulate the film and always helps to create tension or maintain it. <br /> <br /> Probably what I think manufacturers intended for. To me, the film says that it's a adventurous adventure thriller, although it has a much more serious tone than a Disney movie before. If you do not like the impressive tongue-and-neck attitude, it may be glad to see the effort involved in the philosophy. Hack, at least mythology is much more accurate than other Disney effort ("cough * Hercules * cough '*). <br /> <br /> This is a positive, 10 reviews out of 10, anyone who blows away this film. I always suspend my unbelief with no animated film .? After all, the laws in the real world are often more than broken into the cartoon medium. So come back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps Ai can find something to enjoy this movie.
