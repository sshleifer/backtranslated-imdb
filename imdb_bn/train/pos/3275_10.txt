I saw this first 10-year-old film. Unfortunately I could not see it until the end, because it was circulated late at night. Now I bought the DVD because I can remember that I liked it. <br /> <br /> This is not really a common horror movie. It has some awful elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy. I like it but I expect a little more awful and scary scenes. Especially when the scene comes when Ana's father tries to kill him, he is a little brief. <br /> <br /> Plot now This movie suddenly happened to be sick about a young girl named Anna. Although he is sick and lying on his bed because at his higher he is going to finish his drawing about a house - the paper house. When he fell asleep, which often happens instantly, he finds himself in the big green field. He realized that the room is exactly like him and his new vision is also visible. One day he used to draw a boy in the house to talk to someone. She forgets to draw her legs (because she is sitting behind a window) The boy can not walk. Later, the doctor told him that a boy is also a strange disease and he realizes that the boy who got hold of him also got the boy in his annoying dream. Notice that he gets hard and difficult for him to wake up from his dreams. When she went abroad she missed her father and took her father home. She made a mistake and is looking too angry on painting her parents. She tried to make him out of the rubber but realized he could not change anything already painted. And the next time he started falling asleep in a horror. Her father is crazy and blind (because she marks her on her head as 'illegitimate' ***) and tries to get into the paperhouse and bring and kill her friend. His dream became an awesome nightmare. They managed to escape and killed his father and Anna might finally wake up. Getting inside the hospital gets more than what her father is sitting beside her bed. The doctor thought that he had fallen short. They told Anna that another boy is dead and they insist on going on the tragedy to the ocean. Anna draws a watch tower and notice that the same watch tower can be found near the hotel that went to the hotel. He goes to the watch tower and meets the boy (I'm not just mentioning his name because I can not remember it and do not want to go back to the previous HTML page) and I can say it well and forget these horrible dreams forever. <<br /> <br /> I did not understand anything in movies. First of all it ends up which I absolutely dislike. I think this is a very long time, the main part of the film becomes very small. How can the boy fly the helicopter and tell Anna that he will die? Why do you have to keep such a stupid radio on the wall? I hate that scene because it was so stupid to me. It almost destroyed the main horror scene. <br /> <br /> What I liked was the pictures of their parents, which were the first real horror and horror scenes. I liked the boy. The actors were horrific. She was better than fetch. When I was asleep, he tried to get out of his father's hand out of painting and how he liked it looking for garbage. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie. I give it a 10 out of 10.
