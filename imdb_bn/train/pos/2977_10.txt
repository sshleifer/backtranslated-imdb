I want to use a lot of words to describe this movie, but I can not really do it? This movie is simply a movie you want to sit, laugh, cry and then see pee. I'm serious Do not see this movie if you're easily offended by pornography, sex, nudity, homosexuality ... and everything related to nature. Being a woman, and it can not even be a reason, I can see this movie over again. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are absolutely bright. Along with all their other debuts, I think the Base Cat Ball Award winner. I'm now thinking about the stupid things about some movies in the sunny. To see the movie !! What I'm going to say is everything. It's hard for me to leave this comment because I'm a man like Ozir Osborn, who puts cursing words on almost every line when they talk out of their mouth and make laziness out. So I'm keeping it professionally. Best movie Hack yes !!
