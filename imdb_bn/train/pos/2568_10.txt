In 1989, Action Comedy Classic K-9, Detective Dowelli [James Bellouci] and his dog Jerry Lee came back against the cricketer, but at this time they called another detective [Christine Tuchi] and his partner, an average Doberman named Zeus, It did not meet very well. Dowley is mostly with its new partner. All changes that goes along with the movie. The movie is intense, because one of them is really trying to kill Duelie for the past. There are some dramatic scenes related to the death of Dowlin's wife, which do not seem to be from the sound of the film because the rest of the film is a joke about action cricks, dog pop jokes, fart jokes and bad guys biting dogs. In a specific area. I think that is very less humorous, but it's actually something very funny. I did not see the comedy of this movie, I saw it for two reasons. The first is because of the big James Belushi fan and the second verb function. James Balushi was more fun than K-9 and his action is even better. It was nice to get more letters back to K-9, but it's still a fun movie. If you are a James Balushi fan, you would love this movie.
