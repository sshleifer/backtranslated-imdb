Viewing a "feeling" is a very satisfying experience. Unpredictable movies are so annoying, when someone comes up like "Implus", it's something to hug. The script is logical, and highly creative. Meg Tilly, Tim Matheaneson, Hume Crone and Bill Paxton give credible performance. It can act like a zombie movie, but "imperes" are very different from a boring "jmfestest", and the fundamentals are illuminated by almost every scene. Although the script is a true myth, you feel that something like this could happen. Opening up the credit roll from "occupier", you will be fascinated. Very entertaining and definitely recommend. - Mr.
