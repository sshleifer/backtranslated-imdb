How can anyone love this movie? I think it's a ridiculous folly of old gangster movies! If you do not meet them, see this instead. Michael Keaton has some kind of role in this role. Whenever a person speaks English language matches and griffin right is a weird D.A. I play, but my favorite role is going to be Joe Piscopo. She has all the good lines. Danny Davito, Alan Hell, Ray Walton is in this star-studded film that the gangsters used to get far more fun than the "Mafia" for landslide.
