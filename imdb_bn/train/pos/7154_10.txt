I heard from the public hearing the "Holus" movie that it is not usually Disney, which both came in the story of both children and adults. Friends, tell me I was not disappointed. "Hollos" based on the novel Luis Suacher and follows the courage of Stanley Yellnats, who is a boy who sent a strange girl in the desert camp to the camp. He made friends with a boy named Zero and together they started adventure that changed their lives. It was a very interesting, unique, varied and interesting story. I do not quite know what to expect from what I saw it. It was interesting to look at the story as a puzzle piece. Children who were very funny in the criminal play of children and Mr. Voight was just as ridiculous as Sir. Now I have seen movies, I have to read books. Most recommended!
