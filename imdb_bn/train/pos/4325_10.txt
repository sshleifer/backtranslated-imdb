This version of Black House is the best adaptation of a classic novel I know. Chancery Court's presentation as 'character' in the play is extraordinary. Acting from the awesome, terrible Tulkinghorn, Dedlocks, Smallweed, Crooke, Miss Flight, and two young lovers. But it is the spider web of spider that holds the whole thing together and the film is fantastic Does the BBC have made about copyright, which means that this video is not seen in the UK for a long time in a video or a DVD? I have tried to find out from them, but facing a stone wall. In the end I got a DVD copy from Canada.
