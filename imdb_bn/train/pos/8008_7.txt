As far as I know, this event has never been repeated at the end of UK television after the original run of '60s / early' 70s, and most of the episodes now sadly "missing missing missing" are missing. The series 6 has been in its entirety since 1971, and recently I got the chance to see it all in the best part of the 4 decade. <br /> <br /> After returning home from school, the frayillers were essential for me and many. My Contemporary Flair Troubles, Slaydas and Chicory Tip Those halcyon days back. And it again brought a nostalgic tiller to the observer throat. <br /> <br /> Bad / hammy acting, strange fun scene, plot holes enough holes for running a huge ocean running yacht and RADA access to "horribly, horribly" leading players. <br /> <br /> No - forget all that. Because the frayillers are the age of drama in the garden TV (I dare to say "golden" because of bravery), when the shows were just about holesome fun and did not take ourselves so seriously. Today the authors of today's screen are obsessed with all the harmful "ishaus" who have become mad like the relations of their young heroes, pregnancy, medicine, STI etc. <br /> <br /> No doubt this is "a modern audience" On this day of accuracy, the image of the boss will be black woman, a young man hero will be a Muslim, another person is confused white girl about her sexuality.  ে এবং মেয়ে হবে স্কেপস থেকে বেরিয়ে আসা এবং তাদের নির্বোধের দিকে তাকিয়ে থাকা সত্ত্বেও আইকিউ-র সাথে আই -Q-এর একটি সর্বাত্মক পদক্ষেপ গ্রহণকারী - অন্য কথায়, ওয়েন্ডি প্যাডবেরি এর অভিশাপী, গোড়ালি-স্প্রেনিং ওয়াশার-উচ্চ থেকে এক মিলিয়ন মাইল সরানো হয়েছে। <br /> <br /> This is a show which is "too many" of its time. But is that a bad thing? I do not think so for one.
