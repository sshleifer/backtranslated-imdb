Verhoeven's movie was complete and full of trash. He is a director who should be a disgusting hack and be ashamed. Through his admission, he read two chapters of the book, got annoyed and decided to start the whole thing from scratch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is It basically steals the name, cheating the politics of the book (which is a good part of it) and threw it in some T & A, so the average stupid American moviegoer is not disturbed. <br /> <br /> This anime ISN is perfect, but it's at least correct, I can say as well.
