Think about it for the day after watching it. That's a great movie's sign of me. The wide shutdown of the eyes had the same effect on me. I needed the end of this happy Hollywood cookie-cut, tired of these people. I plan to see the plot again a bit better this night - however, the emotional message of the movie was fully realized.
