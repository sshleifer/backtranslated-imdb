I have read several reviews in this movie and I have to say "what's wrong with you? !!" It was an excellent film! I thought the film was fantastic from the beginning and the story was very well spoken. I am convinced that people who do not like this film are not paying very well to the film. Here are a number of important scenes that if you are not paying attention then you will get confused and do not understand the following scenes. I do not like anyone to see this movie again and see it alone so that you can really pay attention. The story has made me perfect knowledge and as I said it was very well spoken. Each scene in the film has a point and fits everything together at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> All actors have done excellent work! Shawn Connery was always very well as her role was as well. Laurence Fisborne was pretty as Tanya Brown, playing a very interesting character. Kate Capshaw was an excellent touch as well, and looks fantastic. Blair Underwood was a wonderful surprise, I did not really expect anything from him, but he stopped a great performance. Ed Harris was the original gem. She plays a really sick person and really makes you see how disturbed her character is. His eyes are his eyes, just superb !!! Also, one of her first roles is a very small scarlett Johansson (as Kate) ... is not a bad place to start. Nice cast in this photo! <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who does not like a Cast member or just like Thriller. This is a great movie and should be seen. Do not listen to all these people's opinions, watch movies and come to your own conclusions. I hope you will see this movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as you like. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> - Chris
