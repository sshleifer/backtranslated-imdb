If the answer to this question is yes, then you will have to enjoy this nice movie. I just saw here a few hours ago in Paris (where the movie is working) and still feel the huge trail back to my eyes ... no visual shocks! I have never seen such a beautiful black and white picture and have seen such a drastic change in animated movies. I firmly believe that there will be "Renaissance" before and after, likewise we have seen Pixar films or Akira and Gostinetell experience. This is a real success in the small world of animated movies and I hope this French initiative (a little less familiar French studio, which is a dream of some young people who have a dream called "Renaissance" ...) will be successful and recognized. Vive la France!
