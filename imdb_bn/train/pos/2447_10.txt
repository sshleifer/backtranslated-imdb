George Lopez never caught interest in his stand-up comedy and he still does not. But this show is a work of art. It is never seen that Jokes smiles when you smile in mind (and the joke that is memorable). This show is simply an enthusiastic look and character ranges from old, short drunk to a dalexic teenager. I do not know who wrote this show, but that person did a great job. If they continue this program, I am sure that it will get positive feedback from critics of this great country. If you are looking for a good, traditional comedy then George Lopez shows up for you! One bad thing is the title. George Lopez? Really? Think of the Bell-Air's new Prince as "Will Smith". Come on, man! But otherwise, this show is the genius! 10/10
