As always, there are controversial movie mixed reviews like this. You love it or you hate it and everyone will not like this movie. It's important to consider the killers' viewpoint, which I think personally. You can hate them, you can feel that you can understand and claim them, but this film will give you a thought about school shooting from different perspectives. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> It has been fully stated from the point of view of the killings that their "mission" is leading the whole day "Zero Day" outside the family, where they plan to massacre at their school. Zero Day does not answer, but only shows a glimpse into the lives of two troubled young boys and lets viewers decide for themselves. Our feelings towards boys are something to mix in sympathy and hatred, but yet we are confused why two ordinary young boys will do such things. They are surprisingly normal, lead to the common life of ordinary teenage boys and if we do not plan that they do not expect any plans they make (they make it clear throughout the film that no one else knows the plan) <br /> <br Two actors considered extremely unknown, acting extremely well. We can only expect to see more work from both in the future. Although it is a fiction film, no one can help but notice the obvious similarities of the Colombian. Calvin and Andrei are mostly like Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, (not so much in beauty, but in the way) anyone who studied Colombians very widely, I can see duplication and it is often dependent on it. <br /> <br /> The genocide genocide is shown in school surveillance cameras and one of the coolest things I have ever seen. I was full of shocks after watching it, and it is a feeling that is close to some time. It is very realistic and well done, and it is very difficult to see. All <br/> <br /> <br /> All are a wonderful movie on Zero Day, and I think everyone will check it at least. In the past, we have always been easily branded killer "psychopaths" and have assumed that they were both biological wired for disaster or media impact, but Zero Day shows that sometimes the objectives are deeper than them and we never understand why until we see the murderers' perspective From the time it was seen that the school was fired.
