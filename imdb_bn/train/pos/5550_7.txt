This is highlighted in the 1917 feature. The Pran of the Clan tells the story of a young girl, who became a descendant after her father's death. On an island off the coast of Scotland, the villagers have a simple life of "fishing". My copy is very dark and sometimes hard to read, but the film contains some stunning ocean scenes and the camera work in boats is great. In this beautiful picture of Morris Tourney, Piccord indicated. Pickford was already a major star in 1917, and this image seems to have been written for him: Lucky young girl succeeded with bad luck. Pixford whip of sluggish villagers on the church is very funny. And the final scene of sinking ships is done very well. Not a great pickup film, but still see the price. Matt Moore (Picford married his brother, Oven Moore), love interest, and as good as the son of the Streaping Island. Latriss Joy is one of the villagers, but I could not spot him. Adds an eerie feeling when my copper bells and lots of gongs intersperses and gram warnings are rung bells. Very effective
