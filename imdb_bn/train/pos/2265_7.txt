I am very fond of Vongut's work and I love this movie very much, but I do not say that it is a movie of Mother Night, which I read. When people say that Vongat is impossible, I think two things. Many of his themes are fake or even close to banned, although he has sometimes chosen relatively "easy" goals for his mockery of charges against him. As long as the filmmaking passes as anxious, less money is earned every day. The directors are seeing these days reproducing in broken tabos and I now have high expectations of the "bluebird" version in production. The innocent piece like Vonnegut's "silly serens" may be equivalent to "and" if it is published within 50 seconds, it is also expressed for its violence, language and content of sex and content, but it is a tragedy that is still a filmable script for it. Come up with And in the current economic climate, I hope some directors are closely monitored in "Gelbard", "Galapagos" and "Hock Pocus". <br /> <br /> Another thing is to ridicule its descriptive style, satire on it, but still make it funny. It seems impossible to think it is impossible and it seems to be the biggest obstacle to producing great movies in his legendary novels, because the little author's comments that often color our reactions like readers are "takawars". Vongut suggested that from his illustrated edition Missing himself as a writer / narrator, his credit, "Champions of Champi Ianas "(film) tried to keep the comedy and came a bit of a crop for its pain, and another touristic means another turkey made from Vanguat novel" Slapstick "was done. <br /> <br /> Still the director will not make any mistake He gave a personal explanation to Vengsu and a great example of how the "Mother Night" has been placed by it, a good director, a tea in such a source If you can, you can add new poems, but you have lost so much humor that although this is the same plot, it is not from the same novel in my writing. If it is, I've probably been rolling in some observers laughing, for the novel reader, Shiny forgiving But the end of the movie is really ruthless and I think the success of the movie is that it can truly make you feel that you have seen someone walking on a razor edge in good and bad and the jury is still outside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are some minor but tedious errors in technically, especially consistently, Most of the times it hits an acceptable note and occasionally shows significant imagination and encouragement. Actually acting is a high order, even if dialogue is stilted slightly by today's standard. <br /> <br /> It is quite good to look back with "Slaughterhouse-5", and in fact there are quite a few "good" portraits of Vanguard, most of its short stories - "Harrison Berggeron", "K Mango this time?" And some other things, of course, the misfiring film version of its funny but disposable game, "Happy Birthday Wanda Jun". It was also an existing piece, if it still exists, it has been done in 70 "Between Time and Timbutu", which clearly did not like Vongut, although he was involved in his need, because he felt that it was a mistake of his generality Explained. He said it reminds me of the surprising surgical trial performed in the story of Higgs Wales "Dr. Moreau Island", but many people work as a wonderful role in his work. <br /> <br /> But if you do not want to go to the sources of higher sources, they are not working on them. <br /> <br /> As people said, less or less, big shows inside your head.
