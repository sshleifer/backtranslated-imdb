It's a great, ridiculous horror film that understands how bad metal music was guessed until the mid-80's. When I was a baby, I was curious to remember when I was a teenager. It does not help me that I found an unclean grave in my graveyard at the age of ten. These kinky metal babies dug up some old bodies and the devil turns out to use some strange sacrifice in their bones. So maybe for some time, I can disturb me from metal, but now I like it at the age of 24. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD used for 6 divisions and I asked to suck it due to the lam cover. , But my surprise, ruled it. It's all about metal extreme demonic power. And vaporizes headbangers in a guitar shoot lazers and crowd where you love a scene. This movie is great, if you love 80s of metal and bad movies but it's for you. 9/10!
