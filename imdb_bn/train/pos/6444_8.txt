The line, of course, from the Lord's Prayer - "Your will be done on earth as in heaven". Sweden, especially north of north, is not my idea of ​​heaven- 30 degrees Celsius is a little lower for me, but the good people who live there think that they are in God's own country. <br /> <br /> Here is a familiar story. Praised international musician Daniel broke medieval health care, he returned to the small village of North Sweden where he was born. Persuaded by the local cleric to help with the Church singer, he turned into a class act of some unlucky genius, and they entered a competition held in Inner Austria. Models of "Calendar Girls" and "Full Monty" dancers are echoes (sorry) for band players of "brushes off" But of course, he would cause a lot of mental uplift because some villagers understood their values ​​and rebellion against their oppressors. He faces unfavorable husbands and increasingly suspicious cleric, but nothing is going to stop him from death. <br /> <br /> Despite some stupid stories, we can learn and, like many characters, who are seen as human beings, despite the recognition of "type" instead of the characters. Am I surprised that the wife and son are being kidnapped for so long? Sweden is a country where such violence in the world is strongly discouraged (he was also one of the strongest men in Daniel's youth), and a secret passion for women's magazines was a bit of a stereotype, but surprisingly it was realized by Nicholas Falk. <br /> <br /> Michael Nunavist is simply wonderful as Daniel, I said, how are you going, finally I ran for noon, I guess, but guess what Daniel said he did. .
