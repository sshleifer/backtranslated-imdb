When I missed the chance in 2004, it was definitely a documentary for me to see, so I'm going to see the repetition. I'm really sympathetic to the film's main character, because it is true, my skin problem has a mild state, Dstrofic Epidermolysis Boulosa (EB). It's a sad, intense skin disorder that is sometimes fun and very emotional about the boy. Johnny Kennedy spoke like a child (due to the loss of muscle muscle) and puberty, but he is 36 years old. Most sympathetic moments are peeling off its horrible condition, and its bandages. Jonny was a naughty feeling of humor, even while showing his body in the coffin, he even narrated from outside the grave. He told his story with the help of his mother, Edna Kennedy, his older brother and celebrity model, and Johnny supporter, Nell Mac Andrew. It won BAFTA for Best Editing and Best New Director (Factal), and was nominated for Best Sound (Factual) and Flhhhhhhti Documentary Award. It was the 100th best TV show in the 2004's year. To see a documentary!
