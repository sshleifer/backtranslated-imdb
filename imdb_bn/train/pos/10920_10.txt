I recall to see this movie as a kid. I do not think where I saw it. I will be about 14 years old. I thought the movie was incredible and wish to see it again. It once came to the Kung Fu channel, but I miss it. I was really bummed. I have seen today that it is the best special effects Kung Fu movie! I highly recommend it, and now I've discovered where I can get it, I can enjoy it once more and come. I also want to see this return for this phenomenal film, some of which have spoken a lot.
