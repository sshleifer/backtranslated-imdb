Stardust is a very enjoyable, very fantastic, and cinematic story rolling together, tells the story of a young man living outside Starford's story of a young man living inside him, it's just living, young and beautiful. A king whose king is going to die, says that the King has published a contest for several boys, who can first restore the ruby ​​as king, when a group of wizards want to create a dark star and use them to keep young. These three plot threads are well-matched together throughout life, well-played, superb special effects, and mixed as some hard feelings and humorages. Stardust is a funny movie and star like Claire Dances (I could keep an eye on him for some time) Michelle Pfeiffer (I look at even more magical power even more long time) plays a terrific witch, it has some interesting performances Robert Deniro is a national-boy wind of perfection Chinese game. As the main character of Character, Charlie Cox is rich and trustworthy and we got some good work from some people trying to kill each other steadily and steadily to act as a boy. Mark Strong, Jason Flaming and Rupert Everett both played their role in both life and death (this whole thread also loved). Peter O'Toole smiles than anything on the whole film (beautiful feet) in my whole five minutes who play the murderous killer father and watch for funny people Ricky Garvis. But the real power of the film is the novel of blue gaiman and the script created from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates his own legendary story and his own world and it works.
