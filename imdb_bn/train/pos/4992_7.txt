I'm usually hard to find Loretta Young, very concerned with his appearance and all the wrong ways too ladylike. But this lyricist is in the romance of Frank Borzage, and although he is playing a little-respected Paty, who is fully intensely persecuted from the premium sponsor Tracy, he is direct and honest and inevitable. It was a strange little movie, mostly played by a room in Hooverville's room, which was frustratingly romantic and idealistic. Tracy, playing a cheating, hard-to-take "regular guy" who, by today's standards, is terribly lean and stupid, softens the tough edge of his character and almost makes him attractive. There is good support from Margarita Rambeau and Glenda Fahrell (who did not want to get to her), and Jo Swing's screenplay is modest and functional. But the real heroes Borzez, who always love the lyrics and love the youth with the true love drama. You want to hijack her and tell her character wisely, she is very good for this guy, but she is very low and persuaded, you see their story satisfying at the conclusion.
