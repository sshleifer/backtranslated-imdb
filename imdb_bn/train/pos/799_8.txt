She is impressive narcissist and manipulator; In this case, the attorney (and the killer) portrays Tom Capana. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We are sorry for this situation, but at the same time other women (including Rachel Ward) Behind the kidnappings also become hateful. <br /> <br /> Sadly, she is actually helping her self-help problem, and Capano actually killed her psychologist. Believing is very difficult, but it was based on a true story. <br /> <br /> There is a camio with Olympia Dukakis (Excellent) as the mother of Kopon. After all, an interesting story because it is based on genuine murder and you want to read Ann Rule's book to get the right details. 8/10.
