Yes, other critics have already said that it can not be alcohol L and H but it's too much to be their worst job as the 20th century stupid ... I mean Fox. To make some mistakes for the boys, this movie must have original ingredients. But it is their serious method and consistency that makes them fun. Like other comedians, they do not play laughing, but they take their work and the situation seriously and that is the essence of their endless humor. In this picture, they face some of the fundamental issues that may be encountered today by any of us, such as job pressure. First, we will check out with a doctor and he will take some necessary rest and probably stay by the sea. That's where surrealness comes at all. L & H always accepts a maximum possible compilation and exaggerates it, but at any moment to be incredible, sometimes without a bit of time. This makes us smile because we can relate to the efforts of their creator and exhaust. Stan and Olie Public makes their appeal public All elements in this picture are presented in a joyfully grateful and impressive slapstick way. Their best was probably not the best because of their previous work because they were the last original film for Rome because they wanted to mirror "big" studios and especially to create features, and wanted to hurry up and finish their contractual obligations. Big mistake They all must stay together and probably have to stay for more than five years. The world may not miss this consideration as their alternative. See, smile, and enjoy this as the last great performance of them.
