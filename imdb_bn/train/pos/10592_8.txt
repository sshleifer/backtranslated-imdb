The happy story of the Pimlico community in London, after an unreleased WW2 bomb blast, the Royal Charter has found that the area they live in is part of the bus. <br /> <br /> This movie works because it appeals to the idea that many of us have made our own rules and do not have to listen to them. A stiff cast in British Stalwartes, especially the Stanley Hollah, makes it more credible. There are some wonderful moments in the film, such as when people leave the supply and others in London start throwing them on food and other things beside barricades. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> <p> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> The producer got some rights.
