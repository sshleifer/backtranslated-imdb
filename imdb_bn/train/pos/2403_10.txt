I have to warn you, it has some spoilers. But to stop it, I think the "Spanish judge" got in February. It was mentioned that the last copy was, but as I see, it was not ordered back. But both ways, I have it. I thought it was good. I mainly wanted to see this because of the actress Matthew Lillard (I did not think of any comment in the review), though it is like a budget, but getting enough money to spend this movie. Man, no good actor <br /> <br /> This story is about an artist known as Jack (Lilyard), who claims to be the owner of the name "Spanish Judge". If the Spanish judges do not know or do not see the trailer for this and if you read the first review, then I will not say what I say. I would have a big turn to someone who knew what it was. She needs protection, so she keeps a couple in prison, Max and Jamie (Vincent d'Anfrio and Valeria Galino) as well as a crew named Pies (Mark Bunen Jr.). He is a girlfriend who will not tell his name to anyone because he is from Mars, as he said. So they (chiefly Jack) call her "Good Girl". Everything started fine, but then it turns into a big game. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some scenes may have worked well and the score may have been a little better. Some of the scores were actually good. The theme is like a good song they used for the start and end (before the credit), that's my opinion. Ultimately, the war scene may be a little long and a bit violent, but what can you do? Another comment on Matt: Hmm, he plays a smooth, moldy con man. <br /> <br /> I know it's a review, but one of my critics, NeCRo must correct: Valeria Golino is not a new one. According to this site, he has been acting since 1983. To me, and hopefully he "hot shots!" To others Both are familiar with Charlie Shane's Italian love interest. Movie But better review. <br /> <br /> Although I think it is one of the rare movies and although it's really good (for that reason I gave it 10 stars above), I would give it a grade of what I thought when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
