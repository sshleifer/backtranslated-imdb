I also come back from an advanced screening of Redei, and of course I would say that I did not have fun in a film many times. WES CRAVEN is never his best. He brought an amazing end to our summer thriller. No thriller this year ... No doubt. <br /> <br /> All actors are amazing and action realistic and fun. F / X was great. It definitely created the mystery. I was in most of the film on the edge of my seat. It was a time when I heard the audience cheer and clap and got excited at the theater. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for thrills, action and a good plot this summer, REDEYE delivers it. See it!
