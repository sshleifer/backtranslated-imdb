In the middle of the 70s, a real screaming situation, the comedy was a huge hit for about 5 minutes and disappeared from the face of the world. I am often amazed by some comedy films that have a big release in a week and then disappeared: High anti, chap detective, black bird, now do not see we are shooting ......... and today there are no profiles . When this comedy was in Norman in 1976 and everyone saw it, then it became laughable and sometimes it never mentions it. Famous for shooting in video tapes and moving to film, a test at that time, Norman is a princessally wrongly locked Kulaseet family, which the Farley Brothers should be restored today. If they make it in the first place, there will be no complaints about the content and the slant. It's very funny and yes too rude and ridiculous all wrong. Just like it should be. Actually these 1976 film with all the horror colors and clothes as a groovy it actually works well today.
