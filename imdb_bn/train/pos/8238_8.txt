I liked this movie very much. Although acting by adult actor was great, I got to find the little kid a little tough. But he carried himself very well to achieve new talent. Humor is very nice and most like Hollywood comedy junk in your mouth. Meaning professor Dr. If you have a short attention span and it is used in general Hollywood stuff, then it's probably not like you're a bit slower. I pick it at Blu-ray and I have to say the top notch of the quality of the image. Perhaps I saw better in Blu-ray. Extra was very cold. They deleted quite a bit, but perhaps it's a good thing because most of the deleted scenes have added something.
