My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much. Visitors have moved away from modern life in old Japan, at the same time very recent themes have been unveiled. Characters are realistic and detailed; This is an unexpected end and the story, which is very refreshing. This story is made up of small plots in the lives of a few gays living in a poor city. I totally recommend this movie to real-life romance in Japan or interested people. <br /> <br />
