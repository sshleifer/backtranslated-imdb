Michael Powell and Emeric Pressberg's great talent are remarkable in their wonderful "life and death issue". It was played at Walter Raid in New York. Powell is part of recent respect. Especially this film shows us one of the best British films of any other era. <br /> <br /> "One of Jack Cardiff's issues" was a great painter of life and death, who knew how to do wonderful work with a camera. Especially impressive, contrasted with the monochromatic tones given in the game of heaven, and when the paint job returns to the Earth. It was quite a coup, and its times forward. Black and white order involving long stairs where Peter and conductor chatting will be one of the most wonderful things of any film. There is a lot to say about the film in this forum, so our comments came from the great actor Powell and the Pressberg, from a larger, eminent cast who responded well to the director's guidelines. <br /> <br /> David Nivene, whose plane has been hit and his best friend dies as a result. This photo is m. One of the highlights of Nivon's career is the highlight. He showed us in this movie as he is an excellent film actor. Kim Hunter, like June, was surprisingly well, the woman who spoke to Peter about his plane fell from the sky. As it's fate, Peter and June fell in love with the first look. <br /> <br /> The best British movie actors please share this photo with their presence. Robert Coote, Bob, is admitted to heaven, but he is surprised that his friend Peter never trip with him. Marus Gerrin turned out to be a wonderful star, who steals the conductor 71 film. Mr. Garing, who has worked with managers, is one of the best in the film. Also, Dr. Roger Livisy as Frank Reeves, one of the best performers for his career, as well as Raymond Massey, who is seen as Abraham Farlan. <br /> <br /> "A matter of life and death" is a ruthless film that will always be grateful to its creators.
