There are two different types of movies in the world ... There are "English Patient" types, which can not be annoying to enjoy something that is not enough to show in PBS and type "Happy Gilmore", for which genetic puns an hour and half $ 7 worth. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is a ton of gray area, but you know what is favorable. If you are an English patient, save you time, save your money, and save us all your "Oh, this movie is so bad and stupid" comments. I know that the movie you do not like, is totally enjoyable and every person likes them but you can stop it once. <br /> <br /> But if you are type of Happy Gilmore. .. Go see this one ... you find it ridiculous. Tim Meadows has created a sunny character, and Will Farrell continues to be just some of the things he has. Check it out. You will be glad you And that's okay.
