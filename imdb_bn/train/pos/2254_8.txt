Fox's epic story of the United States's greatest pioneering effort came in some really extraordinary "extra" DVDs. The Brigam UNN ("Frontierman" was added for European release), a great pioneer leader who spoke about this story, who came with the inspiration of the members of the Sermon Mormon Biswas (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) in the Lake Valley. After the massacre of 1847, their prophet / leader, Joseph Smith (played by Vincent Price) was brought to the screen in 1940 after the United States entered World War II. It was a bold step on Fox's head, Daryl F. Jankoo, and it was a breath of new wind for the depressed people, because it was the first film to show their faith in screen on screen. Now Fox, working with James DeArk, has brought the film's DVD format to an outgoing version of the movie, by the Bureau of Excellent Motion Picture Archive of Brisam Young University in Provo, Utah. Mr. D'Rique, who worked his doctoral studies in the film a few years ago, has provided one of the deepest commentary tracks for the DVD. He distinguished this fact from the truth and explained the listeners to understand why these films are so much appreciated by audience leaders. One of the interesting bits of information related to Dean Jagger, who played the role of actor. After many years of the film, he married a lotter-saint and finally converted to LDS belief. There's a lot to learn from D'Arc's wisdom and it's great as part of the DVD! More than 100 images of Fox and BEE archives are with discs and seven incredible premiere newsreel footage on Salt Lake City's theater. Thanks Fox for another extraordinary DVD - and thanks to James De'Ark for your great comment!
