Very straightforward ... this show kicked back on day and continues to outline cartoons today. I can not wait to track some of the DVDs to share with my little guy and see the same spark in his eyes. I introduced him to Voltron (5 lions one, 15 cars not one) and one day he told me, "Dad ... when you were a child you saw some nice cartoon !!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Man oh man ... 2007 has been very long hair for summer movies. <br /> <br /> Okay, I'll shuddup now <br /> <Cheers
