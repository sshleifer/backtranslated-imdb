Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre for themselves. Among us, there are 'Officers and Gentlemen', 'Top Gone', 'GI Jane', and now 'Man of Honor'. The fact that this fact has happened is not the same as the formula that it is the same as the source. This image is probably the same as 'GI Zen', because it focuses on the digitization angle. <br /> <br /> The story is really inspirational and perhaps the story of the best human interest in the above mentioned ones. Carl Brasier (Cuba Gooding, Junior) is undoubtedly a man of great courage and principle, and his power of character brightens in this picture. Unfortunately, there is tunnel vision in presenting the character of director George Tilman and the character of other characters except Brass has exceeded development in order to show brasseroses in constant problems. Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and without a preliminary view, some scenes with the boxing and his wife, we do not know much about him. For example, Brasier sees the snare of Sunday birds and we can assume that he has done a haor, but there is no follow up in that point. Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only a small scene through which we can judge him. The rest of his screen shows him pacing and ranting around. If a director is going to create a story of human interest, then he must make the characters human. <br /> <br /> The Cuban Gooding Junior Brasier gives amazing performance. Perhaps I saw him the best. It is a role and a character that he is much more complete than before and he emerges on this occasion. In 'Jerry Maguire', Rod Tidwell was an impressive, but one dimensional character was with a rain bud depth. Brasier is more complex and lasting, and the problems facing him are a life crisis, which makes the part more challenging. It's a wonderful recovery from the last role of Gooding in 'Chill Factor', it was a terrible film that was a job of professional suicide to take part in it. <br /> <br /> ('Analyze', 'Rocky and Bullyclin's Expedition', 'Meet the Mentions'), Robert Deanaro with his extraordinary performance Come back to the dramatic roots. DÃ©rono is not a bad comedian, he's such a great dramatic actor who does not feel like he's going to do a comedy. DeNiro endows on Sunday delivering a rock hard personality with a tortured soul belying. It's a pleasure to see him work. <br /> <br /> It looks like the movies I saw recently have Charles Theron. I saw the rows in 'The Legend of Bagger Vans', 'Man of Honor' and 'The Yard', and there is no surprise that in 2000 each of them had any part in the film. (Actually, he only did five). It was a minor role for Theron, but it closes well and steps are taken to stay at the diary stage. David Keith, who played Richard Gere with 'Officer and Gentleman', there is a Kyomo here <br /> <br /> There are some interesting features in the DVD, including those of Carl Brasier and a few deleted scenes. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie despite the hackneyed plot and one-dimensional presentation. I think it's a 7/10 rate. I am a sucker for stylish stories and I have a love for the story where the character power of the central theme. This film is particularly strong in both cases and brings us two memorable performances, which compensates the director for damages.
