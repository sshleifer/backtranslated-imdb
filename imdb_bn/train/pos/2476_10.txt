In the nineties, these two were the second place in the movie "Hamlets", the first being Franco Jefferrlie, Mel Gibson played since 1990. Since 1948, Jefferrley's version, like Lawrence Olivier, was based on a short version of the game, most of Shakespeare's original text was being cut. (I have never seen Tony Richardson's 1969 version, but ran for less than two hours, even less than Jefferrl, I think it was also bound). Kenneth Brengha was trying to do something more ambitious - a movie based on the full text of the game about four hours of running time. <br /> <br /> Branhaig's Olivier crown with "Henry V" claimed that the film's leading Shakespeare, a rare example of Shakespeare's comedy-based film, ensures his claim with his brilliant "Much Ado Nothing". His third Shakespeare film as director of "Hamlet" (he played the IIGO in Oliver Parker's 1995 "Othello") and as expected, is it "too many Ado?" Different from. The previous movie, shot in a villa in the Tuscany Mountains and is located in the beautiful surrounding countryside, is a delightful, summer movie about everything that lives in it's vivid life. <br /> <br /> "Hamlet", in contrast to the depth of winter. (In the details of the death of the Ophila, flowers mention that Shakespeare himself had been thinking about the activity in the summer). The look of the photo is particularly attractive, both are magnificent and chilli. This was probably illustrated in England's most beautiful house Blenheim Palace, but it is rather a ban. Snowy exotic scenes are cold and winter; Internal ones are formal and wide. The action was updated in the mid-nineteenth century; The female characters wear the fashion of that era, while the main men wear mostly superb military uniforms. (There is a contrast with the film of Jeffrelli, where both the interior and the costume were deliberately defeated by the Tone). The game is affected by the image of corruption and erosion; <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is notable for big stars, some of them are rarely Danger in the state of Denmark. Minor role. (Blink, and you might miss John Gieldgud or Judy Dench). Apparently, the production company who was nervous about a four-hour film, needed an all-star cast. Some of the stars imported from Robin Williams's 'Authentic' did not really come, but others played very well like others like Charlton Hesson's Player King or Billy Crystal's First Gravidizer. Yorick, usually seen only as a skull, is seen in flashback here, played by British comedian Ken Dodd. Brian disciplined, who often uses jovial characters, is thrown against type as Ghost and produces scenes that he is genuinely scared. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the weakest of the main characters was Kate Winslet's Ophilia. His eldest wife, Brangh, was his wife Emma Thompson in his first two Shakespeare films, but their marriage ended with divorce in 1995. However, I like myself that Thompson has been played; Although Willett came into his own crazy scenes of Opelia, his character was still where his previous appearance seemed weak. (I like Hannah Bonham Carter in the Jeffery version). Richard Byyars often plays a more respected polynius than he has given him, instead of an intelligent and intelligent counselor, the old fool. Julie Christie has paid tribute to Gertrude's role; There is no effort here, such as with the Gibson and Glenn Close in Jeffrelli version, to offer a cruel attachment between him and Hamlet. (Which gives an explanation more than Freud than Shakespeare). The difference in age between Christie and Brangha was enough for them to be credible as a mother and son, which was certainly not close and Gibson was in the case. (Olivier Gertrude, Aileen Hery, was thirteen years younger than him) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> A national game of domestic as well as about domestic tragedy. "There is a lot of pressure on the war with Norway and Norwegian Prince Fortinbrus - a mistress who is completely ignored by Jeffrelli. This emphasis on the national tragedy is probably best seen in the character of Claudius, sometimes it is played as a dimensional villain, Derek Jacobi There are some things about the effectiveness of Claudius which is different Under him may be a good man, but he lets himself get confused by ambition and desire, he could be a good and loyal servant for his brother, but chose to rule as a bad king, even though he was tortured by crime, he did evil things. There is no way to correct it. <br /> <br /> A wonderful speaker of Shakespeare's verse, Like Gibson, he took a little time from Hamlet's old concept, such as strangers, passive and sadness, with an active, physical, energetic Hamlet, Larter's best of his fierce contradiction. His guidelines are not frustrating around the world but rather evil and corruption. Hate <br /> <br /> It was a gamble to create a four-hour epic, and the film did not work well. Box office However, praised critics, James Bernardinelli is particularly enthusiastic. My own opinion is that, whatever the financial means, Branagh's gambling stopped paying artistic terms. Considering the full text, he was able to bring the full meaning of Shakespeare's most complex game and full emotions. When I do her "Many Ado ??" Reviewed, I said this is the best film of Shakespeare's comedians ever. His "hamlet" can be the best movie of Shakespeare's tragedy ever. 10/10
