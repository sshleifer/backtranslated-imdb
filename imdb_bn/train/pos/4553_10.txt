As far as I know the real person that the main actor watched his performance playing and said that this is an outstanding screenplay, I agree with him. This is a great movie about a great gifted boy / man who helps him in special body parts. Oscar and BAFTA have won, and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis Chris Brownia has played as a man in the brain, who carries most of his life on the floor, a wheelchair and his family. Although he has a special left foot, he can write with it, paint it with and keep things with it. He later learned to speak in the film, it is very good for a guy like him. Also won the Home Alone 2 Oscars and received Golden Globe Breda Freak's nomination, Mrs. Brown and BAFTA winner McNally as Mr. Brown. Jim Sheridan was nominated for Best Picture, Best Make Up Artist and BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, Best Writer, based on Screenplay, and Best Picture based on the Oscars. The Daniel Day-Lewis The 100 Greatest Movie Star was 85, among the 50 Great Britain actors, he was number 20, he was number 9 in Britain's seratom actor, and he was ranked number 15 on the world's seratom, and the film was No. 250 in Great Britain Film 28. Distinguished!
