Lily Mangal Presentation (MGM, 1943) is an intelligent film, but in my opinion it can be even better. Judy Garland is always great, but some scenes from the movie come out of place, and romance between him and Van Hallin quickly develops. <br /> <br /> I mean, one minute he is ready to hit his butt, but the next minute he falls in love with her. I believe that this production, film editing and script (though the photography was great, the scene was nice and the dress was good) might be a little better. It seems as though very pushing. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast was good, especially little Janet Chapman, as the daughter of the second daughter Rosie. She looks really cute at the age of 11 and it is shameful that she did not develop into a teenage comic actress. In the late 1930s, Warner Bros. (better than his Broadway Musketeers 1938, he was really good), was better than the previous films, when they tried to turn him into Shirley Temple / Cybele Jason Hybrid. Overall, this image is good, but in the end, Judy gave it all.
