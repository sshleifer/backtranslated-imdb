I recently bought this movie with eBay from other leaguerasque groups. Generally, I am in war and action movies, but sometimes I enjoy a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> You are bored with today's special FX movies and high shiny romantic comedy, but you can check out the shop around the corner in the quiet evening. What I like about the movie is that the letters are very modest. There is nothing fake or pretentious about them. For example, Mr. Hold Matusque: When he learns that his wife is cheating on one of his employees, he tries to shoot himself. Not only because of insult, because he has done injustice to Stuart's character. (OK, exhausted example.) <br /> <br /> Yes, the film focus is narrow and the plot is predictable. Yet, I liked it a lot. If you like Notting Hill, you would prefer shopping near the corner. Actually, Hugh Grant reminds me of Jimmy Stewart a lot.
