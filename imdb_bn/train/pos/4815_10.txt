This is my top list of favorite movies all the time! This is a fantastic and insightful film. It was historically attractive and was great to see! I thought that Emily Blunt's performance was fantastic and Rupert Friend was a wonderful Albert, the best actor for Albert was elected. The costume was fantastic and the settings and scenes as the opera house were amazing and detailed. I just like it, all of it! I was getting childhood views 'Bulld' by John Cannie. And where his mother says that he has to walk with an adult on a stairs. One of the writers did it again! They produced this fantastic script! <br /> <br /> This award is quite deserved.
