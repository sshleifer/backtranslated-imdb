It is true that you always think that what you are doing when a disaster or tragedy strikes you. And on September 11, 2001, on September 11, 2001, a date changes the whole world in a fight against terrorism. <br /> <br /> No, this documentary has not started living in 9 incidents. / 11 Instead, filmmakers, brothers Gidian and Juulus Nudett, prepared for documentary on New York firefighters and Tribunal problems. They went to the academy and shot some of the training and handed over their "proby firefighter" to join them at Leatherfree and Engroom 7's house in NY Firehouse, but their production had to develop and hold it. The World Trace Center is considered to be the only shot of the first slam. <br /> <br /> I was returning to a train on a train in the night of LAN Gaming, and I received a call about 850 local time from my father, who told me above. A few minutes later, he told me that there was another, and the invasion of WTC was going on. When I reached home, the upper floors of the Twin Towers were shining and in smoke, and in my horror, they collapsed an hour. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We can follow the only illustrated sequence of events in the WTL 1 lobby, where firefighters, paramedics and police have to first respond, to understand what has happened and to plan for quick action. Another camera handheld camera was traveling on the way to WTC in search of his siblings, and along with the journey, many expressions of New York felt the chaos around Manhattan. <Br /> <br /> There are plenty of interviews in the documentary with people of Lady 1 and Eng 7, which are not miraculously damaged. But survivors also bring their own mental instability, because they struggle to cope with this event. Through the events that were exposed, we can learn powerful cameras among these men who survive and gesture with their daily life to save life. <br /> <br /> We started with the documentary that was previously guessed. The events of the day turned completely and became a focus, at the same time, until the rescue phase, where the hopes of living under the ruins were kept alive by people who watch the clock in the feel of the steel structure of the debris. This is not a movie that is made and what you see here can not be made in any other document (and not words for Sky, Hollywood blockbusters). <br /> <br /> There are 4 separate hours of interview with 1 Leather and 1 engine in Code 1 DVD. .
