The memories of "The Last Hunt" are stuck with me, when I saw it in 1956 at the age of 13. It is a film that was far away from others when it is present in contrast between the locals, the environment, and the short and long-term effects of greed. It is relevant today, in 1956, a cinematic discussion of deep depth and relevance. Setting Off It's pretty nice and cinematography is excellent. The memory of this movie will be with me at the end of my day.
