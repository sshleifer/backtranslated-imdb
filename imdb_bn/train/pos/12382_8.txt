Here is a mid-70's blurred blaze about a gate in New York that can be old brown stone. It seems like there are plenty of gates around hell, but of course this strange model can decide that she needs some space from her boyfriend / drunk and so she can choose only one which is as casual and rugged as a valuable apartment. She met several weird neighbors, and even attended a birthday party for a cat. Meeting with Realtor because he heard the strange cry over the night, he finds out that he and an old priest are only employed solely to hire a merchant. Oops! Then who are these strange? Her boyfriend (a slim lawyer played by Chris Sandon) started poking around and not by a long shot, they found that they did not find the thing. It is a fairly playful idea of ​​some modest obscure scenes and cricketer's older ones, which are different from what her "sometimes" neighbors show. Humble Gore and a parade of less common people at the end makes it a decent watch and I've seen it on TV many times, but of course the DVD version is certainly a lot better. A bad little awkward flick, maybe "offering the burn" is not a good companion piece. 10 out 8
