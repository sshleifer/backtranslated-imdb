Carmen is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Saying to the best of whom: Antonio Gods, Christina Hoos and Laura Dell Soul are fantastic. They dance to their souls. This is a wonderful story and story of myths; Mythology penetrates everyday life. Dance becomes life and the whole life is dancing. After one person and at the same time, saving his life and making someone else, acting part of the old boyfriend. The magic is running.
