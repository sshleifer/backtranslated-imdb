Superb Barbara Bach Jennifer Fast is a television reporter who travels to bring his crew (Karen Lam and Lois Young) to the Danish Festival in Solvangan, California. The problems have fallen through their habit and all the hotels in the city are full. So they travel outside the city remotely and take advantage of their friend Ernest Keller (amazing Sydney Lasik) hospitality. If you do not know, Ernest and gentle partner Virginia (Lelia Goldoni) have hidden a secret secret secret in their home: sad, distorted, diaper-clad "junior" (Stephen First, great performance), which eventually terrorizes the girls. <br /> <br /> In this annoying little horror film, a deliciously thrilled lacey plays the real giant. It is slowly but also an intense clash / climax, which delivers awful deliveries in small doses until the end noise. Hotel and foreboding cellar - Great echoes of "Psycho" here - great settings. Most, the opposite plot is injectable and associated with Patricide, which allows the film to move towards a really high quality. And yet it becomes disgusting when we realize that junior is not one of the worst bogans, but more damaged like girls. The final shot is particularly sad. <br /> <br /> A difficult little horror flick that is invisible to "invisible". <br /> <br /> 8/10
