I first saw this movie on the wire five years ago and I could not laugh. Everything about this movie looked like, the story, the story, the characters, the setting looked. As far as the movie is concerned, I will not call it a great movie, but it's fantastic to get it guessed. It gets the meaning of it across. Cast might be good as well as a comedy movie. Carbon Barsson, Fred Guin, Ruben Blades and Ed O'Neal are colorful. Those who do not see it, I'll give you a brief overview: Four criminals meet a small town in Montana, after receiving a letter about a bank's hit from their friend. But after leaving him from New Jersey, two police arrested his friends, tried to know what was happening, and all hell broke down. This film is really a fantastic bank-comedy comedy and it's like a poor man's version of Ocean Ave, only four offenders, who can not stand by each other and instead of Las Vegas in Montana, To laugh at everyone, I would strongly encourage you to see this movie.
