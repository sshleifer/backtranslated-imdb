From the beginning to the end, I laugh at real hard throughout the film. It's amazing that "Grouch Tube" is probably the grandfather of all the lady Schitt's movie, yet cook. In this way, I enjoy watching TV rather than annoying TV channels! For 73 minutes, weird, strange humor will never stop! Just how all these dirty smiles can help you to enjoy simple life! It's way, better way than comedy Central or any major time show! Have yourself a favor and trash all those soft, lame romantic comedy movies in the wastebasket! Even better, tell your box office manager that you want "Groove Tube" on the Big Screen!
