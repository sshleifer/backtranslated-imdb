I came in the middle of this movie so I was not aware of a credit or title here, where I found that it received mixed reception by your commentators. I'm positively about this picture, but the one thing I've noticed is that really attracted my attention: Copeland's America Style's beautiful and sensitive score When I did not write anything other than John Williams, I was surprised to discover the score. The fact that he has written such scandalous lists as sensitive and scandalous scores, his name is usually associated with his name, such as Star Wars. But in my opinion, more than what I heard about what Williams wrote for this movie, which I heard for softness, sensitivity and beauty, perfectly flexible and beautiful plots of the movie. And for her another recent score, if you can catch, still looks more intelligent and sophistication. As Stanley and Iris, how was I How Green was in my Valley and Conquer, John Voigast and his young African American Charge in South Carolina, and Danny Davito's Renaissance Man. Spiritual awakening is a story which is often not enough, they tell the intellectual and necessary a necessary story. This is an excellent addition to that style of one.
