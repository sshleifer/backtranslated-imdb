Since the beginning of the 18th century, Liam Nisson illustrated the Scottish legend Robert Ray McGregor. He is a true actor. He attracted his charisma with the audience playing all his roles. Jessica Lange is as nice as her wife Mary. Mary is such a beautiful woman. It is his love that makes Rob Roy the legend, but it is his passion that makes his love incomplete. They need each other. Tim Roth is perfect as a bad cunningham; One way or another side to watch the movie, you think Cunningham is hateful. Scotland scenery is beautiful. Environmental environment and environment are very well illustrated. If you like history, romance, emotions and love, you will enjoy Rob Roy. There is violence and blood, but it is essential that this story should not be said. No gratuitous violence. And if you do not use a Scottish accent, you have to be careful. This movie makes so much better that an actor or actress is glamorized; They get dirty and actually look absurd in different scenes. Their skill as an actor that attracts you, they do not depend on the name of Marx, popularity or sexual appeal. This is something special.
