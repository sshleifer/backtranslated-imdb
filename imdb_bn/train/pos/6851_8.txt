During this film, De Palma's technique earned its higher maturity, which is an excellent demonstration of his classic tactics, unfortunately, the story itself, like most of the films written by De Palma, makes the meta more than the interests. Putting a mentally compulsory story ahead. <br /> <br /> This story opens with a crash scene where Angeli Dickinson looks at her husband and masturbates in the shower. She then deprives her husband and gets raped when she is unaware of her husband? - And the whole thing is published as Angelie's imagination because the husband is pumped into her bed shamelessly. Her son has a short scene with Harry Potter's dead Ranger, which ends with a joke that "He'll tell grandma that he is playing with his Peter." Before trying to persuade his therapist Michael Kainen, he goes to the session of his therapist for his death marriage. He refused, and he felt hurt and inappropriate and unfulfilled. <br /> <br /> Then a 22-minute bir begins with a silent sequence which is probably the highlight of the film. The burden of film as the only visual medium to tell the story of many plima stories collected from Hitcoak ?? And usually in De Palma fashion, she turns it into a way to showcase her great skills. For me, the problem seems to be that only the scenes are prolonged prolonged for showing the skills of the managers. <br /> <br /> This article starts with the Art Art Museum. He sees strangers, involves all sexual or family activities, then begins to return to a person sitting beside him. De Palma has been very efficiently describing very complex, in addition to the only word about Angel's attraction, shame, retreat, and finally finding and posting a strange person behind a taxi taxi, it sets a very strong score by Pingo Donagio, who runs the scoring . <br /> <br /> Angely has fallen asleep in the second half of this section, and she has to go back to her husband. Again de Palma broke into a ton of tones without a word of conversation, such as that Angela realized that she had no pants, her husband is already home and there is no doubt where she is, she probably has a venereal disease, and that she is somewhere in the racket Engagement ring is missing. It's all very pretty, but starts to feel a little panic, because we're forced to do something like a light lift stream from the seventh floor, then again in real time. <br /> <br /> ... from here! When Angelie reaches the seventh floor, she is killed by a big-hued big woman. Until the soil reached the floor, the woman hacked to him, opened the door and Nansi came to see him there. Nancy Lift has a nice speed pace to reach, Angelie goes on to her, and the murderer's plaque is made for Nancy's hand slogan. Then look at Nancy and follow some electrifying shots looking at the assassin killer in the elevators convex mirror. It's all good, and at that time we have some dialogue again, you think; "Woah, that was purely 22 straight minutes of visual explanation!" Or maybe you do not, but I do. <br /> <br /> A young Dennis Franz has a great part as an absolute and strong New York detective, who else will do his job for him. He interviewed Michael Kine, had a deadly effect (although it passed as normal) that Angelie wanted to die. Angel's boy is there too, and he hooks up with Nancy, and they try to find Keane's therapist's spy and find the murderer. <br /> <br /> Again there is a strong tie in the hitcoach film. , In this case Psycho (just as the Avestian Vertigo is working again). You have a woman whom we mean to be secretly a whore who died in the first 30 minutes in a nearby place, in this case a lift instead of a shower. Then an inquiry into the relatives of the deceased relatives, which revealed that the killer is a man who is dressed for martyrdom. De Polama even ends up in a doctor who explains the psychology of the whole thing. <br /> <br /> This is very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can start to feel somewhat disgusted, and my primary reservation about this movie. It must be essential and display some of the best sets of de Palma, but the feeling is that the third third is behind the need to show De Palma in this story, and some of her extravagant sexual fantasies make it hard to see it again. Full heartfelt affection <br /> <br /> --- Watch another review on my website of Bad and Chasey Movies, Movies De Murray, cinemademerde.com
