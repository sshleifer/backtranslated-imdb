This movie is so great. Probably set of 40's and Meg Raan's character is known as 'smart'. Plus Team Robin is so beautiful in this movie. And everything about it has a magical feeling. Every time I see it I'm happy. This is definitely a girl movie, and I'm a girl, so I like it. I love the song Violin is awesome But still I think this is a beautiful story and everyone will see it.
