A story of emotional love pushed his limit and a lovely man, whose beauty was his ticket to his own premature death. At the beginning of Tokyo, Prose D Beauty walks a thin line in a full-silent film - which is still in the heart - and flirt with sound and sound effects. The effect is a bit annoying for anyone to come into this film because the recorded audio is extremely skinny and it does not help it anyway. Sound-stage conversations are edited in the beginning order, for example, this part of the film acts as an actress who binds Louise Brooks's conversation and loots the good actors. Apart from that, the film continues to be less or less well, with a slight jump here and there continuously - some of the films of this era are common - and this vague spell seems silent. In a way, it is a test of a movie, and visible representation and near the style of Sergei Eisenstein, which raises it from pedestrian levels. Lewis Brooks has played a lesser role in the role he played here: He is an impressive, who has decided to enter a beauty contest despite the fact that Lark is an angry opponent of his extremely harmful lover. His role is mostly contemporary for Thirties and his time; The screen is screened at the end of the flapper / jazz and now, with the onset of women's independence, women are represented as professionals in the film. Bruce's character decides to leave his lover (though he is "matching" with him) a little less than his time. However, he does not want to believe in the serious flaws of his character which is believable - his boyfriend wants to succeed him - and that's why he end up in the movie theater. This final sequel seems to show Hitko directly in his highest mysteries (that person who knows a lot more) and Brooks, his image on screen and murdered lover compared to it. Even more dramatic still singing "live" Brooks is one with dead now - a cool, powerful movie has a cool effect.
