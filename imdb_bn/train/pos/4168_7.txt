This film is not just one of the movie titles, it's 70th child actor Eck Ismanman and Kim Richard's third team. Looks like this movie is being broadcasted in Halloween week in '78 in Strangers in our house against Linda Blair. I like to see another picture to see the first image. After, repeat, I saw I made the right choice. The movie is not really bad, but, really lack any cool or surprise. However, I like the scene where Richard Krena throws a family dog ​​in some way.
