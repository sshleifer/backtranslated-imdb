A movie about the ideal of losing the calories. A trip to the darkest road ever. No return road This plot is a couple that sets out to find a better life in California. That person (so far, David Duvovini wants to write a book about his crime in America) and his daughter - who is a photographer - is going to take pictures. So they were heading towards the famous murder path, not knowing how they were waiting. To share the cost of travel, they decide to find another couple and they keep an advertisement. But the couple who responds are not just a couple. It's one of the weird couple ever. The girl is a homemade, weak animal that loves many dreams and cactuses. People are just the opposite. A cruel ruthless killer. As soon as we learn early movies and betrayal, murder and finally being defeated, we follow the trip to California (normally not as C but A, marking the mark as the killer). All Lead, Duchovny, Pitt, Lewis and Forbes will give really good performance and that you have to consider that this movie was not even even a star among them. Photography is amazing, the biggest part of the film covers the dark, and the music matches the film's dark character. Overall it is a really good movie. Do not miss it. To share with gas, think again before taking some strangers in your car!
