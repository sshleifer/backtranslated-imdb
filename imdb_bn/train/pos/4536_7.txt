Writer of writing a wonderful Morning Room series that chronicles ACD's literature with Doctor Joseph Bell, wrote, I was waiting for it and I was not frustrated. It was running very slowly with a lot of emphasis on the disappointment of Sherlock Holmes' dial, which was very accurate and well illustrated. It was an interesting character to study and had very good shots (digital video, unusual for a time piece). Acting was a nice round, especially Tim McEnary and Brian Cox. Although the actor who painted ACD, whose name I can not remember, has ended me. An extraordinary character study that brings similar twists to the same normal Sherlock Holmes.
