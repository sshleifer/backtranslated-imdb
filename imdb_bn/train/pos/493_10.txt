As long as I can remember, I am a star trek fan. When they announced the fifth series and planned the premiere, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> <br /> It was done with good character and a great acting job done by all the characters. NX-01, to show the enterprise the perfect ship that has started to love many people. <br /> <br /> Scott Bocculla was best as Captain Jonathan Achaar. Joliele Blake gave a commanding performance as a submander tip. Only two people from this wonderful new era are bravely going to take us to the wonderful history of Starfleet. <br /> <br /> The Enterprise looks like it would be good to see a good series and I recommend that. See it
