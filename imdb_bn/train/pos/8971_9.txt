Generally, I'm not a huge fan of stop-motion film and Rooka did not get my attention first. However, knowing the film was made in the suppressive Czechoslovakia in the Soviet-dominated era, the more films I saw, the more I realized how this silly film was distorted. This theoretically made the film alive and gave it the ability to have real status as both art and political statements. <br /> <br /> The tragic picture is done without any dialogue, but it is becoming quite clear. A cute little wooden man creates clay pots, and while having a nice time suddenly a shiny animated hand emerges and destroys the pot - instead it creates a sculpture in hand. Well, a wooden man tries to grab his arm and try again and again. However, with time, the hand becomes stronger and eventually the man cages. And, finally, the man gives the funeral to the hands and hands of the dead, in the face of real hypocrisy, the funeral of a hero! <br /> <br /> I said, this film is a bold attempt by the brave Jiri Trunker to criticize his authoritarian government. Not surprisingly, although checks like the movie and it gives critical praise, the state (eg, hand) has banned this little paradigm. Sadly, Trank has not seen his country release for a little over two weeks for "Velvet Revolution" for a little while.
