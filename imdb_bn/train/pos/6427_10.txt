If you're in a mood to have fun ... and just want to relax and enjoy ... Bad Mia is one of the films in the injury mia. Amitabh started a good start ... but Govinda stole the show from his hand ... Excellent time for distributing excellent dialogue ... inspired by bad boys ... but there is Indian meat for it. People think that it can be confusing and stupid ... but David Dhawan is directing and acting in Govinda ... no question should be raised ... the same other series of other proposed films (David Dhawan / Govinda Combo) ... And Shabnam, Akhen, Raja Babu, Saajan Chail Sasoor, Dewana Mastana, Koli No. 1, Jodi no. 1, Hero number 1, Hasina Manjaygi, one more Ghioroh
