Zorza was very good to see Fox in a role where he got a lot of smiles. Also loved to listen to his song Beautiful changes to see her from her CSI / West Wing / ER role. The movie itself was entertaining, but in many cases it avoided some explanations. A few letters seemed to be sad one minute and the next was happy and it was left to your imagination why it was left. In some cases, I could not wait to see what I would do later or I could not hear what they would say next, although each character was curious. This film is not clearly populated by clean people, but rather complex realists who may make mistakes, feel bad about them and then find ways to solve them.
