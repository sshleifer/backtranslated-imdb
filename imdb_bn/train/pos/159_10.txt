This was another extraordinary movie of the Berlin Festival. But unlike "yes" like Sally Potter, which I have seen some days ago, when I left the movie I expressed the desire to embrace the whole world and was happy to live, there were quite a few instances: there was something that pulled me down Brought it, and the wind suddenly felt cold and inhaled to breathe. It seemed as if suddenly there was nothing left, all hope, all were taken to a dead place in the future. <br /> <br /> Nina's life has become helpless and locked, but then a lovely day, the brightness that takes place that opens the horizon and believes in the fulfillment of her dream. There was no one beside him, but suddenly he found a mate, there was only nothing, who could have shared the most secret feelings of his life. That man was Tony, a miracle girl, who does not seem to be a root like himself. <br /> <br /> But the title of the film is "Ghost", and the demons appear and disappear as disappeared, is there no way to keep them? The ghosts also present people's secret fantasies, strange ideas that hold your mind and are felt only by yourself, hiding away from everyone else. Francois, a French woman, is the victim of the ghosts. Once in Berlin, he lost his child's daughter, who was apparently looted from him in a supermarket at one moment of supernaturality. Now time has passed, and Franco has returned back to Berlin, still looking for a missing child. <br /> <br /> Nina, who could be a child, got her ankle and heart-shaped birthday on the same square in her shoulder blade, which could prove her true identity. <br /> <br /> And Nina accepts that idea, then she not only needs a mate, but she also waits for her mother. But in the end he was empty, Tony disappeared with a man, and his supposed mam became a sick woman. "Marie is dead," he annihilates Francois's husband, and the statement can not be more confusing. Nina is not just a "nina", a girl without a name, no hope for any divine supplement. There is no death in this world with our lonely life. So, finally, we see Nina alone, walking next to the road that is open before it, which seems happy and uncertain in the future.
