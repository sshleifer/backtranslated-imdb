John Waters has created the most ruthless, intelligent, heartfelt, dark, personalized small film that I have ever seen (perhaps Fast Food Fast Women Comes Second Secondly) The managers' views are unknowable ... the description is scary, the letter is personal and the strange image of the family and his own internal life ... tone is never forced or stylistically under extra pressure. <br /> <br /> There is no motivating shot design, NNU or Magazine Grading .... Martha is as inspiring as the implacation sister. Eddie Furlong is inspired to inspire. Mary, tea-bagging, a grandmother with recycled clothing, yesterday's garbage has become the industry of today - and the lesson in the movie is that we value the most important things ... family and modest life.
