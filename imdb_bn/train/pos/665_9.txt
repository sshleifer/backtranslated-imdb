"And All Three's The House" is not a special crypt episode because it's only from the first season, but this episode was the first I saw! Remembering to spend time with my parents, I saw this episode in our hotel room in South Carolina Hotel in the summer of 1989 and I was buried on the right side of the crypt and forever! I was always a fan of the horror-suspense series and loved giant movies and this series, which was started by HBO, was again horrible. This episode I saw the first one is memorable for me and my favorites, it is very enjoyable with a beautiful twist. "And the House of the House" is a wonderful Christmas Eve setting, which is a perfect way to discourage you to spend your vacation! Anyway, however, you have to take care of Mary Allen Trainer (who works many warnings brother, usually working in small parts) as a greedy beggar, who takes care of her husband by waiting for some money and new romance. Like the most horrific series things, it takes a turn for the worst and bad people they deserve. When paired as a Santa escapes from a local nuts house, the interstellar is widely stacked when Christmas Eve is made for a late vacation! Old e.c. From comic lessons, you learn how to pick up for bad guys! Well this story ends with a perfect holiday scream! This story was also in the 1972 film and featured Joan Collins, it is a doubt of my favorites and probably one of the all-time classic crypt episodes!
