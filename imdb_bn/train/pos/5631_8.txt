While congratulating Fawcett, the time was considered controversial. In my memory, rape was still banned in the 1980's, and at that time women's rights and emotions were examined very little. <br /> <br /> <br /> Fusset is the only one who follows, then actor James Roxo. He is sufficient as an unknown psychotherap, but occasionally a little transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scurvyd has some role, such as Alfred Woodward as a partner. During the revenge of fiasco, rape and criminal, the law enforcement authorities expressed concern over Woodward's concerns. The cruising scene of throwing froth pans of hot oil in Russo is classic, and he deserves it as a rapist. Then he kept him in slavery, and must face the consequences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Highly recommended. 8/10.
