I rent from Netfix for these two reasons - I thought I thought it would be a stupid '50s sci-fi-asco and it was the first feature-length Superman movie. Needless to say, after about 15 minutes, I had completely appointed myself and am very happy. <br /> <br /> An experimental oil has broken about six miles in the world and closed by sponsors. Loes and Clark saw scopes, but disappointed that the best drill and no operation will be done. After a day, the odd events at the well are appropriate for a more story for Superman than Clark Kent. It seems that radioactive mole man attacked the Earth's quota six miles deep. <br /> <br /> Supermen and Mole Men are a simple but precise part of social reality. A major actor starring in World War II, the morality of this story, which was released in 1951, is believed to be able to become fascist as anyone else. To run this point normally in a simple Superman mode, Reeves accuses the grassroots people by hitting Mole men to be 'Nazi' even at one point. <br /> <br /> Even in the 1950s even the science of this film was unrealistic. Six miles drilling through continental volumes did not even penetrate the top of the mantra, only "the open center of the world" - which is not in any case. Forgive - Remember that this movie is based on a golden era comic book. <br /> <br /> This picture is a bit uncomfortable. Although Molmann is attractive, slightly obscure, and beautifully illustrated, there are several Karamen-Esquiera views which are strangely showing us our strange behavior. The script is intelligent and profitable. According to today's standards, poor for costly fairness, but for its time, the special effects and costumes of this movie were quite good. Cinematography is usually very good, and the performance can be much better than one. I was particularly impressed by Reeves, Jeff Corrie and Walter Reid.
