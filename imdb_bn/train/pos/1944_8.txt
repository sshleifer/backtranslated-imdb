This is an excellent example of an adult swimming class character, their problem, relationships and interaction with each other. This should be an extensive distribution because it's much better than the same at the same time as the main studio. <br /> <br /> The swimming instructor almost diminished to teach the basic lessons of the Olympian, adults, and often the horndogging goal of his female students. He tried less or less to stop them with different or different results. <br /> <br /> Student's character is mainstream United States; Teachers, police, college students and retired people, all of whom have learned to swim for some reasons. This movie adds to their relationship, such as friends, relatives and romantic conquests through classes. Several concubines offer fun goats, among which a teacher is going to divorce, some high school students are making a documentary and there is only one girl to meet the girls. <br /> <br /> It's a good dated movie, or the only one to see when you mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality.
