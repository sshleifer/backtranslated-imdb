It's been a few years since I've seen it, but I want to see it again. It has become a "therapy" with a personal experience for me. <br /> <br /> A 25-year-old high school shy on playing baseball where he "missed the ball" and lost his team. After 20 years, he thinks, "If I only hit that ball" and why his life would be better than that. Then, she gets the chance to find out ... and she gets a little more than her door. <br /> <br /> It reminds me when I'm in high school, I tried twice for the drill / dance team and it was not made. This group was the closest thing to a sorority in my school. If you had it, you "all that." I tried my last two years of HS and for the second time, I made it really difficult. I cover the wretched and wore tights before hitting and hit my hose, and that made me not to make it. That was in 1987. <br /> <br /> Over the years, even sometimes, I think, "If I did not hurt my legs, I would never have used that stupid tights." Now I do not sit and think that my life is better or I have made any other, but seeing this movie, I realized that we never know how things can be changed by changing a little bit of the past. . Who knows that the incident might have changed that I could not meet my son's father. <br /> <br /> I would suggest this movie to anyone who has a moment in the past that they can change. You must be careful what you wish !!!
