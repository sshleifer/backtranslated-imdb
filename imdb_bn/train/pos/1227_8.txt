I grabbed this movie on my local movie channel, and I was happy to see the movie instead. It has all the elements of a good teenage film and much more - this film also deals with relation between boys and girls and gender and similar behaviors, as well as issues related to the use of steroids by young people. <br /> <br /> This movie has been realized in real life - no strong music, no special effects, and no disrespectful scenes - that was right for this movie. This feeling makes it easy to relate to the characters of the film - some of which we probably know where we live. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, fun to see. <br /> <br /> 8/10
