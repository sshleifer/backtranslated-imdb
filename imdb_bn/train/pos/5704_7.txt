To be fair, I expected car charging in this film. There was only one, but apart from that, 'Freeway' is a great movie that I'm happy for myself in the DVD. The only major name for Cast is the Richard Psychologist of Homicides Radio Psychiatrist and the B-Movie Villain Paras-Excellence Billy Daggota as the quote-quoted freeway killer. But the others usually give good performance. I especially like how Darlan Flugel gave his character, Sunny, a few hats. She might be the character of a helpless victim but she is completely round as she looks out Drago with the help of monster hunter James Russo. <br /> <br /> Rosho, I'm scared, come across as a wood, but again, the character that he played, Frank, his old commanding officer Sunny did not come out very well to send him back. The fatal tune is nicely captured throughout the film, and at night, the LA LA FREEWAY atmosphere is a great way to kill the killer in his giant gray saddle, and the music used to underscore the film. Good creator I do not know why some people hate this movie. Different strokes of different folks, I guess. But I totally enjoyed 'freeway' and I can strongly recommend it.
