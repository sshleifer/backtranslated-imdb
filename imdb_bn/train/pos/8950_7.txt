This is one of his "low" movies since his career for Jimmy Stewart, for his acquaintance. And, although it is not a great movie than many other pictures, it's not bad and it's a perfect time-passer-but not much. <br /> <br /> In New York City and for some unreasonable reasons, he decided to throw a spell on the poor Jimmy to fall in love with him. Over time, cold and isolated M. Novak began to fall in love with Stuart - and obviously in the book of the rule, it is a certainty, no !! <br /> <br /> The image is weird in its sensitivity about drowning. They are not child sacrifice or omnipotent diversity. Their magic is most limited and unmatched (such as Jack Lemon using the ability to stop his street lights). And, very curious, the documents seem like hanging people in hip bars where you can find people to wear clothes and listen to jazz jazz. Considering what jazz is thinking, it must be a witch in this movie world! <br /> <br /> However, the film is quite romantic and funny, but I will not go out to see anything. Acting is pretty good, but the script does not offer enough money to create this exceptional movie - I actually made about 6 films - it was really close.
