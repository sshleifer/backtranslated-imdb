My personal opinion is that the first fragrance of this movie was not a true story line of vampire but I do not like it. John Bon Jovi (Derek) was great in this film. He's really crazy to believe me he was the person who was never a famous Rockster. There was some bad thing about this movie. Like storyline, the film should be more. The storyline of the film should have been a series of line-up films and they should have the same original character in their three vampire films. I really like the clothes and I really like the setting that they choose in Mexico. How old am I in Mexico and new Mexico? With clay houses and old fashion churches. I was a little confused with the vampires and how they could walk through the church, but how they were great after following Dakula Vampire's rules.
