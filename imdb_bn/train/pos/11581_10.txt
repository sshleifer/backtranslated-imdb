It seems a bit weird to call a film against war and Holocaust, because many of us know very well about the horrors that war and violence bring. Using the adjective 'Frustrating', I am surprised that I was unaware of the things that I said about this movie, that's exactly how much I was affected by this movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maruschka Detmers inconsistent instructions Due to this performance, Oscar could not win, but his performance is strong enough and He has lots of charisma. He is thrown very well as the victim and immediately has our sympathy. Her very beautiful look, of course, but she has a good acting actress, nothing to do with her. <br /> <br /> There are some inconsistencies in the Hana war. Sometimes I found the concept manager Mainham Golan (often for Ganyani Verses Maradar) and could actually compete in a few more scenes. On the other hand, I am extremely grateful that he created this impressive and thoughtful movie and I am not very positive about it, I think he did a good job. <br /> <br /> The second half of the picture is the most interesting and sad one. It focuses on Hannah's sorrow (cautions from Donald Pleasence cruel and simple Captain Rosza's scary illustration) and shows that injustice and horror deeply comes with hatred, violence and warfare. I got the war of Hana, especially the second half, as a powerful anti-war film, and for him alone is worthy of Golan's credit. This is the second half, in which the talent of Marusukh Ditter came, which created a character that is one of the most strong, strong and sad scenes in film history. Alan Barstein is very good to see, whose appearance and acting style always reminds me of Romi Skander, who - if he was alive and made a similar contribution to the Battle of Cast-Hanna. <br /> <br /> The second half's unfortunate impact and harmful excitement that is sometimes replaced by expected expectations and good news leads to several final scenes which are unexpected, so moving and poetic shows its tragedy that it's like a bomber Hit me and threw me into my eyes. And when I realized once more, it was not even imagined, it really happened, I got myself in more tears. The image of the han depicted by Maruschka Detmers will be in my mind forever.
