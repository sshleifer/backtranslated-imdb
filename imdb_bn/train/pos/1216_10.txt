As a child I liked the first beer beer movie because it seems to be absolutely dark. I always saw sitting first. I grew up learning I liked this one. I think this movie is too dark for kids, but as you grow older, you learn to refute it after more understanding, when it is a child, it does not seem to be dark. <Br /> <br /> In my opinion, this image is better than the first, everything is so deep. This may be the opposite of the first movie, but it will have to be ignored by the first movie to watch it. The breed is very adorable, I rewind that 'flying my colors' scene I bored everyone to sing. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is great! Carroll and Dean Park are a big hand. I love every song in this movie, I've downloaded them all and I'm hearing what I'm hearing, 'Our Initiative' is also known as 'Recall' at this moment. For the first time I liked this soundtrack, though I only love Carroll King songs in the first movie Care-A-Lot. <br /> <br /> I think the animation is great, both animations are fantastic in it. I was surprised when I was sitting and after about 10 years saw it and the animation was nice for that time. It was really wonderful. <br /> <br /> This movie is great, but it does not have much back up from other people. I do not think it's weird / weird. I think it's a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Originally, how the film came to bears beer and came about to defeat Demo, Dark Heart. The last surprise and again, 'Pokemon movie' with care rears moral problems It affects you. Again, this movie can teach morality to everyone at all ages.
