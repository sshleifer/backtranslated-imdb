I grew up to show this film, and I still love it as much as I was still. Do not listen to critic reviews. They are not right in this movie. Adi Murphy is really burning on his rod. You can sit with your whole family and everyone will enjoy it. I recommend watching this movie for everyone. It's a trick of fantasy A little boy like a monster, a dragon and a powerful god. This movie takes you from Elbe to Tibet, in an amazing view of the wonderful Tibetan hill shrines. A beautiful scene! So do yourself a favor and hijack this one! You do not regret it!
