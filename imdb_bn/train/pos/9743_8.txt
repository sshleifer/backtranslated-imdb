We first saw this movie as a part of the new Argentine film festival in Walter Raid in 2000. Although we like it, we do not think it was great. To see it a second time, we found a different meaning in this view in Buenos Aires's life. <br /> <br /> This photo was held in one of Argentina's darkest days, as the Delerrua administration was ending. After the economy, the country was unstable, which was artificial in the 1990's, artificially created the climate president Menen. This was a time when the bank's bank accounts were frozen and people could live up to their nightmares. <br /> <br /> The story begins, Santamarin, an employee of the bank, is due to the collapse of the economy. Instead of receiving sympathy from his wife, he locked him from the apartment and he became all the real purpose, homeless man. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's almost a miracle job he gets to work. His father, Simon, owns a small restaurant in the Jewish quarterly "El One" in the center of the city. The incident gets worse from the worse, when Ariel's mother suddenly died. Only Ariel, Ariel, comes to help young parents of love <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Choose the female room. When the minister, Elsa shows him naked, he is very angry, but when he saw his good time, he realized the feelings of this unhappy situation when he came to his senses. They became romantically involved, and found a child of Santana on her journey with street trash. Elsa, surprised, wants to do the right things. But Santamarina will limit her love to a life of a innocent life in her life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Have done The worker, who unknown him, involved a gay love. Ariel wins marriage and other shows, get free opportunities by photographing, she feels passion for Laura, but she realizes that Estel sacrificed her to help her father and still loves her. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman, whose "El Abrozo Party" we thought was fantastic, is wonderful with this film. After a second view, things have been kept in the right perspective and we should apologize for feeling it for the first time. If for some, this is the second time, the example of the screen, Mr. Burman and Emilio Torres wrote, is more sensible because they are worried about how the country lived in that dark period. <br /> <br /> Daniel Hendler, who played Arrell, before the surprise results Mr. Cooperation with Burman. She is not a movie star beautiful, yet she is handsome. This actor is a great sincerity project in his work. Enrique Pineyro Another fantastic surprise. His Santamina disarmed. Despite all the bad things that have happened to him, he keeps a pink attitude towards all he meets. Italian actress Stefania Sandrelli contributed to the film with her elisa. Hector Alterio, one of the best Argentine actors, played a small part of Simon. The gorgeous Chiara Coselli is seen as Laura and Melina Petrielli is displayed as noble Estela. <br /> <br /> Daniel Burman is calculating an Argentinean movie by proving "Esperando al Mesias".
