When I was a little girl I saw this movie. And I've enjoyed it every time. Of course the graphics are a little comparative, compared to now, but back in the 70's it was great. I saw it only in the original Spanish version and it was nice. I remember how my Christian friends were with my family - magical The Santa Claus was amazing and I could not wait to come back every year. <br /> <br /> If you have children / children and speak Spanish, then they are called "Santa Claus". Today is a different version than this, but who is saying that there is one way? <br /> <br /> This is an interesting movie to watch. It's good to educate children versus good. How do I know the English subtitle version or it has an English but Spanish is the best. Enjoy and Happy Holidays! Faliz Navidad!
