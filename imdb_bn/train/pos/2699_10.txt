There are other reviews here so I do not have to say how wonderful it is and what it is ... My point: I have seen this movie often before, before showing it. I could not even remember how, I just knew it was through the internet. Controversies have never hit before! For several months I moped and complained. Please note that this page contains links to buy this movie and only highlighted area is VHS at Amazon.com, Germany. You can use Ultra Vista or Babelfish to translate. I know it's PAL format and they change the text on the screen to Germany and there is a short story dubbed in Germany at the beginning, but this movie is ridiculous and as a camp, it really makes fun! If you want to watch this movie and have a place near you, the transitions are equal to it! From Germany to the United States, it costs about $ 20. Believe me, it may seem like a lot to spend on a movie, but if you're a bit flick, you'll get left turn left and right for your friends conversion!
