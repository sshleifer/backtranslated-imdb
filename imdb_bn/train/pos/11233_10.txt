I consider myself as a hidden Frontier's # 1 fan, have seen that I'm among a small group of fans who actually met these boys - well, of course the conference does not count. Since 2001, I've been seeing the hidden Frontier, and I must say I am surprised by what these guys have done. <br /> <br /> The hidden frontier Rob Cave and his self-made studio brain, another photo that works outside the house behind his house. As "fancy", say, the TOS-based series New Voices (which sometimes gets some actors / writers in the original series, such as Walter Koenig, U. M. Czechov), Rob and HF's crust and crew that we call "enterprise" Manage to make a series of replacement replacement exams. The most controversial and successful story was discovered to find Star Trek's first open gay character, Corey Esther (presented in second season) and his soul mate. Somewhere after the series, he met the trail helmman officer, Perry Jane, of Xylilar. On the recent story line with these two letters (Warning: the main speaker! If you have not seen the series until this point, do not read!), Jane has joined an exile, which has resulted in huge changes and some conflicts. Its relationship with Aster. Although uncertain in the future - like the latest episode, "Bichhad", last week HF fans were shown in the chatroom - I think this relationship will bear, but only give time. <br /> <br /> Gene Rudenberie created the Star Trek that this story is more shining than its shots in space. Rob Caves created the hidden Frontier for the same reason - and it's made as popular in this series. According to the previous opinion, I hope I can give more than 10 ratings, but it will be enough. Although the end of next season - Star Trek: The Next Generation - after this initial episode we will hear a lot about the hidden Frontier.
