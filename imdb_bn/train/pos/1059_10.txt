I love this show, it is sure to be a winner. Jessica Elba does a great job, it's almost time we do not have a kick-ass girl who cutesy type The whole cast is wonderful and all episopes have good plots. Everything is well layed out, and thought. It will take some time to put it together, because there was not something soon that just put aside a little. It's completely a great show.
