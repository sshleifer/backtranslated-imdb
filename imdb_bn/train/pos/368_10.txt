Color Purple is a wonderful composition. It shows the amazing acting power of Hippy Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover. Steven Spielberg is not the most incredible director ever, but his multifaceted flick is through this film. See what you can do in a movie that you ever want to see. It's a beautiful illustration of one of the most ongoing stories of all time!
