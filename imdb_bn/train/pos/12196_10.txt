Orson Welles I managed to poke me over my ass with every picture I see. The Shanghai Lady's other greatness, The Magnificent Ambrosion, Touch of Evil, Trial, and Chains are at the same level as midnight. Plots can sometimes be confusing, and sometimes it seems to be moving a tiny bit too fast (it is edited when almost one hour of screening tested went weak). It does not matter. You can not manage to see movies of Wales and pay too much attention to the plot. His direction determines great aspects. Often, any scenes from this movie can be held with any other scenes that he has managed. See court scenes. Usually they are such stock scenes that I can not stand them. In the case of point, try to sit through Wales's own discourse near the end of obedience. In Shanghai's Lady, pay attention to the detail of the court scene. Always see the judge who sneak and interrupting the proceedings. Or just watch that scene light. I know, this is just a typical Venetian blind, and it is always used in film silent and era crime movies, but Wales makes it a beauty itself. Dialogue is also remarkable. The skills of Wales were such skills that no one else had, it produced a criminal film with an example of a great poem. Whether he was talking about Shakespeare or hard-hitting lines, he had power in the light of his soul. 10/10.
