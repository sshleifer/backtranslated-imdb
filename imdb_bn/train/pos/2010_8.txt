I was quite good at this movie. Some parts were authentic but it was understandable that it was created more than 55 years ago. I think the best role in the film was given to Michael Morgan, who played Mileyie firmly. Jack Helio is just as good as Michael O'Brien. Although I'm not a fan of Big Frank Sinat, I think he was very good in this movie. If you have the appetite for fooling, the top musical comedy, high and high movies for you. <br /> <br />
