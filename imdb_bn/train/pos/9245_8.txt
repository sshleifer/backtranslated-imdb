Gene Harlow and the Clark Gabelle Screen Team were great and could be their best film together. <br /> <br /> Yes, your man can be sugar and predictable, but I do not like about this movie. I love seeing Harlow and Jebel together, and they are simply amazing in this movie. It is obvious that they have enjoyed working together and this is part of a great film making. <br /> <br /> Diverse conversations, great scripts, and more attention to detail is the other thing that makes this movie better. I saw this movie for the first time and after every subsequent visit I always noticed at least one new story. To me, this is a sign of a great movie. <br /> <br /> Conversation and script is better than most movies from this period (early 30s). I worship the classic movie, but I acknowledge that most of them are average and occasionally do not care about me. One of the exceptions to your man hold-up <br /> <br /> Hold My Man is a 'pre-code' movie that has a lot with this truth. (Your hold hold was not applied to the head codes for one year.) This film could not be made under code. Well, it could be made, but it has been a completely different story. Thanks to the code until 1934 the code was not implemented. Otherwise, we could miss this jewel.
