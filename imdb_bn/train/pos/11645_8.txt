I was in France, March 05, and I like to go to the movie festivals. I knew about this senior D'American Latin de Plateau, but I never went there. I decided to go and then I figured out the Sioure van 4. <br /> <br /> The image is stunning. It will not affect me like Mexican users because it was a French-subtitle but it is still frustrating. <br /> <br /> This picture is scared of urban violence, kidnapping on the street and crime. Mexico This city is a crude portraiture. In a metropolis. Siquetro Express, with a stunning Mia Maestro, which was abusing abduction, almost, but with a more serious voice, and I think, some connections with the Sioure van van 4. A, sort of redemption story and that's too much? Man of On Fire, it's wildly strong, it's not a mockery, a strange portrait in Mexico street. Or it's like a brave one. Hit you in a film that shocks and is very difficult. It's a common suspicion, some plot twists and turns on it, but it makes even more credible. Ray: A movie that threatens you and believes that there is no security in the street. Stunning dialogue, impressive aspects and amazing performance. C ero E van 4 is a movie that you will not forget soon. You leave shaking and stunned.
