"Domino" has been widely condemned on this site for the exposure editing style and "illness" photography. Its opponents quote its patronage and I could not even disagree by criticizing the "style on the substance". I believe "Domino" represents the full height of the career of Tony Scott's filmmaking. <br /> <br /> At the end of the eighteenth century and in the early 90s, after the formation of the dominant Hollywood action movie, Tony Scott has been moving forward with another subject matter of the film. At the beginning of "Kremson Tide", Scott used his artistic talent to illustrate his characters' inner world - clustrophobia and drama in a nuclear submarine clash, and the play was well-equipped with long lenses combined with dug-angle framing. Then it is managed by the "State of the State" and "Spy Games", which apparently represents the world of surveillance and espionage. <br /> <br /> "Man on Fire" was an extreme departure, a publisher is a step in more painter aesthetic. Here Scott uses cranked camera and flash frame to reveal an old hand to reveal explosive rage of his character. Although not fully successful, it introduced the techniques to find the full expression in "Domino" <br /> <br /> "Domino" represents the life of the infamous huntsman hunter on the device of the FBI asking framework. Memory disjointed pieces. She has consolidated into memory all of us - fragments, flashbacks and short snapshots. Domino releases his story verbally, as Scott illustrates the viewpoint of his view, not just the events described. Her system has her "Messacle's sign", but her personal viewpoint is unique - whatever a woman who abandoned luxury life for hunting. <br /> <br /> Scott really ripped when Domino started to relate the event that led to his captivity. Cinematographer Dan Mindell and musician Harry-Gregson Williams Scott together gave a postmodern canvas of contemporary America. Gradually, we start to understand it unusually, even though he is not more hesitant than domino "90210" denial of culture. As he wades through this cultural melody, Scott makes his audience more aware of the solitude, which it describes the description of the needy children, which introduces the story. Eventually Scott portrays this salvation from the epic trip as we rescue them only. <br /> <br /> Criticizing this film for being too styled is like criticizing a picasa or pollock that does not represent recognized people. Like any great image, "domino" means all of the page and surface in the page. <br /> <br /> I'm not involved with Scott Free in any way, but Tony Scott's work always gets appreciated
