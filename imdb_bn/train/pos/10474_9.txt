I was surprisingly impressed by this movie. It contains basic elements of depression, sadness, loneliness, frustration, hopes, dreams and companionship. It was not only a gifted musician who cast rock but it was caught in sadness by trying hard to find peace between his music. He finds a companion who comes with his own problem. Claire and Friends were able to deliver each other with friendship and love, but a conclusion of more important things that attracted their lives for the worst. <br /> <br /> Dos is an impossible character by a rock star today's standard. Yet he has musical genius. There is an incident in his past that he has decided, though things around him have literally been destroyed. His focus is making his hello music, it's actually a passion for him. <br /> <br /> Claire needs a place to stay where the child is on the street. She is looking for hidden talents while being in the Des Company. She finds a mutual friend that she receives. He learned to trust her for some time. <br /> <br /> These two love each other. The mind is not leakage, emotional kind of sex is emotion, but love is where friendship and understanding means more. Both have been hit, they find faith together.
