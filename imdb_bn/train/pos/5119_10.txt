I would just say, this is all about one of my favorite movies. I could not count the number of times I even saw it. I already love John Travolta, but for the first time the camera was put on his body when he was looking for a beautiful green shave for Guilla√≠'s first trip, I was scared. Debra Wingar always provides perfect performance, such as Bud's young, innocent wife, but with the necessary attitude, married a cruel and hardworking cowboy. If you are not a musician in a country, which is not me, this is a soundtrack that you can sing along with every sound. If you get a chance, please see this movie- it will not be disappointing.
