Saxfernist Ronny Bowers (Dick Powell) won the studio deal and is in Hollywood. He lives in Hollywwod Hotel (of course). At the same time, the great ungrateful star Mona Marshall (Lola Lane) has a vowel and refuses to join the premiere of her new film. A panic studio considers Virginia (Rosemary Lane) to seal her appearance and does not call her Marshal because she does not take him to the premiere. Naturally they fell in love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The score is well (Highlighted by "Hollywood for Hualie") and directed by Busby Berkeley is a unique He has shown his unique scene in the fun drive (according to the musical sequence, Edgar Kennedy is burning his patented slow). There is also some interesting bits like Glynda Farrell's Mons Bone Jonesi. <br /> <br /> Still the movie is not good. The rest of the cast mugs fiercely and most of the fun is not funny. Lola Lane is trying to play Mona especially for the comedy. There is also racism - a stereotypical black maid is played for laughter and at some point there are some real atheist racist "humor". Most likely it keeps the TV off. I understand that it was taken at the time, but today it has happened as a rebellion. <br /> <br /> With all the serious problems, with a good cast of all the movies and some great songs. I give it a 7.
