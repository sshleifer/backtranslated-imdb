I was able to see Jim Carrie as not having the top goal in any film. His character is like all of us. Want more - something good can happen to us and it is expected to give it to God. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman made the great God. When the sunshine is an idea and a true sense of love for each of us when the opportunity presents itself, it's time to take a break. <br /> <br /> I thought Jennifer Aniston's character is a bit weaker and caring towards self-centered TVs, but it's the way it was written. <br /> <br /> I think the previews are very likely to have very funny scenes destroyed because those who saw it all knew that what was happening was already coming. <br /> <br /> I have read several reviews and it looks like some people are looking very deeply. It's a summer comedy and it's not about solving the world's problems though there are some messages we can all take. <br /> <br /> is a funny picture.
