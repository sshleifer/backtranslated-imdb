Before learning about what I can expect, I've rented this movie on DVD - and since I'm reading about making movies in Canada everywhere, I must definitely bring it to the class. <br /> <br /> The story is centered, perhaps the most unfortunate film team in the history of the film, brilliantly written and very talented actors manage to provide every single punishable time. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Notice the great chemistry between - where are they actually acting? Jennifer Tilly (playing a cheerful bad actress) and Martin Landau, is a very lively, yet funny Powerful delivery. <br /> <br /> Great film, even better throw.
