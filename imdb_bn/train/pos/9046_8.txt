I first saw Jarhade's Jack Gilenhal (2005) a little while, and then, seeing the movies I saw on my radar screen. Like Clive Oven, she has intensity (and she's just like a oven) that just bursts from the screen. I'm sure he plays some musical roles, he'll cut Oscar one day ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good story, very credible people (well , It's based on author's first synonym with rocket), a great cast ?? Chris Cooper is always good, and does Laura Darn always have my watch list ?? Humorous, crazy, a perfect blend of tension ... and many rock n rolls to get tapping on the soundtracks with great soundtracks. But this picture was very important to me: In 1957, I was at Homer Hickham's age; Like him, I looked at the star of the night and saw Sputnik as if he had spread throughout the black color; Like Homer, I experimented with rockets in my backyard and used chemicals for fuel too; And like Homer, most of my efforts have ended with explosive disaster! It was fun ... <br /> <br /> I did not achieve its great (metaphorical and physical) height. But, when you see this movie you find it. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is a basic family movie, but it's a mortal reproduction nowadays. Take time to see it with the kids: you have all the good smiles.
