Those who think that this is a ridiculous humor and imperfection, you are actually stupid. There is a part of the poison joke in the show, but it has a lot of satirical elements and has fun in social problems, ethnic barriers, clich√©s, stereotypes etc. You only have to read more about it for some of its components. <br /> <br /> Everything I love is not a fifth. Those friends hope to have a motivated joke (I love friends), you will not find it here. Instead Sarah uses the situation and other ways to achieve her humor which is more realistic. We can not roam around this world and there are diverse five-story lines for everything that is in most comedy. Instead the Sarah Silverman program makes it more realistic in this sense. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not accept it as unselfish humor because it is much more than that.
