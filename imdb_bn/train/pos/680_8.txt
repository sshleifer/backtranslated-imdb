"The Last Wave" is one of the films that rely heavily on mind. The title refers to the theory of Aboriginal Dodsde: One last wave that will remove everything. <br /> <br /> David Burton (Richard Chamberlain) has appointed Sydney lawyer to protect some indigenous people accused of killing. At this time, there was abnormally heavy rainfall in Australia. While protecting Aborigines, David learned the last wave theory and began to think about whether it is mythological story. <br /> <br /> The final sequence of the film is a metaphor for a person falling into the heart. Peter Weir made a confusing, but thought-provoking, movie. Adivasi actor David Gulpilil (whom you saw in "Walkout", "Crocodile Dundee" and "Rabbit-Proof Bare") plays a supporting role as one of the protesters. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the opportunity, see the "created" feature on DVD. Peter Wayne explains some parts of the film, some of which relate to Richard Chamberlain's background.
