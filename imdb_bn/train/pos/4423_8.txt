GOJOE seems to be used a little earlier, but the final results are very satisfactory. The story, a killer Samurai who opposes himself in disguise, tries to free himself, but dangerous samurai is more valuable than a watch. Here there is a lot of spiritual salvation from physical survival. The film may look somewhat similar to another animated-inspired Samurai film, but eventually it becomes more mature / adult. <br /> <br /> Do not miss. Gozo is one of the best samurai films to come near Kurosawa. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
