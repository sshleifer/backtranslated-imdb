I went to see a fever pitcher with my mother, and I can say that we both loved it. It was not usually romantic comedy where someone pins for someone else, and Bla Bla Bah ... you are not waiting for the first kiss of the climate or are not waiting for them at the end together. This was more real, because you saw through their relationship, about being together in comparison to the whole movie. People can actually relate to this film because it does not seem to be in exceptional circumstances or in an impossible situation. It was really fun, and I think it's the best performance of Jimmy Fallon. All in all ... I will definitely recommend it!
