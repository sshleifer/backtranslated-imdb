Yuba City, CA. (November 8, 1993), a "mermaid" helium balloon and 4 days later from Canada Prince Edward Island, Canada (4,2000). (Approximately 4000 miles). This is a very nice movie. This is based on a true story. This film does not only help to cope with the loss of children, but also the elderly. Hope everyone will enjoy it !!! Rhonda
