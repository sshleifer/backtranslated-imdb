In all these sections, the best movie I've ever seen. Forget Hollywood - their movie always sucked - this art! The story of the moon child starts with Kei - a Japanese vampire who is frustrated and denied. His wish for final death takes him to Mallepa, where refugees from several Asian countries live. Here, he meets an orphan Shore living in the street. From here, the film is an intense experience that is visible and emotional in the movie. It has everything; You laugh, you cry, you get angry, excited, sad, happy ... Sometimes this movie did not touch me any movie. And the actors are amazing - I have not heard anyone speak a lot without sounding strange. This is a great compliment to the editor for creating this excellent composition ... <br /> <br /> This is a last commentary on this bright film, it is Gakt (Malis Meyer's ex-singer) and Hayd (singer ~ sing ~ ciel) Nice role as show and who GacT can change his lectures and ways of acting depending on how old I am. I am surprised at this. <br /> <br /> This must be seen. If you can not watch a movie, see Moon Children, Crowe (Brandon Lee) and the newly released Masterpiece Final Fantasy VII - Advant child. All their original language, of course!
