I've only rated it ten because I can see it as an impressive 18-year-old with a video camera on it. This is not an epic, but it was very compelling and I was not bothered. If billions of dollars go into a lot of bad movies, then pay the same amount to this director and see what will happen. I know, I went to the local movie for the first major liberation war. Well done well, and the value of money is good. What a script! It may be a low budget, but I recently saw that it hits in half the main photo. Nanavati knows how to tell both stories on writing and screen. Her serious cudo, can not wait to see more.
