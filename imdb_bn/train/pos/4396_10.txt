I really enjoyed the story that went to the script. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Rhys Myers (Misspellings) and Jewel were outstanding in their support role. As Jeffrey Wright was. Tobey McGuire was fined for acting as a fine, when he was breaking his best friend's hand, knowing that he would die without a procedure. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to better dialing coaching in order to capture incredible good sound accent. <br /> <br /> Why this movie got into the hole by the Hollywood promoters, I can only imagine. I have a strong suspicion. Which makes me more reliably I have given a dozen DVD copies for gifts. <br /> <br /> Completely ignored movie. Rent or buy it and pay your full attention for a few hours, then the judge.
