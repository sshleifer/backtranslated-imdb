This movie is incredible. The great character, especially the old sword that flies in the form of a fireplace and jumps across the trees, is a classic story of war between good and evil forces. The ultimate decoration is particularly exciting and the music score is very cool. <br /> <br /> Very, very recommendable. Although not for little children. It's worth a 10.
