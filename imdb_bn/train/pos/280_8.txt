Undying is a very good game which brings some new elements on the first person to shoot up tired tunes. It considers Patrick Galway as a story, and a friend from a friend of Ireland called him to investigate strange phonomena. After the World War I, this game was established in Ireland, so do not expect to find weapons like Chonggan or Rocket Launcher. All the weapons in the game may be considered an ancient thing, but the original fun in the game is its spell and the system they manage. Our hero ambidexterous so he can use both hands at the same time: He keeps spells with his right hand and uses his gun with the left. So you can shoot at the same time and throw that which you understand very funny and also this game is unique! Graphics are cool and they can run very well in a medium energy P.C.Level design, cool and atmospheric. Most of the game travels around the estate and the palace of the contract, but there are many other places waiting for you to be discovered as a progress. Thanks to Clive Barker's talent, this game has a great story and plot (something very rare for first-person shooters) and before a great and very wonderful atmosphere I said that voice acting is good but not nice. But there are two main errors in the game. First of all, it's quite linear, so when your mission goes in the room for example, all the doors in the house will be different from those who look at your mission room, it can save time, but it limits the freedom of your search. Secondly, all arms are the oldest weapons that can not appeal to most FPS players used for high-tech surgery. As far as difficulties are concerned difficulties are very well balanced game. It is mostly middle difficulty but sometimes it becomes more difficult but frustrating is not difficult. The overall undying is a great game. One of the best fps out of course
