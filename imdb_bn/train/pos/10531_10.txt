I like this movie. My friend Marcus and I were browsing local heights because we wanted to rent something that we had never seen before and ran out of this fine movie. We had no idea what it was going to be about, but it turned out to be spectacular. 2 thumbs up I loved how the film was shot, and the actors were very funny. If you are looking for a fun movie that you think, then I suggest you to run very fast in your local video store and find this movie. I'll tell you some of my favorite parts, but I can not do it so it can destroy the film for you. This movie is definitely the list of the top 10 best movies of my movie. Are you really thinking something shock?
