Al Gore directed our painstakingly honest and cute documentary-movie, "An Inconvenient Truth", directed by Alastair Forthgel and Mark Linfield, also reminds us that the time has come to improve our lives to save our beautiful planet. "Planet Earth" also has a wake up call that global warming of our planet has harmful results for all living creatures around the world. Al Gore presents difficult information to back up the world's long-term future psychologists through documented examples. These documentary manufacturers choose a different yet equally strong way to achieve this. If they do not really change our objects, then they do not present the future presentation about what can happen to our planet, rather they show the world's true beauty in all our wonderful magnificence. We see places we knew that existed but they could not be so beautiful. In this film we can see that there is a wide array of great places, such as the Farzan Result, Livestock and the wide forest of vegetation and snowy landscapes. And in those different situations, we try to survive the most beautiful animals. <br /> <br /> This is a type of movie that has been combined with Al Gore. In order to understand ours extremely sticky with our planet so that. Patrick Stewart's voice-over is always vivid and so well done, but at first it seems like I'm watching an X-Men movie! Cinematography is perhaps the most remarkable thing in this documentary. Occasionally: What you see is untrue, that you forget that a person with a camera was actually to portray those delightful footage. <br /> <br /> In short: It must be definitely for everyone to see. As it is the concern of every single person on this beautiful planet earth! The truth is: I never thought that our planet is so wonderful!
