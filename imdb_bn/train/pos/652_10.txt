This movie is so complex that it can be given a description and can still roll with it. You have an insecure, annoying and impressive main character (played by Jean-Pierre Leod) who is stuck in two (three, three) women. In intermediate monologues we hear his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies, we work his magic around three women that we love him. It can be premiere for a foul movie, it is full of rigorous, cold, spontaneous comments. Still manager Jan Eustache manages to keep it fresh, malicious and malicious. As a long movie, laughing can not explode, laughing after a two-hour conversation, Jean-Pierre Leouf shouts back suddenly when a chase line from the movie seems. In such circumstances, completely cinematographic and can not be completely restored in a lexicon. No one can recover the tragic and painful good solidarity of Francois LeBron towards the end of the movie. 3 and 1/2 hour and price per minute.
