If you played "Psyder-Man" in the PS version, you have seen it all. To really experience it you will get the DC version. Simply make it a much higher graphical game; The textures are sharp, the levels are easy to navigate, and it has a better word, it's the PS cousin. I bought this game at the end of 2002 and it is still standing up to this day. Well, Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is a much better and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'Web Web Head', choose it for your own gaming library. Swinging across the city as Spidi did not look good and dead in a good video game. If you have a Dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. The DC version is simply incredible.
