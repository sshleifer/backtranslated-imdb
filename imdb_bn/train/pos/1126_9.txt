My interest grew up as I saw the name of the name of Ephesians. My name is Eugenia so I thought it was OK, see what this is. I'm very happy I stayed in the channel. What a wonderful, wonderful story The drama, sorrow, was some of the top performers but a wonderful time. I see it and it makes me sad for all the drills in the film industry and beyond this beautiful little gems. Try Iffania, and I hope you enjoy it as much as you enjoy it. I have acquired even my children (27, 25, 20 and 17) to enjoy it. It starts slowly but creates the drama and pulls you into the story. Seeing this lovely movie, I want to immerse myself in Greek tragedies and pathogens.
