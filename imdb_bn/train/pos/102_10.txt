I first heard about this movie 0 years ago, when I was in grade school (!) I was a child, it's just that I enasaiklopidiyasera the classroom and through the film (or movie, and I) were under the entry. Do not remember), from the experimental to the mainstream of the film was still quite a few of them appear on the page for a aphaana was still. It made me really excited, because it has the maximum page (it is one of the elements of the scene with a scene of the movie was still images). /> <br /> years or more, the 18-year <br later, the National Film Preservation Foundation, where I live here released by the Public Library "American Film Archive Treasurer" was the 4-DVD set is available for checkout. So when I was reading a set of notes for the DVD case, then I wonder what aphasanati was one of the disks. After all these years, finally I could see the film! Watch it later, it's my little was (more biological-visible film was considered as it is a bad thing, but I'm more electronic aesthetic hope), but it aiemaeicao an impressive film, aiemaeicao, Scott Bartlett Using the film to use this film, pulling the film on itself and filming what it does Become a scene using video equipment (video monitor illustrated), it is more of a sad, lo-res look. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, the techniques used in this movie have been quite fraught in 1972. So it's still one of my favorite small / experimental movies, and as well as a creative inspiration for me ...
