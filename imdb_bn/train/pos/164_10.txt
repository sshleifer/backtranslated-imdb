Do not say I warn you, but you have to laugh. Probably enough to hit your stomach. Sure, it has some blood splattering, though all the good fun. So, it does not have any budget, when you need a budget to get a script like this. Take the time and check this. Well worth looking at two hours. If I could laugh as much as I could during this movie, then the world would be a happy place to live if everyone could laugh. <br /> <br />
