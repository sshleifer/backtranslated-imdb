Another example of what British movies can achieve now: a simple story, a good actress and a good actor. Brenda Bluthin recently gave stable and warmth performance as a widow and financially narrow Grace, with the help of strong supporting cast. In recent years, many TV series from British Isles and the "Quikie Small Town" card similar to the movie hit the hit. (Baliksengel, Hamish Macbeth and others feel in mind). As predicted, this film uses some horrible beautiful rural scenery, in this case the wet and wild Cornish coast. <br /> <br /> Some visitors may use Kenobis' ownership acceptance as a little challenging, others may find it very intelligent and safe ending. But it's an enjoyable spliff, to be sure.
