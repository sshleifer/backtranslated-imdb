The low form of women <br /> <br /> Some brave girls oppose this and try to enter the stadium using different techniques. They are caught by soldiers and kept in a cage, until the police comes and pick them up. <br /> <br /> In spite of being insane, it is a movie of many comedies. It always encourages how people always find different ways of tackling fraud. You will be touched at the same time as you laughs a lot. Director Jafar Panahi did a good job. This is a heroic comedy in many ways.
