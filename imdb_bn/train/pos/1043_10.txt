Since I can remember and I only see my mother and I look at older movies at the age of 18, because I think they are more productive for a long time (but she does not make me wrong. I love movies in the movies of the 40s and 50s of this day. No) However, now I will say that at this moment I started watching the film, my eyes were inserted on the TV. Of course my favorite character was Luciel Watson. But I love depicting Betty Davis and her family. Children ... do not act like little children. But there is a good reason for this, that most of your life has been hid and run, it seems that children who saw terrible things destroyed their innocence on that day. So people say, "ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq ' <br /> <br /> Paul Lucas ... Favorite Paul has done an amazing job !!! Now I know that many people are crazy that he did not go to Oscars and Bogie, but he has done amazing work, so I think it can go anyway. But Lucas's performance was so great that at the end of the movie I drifted tears. I love this movie so much and anyone recommend it !! :-D
