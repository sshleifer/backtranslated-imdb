When I was a little girl (and my dad owned a video store), it was among my favorite movies. I could not hear a lot about it since then, or I did not remember anything about it, it forgot another of Don Bluth's, probably better movie. I managed to track it a few weeks ago, however, and was pleasantly surprised again. Set in New Orleans in the 1930s, the animation is fun and songs are memorable. If you see it difficult enough, there are some caves in continuity, but they do not usually refrain from the story, which lets you laugh (and even harmful eyes, if you are a lover of animals). Characters are credible (perhaps becoming too big for young observers), as well. Two birds up, and you do not meet it for a while, those are definitely worth a reconsideration.
