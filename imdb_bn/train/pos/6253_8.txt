This picture is great. Often heard, it is actually very realistic and sometimes cruel, but unlike other people, I am not expressing the opinion that it is a disappointing, destroying Austria as a negative or proto-fascist society. On the contrary: Hendstage actually has some heavy scenes and some characters are very bad people, as well as you see love, beauty and humor in Ulrich Sitlos. And this is what makes me try to show life in a more intense, realistic way than 'other people' from other movies, which separates the handstasts. Their helse, their will, their dark aspects: Siddle does not clearly prove that the working class's life trash! In my opinion, the visitors who are in this conclusion seem fearful of admission that almost no one wants to believe other people as 'clean' and 'normal'. And that every live has its dark and often depressing party. The most beautiful scene: The old Venetian man saw his old daughter dancing on the Eastern way, just as he was calling her. I think everyone who is ugly about this scene does not have the feeling of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that is, the proto-fascist: the honextaz or the character of the character, who is stopped by the body of 70+ years old, for her lover all her charms
