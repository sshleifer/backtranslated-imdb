ABC's award winning television show "Lost" announced one of the main characters, "I looked at this island and it was beautiful." The series can be summarized as a story of a dramatic story of surviving crew of crashed planes on an unknown island, but it does disrespect the shot. "Lost" follows a large group that encounters the island and struggles with each other for their new way of life and their reliance on each other. The situation becomes even more complex when it becomes clear that it is not a common island, and they can not be alone. <br /> <br /> After initializing the idea of ​​this series, my initial fear was that the new lack of time could tell us stories after a certain time, but it proved to be unkind. The narrative flows naturally, the dialog is wonderful, the letters are memorable and executed. The island itself is a character, and to understand this comment you will have to see the series for yourself, which can only show its originality and glory. <br /> <br /> Reviewing it while writing, only the first two seasons have been broadcasted, and they are filled with strong episodes. My only gentle criticism that seems a bit slower on the second season, but then fortunately comes back in a pretty form for the final episode. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend a television series, you should follow it correctly now, it must be one of these. You are excited about the excitement, adventure, character-driven stories, a very strong cast and crew, beautiful location, and an island which seems more spiritual than the natural "lost" for you. Just make sure you start at the beginning.
