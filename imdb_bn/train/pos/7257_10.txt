Because I said this because I wrote a screenplay and knew very little about it until I wanted to see the movie. I'm writing it for some manufacturers who are saying it to me. Because Allan Dobby was a friend of mine, I got to hear about it. I was just writing a first draft so I realized that it was on the floor. I asked Peter Collinson, my agent, if he would like me to draft another. I asked if I could not see my original script because I lost it. I'm too late So I did the only thing that I could do under the circumstances and closed my name. I did not know what they could do on my play. Then I was invited to watch the finished film. I'm so impressed that I very quickly asked to keep my name back. This is a nicely made piece, from the first draft written early, I was expected to be asked to do more work on it; Probably if I would not be so good at it If someone knows where it's going to see my original script again? I love seeing this movie again, I saw it at a small theater in Soho.
