"Football Parade" is one of the few wonderful life musicals to avoid depression at the beginning of the 1930s. In this era "42nd Street" and Gold Digger series were also produced and they were literally made, millions of Americans forgot their problems for a while and enjoyed themselves. <br /> <br /> When most of the films were produced, the great talent of Joan Blondel, Ruby Keller and Dick Powell, was the only unfinished James Cagney in Fleet Parde. His most famous musical, "Yankee Doodle Dandy" almost ten years ago. Here he danced with the most original dance of dance styles, his arms usually bent down and his legs tear and kick all kinds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I believe that this movie was created before the installation code was produced, so some costumes and scenes are a little bit powering. But it's all fun. <br /> <br /> It does not matter what the plot of the movie is, just know that lots of smiles and extraordinary cast. In addition to the already mentioned, Guy Kibbi is here the best of his seratum. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 7
