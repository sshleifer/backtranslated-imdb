11 different filmmakers from different parts of the world agree to present their opinions and ideas about the WTC attack in this movie. This is the best effort you can see in any movie. The film like this is rarely made and appreciated. This film tries to touch all the core of the WTC's potential. Here are the most important stories of the film that make this movie so unique. <br /> <br /> Samira is preparing for America's invasion of America from Makhmalbaf (Iran). There a teacher is trying to educate his students with information about innocent people by killing the WTC genocide. Then came a story from Yusuf Chahain (Egypt) where a filmmaker, WTC Ahkun, spoke face to face with the dead soldier and was involved in the WTC attack with Doubt Hard Core Terrorists. Then we see a story from Idrissa Oddroogo (Burkina Faso) where five innocent children see a group Osama bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from America. Then we see from Alangandro Gozalez Inertri (Mexico) where you see a black screen and gradually you see the actual footage of WTC buildings coming to see. And those who are stuck in this building, they jumped from it to save their lives. The other most important story is from Mira Nair (India), where a mother is struggling to honor her dead son, whose name is WTC genocide false accusations! After the September 11 attacks, our heart rate starts pumping automatically if we hear any name in the world. First, the world trade center and the second is Osama! This image completely changes our perception and makes a strong point by demanding something more. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to everyone who likes this kind of home DVD collection. Surely every money you spend is certainly sure. But do not miss anything more than the movies on this DVD. Of course filmmakers have films but there is no additional feature.
