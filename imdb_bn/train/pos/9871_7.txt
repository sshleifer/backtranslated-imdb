The 1992 version of Return to the Lost World was again filmed with The Lost World. <br /> <br /> In this continuation, these five people have returned to Platyus led by Challenger, where a group has started threatening to destroy the land that drops for oil. Gomez has something to do with this. They defeated the driller and saved the plattoo, the negative is much more of joy. <br /> <br /> Like the Lost World, do we see some dinosaurs made of rubber and have T-Rex and Ankylosaurus? <br /> <br /> John Rehs-Davis and David Warner reprise their role as Challenger and Samarli and return to the other three actors also. <br /> <br /> Despite reading these several bad reviews and looking for those cheap rubber dinosaurs, I enjoyed returning to the Lost World. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 5 out of 3 stars.
