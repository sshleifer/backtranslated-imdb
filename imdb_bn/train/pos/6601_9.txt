This film is absolutely stunning A new blade runner - silent in the future It is the most wonderful Paris's views are spectacular, both recognized and spectacular, earthy, granger set pieces and future virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The story line is very simple, with some surprises, but it is not my favorite film about the movie. This is a visual treatment. <br /> <br /> is done in 3D and is transformed with only a small spot in black and white color (no color!) color, it is less difficult than the eye. Many "arty" camera shots - closeups and curious view points - but that just adds to the mood of the film. Overall, you get the impression of a graphic novel in the form of footage. <br /> <br /> I was initially under the impression that this image has been rotoscoped, such as the level of animation and the higher details in the facial expressions of the character. But unlike "A Scanner Darkly" - which suffers from the definition of incompatible character (or indeed extended) (just change some hair size!) - Renaissance consistent and precise. When the character is closed, additional details and textures can be seen, but if the mid-shot or far-off details are omitted, but not for the loss of the character definition. <br /> <br /> For me, the only bottom portion of the film has been said in one comment that it is a single project. As shame, I would like to see more of this future film-house story, and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and English dub is very good. <br /> <br /> All is a great film and highly recommended.
