I do not know if it's a spoiler or not, but I do not want to risk being blacklisted for 3462 years. <br /> <br /> I do not fully agree with the views of viewers, which are "politically correct" and "neo-Marxist" as guns, germs and steel. <br/> <br /> This series * I * saw in Syria the European colonial history of America and South Africa without any special mistake. I did not see anything in Syria that portrayed Europeans as poor people to be lucky, although Europeans were often lucky - and there was nothing wrong with fate. I do not see the poor people painted as poor little innocent things. If anything, it was rather arrogant - as if dealing with foreigners, a leader would expect a leader, if his country did not win the memories alive by any other world power. <br /> <br /> I have certainly seen something that can be considered as a Marxist or Neo-Marxist, without one fantasy fantasy. No, there are many African people * there is a lack of malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack. At that time, they were at the height of their success, the agate, the Maya and the Inca civilizations * were developed as any other in the world - and as rich; Sometimes more so. Indigenous American and Kho-san population * is determined by the roots of Europeans and other diseases; Just as European settlers were reduced by tropical diseases like malaria. (Note: Khoi-san people are completely different from all other sub-Saharan African people.) <br /> <br /> So, I see some other commentators complain or not. Only * I * complain that the series will not tell me something that I do not know when I finish seventh grade. There is nothing new on the path of historical information in this movie. However, some of the events include dramatic events such as Inca's victory; Production quality is very high; Miss Gourre at Milon Middle School has been admitted to the six-hour Social Studies class here and there are few holes in it. <br /> <br /> If you rent or buy it, it seems like you have a decent primary and / or secondary school education, you will not be able to learn anything new, but what you have learned (or learned) while attending high school You will have an enjoyable and entertaining time to review.
