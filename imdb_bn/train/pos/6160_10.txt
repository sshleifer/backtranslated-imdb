SPILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I just saw an extended version of Badnabubs and Bromsticks. Although I like the extended version, I want them to release the original version in DVD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was too long and dragging the movie along. Although the dance is great, but the DVDs were very good in DVDs. <br /> <br /> All these are a great movie. My 5 year old likes it. And it's wonderful that I enjoy being as a child being passed on to a new generation of movies. This and Mary Poppins are added to my collection. <br /> <br /> Just like I did! <br /> <br /> *** *** *** <br /> <br /> <br />
