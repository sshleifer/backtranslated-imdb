I believe I found this picture when I was a minor. I think it's watching as a child, but I could not find the film. I remember the good Allgende Anne, Andy, Babbet, Greedy, King Koo Ku. I searched high and low for this movie and there is still no luck. But one day when I was leaving my childhood, I found it. We are reunited I am 17 years old now. I still see it. Actually all the time. This is one of the fun and sensitive movies I've seen and enjoyed at the same time. And personally I think they should be a sequel. Mr. Yes, yes a signal is really. Now I'm even considering tattoo captain birds somewhere in my body!
