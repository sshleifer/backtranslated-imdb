Fine effort for an Australian show Which is probably not seen as amazing as a resurgence of Australian drama seems somewhat. I love the love of this love dare to compare? No But it's a memorable one of our first secret lives. Cast is great, the first two episodes I saw in the jiban works its magic, the British cast is especially powerful in columns and lizzie characters. But if this event gets another season it can be a light of storage (it is not necessary to store it). I was not a supporter of his performance in the amazing marquee time mini series a few years ago, but he was always nice as a hale like a deer. It's good to see Brooke satchwell again. Hope the program improves with each episode.
