It seems to be incredible, Gozo is an animation- and Hong Kong-inspired Samurai, a Action Flick with a peace message. The film's heel is effectively depicted as a hero-transformed-bodist-monk Bennky, through drama (a wonderful acting edited by Daisuke Roy). Bencken did not swear to kill again, but he still thinks he had the sword to fight against a demon attack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Expression shots, leid colors, digital effects etc.). So the end result is somewhat tedious. Who said that both the elegant and the strong despite the beginning and end of the film. If the director Sogo Isis was quite intelligent, then his tricks can not be used extra. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For a film with such a violent fierce message, Gozo is too much to portray unlimited war scenes Power and screen time wasted. Also, the way shown in the violence is always on self-motivated edges; Actually, one of the blood shower film signature images against the night sky. Thankfully, Eisei is wise enough to show the ugly, unhappy side of violence. Still, it seems that Ishii is not making any traditional action film or deep moral fairy tale. At the very end of the audience, it can not be confirmed. Powerful (though stupid) end, which preserves Gozo; It clearly emphasizes that this film is more than just a Gore-Fest.
