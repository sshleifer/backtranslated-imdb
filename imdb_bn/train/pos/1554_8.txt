I saw it in the theater in the early 1970's. The most memorable and scary scenes of the German army attacking the Yellow Cross Mustard Gas for the first time. The toes (or hoof) from Germany and their horse heads are covered with stylish protective suits. Experienced British soldiers only get gas masks (only) and wait for gas clouds and German attackers again. Gas clouds go much closer, finally, surrounded by British defenders. The Germans slowly proceed in their scary looking dress. Suddenly a shout from the defenders ... this gas is not something they have experienced before .... <br /> <br /> Now you know why I have remembered this scene for the past 30+ years and still cold, I I think you too!
