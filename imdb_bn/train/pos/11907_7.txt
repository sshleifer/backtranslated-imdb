And so, the body of this film is trampling on and out of our tragedy, buses and coaches - jump over the shower - Scrubbing across the dockyard rooftops. <br /> <br /> All the good stuff - but I did not think it was all unnecessary. They should have kept. <br /> <br /> In other words, McGuffin was not strong enough.
