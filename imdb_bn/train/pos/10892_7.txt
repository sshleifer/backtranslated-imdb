What do you like about this movie? Every year you know that you are going to get one or two yearlord films during Christmas and most of them are going to be terrible. This is definitely a fresh new concept that was definitely well drawn in the movie. A real christmas imitation for her liked a very young man in a wealthy young man paying a family. If you can not do anything interesting with it, it's good to have the money like this. It was a win-win situation. A regular family gets six figures and a wealthy guy has a Christmas experience to imagine. Just if <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was impossible to deal with Dres Latham (Ben Affleck) and the family unwittingly obeys its irrational needs. It was a riot to run. It was a fun and funny movie.
