Although I usually do not believe in remaking the time; This picture is an exception. Until I read the previous comment, I did not really know that it was a remix, so my opinion is not compared to the actual movie and compared to that. <br /> <br /> The story and the way of writing is not a question: it is Capote. There is no need for more words. <br /> <br /> Anthony Edwards and Eric Roberts' game are fantastic. I've seen some movies with them, each one or the other. I'm sure that they are good actors and Eric Case I always wondered why his sister is No. 1's famous star and not his brother. At this time this confirmation is actually raised, no question. His game, as well as the game of Mr. Edwards, is clear on top of all their career. <br /> <br /> I recommend recommending this movie for your DVD shelf and for your best 50 films.
