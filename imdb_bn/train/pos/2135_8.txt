Shall we dance is an extraordinary movie because it shows how the dance can revive the flow of life in the human spirit. <br /> <br /> Dance is seen as an expression of being and the birth of a personality. The case with Aoki, of course. At work he was deanzene at a low office, but he kept the dance floor and all the intensity of his bottle was revealed. Surprisingly, due to the harsh culture of the continuation of this release, the liberation of Japan has deteriorated. At the beginning of the film, their desire to dance all the characters are ashamed or scared. They will be deemed scorned, or distorted, to express their emotions through dance. <br /> <br /> This image is a good value to see people's emotions and emotions witness to regenerate. It can leave a smile on your face for the day.
