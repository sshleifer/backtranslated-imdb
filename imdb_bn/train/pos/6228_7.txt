Another fun, wicked, lively RKO musical with the Astiar and Rogers, the Fallet the Fleet is a charming movie. Although it lacks stand-out great sound of SWNG time (although the final number "face up to music and dance" is the best and right face of the team), but it is very enjoyable, because these two virtually can not make mistakes together in the 1930s. Again, the plot is lightweight and forgotten, but Fred and Ginger are together in heaven to monitor dance. These two films have more romance and dance magazines than many couples in a huge love scene. Although there are good Fred and Ginger musicals, this certainly must of course be seen.
