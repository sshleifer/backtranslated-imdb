It's a plain old witless ghost story. I have shown some of my friends in my movie club, and finally they keep spellings! No blood or gore-just good old fashion suspension. It starts right from the beginning, and builds and builds. Finishing a real wrapping that unawares me. <br /> <br /> Well guided and well-played. It is a "piece of piece" - set in the 1920s - which has been added to the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was very impressive I got Susan Hill from Amazon. Movies rather closely follow the book. <br /> <br /> It's embarrassing that it is not easily available on DVD. My copy is VHS. Along with this "uncomfortable" I've probably ever seen two of the best Ghost horses. Which just shows that a little creativity holes "your face" in a day!
