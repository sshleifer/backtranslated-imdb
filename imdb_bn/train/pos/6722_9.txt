Everyone has already commented on cinematography (from great to great), personality (bigger than life), structure (chronological, time, with many mention of surf culture). Miss is a big question of socialist gravity: mainstream American culture revolves around something more satisfying and rewarding. <br /> <br /> I was a surfer in the 1970s. We used to watch 16mm movie in Sokal's local high schools. Until my skin's heat evolves, I remember the wonderful feeling of surfing all day long to enter Hawaiian shirts and shorts and watch the latest surfing of the night. Often, the narrator himself was a filmmaker, used to read a script for closing papers. Sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band will add music. I was not happy. Besides whiting and holering, I took time again to see 'riding giants'. <br /> <br /> It makes a feeling stronger that lives on the edge, does not think about the meaning and the social and corporate climb. The stairs, not with Jones's, are imposing physically and mentally for a moment of joy and genes - the answer to the question is, "What is the purpose of life?" At least for Gregg pole, Layered Hamilton and his looks, some of them are found that some of us are brave or honest enough to follow: To save lives on our own terms. It may be surprising to see people who really want to find their dreams, if everything is different from what we wanted in life. <br /> <br /> This message really impressed me.
