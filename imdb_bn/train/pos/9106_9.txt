As I saw it for the first time, "Piedras" is a personal favorite and a few pictures that I can actually see again. Great screenplay illustrates the life of a bunch of women (combined with all of them) with deep understanding and sensitivity. Raman Salazar has achieved an impressive film on his operated debut and proved himself to be an expert actor. <br /> <br /> Not all the performance is excellent. Among all the leading women, they range from average (Najwa Nimri) to very well (Vicky Pena), but the permanent festival should be directed to Monoca Sivervar, who sincerely acted in San Juan's disabled girl in Antioch. Enrique Alcides is an oddly impressive girl's male nurse, and Andres Gertudidx, Galee Albaladzeo and the director herself have beautiful little cell phones from Raman Salazar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Pyadras" is well-written and illustrated. I have seen that for so long I have not been able to think that I can not think it in days. I highly recommend it.
