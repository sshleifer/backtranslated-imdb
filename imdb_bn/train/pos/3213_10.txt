A perfect example of "Less Than ..." QT Russell (Szad Tod) is just 72 lines and 104 likes. What a challenge! Like a black and white photo, when your eyes are filled with empty eyes, facial expression, physical drama, emotional gesture, all can have strong effects. One of the top 5 movies I can not live without, well it's classic like street fighters. If you like it, then watch "Mad Max 2, The Road Warrior" and "Bravo" by playing Mel Gibson. Also with "Gladiator" Russell Crowe and Kony Nelsen who was Soldier. Actor Antonio Banderas and "Blade Runner" starring "Thorol Warrior" Harrison Ford.
