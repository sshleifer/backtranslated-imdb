After seeing "Guinea Pig", two questions come to mind ('I really like to see it?'): 'Is this a snap?' No answer; Although it's the closest thing to a snap movie I've ever seen. And then: 'Where are they found that girl?' He was tortured for '45 minutes because without any reason (actually, there is nothing else in this movie!): Fungus hands, feet, equipment, tortured by maggots ... and many more final scenes (I'm still not sure they What has happened). Because it's part of 'Japan underground scene', it is clear that he did not get much money. So what was his motivation? <br /> <br /> I saw it in Japan without a subtitle, but it is not a problem (no real conversations, boys are just insulting some scenes). I still have not seen all the cereals, but the first "Guinea Pig" is not known to be one of the best. Yet I've rated 8, because if the purpose is that people can trust this sniff, but the thing is pretty good. (Tell the actor Charlie Shane). But I think they could go further, which they did later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
