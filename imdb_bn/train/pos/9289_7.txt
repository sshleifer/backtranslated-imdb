Barbarian and Gisaya, John Wein Townshend played Harris, who is the real ambassador of the United States who was responsible for opening Japan with international relations in the late 1850s. Prior to that, Camodorone Perry originally entered Japan with gunmen and in 1853 an agreement was signed on the Japanese. Harris, who came only a few days later, worked with details and helped to confirm compliance - many Japanese felt his special tendency to respect the first contract. All this is true and the film is shown. According to some other sources, most of the romance in Harris and Japanese Gisha is fiction and this romance attracts more attention (because of the title) of this film. <br /> <br /> My first reaction was the first time I saw this movie. John Wayne as a diplomat?! When he is diplomatic in most films, he is kindly saying and thanked for joking people !!!! So he is shown a man who is not a worker and is able to play diplomatic games, he must be very strange. Actually, in 1958 I could not remember many actors who were more unusual for this role. However, I did not see any similarity with the pictures of Harris and Owen. <br /> <br /> Despite the story of many freedoms taking with true and strange casting, the film is still very watchable. Color cinematography is excellent, the film shows some nice insights in Japanese customs and culture and the performance is not bad. After all, it's a favorite and visible movie despite exceptional casting. <br /> <br /> PS - Read the intensity for this movie. You find out more about the real life characters as well as the supposed war between Wayne and director (John Houston) where Wayne definitely finds him !! Based on the way I read along with Houston and the actors, this is an incident that I believe. And, it is a wonderful example of John Wayne "diplomacy".
