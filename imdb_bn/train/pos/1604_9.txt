I'm really surprised this movie did not get high rating on IMDB. It is a film that can be easily received by someone, but the romantic comedy "Moonstrack" really is in a class itself. It seems to be setting and ethnic charm things approved for people. Single voting makes it almost a perfect movie. In the 1980's, some movies were good as "Moonstrack" and it is very interesting. **** out of *****
