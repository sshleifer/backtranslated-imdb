It has been made good shots and, very good shots and made! But the story was so weak. And Lincoln's illustration was even weak. Henry Fonda is not good, but the character that he played was nothing but a loon. What you mean to say is that Lincoln had an intelligent cracking smart ass without any respect to the law or court. I mean that he could be hell? Cousin niece? I mean, "I'll tell you Jacques" ???? I got to know that Ford was going for a very funny hero, but I really did not like this guy. She cheats in sports, does not seem like a real sweet easy to find and sit in a courtroom. I was supposed to take this seriously. <br /> <br /> The twist was too weak. Come on, come on! That was just stupid. The whole story seemed almost 5 years old in her dream. I said, I liked it enough, it was very entertaining and made me laugh several times, so I can not say it is a bad film. In fact, I must say that I should speak good enough, which makes me entertain and let me laugh it may be bad, but this javascript and silly story was so ridiculous that I do not understand how anyone can consider it. <Br /> <br /> I do not know whether this film is historically correct, but if its truth is true then I will have to reduce my head.
