I've seen this movie a couple of dozen times and it's cool. But the only thing that was to start with was that there was a lot more about who went with it. I think it will be interesting to make a remake. But on the official site they said they would not rebuild it because many people were saved while watching it. Now what happened with the daddy? She is a pretty good actress. He has made several films in the 70's and 80's, but we have not heard from him. I'm sure about Jerry Rachford playing Jerry, who works for accounting at RD Films. But overall, I want to say that the series itself has gone left to the old school.
