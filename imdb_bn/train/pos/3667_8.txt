The Hollywood answer in Canadian film history was a satirical look when Canadian government made huge tax breaks for Canadian-made movies. Most of the time it was considered tax shelter or cheap way to make American films. For example, the turkey came out. However Matthew Murdin is a stranger producer who does not want to make an adaptation to a favorite Canadian novel. However, he needs an American name star to get the money. He gets a loose shot and must learn how to compromise on the point where the film was not exactly the same as the book. It can play well in Canada but the Great White can not be understood outside the North. Americans will think we are mocking ourselves, but we will miss that point that we actually mock them. 5/10 for Canadians 8/10/10 for everyone else.
