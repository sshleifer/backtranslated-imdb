This movie has been dying to see me. Well it's actually decided to rent. It was completely worth it. This movie lets me laugh from start to finish. Chris Rock is funny in any of the fun movies. However, it should be closer to its greatest near. If you look for a family movie, ie pre-teens and up, then this can not pass you.
