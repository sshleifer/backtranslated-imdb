I saw this movie on the Hallmark channel and it was nice, especially since it was based on real people. Pearce Brosnan Lonner was very good like an English man, who had accepted the half-lineal personality of Gray Aul. The photography was beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie made me more interested in this character, Archie Ballan is known as Gray Oil. I want to read as much as possible about him. At that time I did not know Richard Attenborough did it. But I'm not surprised. I love all his movies whether he is acting or indicating. I gave it the highest rating. However, I would have thought more about this person because I saw this person because it showed only those cousins ​​who took her home and her home. You can not go. If you are like me, then make a mistake with this movie and enjoy the beautiful story without listening to silly language and without special effects every few minutes.
