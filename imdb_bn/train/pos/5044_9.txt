Bill Paxton operates and operates in this very original movie. The first time I saw how good I was. I heard the reviews were okay. As a result, I was expecting an average thriller for most of the time. However, due to the excellent direction and acting of the film, the film is well worth it, especially if you are a horror movie hostess. The film also helps plot twists until it comes. Off credit Movies are the most powerful point, which I say is very original and I have never seen before. Well if these misguided boys express perfectly emotions 2 young leaders are also done. I am giving this picture 9/10 and I highly recommend that it takes everyone away.
