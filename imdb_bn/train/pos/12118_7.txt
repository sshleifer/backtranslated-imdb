When I saw that the film was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. Dr. Dr. Throwing Somerset Mushroom in a novel novel, the watch was awaiting an incident within one and a half hour. But you know, the film is not half bad and it even guides to keep a lot of things that are very fond of the book's readers. <br /> <br /> I heard many movies buzz that Leslie Howard was an actor's wet noodle, and she was, but I can not think of someone more suitable to play the role of Philipp Kerry than a wet noodle, it is obvious why Carey Is. Howard did it well, which means that you want to hold him down and raise his head again, then finally take him out and buy the spine. <br /> <br /> Ah, and the girl with whom she is crying, and around her disaster, bring her world to the world. I did not know what was in the world, Milldale's appeal was in the book, and the film considers that statement true. But starring Davis, she has become the most amazing character in the story, and if she is nasty and unlikely, she is at least one of the most dynamic people of the screen. Here Davis's performance screen was submitted to change course, after Brandon's almost 20 years when he "Stella" plays those little tennis Williams, and why it is not difficult to see, Davis's horrible point is intense. He does not try to prevent sympathy, and he looks ugly and quite lazy, when his face or his name is unheard of. Kerry was delayed in the film in search of Cree's death (although it does not care much about hiding an STD), it is frustrating. Of course, this film has shrunk just before the production code came into effect; if it was created a year later You could have been a bit different. <br /> <br /> Yes, most of the novels and most of the interesting parts are cut by the floor of the house. And the story really became about Kerry and Mildred, and nothing else. I found it to be the least fun and most annoying part of Mestam's novel, but it is a part that gives the title its title and it seems that readers are still Hold it, so it hit me as a wise decision. They opted for the novel to be part of the filmmakers. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
