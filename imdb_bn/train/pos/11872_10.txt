Many people love this movie and many love it, but it seems that it is for the wrong reasons. Scarface likes and should be liked but it has not been. <br /> <br /> Many people say that acting was the top, but who is better than acting more characters. Al Pacino Here the top of the pasino went over-the-top would be a understatement. Yet he has done so well, he has just done so well in your inner devil. His character Tony Montana was not a big man to start, but thirsty brought his level of greed for his power; An inhumane level. Of course Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not seem to be all a liability at all. Support Cast very well served its work. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really his best but he certainly fit the role of acting. On the other hand, Steven Bauer was his best player, yet he is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Maastricht was also good and fit her role like Michele Pfeiffer. Robert Loggia I've always enjoyed watching watching him yell. Without Pacino they really did not have any standout or memorable performances. Everyone just fit their role by staying there. They were not perfectly fit but were quite confident. <br /> <br /> Brian de Palma did a very good job in this movie. Whenever an actor can grow up to his career with life, then the director should give some credit and I will definitely give it to Pallama. Brian de Palma, though not honored, is a very versatile director by my calculations. He knows how to manage movies according to their style, but has turned out well at that time. Here it is a gangster film, but it is much better than it is due to the passing of several dails. <br /> <br /> The author was right pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credit at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone wrote this article, I was not at least surprised. Although a rule for him I always have a great writer and I have it and he has proved it again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write a real reality for a movie than Oliver Stone. <br /> <br /> The music was good but it was not cool. It's certainly not my favorite, Giorgi Morodor. The song was about 80 seconds-ish for me but it did not bother me. The cinematography was not good, amazing but it's really a car with a movie. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the most influential movies in the last 25 years, but it has been mentioned earlier that due to wrong reasons. People must understand the character of Tony Montana no protagonist character, he is a demon. He is not inspirational anyway. She is greedy, bloodthirsty, illiterate and self-feeding. Yet he is the role model of many people because he is a rebel in any way or another but perhaps most likely because he is a confused gangster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The good thing about this picture though shows that Tony Montana is not a real problem. If we or the authorities want to stop people like him, we can do it but we do not. On a strange package he is a necessity of our society. He can blame all of you and he gets better about himself. Tony Montana of this world is the smog of our society. In this way, people like him do not excuse. Instead it is a reminder that we can not allow ourselves to confiscate or do bad things ourselves because we measure or think we compare a gangster or a drug dealer relatively well. I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie, it's a movie that strangely arises in you.
