At 7:30 in the morning, I was very close to the school. Animation and computer graphics were spectacular for the time being. The idea of ​​throwing imagery and ordinary people evacuated near space missions and robots was amazing. It may have inspired the Treasure Planet. Unfortunately, it's really annoying in DVD format. The show is all basically identical. When viewing a non-serial episode in a DVD, you killed the stone by # 3. By today's standard, animation spot. We no longer look at computer graphics and pay attention to how strict the characters are. <br /> <br /> Bright spots heroin characters. They were much more credible, took themselves more seriously than the modern heroes, and they were not. They actually save men.
