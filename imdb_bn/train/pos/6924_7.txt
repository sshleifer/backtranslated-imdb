After returning from the complex Western wartime service in Jams Stewart's career, he wanted to change the image through his western, which was considered to be the cause of the western flow in the 1950s, because it was very impressive. It is not very technically photographed by technicolor. <br /> <br /> Stuart won the first prize for "West won the gun", but after stealing, it would have to spend the rest of the film for recovery. Shelley Winters is a shadowy girl with a dishonest reputation and the local bad boy gunman in Stephen McNally Dodge City. GEER Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA are Shelley's bad boyfriend. And you do not know that this is a public-international film, Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson (both at unknown). <br /> <br /> An interesting sequence represents the first Indian attack, through which Charles Drach identified himself as a coward who left Shelley alone in horse drawn wagons. Later he rebuilt himself, but it became only a tornado and active form which passes the gun from one helpless hand - but finally ends with the right owner. <br /> <br /> Stephen McNally and James Stewart are almost as a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic (but not quite) as DUEL in the end of Sun's burning gun. McNally makes perfect villain and DAN DURYEA he is equally traitors of the kind of villainous role played as a low-life gunslinger across 40 years. <br /> <br /> The construction of tights is very well run by Anthony Mann, and Rock Hudson (submitting as Young Bull) looks like Indian war paint and Tony Curritis are like a young soldier, who is that thin and attractive Shelley Keep a long look at the winters. <br /> <br /> Look up well and of course above average stories.
