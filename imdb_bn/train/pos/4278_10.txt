I've seen this movie more than any other time (I believe it was seen once every year after it was released). And every time I see it, it is equally gorgeous and always reveals my new things. Cast is probably the best combination of UK Sinemontography. This movie is an absolute must for any self respected movie lover. In the same league: Martaoni Trace Pokasni Krung, Balkanski Spijun and Oatak Na Sluzbyman Putu. It's a poker of movies from everyone's own personal video collection.
