Rare events include a movie with the ability to stretch the mind, warm heart and touch the very soul. "LOU" is such a film. I got "LOU" from my wife who got it from a neighbor, who is in the film business. He saw it with me second time. We both were enthralled. <br /> <br /> "Lau" is a magical piece designed to send you at your moment That was where all your plays started. This is working relentlessly while doing this. Brett Carr acting as director and pacing does not let you look away from the screen. He wrote a character that robs innocent, innocentness with a bug, but warmly carries with warmth that you forget that you are watching a movie. When Epiphany was hit during a bright hike, I saw my wife in tears for the second time. <br /> <br /> As a life coach I facilitate personal growth and transformation, and for this film "Must be seen" life coach and seeking their personal growth and transformation. It's a brilliant, creative skill, ability to change life!
