Since watching this movie as a child for more than 30 years, I have never been tired to see it. From the front of the short factory to the car from the back seat of the car, Oli was answering the phone and by storm, the wind hit the window suddenly, it was probably the best film next day. After this, they went to Fox in the 20th century and when these films were not terrible, they had lack of comic timing. Jimmy Finson, his long time foil, his last appearance with the boys, as a super super doctor! Quotation: "I told the goat milk" to his reply to Stan, how do you milk a ghost! Charlie Hall and even Ben Turpin show up! I want to tell all of my favorite L & H comedy all in one.
