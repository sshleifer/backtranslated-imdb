My favorite "Imperialism" movie and the best action-adventure Flecks of all time. Grant, McLuggle, and Fairbanks dominate the screen with bold-and-cute cracks, but please feel free to everyone except the movie's "PC". A lot of memorable scenes - 3 sergeants and 20 of them sepoys battle several thousand; McChesney and Cutter give punch to Bobby Koot ("Save something for elephants"); McChesney cut - "I'm an expedition"; Out of prison, going to prison, a fork ("Do you think I'm going out? Bladdin's pudding?!) And the scene of the incredible temple with the Katar song and then brave like bronze -" All of you are arrested Gone! <br /> <br /> I could go, but not saying that when I try to capture this image Armchair's adventure and generals are hard to imagine it. A good 2 hours
