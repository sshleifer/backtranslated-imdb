The second feature is disappointing for a young woman in London, who is happy to accept the signature signed with an elderly woman and her son. The thrillers always made me feel uncomfortable against the people in their civil war against their wishes - I also feel a prisoner - but this classified B-film is not flexible or clastropobic. It is a very unstable, but not selfish, and our heroine (Nina Fokk) is quick on her feet. Revising it as "winter dead" in 1986 has not been proved with wisdom, because the elements of the plot are not of modern day. "Julia Ross" is extremely compact (very short in the 65th minute!) But it slowly runs nicely until climax, which seems a bit sloppy. *** *** to ***
