This is a very nice movie and I will definitely recommend it to everyone. But there are 2 minus points: - There is a large spectrum of story level. Some of the scenes are very great and some are annoying. - Many stories are not self-contained (if you compare with Fif coffee and cigarettes, where each story has a point, a message, a fifth or you want to call it), but most of the stories are really good, some great and above all it is sure To be one of the best movies of this year! <br /> <br /> It's boring, I have to fill the minimum 10 lines, I do not have to say anything more and I do not want to start the single series analysis ... <br /> Well, I think it's !
