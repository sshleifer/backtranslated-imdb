Batty Davis' electrifying performance is such that it is difficult to remember other female players. Davis had her as they were perfect in their part - they just do not have to do. Critics think that this book was so good - it was no reason to reduce the 83 minutes of the 600 page book. About the time of Philip's childhood, the first part of the book was not even made on the screen. Then he went to Germany and Paris, where Philip tried to do as well as the artist. It also chronicles his first romance - with Fanny Price, when he realizes that Philip can not bring back his love feeling. This is a wonderful book but I think that anyone who does not think too much about the film will read the book and understand how good the movie is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A medieval painter, Philipp Carey (Leslie Howard), took drugs, hoping to return to England. When he was out of a tearoom, he met a Sullen waitress, Mildred (Bate Davis). Although he does not care about her and basically thinks of him as a dirty, Philip is neglected. Trying to find no civility in this harmful burglary is hard to see. At one point, he pledged to meet him in the second class railway waiting room, when they face each other, he gave him semen, "Why should I wait in the room waiting for second class if one of the first classes is found." You just want to shake him. When he told him that he was going to marry another person, he was a deadly salesman, Emil Miller (Alan Hell). Outside of Milldale's photo, he meets Nora (Kay Johnson) a beautiful woman, who wrote a romantic novel in the male's name. He joking about the popularity of books among his servants (he saw his writing in the novel Mildred.) Norah gives Philip all his love and confidence, but he is unable to return his love. When Milledrade returns (Miller does not marry her and has a child), she must take care of her and help her with the baby (in the film it is considered an object - always called "baby", never given a name Or sex) - She gets her reward by escaping with her best friend. <br /> <br /> She is going to see her sick father in the hospital Seli Atheli (Frances D). She gets a sense of family visit and first time in her life. Then surprise! Surprise! Mildred back like a bad money and surprise! Philip took him in. But he has changed and when he tries to express gratitude, he only feels hated. Then, following the one of the most fierce, oral fights in the films as "You Cad, You Dirty Swine", "I kissed you because you were begging me" and "When you went, I wiped my face, I pressed my face" !!! In the book, Stock credits such as "You're a gentleman in every sense of the word", "I do not mind" and "Mr. High and mighty" prostitution and when Philip meets her <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> She again tells Philip in the book that she thinks she is a child of a child, but this is about her love for her. Makes more sure. Milledrade may end up like "sickness", even in the movie. Even though <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> KK Johnson was always invited to play intelligent, believable women - which she was fully aware of herself completely played. His nurse was supposed to have woman woman Philip. Frances D is one of the most beautiful of screen material. He was created for some role in the role of Starodom, which proved that he was not just a beautiful face ("silver cord" and "blood money") but when Joel married McCracky, his career started. Her Sally did not push her talent to the limit. Apparently Leslie Howard was not very helpful for Bat Davis - she was upset that an English actress was not part of it. He used to throw his line "When reading a book off the camera" throw. When a newspaper "the kid is running away with the picture" he started to express interest !!! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, highly recommended.
