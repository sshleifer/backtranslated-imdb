I've enjoyed this picture. It was fun, cute, silly, and entertaining. There was a fine cast and really I did not understand that due to some got hammered by critics. No, it was not "gourmet grape" or "Casablanca" or even "Moonstrack", but it was an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> The story is a little silly to be sure, but it is not a high drama, folks. I saw a review of the film, perhaps it was only good and then ran in one night while watching a movie. I did not see it until I saw it, and I'm glad I saw it. Finally, bought VHS tape on exchange pills, and I see it several times a year.
