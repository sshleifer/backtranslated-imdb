What can be said about Mr. Moore? He is the Godfather of Rap, he is the king of the Z-level Black Plupleting Flickr, and here, he returned as Dolmite's most famous character! Can you dig it? This movie is politically incorrect humor, trippi kung-fu, nudity, cheese, violence and most other stuff that you never find in most modern films (or a movie, really, ha ha!) Study-up routine he will not miss initially! At any rate, D2 is definitely an entertaining way to waste a hour or more. Dllime: "He thinks he is bad and no class! I will upload this shotgun to his * BP ** **!"
