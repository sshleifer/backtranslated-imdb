This is an impressive account of the first known serial killers of the Soviet Union. I just hope in one half of the beautiful TV movie, but I strongly hold myself to say the story. As others have said, there are so many complimentary performances that sadly there is a lack of great screen release. <br/> <br/> Most credits must go to Chris Giroumou, who has to draw intelligent screenplay and guided viewers. It is impossible not to feel mentally involved. The whole cast performance is fantastic, especially two leads, Stephen Rey and Donald Sotherland. Their strong symbols give their character a bigger share of credibility and are actually touched in the meeting of their first committee after the scene. <br /> <br /> If you like your crime film with a little more depth and a little less, I strongly recommend that you search for 'Citizen X'. <br /> <br />
