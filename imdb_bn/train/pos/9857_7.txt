Although I love this movie, the years before the trailers hit the theater, they set my expectations a bit more. <br /> <br /> I'm the DVD owner, so do not make me wrong, I'm not saying to see it or even buy it! It's just that I was still the best at the first scene, and nothing in the whole film was not at the top of it.
