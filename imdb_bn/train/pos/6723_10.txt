Riding giant is an amazing movie. It really shows how these people came to surf again. Their lives are basically surfing, living, breathing, and having fun. They do not care about money, jobs, girls or any things. The wave for them was their girls. I have never been on the surf board, and it seems so difficult, they do not understand how they can stay on them, it does not have any meaning. This is a great movie and if you love surfing you must watch this movie. If you are a surfer and you start surfing, how it comes to living, want to know which fact or what is really famous but you must see it. It could be a documentary, but it's really good. -Your F.
