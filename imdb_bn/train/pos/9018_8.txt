In spite of its low-key publication in this country, and in other countries, his abusive disregard (US 'R' ratings did not help - honestly, because of using HBC C-word!), It really is a good piece of work. Sensitivity sometimes threatens to reduce it, but it is overcome by playing two leads. <br /> <br /> Your physical or mental disorder (Daniel Day-Lewis, Geoffrey Rush, Dustin Hoffman, etc.), and Helena Bonham-Carter can not capture most MND physical degradation, but her voice stretches and ruthless mental drive Completely Compensation In fact, all his performance is managed through his eyes (and what the eyes!). This is an intelligent rotation of an actress who is quickly reinstating his English daily reputation, and being seen as a few images. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, big cast). Here, however, he is the top, spontaneous, unstable, finally loving person who has not always seen, and shows both intelligence and depth on his other appearances. In short, we believe in him as much as we can not believe as much as we as a lawyer in 'The Zinger's Bread Man' as a 'believer' as Frankenstein, as Andrew, in 'Peter's Friends' too. This is certainly his best performance yet - so why can not he produce the product so much earlier? <br /> <br /> As a film, it looks more like a television offering, and without its stars it probably will not amount too much. But this poker is happy to stop their stockings in such a way, and I'm waiting for more interest from them (though 'love is not lost in labor' ...). 8 out of 10, but 10 out of 10 from Branagh and Hbc.
