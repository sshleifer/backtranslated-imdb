The first two sequences of this film establish two conflicts: the conflict between the Tommatic-soldier Tod and his oppressed humanity, and between Tod and his biogenetic replacements -figital-conflict <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, with the heart and even a little soul, and especially with Cart Russell, they comedy with the makers to create a series of action pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great movie, but to see one price.
