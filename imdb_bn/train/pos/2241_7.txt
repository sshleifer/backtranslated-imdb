Another comedy about a lucky little country struggles through the jungle of the modern (fifties) world around, which tears only with local intelligence and guides them, it is a fine entrance to the Yelling Canon. Terry-Thomas was naturally surprised, because a painful ministry man came to the end of the disaster when he thought that the country he thought was initially attracted to the world's interest, Ian Banen created a romantic leadership, Peter Sellars was a corrupt politician and uber-suave John Le Mesurier as his silent performance at Rare play against type as a revolutionary leader. Lots of fun was by all, especially viewers; Perhaps Ealing is not at the very top of the classic, but quite high up.
