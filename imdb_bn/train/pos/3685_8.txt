This curiosity project has seen just such fun. So refreshed and educated. Not only for the filmmaker, but what can be achieved in 5 minutes of the screen, but also as the audience, who may not be ready for so much love in this short time. <br /> Films about love in Paris are all unique, but some of them, as expected, stand out. I thought the Tom Tykwor (Natalie Portman) segment was good, although the wax made me laugh at the same time. <br /> <br /> I clicked the "spoilers" option for this review bus ... you're a spoiler enough to read Just see it. I do not read what I write, but watch the movie. <br /> <br /> and smile
