Stephen King movie is a fun thing with me. I really love them or I hate them. I did not enjoy some of the fantasy productions (like the sadness of the century and the storm). Something small, I really liked. Sleepwalkers I really enjoy it and see it regularly. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Charles Brady and his mother Mary. Although they move between sleepwalkers, a feline like human creatures like those who change the shape of animals in shape. They protect the cats from scratch and whenever they go to a new town, trap them to catch and kill animals. When they go to their last city, they have to find a virgin and when Charles finds one, he actually falls for him, but his mother needs to eat food from him to keep her power. The story revolves around what happens to the girl. Charles will release him or use him to save his mother. <br /> <br /> Although many of these stories have looked at immoral behavior, it may be a little unexpected, but it can actually play a part of the story and is not just sloppy in the film. For scandal Like most Steven King stories, it's a striking catchy character in a small town. Acting is not the best, not the special effect, however, the whole thing is in jail and it's a very intense and enjoyable title. <br /> <br /> For UK readers: This product is most recently shown on BBC1, SkyFire and Sky Thriller / Horror Channel.
