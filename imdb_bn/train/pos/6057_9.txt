Sure, its awesome image and extraordinary sound, this is a great home theater "show off" disc, but it is also a sensitive drama and informative documentary. This movie will be kept intruded to all visitors interested in parallel stories intertwined. Young people, old people, boys and girls can be found deeply together, we are all fans of automobiles, especially high-performance indie machines that result from blood, sweat, tears, consciousness and persistent generation. Mark Knopfler and Ray Quader Soundtrack are fully visual and matched with content. I do not want to give it to the end, but the final driving sequence in Quenny Jones's "Like Like Is" can only tear your eyes. Enjoy it
