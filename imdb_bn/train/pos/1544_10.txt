This is a wonderful but difficult to find the great World War II spy thriller of the incredible 60 Italian style trips. From the early achievements of the psychedelic graphics and from Nanoe Mikeron, the gay love scene of Capusin and the wide-produced apocalypse in a giant land battle scene and full gas proof 'Storm Soldier' ​​gear with the German cavity from this gravitational graphics, this is a movie that should not be missed. It is a film that gets the cruelty of the war and the ruthlessness of the players outside and outside of the battlefield. In addition to the war scenes, some primitive in production and special effects, apparently because the budget battlefields for this movie were reserved for war scenes, but it can not be a problem for lovers of the 60 films. I watched this movie on television many years ago and had the farsightedness to tap into VHS. I still have tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time.
