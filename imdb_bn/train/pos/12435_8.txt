I found that his black hair was! I have been fond of for almost 30 years now and these stories have been hated by two attempts before the movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleased that the screenliters updated the time to include computers, did not 'loot it all. Actually I saw the film twice a day, it was a sure sign that it was quality. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are well illustrated and both the early books of Momesi Blais and the comic strip have been published in the same way. I have to agree to comment on the bad ugly by the previous critics. Does he really read books? <br /> <br /> I thought it would look like sequels with a very good movie and hope.
