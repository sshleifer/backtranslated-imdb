It is not as big a film as many people believe (including my late Massey, who called it his favorite movie). But due to the special sections of this film, especially in the late "funny room" of the beautiful creator, Shanghai's daughter has acquired a place of importance beyond her real value as the key to Oscen Wales's failure to conquer Hollywood. <br /> <br /> By 1946, the position of Hollywood was mixed as the image of Hollywood. Citizen did not recognize Catherine as one of the greatest films seen by Herst Press and as a way to attack herself by Huliwill's interior. Wales's total control of its movies (management and production and acting) Wales's threat threatens the entire system. His best work at this time was Jane Edward Robertson, supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson, but he actually shot large (with Stevenson's blessing) by Wales. But the credit went to Stevenson. Only stranger, Nazi war criminals, to gain a subsequent self-profit, earned a profit by filming. It was not a very good record for five years in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Wells returned to Broadway in 1946, hoping to recover his critical skills through his production worldwide in 80 days. But despite the help, Mike Todd and Cole Porter scored the score, there was a musical failure. His failure took place at the same time when his wife Rita Hayther's guilder scripted. So marriage was going on as well as marriage. <br /> <br /> Wells had to make money - his Broadway production became his personal bankruptcy. Todd (who eventually blames him) sells his interest in potential movie rights, and he sells the idea of ​​a film by Charlie Chaplin about Henry Desière Laudrück's career, who gave instructions <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story is worried about the $ 10,000.00 tax bill, which name A familiarity with Rita for familiar and down payment He proposed to ra. What agreed to do, but naturally asked what the image was. It was an intelligent question. Wales was on a payment phone in a pharmacy in New York, which was a book section. He grabbed a book titled The Lady Shanghigh, and it was a great thriller. Anyway Wells believed in a straightforward angle that Wales knew what he was saying. He said he was looking at getting the right and sent his 10,000 dollar down payment to Wells. Cohen then bought Wales books after reversing - and it was found to be really bad. She will spend Rita's Elsa Banner's character that she spent a time rewriting treatment and screenplay. <br /> <br /> It is certainly a strange plot development. Michael O'Hara is a beach / longshoreman. He rescues Elsa Bastaster when he was apparently attacked by a park gangsters in San Francisco. Elsa married Arthur Bansin (Everett Sloane) married a criminal criminal lawyer with an extraordinary fame. He believes Michael to appoint his yacht captain. The cruise has bassist's mischief by George Greensby (Glenn Anderson) and Sydney Brünm (Ted de Corsea), who sees Banner as a detective appointed to visit Elsa. While they may try to find time together Michael and Elsa, but they are showing Brum or Gresby. <br /> <br /> GC suggests Michael - He wants (due to the reasons his so-called fatalistic view of modern society), pretending to be dead. According to Grysby (the plot becomes obscure here) he can still collect his own life insurance (though dead?) And use it to move south. He will pay Michael $ 10,000.00 if he picks to shoot Grisby. It is actually signed into a document acknowledging the murder (Michael does not realize that such a type of admission will erase the dead body's necessity if other evidence proves that Greensby is probably dead). <br /> <br /> Course Grycebike was killed, and Michael was arrested, and for the murder of Brum (shot by Michael Gol). Michael was tried to defend the banner and discovered that the second person was acting second because he wanted Michael to be convicted. Michael admits that the bunist has actually managed to escape before the real killer and the jury ray. He is out and credited in a solitary carnival, and this famous "funny house" leads to the sequence and end of film. <br /> <br /> This is a very confusing movie (as I have commented). This means that it is not valuable - apparently it is interesting In the fourth quarter of the judge, witnessed war between Michael and the police, where he opened the judge's bouquet to Bellef, to tear the glass. Or the clever use of the photography, to catch the Heaven Diving from the rock, is displayed at the distance of Lecturer Gresby. <br /> <br /> acting is quite good, especially in Sloane (perhaps the best actor's role in the film). Glenn Anderson was a leading Broadway actor. He rarely made movies before the girls from Shanghai, and his slim grisby was unforgettable. Ted de Corsica works very well with Broom - a detective who searches for his own interests for his own interests. <br /> <br /> For Heyworth, she played an act that was different from most of the time (there was an exception in Blood and Sand, Manhattan Languages, and Strawberry Blund), and a memorable sarine. Welles O'Hara is an extraordinary character for the actor - a favorite but naive person who wants to believe in the hard way can learn solid beliefs. It's Cannes, Ambers, Othello, Evil Touch, or the Chem in the Midam, but this is a good movie for it.
