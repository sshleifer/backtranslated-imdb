This movie really surprised me. I had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for every minute. <br /> <br /> This is not like searching for the audience, but it is not like a very strange criminal, male, lover, and a clear picture of her husband. If you are not a fan of bad language or sexual content, then this is not for you. <br /> <br /> The story is sometimes hard to follow but ultimately it seems that everything is well-made. The last thought was unexpected because you would often end up thinking. <br /> <br /> I think it was good for acting. It was not long for Oscar awards, but at least I was caught by my eyes. Jail Bellows A man's portrait of a man is not always perfect, but it is very entertaining. Shell Park is great and extremely strong in Belo's Junk Hospital. I think I'll give the portrait of Marquee's Moralees at the bottom. <br /> <br /> Take my advice and watch this movie, you do not like or dislike it!
