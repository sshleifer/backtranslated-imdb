Movies can be great. I saw this last night, but I feel unable to give honest opinion because I have read the first book. The book is so good than this movie that I was frustrated with the film. If you plan to see a "human chain", do not read the book before. On the other hand, the book is so good, and more than the love relationship with Philip Milledrade, you can still enjoy it after watching the movie. I do not claim this light. I made a book every 4 days to read and read vague writers like Daniel Steel, Ovied, Faulkner, Plato and Shakespeare. "Human bondage" I got my vote as one of the top ten novels I wrote.
