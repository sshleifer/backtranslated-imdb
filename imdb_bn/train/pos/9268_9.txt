A film about women to watch football matches in front of it will not appeal to anyone in the interest of football like me, but it is not about football, they are worried about the discrimination and encouragement of sports for women. <br /> <br /> The picture is between Iran and Bahrain. Opening on an important World Cup qualification day, a girl dressed like a boy in Tehran's Ajdy Stadium Trying to Barua, looks like he's trying to be a soldier until the time of his investigation. After being caught, he was taken out of the stadium to a small enclosure where some women have already been caught, some of them are protected by secret soldiers, whose leader will come back after returning home. Livestock We never learn the names of the characters, but we wanted to know that girls allow watchmen to see them while they are near the wall and deny at least trying at least one commentary. <br /> <br /> In addition to making an important point about harsh gender isolation in most of Iran, this film has a lot of sunny moments like "camouflage" girls wear while going to the toilet. Who made himself as a soldier and was caught only because he chose to watch the match from a reserved seat for a senior officer. The encouragement of the girls to play is that, in the end, the audience is expected to be on the verge of their seats that Iran will win and thus to the final in Germany. The soldiers are not shown as fundamentalists, they are only copies of which women explain why women are not assured by their athletes to explain and explain girls. It is embarrassing that this image is not seen in Iran itself, but the larger world can see it and thus it is seen that ordinary Iranians are not brave for the Western wars. But as people everywhere throughout the normal life with the same tendency and anxiety everywhere. Cast has done a great job to feel like real people rather than their perfect caricatures.
