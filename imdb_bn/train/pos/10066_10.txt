King of Mask (Bean Lien in China) is a beautiful and deeply sensitive film. Winner of the 16 awards worldwide, this movie was based on the story of the true story of Wang Bianyan in the 1930s, when he was an elderly woman, but he has no heir to change his face. His performance has a unique talent of rapidly changing masks and no one knows how he does it. If he has a desired desire to have a grandson, his industry can be a heir to the heirs of a family that only heirs. We then go to the street, and see that people are selling their children because they carry their care ability: Some are begging for the release of their girls, because girls are not very valuable in this society. Wang Bianlian's story goes out there. <br /> <br /> This picture was so surprising, the role was amazing, and these things were so heavy and consistent. Gender discrimination and sadness that no small girl wants this time and place. It should be noted that the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as a living Bodhisattva, wearing a man like a dress and when she is famous and respected, she considers herself less than half as a woman. When we go further in the film, then the people's slave trade and its needs and the lack of possible solution for it, facing the cruelty of the military and the police and facing corruption, and the lack of helplessness and power can face anyone. Face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions It is definitely one of the best movies of my life, and Wang Bianlian's acting actor Zhu Zhu has present yet another beautiful performance. .
