The young woman's name is Boni (Poll). She is living in a beautiful, visually beautiful life, but suddenly she was hijacked by Evil Dude and various and beautiful Evil Hennchen from her house and life. Now what he is doing, he has no idea, only armed people have raised his body from the armed tooth ... and he does not even know why he is dying. <br /> <br /> <br /> God, I hear whining all the time. Now this content is so cheap and producers can create their own movies / books / comics / internal organs, there is no quality that has standards! We're drowning in shit! The only people who really believe that someone who did not see a movie or did not read a book recently - because we're already doing the sculpture of a dead person. People like Ferrari and Rodriguez throw $ 8 on this table and lie to the liars of those senses ... Well, what I say is a better step than anything that has been seen in the movie. Year ... but you have not seen any activity in this year's movie. I saw the box office. You're staying away from the droves. You're better to rob a copy of this, entertain 20 minutes, and get in with your life. <br /> <br /> It's merely entertainment. Write like a boni, many questions and where the whole thing ends, so intensive. The whole mustache has been accomplished in a number of ways, but not so narrowly and not as casual, delicious gunfight. You are there for the atmosphere, mysteries, and guns. It is that - all filmmakers are committed, and they provide. <br /> <br /> Forcing it to feel like a budget, the black cord of my heart is forced. We have passed a good number of indie movies around here, but rarely do we see something as polished, and we did not see any of the continuity of the action that we liked it. Well, you can keep these two guys in MI3: 3 and it can bring me to the watch. Bond franchisee Hell, something No, in fact, still good: I want to see these people create their own features and go away from Hollywood. Whatever the movie industry is killing, whatever it may be infectious, whatever is contagious. <br /> <br /> We saw the best indie in a while and the most effective indie calling card we have ever seen. The DVD has $ 20 and the bonus features out of the donut. Go take your movie ticket budget and put it on this side instead.
