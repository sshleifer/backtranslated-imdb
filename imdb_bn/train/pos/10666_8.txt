When I really started to be interested in the 11-year-old film, I must have had a big list of 'Must Have To See' and I went to Blockbuster and rented two or three per week; Some of them were not for all the audience and my mother would go nuts. I remember that a movie on that list was "a chorus line" and it was never found; So now it's a dream to see. <br /> <br /> Of course, I've lost the list and I want to do something to get it back because I think there are some interesting things to look at. I mean, "a chorus line", turned into a stage-game film. I know we can see many things today, but after coming back, it was a little different. And this picture has something special. <br /> <br /> Most musical instruments have made movies today, the camera gives them free opportunities, creates different grades and takes the letters to different places; "A Chorus Line" was born in a stage stage at a theater stage and died in the same place as a movie. Following a large audience run by the recognized Korean gag (Michael Douglas), Richard Attenborough has instructed a large number of dancers to try to get the job done. <br /> <br /> Everything is happening the same day: Do not know, the pressure to learn numbers, silent competition among dancers ?? And it all happens at that stage, where Douglas puts every dancer on the spotlight and talks about their personal life and their most awesome experience. Hundreds of dancers and they all are fantastic, but they go as hours to shortens the list. <br /> <br /> Like a movie recently watched, "A Prairie Home Companion", a radio show broadcast, deals with the issue of continuity here at Atborough. On the stage or behind, things are going on, and the time does not seem to stop. Again, I do not do much to shoot Attenborough, but it certainly does not seem to be; And anyway it is a great instruction and editing (John Bloom) work. But in that little stage, what do you think is to do with the camera? Only Rony Taylor's cinematography finds the way, creates close chord, zooms in and out, shows the stage from different perspectives, and gives us a nice view of New York. At a critical moment, Douglas tells everyone else: "Before we move: all you are awesome and I want to rent you all, but I can not." This makes me think about the reality show, where the count is only the talent of the song or the dance and where the jury always tells the right words (even when they are not good) before leaving some of them. It's hard, you must imagine; At least here, where all of them are really awesome. <br /> <br /> To tell some stories, using character songs and in a second, the stage takes a new life and literally it is a dream. Come True ' The music of Marvin Hamilts and Edward Claben's songs create the theater to transform without errors, show the feelings of the dancers and showcase their wonderful diverse images through Michael Bennett. Theatre books by Anadle Schulman become a flawless and very short playback; Which is very touching at the time. So if it is not with a song it will be with a word; But "a chorus line", it is impossible to move. <br /> <br /> During the rehearsal break in the audition, a special dancer, played by Alison Reid, Casey, takes the stage to satisfy the character of Douglas that he can do it. The words "dance me for you" sometimes do not have to be honest and beautiful music and songs.
