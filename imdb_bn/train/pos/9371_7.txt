I always like about Robert Ludlum Thrillers when you think that it seems to you that it is completely different. There are many twists and turns in this movie which I found pregnant throat. <br /> <br /> I love direct directing John Dahl (kill me, rounders, unforgettable) and in this case, write a good story (with his brother Rick). <br /> <br /> Now add Nick Cage, Dennis Hooper, Lara Flynn Boel and JT to cast Walsh and you have a story that keeps your interest, even if they are playing letters, all of them are perfect. Dahl seems to bring the best out to the folks, and until this is very interested, you are interested, and will keep the guess.
