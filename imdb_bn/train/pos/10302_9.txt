This image is best created by Jim Carey. Carre was not the material to create his natural face in this film. She was both fun and sad. Carre Bruce Nolan played a reporter. Blame God (Morgan Freeman) for everything that Nalan wrongs in his life. Then, God comes from heaven and gives Bruce his power. As I said before, Kerry did a wonderful job. I thought Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston were superb acting actors / actresses. The plot was good because it had many subpoints on the main point. This movie might be funny (Bruce's dog) as well as sad ("break up"). The script works very well I'm glad they made a photo of this photo. I think this film is a 9/10 rate.
