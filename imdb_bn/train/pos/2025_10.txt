The Anne Brontas epic novel will read the tenant of the Wilfell Hall and read the people living in the whole school, library and people. This is a fantastic story and the true story of alcoholic and "great marriage" is true and the fight against her son is kept away from her deadly husband. Nowadays, the same story we see and hear and I believe people can learn a lot to read this book. Based on the true experience of the author coming back in the 1840s. <br /> <br /> Look at this picture, it's a great version of a book and very moving. I'm sure he was happy with how Annie was produced. <br /> <br /> Excellent acting and great location.
