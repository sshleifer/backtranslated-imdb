Homeward dam is a beautiful film. You know Shadow has dropped down ... It's a thing, I'm crying, I think I'm only six years, I cried! I need to cry a lot! Dogs and cats are best trained. A nice family movie, * not * for completely lazy people or animals, but soft-add-ons like me A.K.a. For the people. <br /> <br /> Overall a good movie, 10/10!
