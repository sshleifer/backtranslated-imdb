The 1960s TV series Bewitched carries from the idea of ​​this movie. Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak created the film after Alfred Hittkk was thrown together in Vertigo. This is not as unreasonable as this one but Novak is just as economical as it is. <br /> <br /> This is the 10th film of Jack Lemons and he's a good supporter here as well as Archie Kovacs. There are so many good things about the movie. Harmin Gingald is very good at this film, he was better at supporting it like Human Man. Cast is very difficult. <br /> <br /> This movie feels New York City in the late 1950's, and a cat is like a cat like a cat in any movie. This is the story of a love, since its love story about any emotion, and a little magic boots too. <br /> <br /> This is not the Vertigo but I think it follows the movie, the viewers did not do it. It's as good as it deserves - sure that William Hope is pleased to see it, so that the series of the 1960s was created. I'm not very happy about what to do on the big screen, this film is much better than that.
