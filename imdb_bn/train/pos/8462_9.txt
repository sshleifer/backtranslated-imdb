I recently purchased this awesome series collection and even after watching three episodes, I'm still slow on the smooth animation and storytelling of the animations, yet softened by thoughtful steps. I'm still a fan ... with some minor pain ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Or do not need power (the word is known?), I have to say that it is becoming very dramatic for explaining the life of the main characters and the life of their essential needs, OZ Group will succeed in their plans (especially the character called Oufi ...) I mean, I'm a soap op More impressive than American characters in Array. The adviser, yes?) <br /> <br /> For the extra overstrual drama (I think most of the English voice actors come from dubbing), this series is still very exciting and still fascinate me again. I mean I could always be bad. It may be like the latest installment, SEED ...... eeeewwww, talk about drunken dramatic .... I will talk about it later.
