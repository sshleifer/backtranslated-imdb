This movie was a while for my collection, but not before my friend reminded me ?? Until I decided that I would look at it. Did not I know a lot about Leo Off ?? It seems to be coming out of great movies and does it work on a very serious matter? Materials. <br /> <br /> Is there such a help? Leo ?? The scene revolves around him, in which Marcel (Leone's youngest brother) is shocked with his relatives' sickness. First of all, trying to hide the truth from Marcel ?? Does he think too young to understand the illness of his brother ?? Leo is a lesbian who contributes to parental reluctance to spread the matter with young Marcel. I know from experience that in most cases most elderly people do not want to acknowledge that sometimes even when someone is young, it does not automatically mean that he can not accept the reality and will not even work properly on his own behalf. After trying to hide the truth from Marcel they have got a great impression for me? The way they supported their son ?? Even after discovering the truth about her sexuality and her illness. Did the young Marcel allow him to travel with Paris to meet his ex-boyfriend? I know most families will be reluctant to do that. There are so many warmth in the scenes where the brothers spend some time together ?? You can see their real friends, worries about each other. <br /> <br /> A nice drama around Leo, which I strongly recommend
