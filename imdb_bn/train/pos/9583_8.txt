I waited waiting to post a review of this documentary because when I saw it 10 years ago, I would like to think carefully about what I wanted to write. <br /> <br /> I found from a documentary perspective that it is a good documentary. That was what I did, show me anything that I had no idea and it made me interested in this world. I did not know anything about the drug world, and looking for them and "balls" were just spectacular to me. So talented they are doing this for the competition and how they do it. Katley was public, complainants (even I was angry that when someone told the judge that the queen coat of a drug was wearing only then there was no man's quote!), Jealous, it is like all the competition. It's like every other competition like this. What I felt was a point. <br /> <br /> The queen says that the "Bell" compared to your new drag queens has changed the ball, and the more competitive sections are created, the queen says - and even those who know the future of the ball will change even more when they walk on the runway Was ready for. I heard that some competitors came out on the streets in the streets for two minutes on the street but came to compete, that was important to them! Then the sad story, who brought the best and bright out of the story of "house" and "house mother" in the competition. It was interesting. <br /> <br /> Now after 10 years of watching this picture, I used to live with the so-called 'Madonna' crazy. I saw some familiar faces from this documentary who ended up with MADON at her "enjoy" stage and say so. If not for those people, Madonna is not in the "Vogue" stage, I know now. Credit should be given where credit is given. I am surprised if anyone else from mainstream America sees this documentary, they will learn that they do not think they are "mainstream".
