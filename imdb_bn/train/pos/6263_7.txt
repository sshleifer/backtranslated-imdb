The first collaboration between Schoedsack and Cooper is a compulsory documentary on the Migration of Persia's Bakhtiari tribe. Twice a year, more than 50,000 people and half a million animals cross the rivers and hills to get pasture. These people saw their livestock with cold water and saw them walking frequently during their attempts to walk along the steep and narrow mountain paths to cross the mountains.
