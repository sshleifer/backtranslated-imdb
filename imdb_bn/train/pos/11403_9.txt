While with MGM some really came up with grand ideas for gene kelly music. Here he is on top of his creative ability to work with Arthur Friend Musical Unit. Never believe that when you see an American in Paris back to the players back at MGM. <br /> <br /> The Magic Vincent of Paris, USA, creates creative editing and magazines designed to create some background shots in the direction of Mineral. The idea of ​​the film originated with Kelly, who wanted to make a film by George Garczyen's poem in Paris, in a long ballet sequence of an American. Arara Friede, who contacts Erra Gershine, likes it as long as they use other Garcin material as fine. <br /> <br /> Gershwin got such a contract for Gershwin's song that Eveening was usually received by Berlin. A Gershwin song note can not be heard in an American paris. Listen to some background music and you will hear something hugely for me, but not for me, which is not the actual music number. <br /> <br /> Another man, who had a fair hand in written lectures, was written by Allan J Larner, a confession which is a thin one. Jean Kelly, who did not leave France after World War I, had played former GI before, settled in a left bank apartment and became a hungry artist. He lives with the odd musician Oscar Levant, and it's a word that sometimes sounds like extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Two women are interested in him. Another foreign American, Nina Folk who wants to act as a painter if she rewards in other matters. But Kelly falls for her film debut in a shop owned by Leslie Carnon. Because here interest in musical comedy star George Gatty <br /> <br /> Certainly the plot is an excuse for singing and dancing George Gershwin One of the first American in Paris saw the movie of a movie that I've ever seen. I'm still going back to Phoenix Arizona at Kennedy Airport. I feel like I've got Latin. My favorite number in the movie is Tra-La-La, which sings and dances in the entire apartment with the Kelly Pisco playing Oscar Levant. At one stage, Dancing over Kelly's Grand Piano <br /> <br /> In a book about Arthur's liberation, I read a quote where he told American language in the background of Paris's ballet compilation. The French thinkers, which she felt the public, will accept it rather than many realistic settings in the street or behind. So it happened that way. In the Kelly Worms and Music, The Pirate and On Town, Long Ballot Cricks. But this one is leading all of them. I still have opinions and there are some of Jean Kelly's next films. <br /> <br /> Surprised by the Oscars, the American In Paris chose the best film for 1951, a streetcar congratulatory desire called. I guess that's the year of trumped reality imagination. <br/> <br /> An American is still one of the best movie musical instruments in Paris and there is no creative talent under the roof of the studio, even above the big budget. Some are less likely to repeat.
