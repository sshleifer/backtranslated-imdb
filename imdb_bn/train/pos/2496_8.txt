No garbage - even near the garbage no. Is not an original? What is the last thing that can be said of "2.4 children"? Guessable Of course not! Although it was a bit of a fantastic series for BBC, it was ridiculous, funny, and malicious. I especially like Belinda Lange and John Pikeard - I believe Professor pretty well. Gary Olson was also very good and all the cast members were also. I was never completely new until I read about the death of Gary Olson. A relatively young age. I want them to make such a comedy, many more (and they will show Israel here).
