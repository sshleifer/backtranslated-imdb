World War I 9/11 and Vietnam will inspire many films as a mix; However, there is definitely a big danger that most of these movies are as good as Pearl Harbor (or rather bad). It is a great fate that the first international release of 9/11 is not a Chess love story to perform a bunch of beautiful faces, but a collective work of 11 Directors of the whole world. <br /> <br /> I do not think 11 episodes are fantastic (for example Yusuf Chahine, there are inappropriate suggestions on many cuts, and Shah's Imamur has a really intersecting end) or they are in the right order (Imamurra being the only) not directly mentioned in Twin Towers The film does not have to be opened, it does not have to end, because instead of Alangundro Gonzales Inatra, it should end, because This is one of the most impressive). But this is an interesting illustration about an impressive effort and the reaction of the twin tower collapse with other parts of the world. <br /> <br /> Consider Samira Makhmalbaf's opening segment, where Afghan teachers are trying to explain what happened to his student New York and offer a one minute silence for failure. Or part of Idrissa Oudrogo (which has a bin Laden-double feature that you will be disappointed if you see him), in which five guys are fun about the good things done with the prize. Bin Laden <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Chile was elected as the elected president on September 11, 1973, a Chilean man was surprisingly well ) With the generous support of Henry Kissinger and the CIA, Allend was killed and Pinochet founded his dictatorship. This may turn out to be a terrible attempt on America's opposition, but it recognizes the best part of the Inirtu (especially the word imprint and hijacked planes, to share my recognition for the phone calls on the black screen), sometimes some people of the film are WTC and eventually breaking up The tower is collapsing, the screen is getting shining and a question appears) and Amos G. Ai Oil abibhera car bomb exploded in the air after the hatasajanakabhabe are trying to reach. <br /> <br /> All these sections (I still speak of Claude LÃ©loch from the deaf girl, Denis Tannovic, Srebrenica about the demonstration of women, Mira Nair - strange, but it takes Indian director to make a part of that Perhaps the most attractive for western taste - a Muslim family whose son is under 9/11, and Arnest Bargoni The (yes, Ernest baraganine) is a toxic person who can not imagine what life most depressing) add a unique film which is easy to see and hard to forget. I'm sure that this film will be a classic known to everyone from now to thirty years from now. Hopefully, it will be remembered to start long tradition of cinematic movies. But, alas, it's a lot more likely to be remembered for the one-film effort. And then one of the few movies of 9/11, because of this, to make the audience happy, this horrible thing will not make a love story happy.
