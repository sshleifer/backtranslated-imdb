This is one of my favorite movies of all time, PERIOD. I can not think of a movie that brings together many beautiful movie features like this. This is all in the flurry: action, adventures, science fiction, good versus bad and even some romance (innocent "peck" on the cheek in Pazu and Sheeta even). Probably the best, you do not have to "get it" in the menu and do not have to enjoy your movie with other Miazaki movies (I do not know about you, but I see movies to take a break). It's just a flat-out enjoyable movie that everyone likes, so please buy it and buy it. Only a few notes from Dobbinka America I found Vander-Geek to be just plain annoying. But not all lost, the original Japanese version set two discs and it is stone! If you can not understand the spoken Japanese, then who care? If you can read in the second-grade stage, watch the original Japanese recording with the English subtitles. You do not regret it.
