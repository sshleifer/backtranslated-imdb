Flavia Heritik is a weird entry in the style of Nanpolot - including equal parts, feminist journeys, and "history" as we follow Flavia on his weird travels. <br /> <br /> We start with Flavia in a convention .. He is not very happy and he does not believe in all male-dominated "rules" and macho beliefs in the world around him and the Jewish Paul, fleeing from Convergent with Abraham Go. Both of them are finally caught and brought back to the Flavia Convent, where he joined another Moslem assault, with another "unbeliever" salt. Flavia hangs out with Moslem accepting the Convent and is "busy" with nuns in the wonderful sets of scenes. Finally Moslem roll-out and Flavia punish Christianity as a traitor in another singularly brutal scene ... <br /> <br /> I want to see some of the things that can be seen in this 70 years of exploited films. - Some good grazing, nipple removing, and an excellent leg-skinning scene, some decent nudity - including full-fledged need and a suitable story. I would say that it pulls in a few points, but it is not enough to get completely annoyed with it. I would definitely recommend fans of this one nunsploit / 70's absorption ... 8/10
