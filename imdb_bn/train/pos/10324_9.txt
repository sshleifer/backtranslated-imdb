It's a spin in a lot of entertainment periods in 30 seconds, it's a spin like the classic Clifanzer series, "Lost Ark Riders", only in low budget and by director Michael Anderson in many cameras. The opening scenes come in liberal amounts of Gothic Art, which predicted Batman for two decades. Roll Eli (Tarzan) is a completely cast hero and a fantastic Latin puella Hensley, as the local Latin Mona Tagging, our hero is tagged in Sonal Hunt, the Latin American country of Hidalgo in the existent Latin American country. The best line, Mona is our hero, just like holding a fist to his chin, you expect him to be flexible with him and hug him: "Mona, you're a brick!" <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler's Ham-O-Cheese Black Hat, Captain Saas is an absolute pleasure. A little "riders ..", "Batman" dash, little "The Lost World", a little "lost Horizons" and hope for the full campaign and you'll find it right. Watch a small part of Michael Berryman as loyal favorite and enjoy the use of John Philip Sousa's patriotic music camp. The main candidate for the DVD release, it must expire. An unmissable behavior for the whole family. 9/10
