It makes the audience happy at several film festivals and why it is not difficult to see. Director Young Zhang, with three wonderful actors, Jiu Zhu, father, Master Liu, with some excellent work; Quansein Pu as the eldest son, Dr. Ming; And especially Wu Wu Jiang, an obsolete and loving little boy, Ming Ming, spins a story that will warm the cold heart. <br /> <br /> The image starts with fountain of an automatic bundle with a man. Beijing He keeps some money in a slot, opens the door, opens his clothes, cleans it out in the conveyor belt, and drops in the shower step by step, and drinks soap as he carries car car wash This is being said in a symbolic way in the future, and we look back to the old bath room past. China is giving China way to China industry. <br /> <br /> Pollution? What is the end of the Cultural Revolution? Industrial Blues? No way. What we celebrate here is the celebration of people and their goodness and love for each other, celebrating the goodness of human hearts. Still, I wonder how the Chinese movie can see. On one hand, it clearly represents a beautiful view of China and its people. It is strictly nonpolitical without expressing or implied criticism of the current government. Yet there is little idea that good old ways are replaced by anything that might not be good. I had knowledge of young Zhang just let that be it. Tell a story about old men in Boothhouse where they get back birds and messages, where they remember long stories and old days, where they can play impressive and Chinese chess and stage cricket fights, where the master is a spirited and intelligent adult man and his assistant His son, who may be disabled or autistic, but his work is fun and fun Marshal will work with the infectious spirit. <br /> <br /> This scene goes back to the old boy, Da Ming, who is smooth, well-groomed and taciturn. He is uncomfortable with what he saw as his father and brother's illogical behavior. She represents modern China with her tie and her briefcase, her cell phone and her education. He just came back because he thought his father had died. When he sees that this is not true, he packs his bags and sets out to return to his wife and his career. But then a crisis arises, and during this crisis, Dr. Ming sees the value of natural, human-centered life that is living the life of his father and brother. <br /> <br /> Young Zhang is old and new, and so I do not work in something impressive that I will not know, especially since its style is so obvious and carefully expressed. Among the wonderful works she missed in most films, she discovered the concubine of a big story so that the picture was resolved before it was over. The song "One Yoma Mia", which is regularly in Bernhaus, sings "E Sowli Muo" as a fountain under the water, and he can not sing the public because of the stage of the fun of Ming. At the end of the film, he was frightened on his stage and thanked for the encouragement of Ari Ming. And the regular bathing room is the reason for losing his wife ... well, before accepting the real reason, Master tells a story about Liu. But before the movie ended, Liu realized that he had met husband and wife. <br /> <br /> This type of "Happy Ending" film is anecdotal in today's artists and international films, or adults directed by almost a movie. Some happy ends make embarrassing the audience, not their rivals. And some audiences are so blatantly condescending that they are offended. Here the visitors are delighted. <br /> <br /> See this especially for the funny acting of Wu Xiang, whose warm fertility crosses any problem with his character.
