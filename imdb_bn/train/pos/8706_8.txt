When the average Joe finds out he has the miraculous power? The premises can be known words. Watchmen? Unbreakable However, the Russian Science-Fire Action Flick, The Sword Bearer, is far from the stock stock. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around a man called Shasha, because a boy has moved away from society, his colleagues and family, because of his being a supernatural force. When he wishes or permits his anger, the sword breaks down on his skin and stretches from his arm. Very voluptuous? Maybe ... but this is not an interesting part of this photo. Our "hero" returned to his hometown or returned to his hometown to find out the reason for his life and satisfaction with anger (and he made that mood). When faced with a new boyfriend of the old peak, he is bloody on the ground. This is where vengeance and anger come into play. This is a man you do not want to cross and at this moment the mafia and the police are on his tail. She and this movie are really really as she meets a girl and immediately falls in love. <br /> <br /> The film is extremely impressionistic with bold colors and silent overtones short but spliced ​​with extreme action sequences. It depicts its main part in the Art House, with a remarkably detailed view of each scene with a fascinating Sci-Fi action. It's this weird mash that gives me so much interest in this movie. The directors are concentrating on this section to draw attention to the emotional journey of SASA and not directly to the staff. Although do not worry, there are plenty of actions and lots of it. However, most of these sequences show only violence with pictures of terrific ecstasy. This is not to say that action is not shown. These scenes are here and gorgeous (especially in the end where we see Sasha's full power arisen in despair). To maintain a focus on the character of the character of the director, many scenes indicate violence. It's a sad love story and a refresh entry in style.
