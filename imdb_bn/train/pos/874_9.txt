This movie dragged you so deep into two main characters. I even popped my laptop even after reading the cover (review alone) and were excited for two tough hours. Two lost ship clashes from two different worlds. Sexual intercourse between a secretary and an offender is almost clear even without any physical contact. At the end I could not decide what I wanted: our hero and heroine to pull their flirtatious or just to empower their emotions. RML could work without a weird subtlety and there has been a traditional 100 minutes plenty. I'm nitpicking though. A series of Netflix, Blockbuster and local libraries duds after making this movie a great film to restore my faith.
