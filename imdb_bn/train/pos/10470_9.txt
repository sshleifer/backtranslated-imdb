I'll tell you a story in the summer of 1994. A friend and I joined Canada Day Concert in Bari, and it was among the top Canadian bands of that age. At around 4:30 in the morning, we waited most of the morning, and when the door was opened at 9 o'clock, we were in the first door. We then waited and waited in the hot sun, slowly boring but we did not take care, because the titles were among our favorites. At one point, at the beginning of the afternoon, I sat and stopped by obstructing me. I am awakening my shock and frustrated by a shrieking girl after a Rheostatics T shirt. That's why I hate Rohitics today. Nothing is reasonable except for their reasonable, taste is not there, nor really anything. My graduation, is not it? So, I hated my band, I refused to enjoy the joy of Hell Music. <br /> <br /> Desmond Hawl had everything. It is difficult to say what he has lost, because he lives in a magnificent palace in the ocean and hills (in the BC region where the film is shot exciting). The dreams of our life are lost by dreams, fantasies, and by its own past, until a teenager does not break the criminal ... and, as long as it sounds, it does not stop him. <br /> <br /> Canadian movies suffer various problems. Generally, the lack of money, and the inconvenient lack of asking for help (such as being Canadian by no means) leads to lower production costs than American or British films, and most people do not like to see something that looks like words or looks, well, an American film Not like that. Later, Canadian screenlines are often weird about how they would tell a good story and think it's good. Thirdly, they think that undesired nudity (often full) makes some artistic. I'm sure nobody sees the Canadian movies, especially late in the CBS, I know exactly what I'm saying. It's almost like "no-no" handbook and Canadian filmmakers have thrown it a long time ago. <br /> <br /> In the 90s and 00's, however, some films (such as Bruce McDonald's work and brilliant crash) broke this mold and how it has managed to maintain Canadians, when it is kept in visible production prices and great stories. Whale music, such as a film on the surface. Only deeper than Canadian-ism, this is a deeply moving story of a person who has lost his strength through sorrow and excess, which is liberated by music through love. And that even redeems Rheostatics. :)
