This complicated story starts fairly simple, with an acronym from English journalist Edgar Allen Bo and his friend Lord Blackwood, he can not spend a night in the frustrated Blackwood castle. Once there, the author wanders around dusty rooms and straps, until a glimpse of music and a waltzing couple takes him to the empty room. He was sitting at the harpsichord and began to play the tune he heard, and was surprised to be tapped on the shoulders by the wonderful beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood. He told him in an unusual impressive / stupid manner that he rose upstairs to his room and whoever is on the night ... the dead are always expected. Thus began a surprising series of miracles which disturbed journalists all night. Spinner Ahed: It's probably not a surprise to many visitors that this beautiful Elizabeth is actually a ghost This does not prevent him from falling in love with a journalist, but it makes complex issues even more complicated for them than the average couple. It's a funny movie, with all things: Ghosts, Wicked castles, past incidents, sex and a repetition of violence (though most editions are seen in both versions.) Alluring, captivating Barbara Steel is the main reason to see it. She sometimes has a weird charisma unlike anyone else who has seen the movie. Recommended!
