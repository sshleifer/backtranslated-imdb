I must admit, when I described Netflix's description as "steam romance", then I was a little suspicious. "Fierce"? A movie since 1968 ?? I was ready for despair. And when I realized that it was shot entirely in black and white, I knew my erotic hopes were destroyed. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong! This film does not contain all the elements of a steamy romance - the discovery of the first love, the secret of secret mysteries, suddenly unexpected - but sometimes the film was cruel boyfriend. Make sure that you are soon black and white shot. Cinematography deserve for each accolade obtained over the years. And the performances of two stars (AC Persona and Ana Gayle) are intense and memorable OK, so they are trying to play both middle school girls in their middle class. It's 1968. Do you really allow teenagers to '60s to explore a gay love love story? Many adult women were still trying to try to come back with their sexuality. Nobody is looking forward to finding a real teenager. <br /> <br /> I think this film was ahead of its time. The level of eroticism was an unexpected pleasure; Yet it still left a lot of imagination, and we wanted to give us a poetic description to add what was shown to us. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure the lesbians will be identified with letters here. For those who love watching live staff lesbians: Even though you do not expect it, you do not think you will be very disappointed, too.
