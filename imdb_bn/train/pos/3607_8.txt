So I flipped a digital subscriber channel a few years ago and thought, "Waiting for the war of heart" will be half hour for me to watch "Girlfriend". With such a headline I understood that this is some of the exploitation 'B' internal city girl Gang fix. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that this was not the case. Instead of doing it a young actors often accidentally played a good role in boxing, well-scripted stories. He is responsible for taking his younger brother to his practice session and being interested in watching his bits. He does not really want to be a boxer (only following his father's wishes) He firmly believes in taking his coach to his place. <br /> <br /> The story is manifested in an intelligent and credible way through various efforts of her intelligence. Initially, his brother's coach does not want to take the female boxer. After working sadly, there is a problem to end the match. Then clash with his father when he finds out what's going on. Yes, the interest of love increases, but it helps in improving the plot, coming across an interesting inter-human response with its own battle-related results. <br /> <br /> This is a small sleepy movie that seems to have heard a few. After a while, when I saw a lot of much-publicized and appreciated "million dollar baby", I thought, "Wait a minute, it's quite familiar". Needless to say, I did not see that "war of heart" that night.
