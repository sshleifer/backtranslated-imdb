This image was first published in 1975 and it was the series of three successive series of Sheriff Booster Possar, the second. Bo Sevensen Sheriff Booster played the role of Potter and Louis Asyque Moberter played the role of Pinky Dobson. We saw Sheriff Possaar last night, he and his wife kept in bed in the hospital, which was attacked on Sunday morning. After the pusser recovers he goes after the men who killed his wife. Pusser is not able to complete that vengeance after him or try to take him before the success of the crowd. The only thing that annoys me about this picture is a true fact. You will go to a city with such crimes and do nothing about it. Since there was no name actress in this movie, I can not give 10 wireless stars but I can give 8
