This is a really fun, lively, light heart romantic comedy. You can not go wrong with Mitch Ryan's cute perkiness with Albert Einstein's talent. Naturally, I'm not a supporter of actual people, now dead and self-defense, not fully fiction stories, but I think late Einstein himself got such a chocolate. <br /> <br /> It was in the 1950s ... in Princeton, New Jersey, in the spring. The story is a beautiful, young, skater-intelligent mathematician, walking around Catherine (Meg Ryan), who is preparing to marry a biological researcher named James, because in her brain he is looking for his future father. However, when it broke his car, love it at first sight and he met an auto mechanic named Ed (Tim Robbins). He does not think Ed is intelligent enough, his uncle, other than Albert Einstein, played match-maker, helped three attempts by his crooked cronics, all theoretical physicists. Uncle Albert must be shown smartly, so portray him as a physicist ... Naturally interesting results <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With her three professors, Cart, Nathan, and Boris, many smiles ensue. The real Einstein had a real human aspect and this movie only took this one (abusive) step. If you suspend all the arguments then you can imagine this stupid story! <br /> <br /> It may not be rocket science (despite its main character) but it's a nice sweet, fresh movie. Comedy Romance is one of the best in the genre.
