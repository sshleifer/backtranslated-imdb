In 1995, when many people spoke about Bray Vitre's great premiere by Mel Gibson, Robi Rooney saw another subtle, yet intrinsic movie in Scottish history. Although this is a very different movie, especially for the historical period, the story is set, but ROB ROY is not only great with the adventures of Brahhart but also with the souls of the epic film. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that talks about the same theme, such as dignity, courage, honor, revenge, family, a key to happiness. This leads us to the happiness of the Scottish Highlands, where the human soul surrounds its rest by all the glory of nature. Robert Roy McGregor (Liam Nisson), the main character is the real hero (universal in epic), "Scottish Robin Hood" who struggles to take out his people out of torture oppressed by cold hearted intellectuals. Although he has made his situation worse, he has to suffer a lot, he keeps his mind free from two things: the honor he gave himself and loves his wife Mary McGregor (Jessica Lange). That takes him to an unexpected event ... <br /> <br /> Except for interesting content and quite vivid performances, the film is really filled with stunning visuals. This factor is to be done both with film and clothing sets and locations. Many memorable moments are in the mind of an audience that gives insights into artistic images themselves. For me, the most brilliant scene was in Highlands when Rob Roy paid no respect to his son. Then, he makes them send away and nicely makes her woman love. The view that he had left in the wilderness of Montrose (John Hart), can be seen as a sudden sight. <br /> <br /> Certainly, there are some graphic violence, like a conflict, for example, but I do not think that this violence will be harmful like many other modern movies. His argument is like any epic: Bloodshed and cruelty of that period was really serious and there is no reason to hide in it. The most annoying scene for me, Rob Roy's wife was raped by the arc of the story: Archibald Cunningham (Team Roth). It is really hateful and the kids must stay away from course. However, all the rest is O.K. Yet, such an attitude that I really love this movie, performance. /> <br /> All the actors from the lien nisanera <br worked perfect, the tall, brave, strong support for the people of Scotland kastake starred Brian Cox, who has portrayed kilaranarake wicked, evil war comfortable with the silent witness of the terrible actions. Jessica Lange is very fine like Mary McGregor and has several beautiful moments in the film. There are chemistry between Miss Lange and Mr. Nixon in many of their scenes. Best British actor John Hurt has done a great job as a margin of Montrose, a corrupt man whose goal is to get the money in any way. I liked that peace of his portrait. But the real villain has played by Tim Roth, who is truly the unfortunate aspect of his character, Archivald - a man who tries to love, loves war, and finds genuine desire for rape and murder. But, like a good epic, this exceptional temple must end ... <br /> <br /> And one more aspect: Musical score: A memorable and emotional tune that has long been heard in the ears. The final moment only touches the tears due to my beauty, because I deeply attached these delightful tunes to the position of glory. Scotland remains in the heart of its visitor and this film reminds me of that permanent effect. This is my second trip to Scotland. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is probably not the same as the spectacular set and the crowd of crowds in battle scenes, but it's a fairly rough Longer movies that focus on one of the most important features of a movie: Attractive entertainment together with heartfelt learning. I really enjoyed that movie, do not hesitate to call it as "highland of entertainment" and it will rate 9/10
