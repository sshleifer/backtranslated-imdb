Not saying, I mean, this is not a good movie, but it's a very good version of the real event and so far the best illustration. And if you are a WW2 buff then it is a treat for you because three of these subtitles are being played by members of Sabotu. This is the theater that plays the best, but it is still said before a semi-documentary. <br /> <br /> Almost all of our human heroes of World War II should be a mortal fan, and hundreds should have been shown to us by these movies that they will not forget it by the next generation. Because nowadays kids do not have to read books, they show movies. <br /> <br /> If you want any activity, hire a personal, ryan, pain of pain, frustrating patience and if you lose it, then it is true that the war is true.
