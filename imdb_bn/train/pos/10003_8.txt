This is not usually Mel Brooks film. It was much less snapstick than most of its films, and in fact there was a plot that was followed. Leslie Ann Warren has created this film, as she is a fantastic, under-actress. There were moments that could have swollen slightly, and some scenes that could possibly be spent for the house, but everything, renting it and the price to see it. Acting was fairly good, Brooks himself did a good job without speaking to the audience directly to the audience. Again, Warren was the best actor in the movie, but both "Fume" and "Sailor" played well with their fate.
