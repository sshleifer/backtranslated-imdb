Richard Brooks's performance in the 1967 truman caption novel in Cundle Blawde, starring Oscar Hoffman in 2005, was Oscar winning. They really play well together (try them on separate nights). After 38 years the film is very unusual to make that fake. These two really improved each other. Though different actors play Perry Smith and Dick Hick, the two pieces are well mixed. The only part of the writers (played by Paul Stewart) in Brooks films is weak, because they gave him a different name as Capet. I recommend the first CAPOTE observer, recommend in COLD BLOOD. It makes for a strong experience!
