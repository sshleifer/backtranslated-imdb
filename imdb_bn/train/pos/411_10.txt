This film is well done on so many levels that I am less like this score (5.9 / 10 (576 votes). This film has incredible special effects, a real epic story, complex great character interaction and mind-blowing war - they believe I have the only complaint that I have received subtitle in the HD DVD version (some lines have not been translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I When I read and heard from different sources, I do not understand: "This is a misleading plot ....", "I could not follow the story ..." or "the letter did not come from anywhere ..." For the first time I I saw the movie, I realized it, I knew that the characters were, and I love it all! I have seen it almost eight times and it enjoys pure every time. Oh, and it's cab Not in my opinion, because a lot of my fellow Americans showed this movie (HK films never before seen) who feel the same way. None of them had failed to follow the story of their love for each and every person who declared the film. Oh man, why can not we come out of this kind of Hollywood? At least Lord Lord of the Rings had a special effect, character development and story marvelous marriages. <br /> <br /> It does not come from Asian film lover Nababi. I own a wide library of Asian films and I must say that this movie is one of my best DVDs. When you see it you will be boasted by this movie's extraordinary special effects and epic feelings. You will drag this fantasy world and you do not want to go! I saw both the 1983 version and 2001 (both completed by Tsui Hark), and much better than the 2001 IMO. In addition to subtitles, I have an additional complaint about this movie: I did not want to finish it ... I'm begging you. Harck - can we get a signal?
