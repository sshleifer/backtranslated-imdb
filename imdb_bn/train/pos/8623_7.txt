Dara Todding is not one of my favorite zombie budget movie - but it is an interesting movie related to suicide and its causes and restrictions. Those who are looking for a gore-fest, or possibly NekROMANTIK film or SCHRAMM style will probably be disappointed. DER TODESKING is definitely an "art-house" style film, so it does not need to apply the requirements of linear, explanatory stories ... <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​DER TODESKING is "episode" every day of the week which is a strange chain around Walking around, which apparently causes people to commit suicide, slowly and slowly, the body of the corpse is associated with the scene ... <br /> <br /> Some good work and a lot of sensation The scene is full, people talk about "problems" about his wife and "concert kill" (which unfortunately lost some "power" to me, because I was laughing in the same band on the screen in the script) .... But seriously - it's sometimes beautiful (the scene that shows the different angles of the huge bridge is particularly effective - especially if you understand the significance in the scene and the name shown is those who committed suicide from jumping from the bridge ... ...) Sometimes confusing, sometimes silly (SS Rip Off SHE WOLF is quite funny), sometimes annoying (I'm special to the man about his wife Ray view of the park have found to talk with her), "experience" is only for entertainment and much more, this "art" films, most definitely. However, I could not find DERDCscaching as powerful as encormant or scramble, and perhaps it could be firmly placed in comparison to the encoremic 2 in terms of my personal "enjoy level". Must be a look for a budget or "art" film fan. If you dig this kind of movie - check out the subscribe error - in my opinion, the best industry / horror movie I've seen. 7/10 for DER flashing
