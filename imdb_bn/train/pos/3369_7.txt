Despite what the title can mean, "pigs is pigs" does not play porky pigs. Rather, it is the hunger of hungry young young people rather than the character of "Elizabeth House" Belusi's character. His mother repeatedly scolds him, but it's no good. So much so that he goes to another room where the energy of a scary scientist gives him more food than any person can handle (but ultimately it is not surprising). <br /> <br /> I mostly say that this cartoon takes really great like a space holder in the cartoon (debuted after three months of daffy duck). But do not make any mistake about it, they do some fair things here. Feeding the obesity epidemic surrounding our country seems more relevant today. <br /> <br /> However, not the greatest cartoon, but worth seeing.
