This picture is from Pearl S. In the novel of the same novel, Bacak had an interesting role. Although some today may think that it is ethnic in nature, because at that time the concept of Chinese characters was progressive and itself. I found that playing Chinese actors in China was not bad for me, it is not Asian equivalent to Blackfus. Then there was no Asian actor in America (even George Tequo is not playing) and Renara did a good job with his part. I never saw that the maximum performance was not but the old school played pre-procedure it was nice. The grassland scene was very good and the special effects were strong. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that during the Great Depression the liberation time turned this movie into a metaphor. Especially political emergence seems to fool the peasants and how they left behind it. <br /> <br /> This picture had some parallels in the style of John Ford, but I think the effects of the past have also affected it. . If it was a Western family, then it would eventually be broken into pieces, punishing the farmer with his pride, desire and gluttony. But here he learned his lessons, then won.
