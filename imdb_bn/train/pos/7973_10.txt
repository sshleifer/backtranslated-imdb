Maybe I'm a sap but this ever sweet movie! When I saw 4 or 5 for the first time, I opened my eyes and said. Then and now (feeling embarrassed at the age of 15) I saw this 25 times and handed them each to everyone. Do not worry they are tears of happiness! And it's not all sap! It has a lot of humor and comedy. Generally the whole thing can be a huge pull, but this is not the case with this movie. The only sound of my advice: even if you love it - do not see the order! I recommend checking this out to everyone ... you will not be sorry, how old or young you are!
