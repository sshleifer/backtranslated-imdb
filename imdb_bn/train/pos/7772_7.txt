On October 24, 1955, the hard working geologist of Headley Oil Company Mitch Owen (Rock Hudson) met the Executive Secretary Lucy Moore (Lauren Buckal) at the office of his boss Billy Rayan and invited him to attend the conference. Along with the son of alcohol playboy and a tycoon Kyle Headley (Robert Stack). On his way to the meeting, he admitted that he had traveled from Houston to New York, to fulfill Kyle's wishes, his best friend from his childhood, to eat sandwiches from club 21, and only one proverb in the meeting was Kyle's father Jasper Headley (Robert Keith) Mitch and Kyle soon fell in love for Lucy, and Kyle failed to use her money to influence Lucy; Then he opens his heart and offers Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and stop unsafe Kyle drinks. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Mary (Dorothy Malone) is a simple woman and her relationship with Mickey is lost, which she sees as her sister. One year later, Kyle discovered that he had a problem and that he could be stupid and start drinking again. The miserable poisonous Kyle says that his wife and Mitch have a love relationship. When Lucy is pregnant, Kyl believes that the baby is related to the match and her mistrust leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> "Lined On the Wind" is an exaggerated melodramatic soap opera with artificial character and situations. There are at least two great films with characters in terms of drinking problem: "The Lost Weekend" (1945), "The Wine and Roses" (1962), with the great performance of Raymond's great performance and outstanding performance of Jack Lemon. Robert Stack is a shallow performance and its character's aim for drinks is shallow and clich√©s. In the end, the forgotten "writing on the wind" is not just a feature to be entertained and an Oscar nominated. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Palavro au Vento" ("Words in the Wind")
