I liked the quiet part of the quiet part of the first part, casinos and casinos, especially their scenes together. The mood of the setting and the joke of old pole and idealistic youth was effective. I wish there were more scenes in Bridget's Fonda movie; She was a sincere and interesting character. This image closed the railway for me when the mayor tried to travel around Mafiaso, his boss apparently did not want to do anything. None of his right should be found in his abandoned dock. Dump into the castle. The story here becomes incredible. Something that I can not understand: why police and Vito were providing information that could push the answerant to the corrupt judge, who was shot dead?
