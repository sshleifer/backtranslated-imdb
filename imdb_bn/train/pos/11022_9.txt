Forget the credibility <br /> <br /> You do not have to expect credibility with action films where the superhero will have to perform an uninterrupted string of incredible achievements, the process is going on, but the power is being restored and transforming the lethal weapon's unarmed gadgets ... Especially when Ronnie Harlin is directing. <br /> <br /> There is no exception to "CLIFFHANGER". But the film has lots of resources: breathtaking scenery, nicely photographs, stunning special and visual effects (screaming for the first five minutes and filming), excellent musical scores, welcome attempts to relieve some tension and a strong throw: Two heroes (Stallone, Star And the singer is part of the lion's footage, but Michael Rumar is in his soil Che ), An impressive heroin (Janine Turner), and the greatest danger of all times (estimated John Lithgo and the fraudulent feminine Caroline Goodal, but Rex Lynn - much longer than normal parts and most of it, Leon, Craig Fairbrace) is no credibility. If good, solid entertainment Such as Roger Ebert wrote another photo) "This is a movie that you can sit back and you do not mistake too much." <br /> <br />
