Sabrina Te√±iz Wech was one of my favorite TV shows: Every day I went back to the episode back to school. So far, I think I have seen at least three or four episodes each time in the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Heart is the perfect teenage girl / witch playing with normal teenage troubles that we can all relate to. She is funny, smart, outgoing, malicious, and more. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broaderik both fits very well as Sabrina's aunt. Gilda, intelligent scientist, and Halda crazy, maintain a perfect balance of gratitude in the life of a saint. Although I must agree that college years are not as good as their high school year, but this does not mean that they were not good at all. I think the last was fantastic though I do not expect it, it was sensual and I like it. :)
