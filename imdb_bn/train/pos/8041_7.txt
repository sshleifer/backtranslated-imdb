This negative picture is featured on the IMDb page, it is still considered a point of view, because it is a story of the survival of the Panamanian jungle and a story of the story of Cameradar with a different mentality. <br /> <br /> Peruvian director Louise Loss took us to see this thriller set in Panama. Recently, Beckett, a newborn baby Beckett, who was a stranger, who tried to exclude an infamous drug cartel head and corrupt army general, still has some good moments in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> American detective learns a valuable lesson from male, Beckett. What is good in the theory, irrelevant in the jungle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just a few words as a man. Mili can play with a role in knowing that she does not get any glory at the end. <br /> <br /> For lovers of action film, "Sniper" will give a 112-minute action which trimming bits will create a more satisfied movie.
