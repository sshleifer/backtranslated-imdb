This is a movie that will take you out of your head once. Dialogues are near perfect, it was adapted from a game, which was expected. Actors are simply giving their best, simple and interesting in the story. 88 minutes pure happiness <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Paul Rouve is giving a great rapport (and proud of such) and giving a great introduction to Marina Foyce's mobile phone, who is always at fault when it is still waiting for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This fantastic game is best suited for adapters and future productions! <br /> <br /> I want more in this generation today. If you like it, you'll probably enjoy: "An Air Day Family", and "Quizin and Dependency". Both have written and actress Bekri / Jawai.
