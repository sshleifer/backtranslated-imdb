A remarkable piece of documentary, giving a country's elaborate illustration of a deeply divided into itself (for more proofs, check out some of IMDb's comments!). Oliver is very favorably compared to Stone's "Commandant" (which essentially tests Fidel Castro's atheist hair deeply). I do not know what Chavez himself has presented, or is one of the long Latin American "Cadillos" long lines. I do not know whether he can do good things about the huge expectations he has created among the poorest majority of Venezuela. It is rarely a film to be able to answer such questions - but now I have got a pretty impressive idea of ​​what I risk and find it in the middle of a coup. Some people say, "We're making history," and that's exactly what the film looks like. Excellent stuff.
