I did not get the rent because of almost all the bad comments, but whatever. I thought it was like the darkness that I liked. The only part to hate the tooth ferry was the two red throat brothers at the gas station. They were funny and the dialogue made me laugh, but it was not a comedy. This destroyed the movie for me because it was unnecessary. The rest of the film should be like a horror or a suspense film. Make-up was good and I have seen bad movies in this one way then. It was a simple story with credible acting. This is not the most horrific or gorgeous film, but after watching it, I was not cheated or refunded. There was a preview of the other movies on DVD which are all good and I'll test them.
