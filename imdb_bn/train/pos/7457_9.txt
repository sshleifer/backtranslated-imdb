This is one of the best bond games I have ever played: <br /> <br /> The mission is very funny for them to perform many tasks. They can sometimes be harder that makes it more fun that you use really well. This game is really fun driving missions in cars. This is a good story to play James Bond. The sound of the actors in this game is really good and it's great that the broth is very good in this game and the character of the game is really good, because they are really good to see in the real life. Also graphics in this game are quite good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
