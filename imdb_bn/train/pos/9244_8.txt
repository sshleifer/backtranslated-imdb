If you only read a summary of the plot, then the film will sound like most common words of the 1930s. The story is quite fabulous, the subject will feel maudlin. The power and beauty of this film is directly, cast performances performance. I've rarely seen that Gene Harlow is feeling her rich, rich and fine nunances floating on her face. If you look at their faces during Chappell's wedding ceremony, the main characters have such depth of feeling. The raw emotions are so heartfeltly portrayed, so true. The final sequence is almost helplessly shocked: when Clark Gabelle sees this joy and surprise of his son, lifting him up proudly and saying, "My child!", I could not remember that Mr. Gabel's own son was born, he died. This is the best example of the era of depression era.
