I read an article about Dan Jansen's Olympic and personal journey before watching this movie. I'm always fascinated by the story of hope and attacking life-changing events, and it was not an exception. <br /> <br /> The background of the letters given to you can affect your family's closeness and how they positively impact each other's lives. I can not speak with specific detail in this film, it is a formal license to take some creative licenses while organizing a script. However, Dan and his family's soul is important here. <br /> <br /> This is a worthy movie in a story that should be called. I felt sympathy for the letters and cheered at the end.
