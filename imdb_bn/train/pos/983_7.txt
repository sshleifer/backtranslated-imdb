I think this film has been specially recommended, especially more so than the performance of David Morse and especially Mr. Fox, according to the ability to watch. Although the plot has many holes and motivation is very difficult to follow, in some cases it is very difficult to follow, above all, it makes a nice time in front of the tube.
