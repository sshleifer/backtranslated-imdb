A few years ago, satellite channels promoted a repeat of 'Man Behaving Bedley' with UK Gold Hip: "Here's the real flat-sharing sitcom!". This was actually untrue. 'Man of the House' was a flat-sharing sitcom and ran from 1973-76. <br /> <br /> This is the creator of John Maryam and Bryan Cook's brain, the popular sitak 'Father Precious Father'. When it ends, they decide that they wanted to do more with time. <br /> <br /> In the first episode, Cristi (Paula Wilcox) and Joe (Sally Thomset), their Mudelton Terrace flat followed a wild party when they found a man in their Gosle. He is a Robin trip (Richard and Sullivan), Southampton worthwhile student of any permanent residence. While drying his clothes, he puts on a female 'dress gown and prepares their meals. They are so influenced by their cooking skills that they invite him to stay. But there will be no naughty business. So Robin was asserted to be gay ... <br /> <br /> As shown in BBC II's 'I Love 1973', 2000, Julie Burchil claimed that the 'House' showed her a way of life. She was not alone. One of the most symbolic pieces of British television (for me, anyway) was 'Sally Thompset' bringing a parasol from the London Underground, and a blind person doubled down on her stomach. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As far as Martyma and Cook's script went forward, they could go beyond the side without side. <br /> <br /> Richard and Sullivan were still playing 'Bingham' in 'Doctor in Charge' of ITV. In fact the 'in charge' overlapped with the second run 'House' first. She was born in the crazy Robin game of sex. Her role in Palla Wilcox's 'Crisi', 'The Love' was way more than 'Belle', and 'Joe' from Sally Thompset was a loving touching blonde. Went as time, he almost became an elder brother of them. <br /> <br /> For many viewers, Brian Murphy and Jute Jones steal this exhibition as a ropper of war. George lost interest in sex, but did not belong to Melredrade. They went to their own show - the appropriate creator 'George and Milldale'. Bob Fisher's good value was Robin's Widebau friend Larry. He has done so well that he was regularly created. <br /> <br /> In the first year of its first year, the inevitable movie was spin off. 'Man of the House' is not a big fan of the movie, because I think it has been fitted on the big screen. Most of his characters have never been seen in Syria. <br /> <br /> The format was sold in America, where it became the longest 'Three Company' of late John Ritter and Suzanne Somare. It was much more indicative than the British, the SOMARs were often seen in sexy clothes. <br /> <br /> After six seasons, Robin's elder brother Norman (Norman Ashley) is finished with 'House' Christian. The fans were devastated for failing to get the girl who loves Robin, but she actually showed her own show 'Robbins Nest'.
