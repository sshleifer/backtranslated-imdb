'Student of Prague' is an early feature-length drama or rather, it's an "Autorefilm" (i.e. a writer's film). This film is a member of a movement of many movements, who seeks to respect the film or to profit only, draws literature or theater onto the screen. Fortunately, this book story with moving images is good. Using the story of Alfred de Moosete and Edgar Allen Poe, it is based on the Doplagner theme. Unfortunately, this film gets in most cinema, it is twice the exposure effects of Paul Wenjena's appearance twice in the scene. Guido Seeber had a special effect wizard for her day, but she is not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. Film scholar Lyon Hunt (printed "Early movie: space, frame, dramatic"), however, Doubles has done an interesting analysis with the help of framing to further enhance the theme: Characters are left / right / near and front and foremost / characters and Shot formation structure. However, the film contains an extended long shot from most specific locations, which are significantly primitive. Bad editing is lacking; Very little scene separation and the scene is prolonged. None of this was unusual for 1913, but at the same time more advanced films were 'Atlantis' (August Bloom, 1913), 'Title of a Woman's Soul' (Yevgeny Bauer, 1913) and DW short films Greifith. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br In addition, a repeat of the character of LeDocuschare is a contemporary problem and there is no other reason than the visitors' supergroup. Here, with a cloak of non-existent gypsy lateness, seemingly almost lurks. I know their earth is silent to me, but I think that their lips are going on and so that they will not be silent in their world, so how can Liduscht lift his shoulder and not notice? <br /> <br /> However, it is conceptually one of the most interesting primary films. Wesner, who had a headline role in the role as well as the title role in 1920 and co-played 'The Golem' - thought the main motive behind this film was to help the German launch a supernatural thread in silent movies. <br /> (Note: The first version that I saw was almost an hour long (definitely not completely completed) and was in poor condition, occasionally face face. I'm not sure who I was because of the alpha dvd , Since, in 41 minutes, the previously mentioned footage is missing in the footage and there is less and very different title card, but it is not apparently bad. The score is silently monitored, though.)
