This movie looked like a classic in the style of the 80-second slash, which seemed to be my favorite genre, so when I saw it was a free demand, I had to see it! It has played Caroline Munroo from both of The Phineas (Caroline Munshi), Daraka 1972, Golden Voice of Sinbad, Captain Cronos - Vampire Hunter, The Spy Who Loved Me, Maniac and Falcales. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A wide spectacular game over the school - sex commitment to him in the shower, and to humiliate him public and make a toilet Providing face (sleeping all the time nude!). The instructor puts a stop on it, but both parties vow to revenge. But, cool kids finish the perfect animated flames. <br /> <br /> Cut in the future, and reconcile its high school, or so they think (bwahaha?). The only person with the invitation was the gang to burn the goats, and its April Fools' Day (or really, the day before the April Fools, but the fun begins at midnight), but they fail to see the event and hang on in front. School till night. Then they finally break into the school and start the storm. <br /> <br /> They find food / drinks and a small temple for each locker and accessories, along with Marty (Nerd) locker and year book. They also told the old black janitor / caretaker that "Oops! Yasar! Yes, I do not want any problem, sir!" And then was killed immediately. Beautiful idiotic character, but laughing is still my favorite. <br /> <br /> This movie leaves a page from Allian's book, which you will see! When all of them realize that they are dying there, and they are coming out, except those who decide that it is better to have a good bath in the old school bed. Of course, it poured blood and acid and melts his mouth (very cool, you mind) the rest of the night, natural, sex, medicine, and Marty all die wearing Jason's mask .. What is their plan? "Keep watch on what we have to do and wait until noon. Marty will not kill us in the middle of our day!". Seriously, what he said. Apparently you can only kill at night. But will they survive at night? Who will live and die? And why are all bodies disappearing? Rent, buy or steal this great movie to find out! The film is really good, the clich√©s (the car will not start, damaged!) And just the usual slash fun Not all of them have names like Carroll and Nani and Frank and Joe and Susan. I recommend it to you all! And, not to mention, it's a spin off! The 1989 Cutting Class was spin off from this slash wax and it started with Brad Pitt and Rodney McDowell's career. <br /> <br /> Favorite view: 2 people are sexually, people want to end, but the girl is not. "Dirty talk to me, Frank !!" He shouted, "Yeah ... tits!" "DIRTIER!" "Uh ... Mike F.C.K. Tits. Boobs. F * ck.". It seems to work for him and his measurements, killer them both electrocutes!
