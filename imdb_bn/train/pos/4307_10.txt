Well, probably not before the rodeo riot, but there was enough time a few months ago. My parents said that they saw it and knew the next thing, the police were confined and burned on the ground. This is just to show the state of ethnic relations in America. Simon Simon (Danny Glover) and African-American Simon (Danny Glover) saved Mac's life as a black friend of this plot. Meanwhile, film producer Davis (Steve Martin, a serious role) thinks that selfless violence is really cool ... as long as he gets shot. There are some existentialities in the film: Mac and his family realize that they are not actually living in reality. <br /> <br /> "Crash" seems to have renewed something new in ethnic relations, but this one has come a long time ago. Maybe we will not be able to have stable nation relations in this country. But in both ways, "Grand Canyon" is a great movie. It affirms Kevin Kline as my favorite actor. Also starring Mary McDonnell, Mary-Louise Parker and Alfred Wudder.
