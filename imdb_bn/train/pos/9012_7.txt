Think of Richard's misery, a painter whose real passion is flying. When we first met him, he wore his home made bird on a London home. He ripped his canvas and other works to heighten his frustration, and fashions a flying device for his jump. When he falls in the custody of the protective police, he is not scratched, but it puts him in front of the judge who orders him to serve the community. The happiest relationship with Richard probably ended badly, he decided to move to rural areas where he found a place in the country using a large burner to build his own plane. <br /> <br /> Richard is ending up trying to help Jane Harchard unwillingly. She is suffering from LLS, or Lou Gehrig disease, from a young girl and limited to a motorized wheel chair. Jane is very intelligent, but has a bold side and a sweet vocabulary. Sometimes he uses handmade instruments to speak, because his speech is not clear. If Jane loves to do, her virginity is to lose any cost. Clash with clash with Jane and Richard, but a mutual tolerance soon makes it comfortable with each other. Knowing pornography on his computer, knowing about someone like Richard Garre, "American Jiglo", who, for a fee, has sex with him. When Richard took him to London, he found the right people for the job. His fees are huge, but they agree. Since they have no money, Richard decided to loot a big bank. Unfortunately, do not go by planning plans when Jane realizes she can not go with what she wanted. Eventually, Richard took a joke about his life to know about his playful building plan, which makes them closer, because they find solace in one another. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film, which represents an unusual situation. Jen is not a romantic heroine among mainstream films, and yet she has a sweet assassin that is difficult for her to feel and is not difficult for what she is trying to achieve. Mr. Gregoras shows a feeling of Richard Hawkins for the photo. The film does not try to be tricky or gives a young girl with a sick disease giving a pink picture. <br /> <br /> Helena Bonaham Carter is the main reason to watch this movie. She makes a wonderful jane. On the other hand, Kenneth Brangha does not look very good for this kind of comedy. However, Richard explained that he has his own problem. James Jones, Richard's former love anna has some good moments. <br /> <br /> "Flight theory" shows a good manager. There is no doubt Peter Greengrass will go big and good things.
