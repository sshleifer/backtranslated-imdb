This flick is the Sterling example of erotic B-movies: porn movies without hard sex movies. This thing is not so bad that these things go away; It is innocent of killing his wife involving a woman lawyer trying to prove her boyfriend. The rest of the movie, however, leaves something to be desired. Bad acting, bad direction, bad looking woman, bad set, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scene. The filmmakers will learn the difference between raunchy and erotic. There is no general idea to put Gabriella Hall in naked or in love scenes. <br /> <br /> How foolish is it?
