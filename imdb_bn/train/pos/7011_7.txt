First, I like this picture. It was all well played. <br /> <br /> However, I can not hear comments from some people being surprised. I did not know anything about this movie, except for some "overview" recommendation, but I knew that the plot was going on in ten minutes. (I do not mention how I hid myself in order to not spoil a good movie for others.) Even so, although it seems obvious, I see. How did it look at everything, it looked nice to fill in detail and character motivation in the next scenes. <br /> <br /> I do not hate when I guess the end of a movie. I just hate it when the Resolution road is lined with annoying scenery. <br /> <br /> Smith's screen personality is simply selective, even when he is playing a problematic character. He is energetic and trustworthy in everything that I've seen him. Another fine performance of seven pounds. <br /> <br /> Rogerio Doson is a tough performer, despite a terminal heart disease, illustrating a playful, rather enthusiastic character. With the beauty of the eye, and Rosario, if you are not superb, then you have to think about changing your eyes. <br /> <br /> It was nice to see Woody Harrison back on the screen. I did not see him much, but it could be mine. Woody did not have a tremendous amount of screen time, but he sold his precious, piano-play, blind man's character for all prizes. Nice <br /> <br /> A researched bit research in the jellyfish box tells me that its venom is cardioxic, neurotoxic and dermomontocritic. I would think this makes a suspicious choice for both pet and plot. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'm not for this plot, but for some very good performance, and to express some tragic emotions that we usually try to avoid.
