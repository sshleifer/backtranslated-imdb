I love this "Diaper Baby" movie! You can not make a movie like this today and it is rich in film history. It was a fool and the film forced you to laugh, which did it. I do not know how they've ever got these kids to "work". I think they are valuable and kids laugh at me, but do those who have made this movie because it shows existence at the beginning of 30 years. You have to remember that when the film industry was very young, the stock market had crashed, worldwide depression started and these films were made for people to break into the real world. You can see the movie for five cents, beyond my perception, but then the dinner for 25 cents is too much. It was a different time with a completely different mind set.
