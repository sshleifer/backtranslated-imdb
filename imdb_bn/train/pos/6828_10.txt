Broadway and film actor-director-director John Cassettes (from Rosemary's Baby) created a wonderful composition through this 1977 film. It's a cameo from Gane Rowlands, John Casavettes, Ben Gazara, Joan Blondel, Paul Stewart, Johora Lampton, Laura Johnson and Peter Falk. Firmness of the film: An old man and film actress (Gena Rowlands), who had died in a car crash due to writing his autographs, reassured his life after the death of the fan. The movie has a slow pace and a dark, moody, scary quality. It's a 60's synthetic look and it reminds me of Polanski's Rosemary's baby even without the suprise awesomeness. Here every successful actress has been threatened - she is going to be old and she will become vulnerable in her career. Moreover, he thinks he has made a living that has no true spirituality, humanity and ability. He lives only for his career - he has no children, charity does not work, etc. The flesh of this movie is the increasing isolation of his personality. She is falling apart. He is in a crisis. Gena Rovland really gets into the character's torment psyche and works quite a good part. She is an awesome actress and this 70's film is an instant contrast for the times and disaster films or adventure thriller films often violent films. This is a deep emotional emotion in a movie, but it is a cold, cruel feeling, as Cassavetes is critical of 70 generations of mainstream films and actors. Is this movie a 70 product that is Nixon's Fraud, Watergate, Vietnam etc. Although the production price is not good, the film is not well known, but it is a very hunting movie. With Hunting Mood Quds near the underrated and late director Casavets, who died late in the late 80's.
