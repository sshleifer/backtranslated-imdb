Walter Matthews and George Burns Actor Neil Simon's Sunshine Boys are funny comedies about the life of curiosity and its intensity, but smiles always bitter taste. The two big dramatic comedy actors of Willie Clark (Matthew) and Al Lewis (Barnes) are now reduced to ruthlessness and helplessness from the age of old, only you can feel angry and blue. Willie never surrendered and did not see the work, he was tired for the aliens and he was retiring his daughter to his daughter in the country. The couple was really funny and similar in her old days, but the scene continued and started quarreling, and after 11 years of breaking them they could not speak. Now if they will work, they must go back together to make their best old sketch for a comedy story TV show. Filling the explosives and the freedom fighter for old questions? Blue Simon's screenplay gives a definite corpulent spirit for the story and sadness and blue tasteless heresy also make many gogs and smiles to make a good mix of them. Walter Mathu (nomination Academy Award for Best Actor) and George Burns (Win) Academy Award as Best Support Actor Two actors are very credible and realistic and their harmony seems almost real time together as real work and that reality they do not tolerate them. The story is very sensitive for all its food. Because the story has been described and the love-hit report related to two actors is a complete real part of the odds but simultaneously understanding things in common life. My rate is 7
