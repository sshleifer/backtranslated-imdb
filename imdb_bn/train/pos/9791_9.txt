I will not give anything with the description of the plot of this film, it is not saying that it is a young blind woman who returns to Israel, whose closest friend and companion committed suicide. This is a detective story, because the blind woman tries to understand why her friend ends her life. As he follows his investigation and accumulates the information, it leads irrationally to a devastating conclusion. The film is skillfully portrayed and played, especially Talia Sharon, Yara, blind women, excellent. The Israeli film must have been from the beginning and it is now completely competitive with other foreign films, although some have received a big audience in the United States.
