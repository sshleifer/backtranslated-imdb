Running Man is one of the films that can disappear, even to be boring and depressing. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to meet once or twice a year with some companions and a few drinks a few times. <<br /> <br /> Today, in the climate of TV media and in the climate of the capitalist mode of society, it actually acts as revisionist social commentary, since the 1980s. Forget that though! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The real leg-end-Derry (with its main camera highlighting the camera with the keyline). <br /> <br /> The design of the stalkers is actually American, and the mirrors of the characters described in the PC 'Gladiators TV show', as well as the WWE. The scary ending of the buzz-saw will push the viewer's core (as a foot note, why is his death bothered by the particularly humorous attitude of the annoying performer?) <br /> <br /> Jesse Venturer and Sven W. Thorssen Muscle backing (and in real life Arnies are buds) is great, and it even got Mick Fleetwood! What more could you ask? <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a great piece of great activity and a great piece with some great characters, I highly recommend running man. Just do not expect learning from it (at least on the surface quality). <br /> <br /> Quality, I really love bloody. You will be very much until you get a thespe. 7/10
