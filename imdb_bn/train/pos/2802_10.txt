Anyone who was never in the sport, it seems like it would be difficult for me to enter football (or we say inexplicably, football, American) - "Bed It Like Backham". But I would say, it was a cool movie! Angelo-Indian Jasminder Bhumra (Parminder Nagra) and his WASpit friend Juliet Packethon (Keira Knightley) love to play soccer (yes, I'm going to say this British-and international-way) and only fans of football player David Beckham. But Jasmine's traditional Sikh does not approve parents (her mother portrays the movie's true hacking of early football). All right, so maybe in this sense it was a cliche, but you must love this movie! And if you like me, you go to this movie, if you do not know the definition of "turning" football ... do not worry, the film explains (I have never heard of David Bacham before this movie). And we all know that it has been raised by Nightwatch: After the "BIBB" came out of the USA a few months later, she starred in the equally cool "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl".
