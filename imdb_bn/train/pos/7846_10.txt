I'm not usually in a particular event (save for OC and Depertet householders ... hey, I'm 20 years!), But there is no fun, I was hooked after a episode of reunion. <br /> <br /> I did not even say how I said that yesterday's slogan was the cause of conflict with Bush's statement yesterday, because I was really looking forward to the 1987 episode, which will be coming to Air on Thursday. Again, that conflict was frustrating because, there is a new program, it should create a following and try to push back a week in the second phase. <br /> <br /> It says that TV does not always have to be usable to be enjoyable. I do not want to receive a rewards for reunion, but I hope that it can attract my attention in all seasons. Ever watch the first few episodes of a favorite show year after? Sometimes you wonder how ever getting hooked. The Character Building takes some time. <br /> <br /> Every year an episode is good for the idea, in my opinion. The only other event I can remember is that doing something like 24, each episode is an hour ... and the event event is more realistic than that one day! Please give this shot a shot. Relax about the art form ... it's just TV!
