I saw this picture on the special screen of Oven Alik Shahadah's work. It is so interesting where this guy comes from. Now he is probably the world's independent African filmmaker. And I'm not talking about black filmmakers I'm talking about filmmakers who are the main in culture. 500 years later, African variety of African themes and the range of evidence proves anything, it is an African problem. But the idea is that the mold does not fit. Showing artistic diversity The film is an African cast, but the issue is a human issue that can be most related to us. I just love it's light comedy. And the Trouble Wake Crown is just amazing, it's actually an art-house jewel.
