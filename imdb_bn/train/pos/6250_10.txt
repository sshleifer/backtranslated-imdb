Australian movies are not just Sedlals but also Spielman and other directors. This is the piercing sense of reality that does not leave viewers throughout the movie. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by illustrated stories, but by acting performances. I never felt the feeling that this actor was playing in the Handsstage, but rather the real people Visitors' Visceral feeling is so real ... almost as if the pink pannier or solo woman below your block lives in your block. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . It is much more powerful by Viennese dialect, which is made to complain much more, especially as a way of life. Generally arrogant for a special parochialism and Vienna is also well illustrated. <br /> <br /> There is a strange presence in the movie on the coast of Vietnam, where nothing happens with their atrocities and thirst. Moreover, they have become a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores. The people in the house where they estimate that what they calculate are fun activities, they try to communicate with their human flavor, but it is useless For example, the old lady's sex game with the relation of the older sisters, the person loses her nerves and hits her girlfriend and beats a young girl who hits his driver and burns him. <br /> <br /> The image has no soundtrack, it only focuses on its image's generality / abnormality. Another common feature of Seidl (and other Austrian directors) shows her annoying sexual images. Among them are husband, sex scenes in his bath, sexual scenes of bath, sexual relations with two men in his apartment etc. <br /> Those who might eventually be citizens of Paris, New York, or Madrid, the number of Vienna could be as high as their number. Visitors do not show condemnation or regret for the film because they can be victims of the same human chain and separatism in different circumstances. In the end, I believe that the silenced movie is a warning to us about the horrific state of Human Relationship, published in Hundstage. And the audience is not frustrated due to the reasons for this evil transformation, the team has achieved its goal.
