Scanners 2: The new order is as good as David Krenberg's classic scanner, the scanner was scanned in the 1980s and scanners in 1991 between eleven years of two films. The film captures the scanner style which is a good thing, it will not be a scanner without a head blast, so scanner 2 has a major explosion scene, which is as great as the first one. Scanner II: The new order is another fantastic gauri scene which is well done. Scandal II plot: The new order is a new step in Syria, since it is being used as a surveillance force for a police head and scientist group, a young scanner named David Kiluum, and he decided to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Scanner II: The New Order is a great sign for David Craneberg's Sci-Fi classic scanners and should be seen. See it 10/10
