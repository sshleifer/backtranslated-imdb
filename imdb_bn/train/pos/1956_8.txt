Really, I think this movie is an example of a simple goal than a real bad movie. Actually, the film has done well in many cases and it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> Yes, the script is a bit slower, but this is the section. The film has a messy atmosphere centered around a femme fatale. Just like the old silent classics, it is also a pornographic that turns around you so that you do not always know how to think about it, and if you think deeply and try to do it, then it can be expanded, keep all the pieces together. That section In general, the script is amazed by the amazement of the script and the audience's guess and actively discard the viewer. <br /> <br /> Sharon Stone is also an easy target. The truth he looks great and he calls his dual wishing conversation so that it can be mysterious, sexy and funny. <br /> <br /> The face is much more than being passable, because let's face it - you have an interested audience to keep "did he or not?" Question for two hours In addition to a fun performance by a Twisty script and Stone in Stost, it is a dark and very starck and modern, both of which are implemented by the creation of a supper atmosphere, which can go directly to Stone Lines with sexy curves. The frame is always beautiful - press anywhere to break and there is something interesting to the eye. <br /> <br /> This image influences the worst of the first film and makes them a bit realistic. , Especially gender. "Catherine trimle bisexual ... how frustrating!" Actually, more behaviors are performed here, and generally, the film sexuality is used in good effect. It is still titillating, but not as easy as the shock value and buzz done as first. I would not say that it is still not a hostage because it should be facing it, this picture is considered funny. <br /> <br /> And this is a fun movie. This can be a simple goal, but if you see it for it: a silent, female-flapy, fat, sexy, and-no-no-world, you are bound to enjoy it (no pun intended).
