It was a pretty decent movie. This movie is just good for sitting and watching and entertaining. Just a simple Hollywood movie. This movie will not win an Oscar or anything else and is definitely not worthy of one, but I think it was pretty good. It's like 24 shows but set in the format of the film. If you like the whole, then we can save the terrorist from killing the President's movie, then you will enjoy this flickr. I personally think that the storyline has been done a lot in the line, but by adding a little wrapping with a joke into the sentinel secret service. After all, this film will not throw your jaw on the floor or change your life, but who has said that every film should be good?
