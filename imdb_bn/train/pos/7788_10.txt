I love Ashley Jude and all his films are great. <br /> <br /> Its best in Paradise. This is a very different movie that you must watch closely to appreciate it. A woman tries to make it on her own and refuses to make any temptations that can make her life easier. Some of her movies, like Cos the Girl's and Time to Kill, made good at the box office and video rental. They were very good movies <br /> Also, it will take time to see Ruby and I think you will agree with Ashley's best one. <br /> <br /> <br />
