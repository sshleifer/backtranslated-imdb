Finnish director Eikka Jarvi-Laturi, although I have never seen the best Estonian film. Tallinn Pimedas is a colorful thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold, it is a national asset that belongs to the Republic of Estonia. But at the same time it is a brief description of the condition of Eastern European countries. In the early 90's, the Soviet Union collapsed and many countries became independent as Estonia. Now in most cases the situation can be better. But in the early 90's, many new nations had to fight against the corruption and organized crime of Soviet era. (And still many of them ... at least some level ...) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tallinn Piedmus is a credible character and a well-written script With a very realistic movie of that era. The actors are very good, especially jury gervet (probably the best known Estonian actor, playing snot in Tarkovsky's Solaris), playing and the old gangster who has become tired of living slowly. But the most wonderful performance comes from Monica Magar, who played the thirteen child actor, is a young girl in her childhood whose plot is very essential. (And his name is not mentioned in the IMDB-Credit List !!!) <br /> <br /> There are not many movies in the world which can be entertainment and artists at the same time. But Tallyen Pimedas does that. Unfortunately, other films of Jarvi-Laturi are far from such success. His first one, the Chinas Pin is very artificial and his latest, history is made, the night was simply a strange mess.
