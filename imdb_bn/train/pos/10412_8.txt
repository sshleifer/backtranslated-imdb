Baghdad thief is a treasure. First and foremost, it's a good story. Although the initial publication of this story of my four children, the most famous among the stories of Arabian Nights, comes from the Disney Corporation, Baghdad's thief keeps interested in it till the end. The story includes move along a good speed and includes a twist or two which reduces forecasts. Abu, who played a young thief, appealed for an appeal by some of today's actors, I told my oldest daughter, "She is CIET!" <br /> <br /> In the 1940s, the film won an Oscar for cinematography and special effects. Today, of course, these effects seem to be very date ("Look, Barbie is flying through the air", my daughter announced in the eyes of the jin flying). They still fit well in the story. The film, after all, is 60 years old. The effect is to fit with scripts. In addition, what was seen in Baghdad thieves was very sophisticated for the next twenty five years. It is necessary to compare only one opening montage from the 1967 Star Trek episode. It was quite a success. <br /> <br /> This qualifies as a family film, though there are some stabings at the end. The acting is so clear and the wounds are so bloody, which are almost artificial like animation. <br /> <br /> Finally, the effect of a music movie for viewing pure entertainment evening, or historical value. I recommend it
