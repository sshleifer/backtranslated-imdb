"Cut" is a complete blur of Slashar style and basically it achieves what it accomplishes. Most standard slash clips are; Old vague houses, wood, anonymous continuous serial killers, Gore's buckets, and of course they are interrupted by couples when couple is sex (that is rarely a spoiler). <br /> <br /> Setup up simplicity itself: The film is set out to complete an incomplete slasher "masterpiece" in school school, Cast is incomplete due to the murder of a couple. It is very nicely - OK, gently - disposed of Kylie Minogue in the first arch. They joined the survivor of the original film, played by Molly Ringwald, who received the best character, because the movie was stolen. The rest cast well fits their role, especially the lovely Jessica Nepear, who played it directly and beat and bursts around her. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of red deer and fake mysterious moments, and there is very little time for the killer to try to work because of the film moving so fast. It's also a fairly low budget, it's probably a bit weird editing that is probably deliberate. Good soundtrack, too. If there is a problem with this movie, then it is being decided whether to send or respect slash. Probably both a bit.
