<br /> <br /> I saw Glasciar Fox in the 9-year-old theater - I confiscated my parents three times to bring them back. I started searching for it in the video about five years ago, eventually unveiling a copy on an online auction site, but I would like to see if it was selected and republished by a new distributor (I understand that the original video play is small ), Or rights to the rights purchased by The Family Channel, Disney etc. are shown regularly. This is an impressive film that attracts you to the story of a life of family life in a fox of northern Japan, which is described by a wise old tree. Nice soundtrack good congratulations of the film. It will be a good seller today, today's children are much better than poor festivals.
