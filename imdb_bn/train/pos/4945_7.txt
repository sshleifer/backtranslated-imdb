It is a solid film to classify "10 items or less" Generally, I'm not worried about defining the style, but there is something about this movie that you want to keep it in a specific section, to send it, even with one word, your feelings about it. I totally recommend this movie to anyone and if you really enjoy the movie and if you enjoy life you will end up seeing it. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie and it's nice and nice to say it is not perfect but it does not do any wrong. I do not want to listen to words of disagreement, but I believe that author / director Brad Silberling knew how he was getting this inspirational script while writing this inspirational script. I am sure he wanted to acquire a product that is nothing to do with perfection: a product that is as simple as its title, objectionable and incompatible. Well, he did it. The tall, complex, dramatic movie director of "City of Angels" and "Moonlight Miles", Silberling proves "10 items or less" that just stops within 70 minutes, his passion is his Work and faith in him. To put an actor (Morgan Freeman) in front of a grocer (PJ Vega) in a grocery store and offer them the general life, they will be offered a sealering. <br /> <br /> I can not say to you anymore because there is a thoughtful background in simple simplicity that should not be underestimated. Because everyone is open here: The camera monitors the two main characters, who stop continuous conversations in a car ride which stops which is not just life because it is not endless. And appreciate how silly it is to say how far it is praising that in less than a few times the number of characters produced by Sophia Coppola "Lost In Translation", in a short time (not only in the film time, one day the movie develops its events) and in small places. Connection <br /> <br /> This film set in Tokyo also featured an actor and a woman and they also talked about the moment they are living their lives. In such conversations where we can understand the provocative quality of "10 items or less" and like Coppola, the naturalness of each situation is never lost and all the songs with music and no words are forcibly induced or included, 'buy time' . <br /> <br /> In this case, Mr. Paddan Papamichael, director of the cooperation and photography of Silberling. The person that fits beautiful sceneries at "Sideways" and is focused on passion towards "Patch Adams", delighted with us here with visual passage of true natural beauty. <br /> <br /> However, the final beauty of "10 items or less" will be available in both the plays (Kavfman) cast. They send the feelings that I mentioned at the beginning and I can not specify; We feel their connection and we can say that they are having fun and they can even improve the stuff. Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman, an executive producer of the film, is standing there and confirmed today's status in the film industry and is appropriate for him: A calm man who is filled with knowledge, which can easily laugh at you. And beautiful legs Vega (well, I said he was cool in "spanglish")? Here he proved the real deal, and Hollywood is not small for him.
