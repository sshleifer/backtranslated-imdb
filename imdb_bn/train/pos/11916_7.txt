In today's family movies it looks beautiful with all "adult" viewers, where you will not have to worry about it and just enjoy a family with your kids. Yes, there may be some swearing words in this movie (there are times where Nox swears, but they do not let you hear the whole word), but in most cases this movie comes out really clear (and includes) movies from the day back) . Not only this, it's very enjoyable, my darling, and a nice clean and funny movie to watch with the family. My only thing against this movie is that it is too small and I think there may be some memorable part, I am not going to mention them because I do not want any spoilers here. <br /> <br /> All look nicely and a great movie; So go out and get kids, see some cookies, and this movie!
