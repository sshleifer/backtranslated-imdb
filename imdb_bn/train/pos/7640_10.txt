Mr. Destiny - 3.5 / 5 stars <br /> <br /> The "Mr. Destiny" theme has been reused from many movies that have been circulating for many years. His theme is the same, more serious and dramatic idea that "this is an extraordinary life" and described in the story of Charles Dickens in Scrooge's Stories, centuries ago, in their plots (see the recent "screwed"). "A Christmas Carol." "It is an ungrateful person being taken to the guided tour of his life and shown (or has been shown) how his life can be. <br /> <br /> In most of these films, the guardian angel has rescued a man from ungratefulness, Life was shown, or how it might have happened, in that case we showed a businessman named Larry (James Bellushi) She hates her life, she lives with an overwhelming wife (Linda Hamilton) and wants a bigger life with big money.He just hit the ball in the state championship high school years ago, she believes that her life will be better. I think he thinks this seemingly small moment of his life because it has a big impact on his subconscious party, Bay I doubt that an old man is interested in doing solo work from high school. However, it works in the movie. <br /> <br /> However, Larry is running home from work one night, where he is a penpusher along with John Lovitz Hi the car breaks. He woke up in a bar for a pay phone and unwittingly decided to tell Bartender (Michael Kain) about the way to save his life. This is the first time we see him remembering his childhood baseball strike out. <br /> <br /> Bartender hear and nods, apparently not worrying about any other customers. This is probably the reason that the bar, although old and burst, seems to have never been occupied by these living people. In fact, Larry even commented before watching the bar. Perhaps for a particular reason of the audience's expectations in front of Larry, it is probably likely. <br /> <br /> Therefore, Bartender, who can be the angel of God, just as Clarence revises a special beverage of her Larry, who keeps Larry's life inversion, shows her life as she has been traveling for forty years as before. Has been there. But Larry has no idea about any changes, just as Jimmy Stewart did not understand that Clarence had removed his own life before he was removed and kicked out until he returned home to find out the lawn, and the big, wrestler- The type people occupy his house. Instead of marrying Linda Hamilton, she married Ren Rousseau and moved to a big palace with the children. He found out that John Lovitz is no longer his friend but an employee of him. And the most surprising fact is that her new life, Larry always wanted ... she wanted herself after her oldest wife, Linda Hamilton. Evidence that sometimes the meaning and a great look is still a shallow wife an intelligent wife and like everything in life, like happiness and true happiness. Just as "this is a wonderful life" to show the viewer that the person creates and affects every person's person, "Mr. Destiny" shows us that material wealth is not a spiritual asset, a lesson has been taught to us repeatedly, but sometimes it is so It is not shown in our "Mr. Destiny" as sculptor, forgotten and truly sweet. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Destiny" is never too ridiculous, but it's a sweet, beautiful nature comedy that does not take itself very seriously. The problem of "this wonderful life", like "The Family Man", is trying to be dominant and memorable as "it's a wonderful life". But you can just stop the famous movie once and "Mr. Destiny" knows this and played it on behalf of the truth. It does not try to do anything; Rather, it is something that does not try to do it, and it is clear to the audience. <br /> <br />
