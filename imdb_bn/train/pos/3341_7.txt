I really watched this movie on Thursday night after having a boring day. I had no expectations, I was rather negative. Jimmy's only movie I have ever seen is that American version of the taxi with Queen Latifah? (?) ... do not ask why! But seriously, this movie is so beautiful! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I fall in love with Fallon's character almost. Why can not I fill an intelligent nerd like that. :) Excellent movie like that. Easy, sweet and necessary. Sunday a Thursday I'm not even a sports fan, but it's something about the basin American film that fascinates me. We probably do not have this game in Norway. <br /> <br /> (My first comment.)
