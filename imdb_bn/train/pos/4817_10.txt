The Young Victoria presents a beautiful movie and Queen Victoria in different light, which is what everyone thinks about them. Movies queen Queen Victoria "I'm not surprised" and showed that she was a delightful young girl. <br /> <br /> I like history, especially in Victorian history, when you see my first reaction, this picture may be advertised, I was so excited and counting days until it came up to the movie. I was a little worried that would not be historically correct, but it was and I liked it. I found new information about Queen Victoria, which I did not know before and it made me very interested. <br /> <br /> Queen Victoria was one of our greatest empires in many light, and this picture grasped her picture, what her real personality and her life were. He was treated so badly by his mother's adviser Sir John Convey because he wanted the kingdom of Britain. This is what Victoria inspired to be a fantastic queen, which she was! The romance between him and Albert was so deep and it was very good by Emily Blunt and Ruppecht Frand, who was brilliant! Young Victoria is a heart-felt love story but as well a great part of British history is a great look ... I love it !!!!!!!!! 10/10 ... No doubt!
