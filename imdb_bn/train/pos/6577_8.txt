With a few exceptions, most of the plays George Bernard Shore have almost disappeared from the theater nowadays. Very arch, very tabloid seems to be the general verdict. This BBC version of the show's most fun plays does not rule out the verdict. It's definitely arch and talky, but it's wonderful. And due to the quality of the British theater, it has been completely cast with actors - except for the exception of Helena Bonaham Carter - many of us have never been heard of this. Carter is the Bulgarian girl who as a "chocolate soldier" (Pope Torrens) as beautiful as haven and later falls in love with her. Sergius (Patrick Reichert), Bulgarian cavalry officer, may be particularly skeptical about the ridiculous interpretation, who operated enemy lines and only had the wrong ammunition of enemies for his machine guns. However, the role of additional role was invited and Ryecart was definitely asked to work extra. Other player characters are perfect. Carter is certainly in the center of the game as the fate of Switzerland as self-dramatic Bulgarian "Aristocrat" and Terrence, and of course they are wonderful. Yes, "Arms and The Man" came across as a pictorial game. But you're unlikely to ever see a film that does not betray its source. The plot is usually tricky. However, about all the conversations of the bodies of the bodies. The action is short (even Saint Joan) and the set is irregular. Enjoy this for what it is.
