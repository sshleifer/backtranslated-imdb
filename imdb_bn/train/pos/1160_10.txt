It's funny This is not Arthur Miller or TSS. Elliott, but people are funny about this. Cain and fields are great. (His toss of line "God, you are so dissatisfied" because he climbs on his window - Great! Carol runs in the door to find Terry hatcher!) Robert Dony Jr. and Kathy Marriyare working together - until he is really Find out ... if everyone is there then a soap opera will be launched! <br /> <br /> The last scene in China's dining area was my kids and I was roaming in the floor - the scene <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just a lot of fun.
