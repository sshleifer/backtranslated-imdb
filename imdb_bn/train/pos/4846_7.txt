This is a classic British comedy-thriller that I always wanted to check out but there is no scope for it so far. It is based on a popular stage game that has been portrayed many times before (most notably the same director in 1931, but unfortunately, this version seems to have not been completely alive!); To rebuild under rebuilding, this plot has been updated for the current wartime situation. However, I was initially familiar with the British Comedians with the Will Hey films: This feature is a legendary hooning, smuggling and a plot similar to enemy agents, this is much more in the vein (this is actually Marriott Edgar, the Valley Guest and JOC Orton's regular writing was written by the team); Blocked passengers material, then, was an equally tried-and-true formula. This time the star Arthur Askey (raised by Richard Murdoch) - I've seen any film before - who is proven itself as a hei as a hero and whose personality is proven as possible ... but one warms soon to him, and Assy must be quite a bit wicked The line and business brings interesting bit, to justify the fact that the main character of this game is here (and the 1931 movie Image Version) has been divided into two categories, star's direct partner. <br /> <br /> Remote unit setting (movies occurring during most stormy night) provides for some wonderful environments; The last half hour - a sudden appearance of a mysterious couple (Raymond Huntley and Linden Travers) and finally with the arrival of the famous car itself - especially the sticky and well-managed. The significant value from the remaining cast list is Catherine Harrison, a parrot as her strong companion, and as a stereotypical scared spinster which is driven by all tensions to take its first drink.
