Franco again proves that he is the princess of the supernatural and erotic movie. Indeed, most of his work can be seen as a recreational sledge, but when he sees that he can be truly competent with Sukubus (nakronnikiman), how can his strategic creativity lead to riots and give us a movie that is hypothetical and mysterious underlying eroticism of his work. Jerry Van Roween's excellent score puts an eye on viewer from one odd scene, because we follow the striptease artist's (Rayonwood) trials which can be skyscraperic, or indeed (as a mysterious character) devil may come along with the world's residence. A beautiful and mysterious piece of cinema highly recommend someone with a passing interest even in the film.
