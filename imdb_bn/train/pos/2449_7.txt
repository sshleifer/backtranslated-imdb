When I saw this ad, I was thinking "The drama is not in the drama!" Because it is taking the "fresh princess" slot. Well, I still love the fresh prince. But George Lopez is an amazingly good show. I do not love how- stereotypical benny. Carmen is a fantastic good character, it's really fun to see how sometimes it can be stupid and overemotional. I feel bad for the person who plays most, he is really small! But the max is a funny character, and well played. And yes, Angie is a little stereotypical, but has her fun moments. Hey George has a big head! But he could really be very good. Funny show! It will definitely be more often to improve the house.
