Robert Taylor is the main character of this photo as the crazy torch hunter Charlie Gilson. At the beginning I was thinking that Charlie the Shortcuts or James Stewart's The Naked Spoitter would free yourself like John Wein. But until the film goes to Gilleson, there is no hope of hope for as long as you do not expect it. Stuart Granger Sandy McKenzie, who wants to stop hunting, because he understands that Buffalo will soon be gone and he has become abusive by the killings. Gilson is a natural killer who does not make any difference between animals or humans. Debra Pagat, an Indian girl, is an amazing character considering the spontaneous censorship of that period. Although he hates him, he has resigned with Gilson. The last scene of a frozen gilson is unforgettable.
