Perhaps Disney was waiting for another Mary Poppins, but it was a different story, and when Angela was happy she was a very different actor from Julie Andrews. To say that Lancers have been fully cast and distributed in a magical performance. There is something funny about her character and she has been given wonderful support from David Tamlinson. Tommilson can carry a melody but he certainly does not have as much to sing as a singer. It does not matter to you such a gifted actor as rarely notice. Like many other favorite stars like Ruddy McDowell, there are some great quayos, who win the winning performance and many favorite Tessie Oceania, but the old girl looks beautiful to see it again. In a small role, Sam Zaff and the King of French Television King Bruce Forsyte, it is very nice to see. This score is especially composed of some beautiful songs from the Bony Sea and The Wygoff of Volleying. The big number stretches to porteboo road limits but it has lots of drama. The effect looks a bit different today, but with the German aggressors, the film is one of the most fascinating scenes of the film being attacked by wild soldiers. Children are not boring like other movies, but struggle to understand what a young boy is saying. I liked the Home Army's marching song. The Home Guard was very important for Britain and it is a warm tribute. Animation is a lot better than Pixar, which I feel extraordinary. A warm happy movie and it's not a surprise that it's done at the stage.
