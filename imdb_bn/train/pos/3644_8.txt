The 40-year-old school of Ruxi Big Lake, Texas, is based on the real story of the teacher. Jimmy Morris (Dennis Quaid) High School Science Teacher and Baseball Trainer in a small town. The team lost their team terribly until their coaches played in the minor league and could not throw 98 meters pitch. <br /> <br /> After throwing the practice of batting and after hajj pilgrimage, Jim agrees that if his team won the regional team, he would try for the Major League. The movie tells the story of Jimmy's son in the first game of the movie. This is an extraordinary story and a very friendly family movie. Dennis Quaid makes the movie valuable, provides a mental performance and is supported by a wonderful cast that includes: Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T. Jones. <br /> <br /> The story takes a while to develop and some scenes are a bit slower but it works well till the end. Baseball scenes are fun, well-painted, and nicely illustrated. The film is not about baseball, but almost one person wants to reach the dream. It's inspirational, it's emotional, and it's fun. I liked it, hope you would. <br /> <br /> Rookie. Starred: Dennis Quaid, Brian Cox, Rachel Griffiths, and Angus T Jones. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 5.
