Thanks for Martin Scorsese and his love for the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect introduction to the mind of the most talented American artist in today's movie, and I could not recommend it more. I was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too. Just take a break and let him take his journey to the world, you like it.
