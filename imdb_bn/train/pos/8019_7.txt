"Muppets to Manhattan" are so different in many other ways so far as other Muppets are made. For one, it's Disney's only Muppate film. Until 2008, the film still belongs to the 20th Century Fox (CBS Fox, during its release), but the owner of Disney Muppette rights. Also, this movie has a storyline that is very non-linear and event that is otherwise unpredictable. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < However, "Muppets Manhattan" is a way better than "Muppate Movie", perhaps a surprising realistic scene. In the first film, all Muppets must go to Hollywood, walk to the agent's office, and they are given a "Rich and Famous" contract immediately. In this movie, Muppets can learn that they really have to work for their desired success, and it is very difficult to do, especially in the entertainment business, they are more than initially thinking. This is an important and often repeated message, if the Muppets are small and willing to suspend the unbelief made of cloth, it must be in a spacious place or not even feed in order. After all, after creating a postgraduate college, their struggle created a very good story. Another note: Celebrity cinemas were great in the movie, and they were surprisingly managed to not take spotlight from Muppets. This power was a rule to Henson, and how objectionable the muppet characters were to adults. <br /> <br /> Where "Manhattan" has flattened, and this is where I'm sure that people will not disagree with me, especially at the end, with some original songs. I thought the wedding song "Hey make May May Happy" was very difficult for this happy occasion like a wedding. It sounded more like a song played on a funeral. Every time I see this movie, I heard that the song made me uncomfortably disappointed, especially when the movie started as "Together" and ended happily on that matter. "Swing Goodbye" was a tragic number, but due to isolated in the movie, it was better in the movie and was not sure they were going to see each other again. The last song was so frustrating and probably linked to the sadness of young viewers leaving their favorite muppets big screen. <br /> <br /> "Muppets Take Manhattan" is a good film overall, and after the death of one Jim Henson and Richard Hunt, the new Muppate films carry a procession in different drum beat than other Muppets films. Fortunately, the film march with the same direction. I just finished the last song in this movie, which was not too bad. Plus, Disney got her hands on the copyright of this movie and it released a suitable DVD release. Maybe it will be someday. We'll see.
