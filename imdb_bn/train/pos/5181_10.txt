I've enjoyed this movie fairly, but the four things really are standing: Sam Raimi's perfect comic time and camp's Qazi (?) Man, the excellent screenplay by Alan Orkin's camp owner, and above all cinematography. The beautiful golden tones of exotic scenes attract me in films such as Sunny Lekshavar, attracts me in my own summer memories. <br /> <br /> Dialogues and moods seem very normal and trustworthy. Some critics also criticize the lack of a "deep" script. To me, there is a lack of work to do in this film. Characters and their issues seem to be real and because of that I am concerned about what happens to them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that all the parts that come together together think right.
