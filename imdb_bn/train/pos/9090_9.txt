"Hollywood Hotel" is an agile, brilliant, amazing entertainer comedy which is sadly overlooked by Warner. It should only be remembered for offering three official official songs songs - "Hollywood for Hollywood." The numbers of Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer have a number of gems, but curiosity is "like a fish I like," and "silhouetted in the light of the moon." The best musical number "Let you have a text", which contains details of Dick Powell and the company that found himself "behind the eight balls", which luckily slowly and slowly being slowly and gradually flowing slowly, Edgar Kennedy . The end This picture is a glamor of Hollywood and it's a one-time punctures for celebrations once, because it finds pompous and ego-maniac actor and copied studio officials out of many comic mileage. This cast contains a mockery of great characters - Alin Josin is a tricky press agent, Dick Powell's manager as Ted Healy, an exciting restaurant sponsor of Fred Fadel, Glenda Farell, Mona Marshall's gossip-gull Friday, McDay Todd as McDonald's Fools sister as Edgar Kennedy and Hugh Herbert, even as his secret father. Here is another review described in the "racist" element ten second bits, in which a curtain is displayed in black appearance during the "hard win win" sequence. It's a suspicious flavor, but the only footage available in this awesome jazz combo is that I should not allow you to stop it from other pleasures, especially Beni Goodman Quartet (including Teddy Wilson and Lionel Hampton)! The "Dark Eyes" sequence is too long and comes very late, but otherwise the "Hollywood Hotel" is a jewel, your time is good and of course a movie that should be considered for DVD releases.
