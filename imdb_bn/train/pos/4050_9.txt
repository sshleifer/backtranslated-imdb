Anyone who finds this movie annoying, it is a frustrating bone, which should be stuck in car chez films and romantic comedy. This film is not riveting and an annoying moment. Why? Because it creates the most intelligent dialogue between real people at the moment of crisis and gives details of their efforts to survive the crisis. I repeat - intelligent dialogue! Most of Romar's films represent, and because of that, many people do not like them. They like the action Fine, let the rest of the lives of their career be spent, although those of us who have taste and discrimination will continue to find such movies. <br /> <br /> Rohini has always been accused of being "conversational". Well, he did not criticize me, but praised that, to me. Shakespeare was very talkative. Is there a game of "Hamlet"? Whenever there is any subject of art, or theme, the concept of price and the contradiction, there must be a discussion of these concepts and values, which is basically about this movie. Democracy and noble birth versus proportionality; Loyalty to old friends is kept in the final test when we accept that friend we believe in the wrong way; The value of human life and the responsibility to save that life, even if that person is the person, then it is very nice or even hateful. (Anyone ever heard of Dostevsky, or "Crime and Punishment?") What is this picture on this subject? <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid in two furloughs, as they were born to play this role. Lucy Russell, who speaks French as English and its second language, is particularly bright. See yourself a benefit and this riveting film. It can be the last film by this screen master.
