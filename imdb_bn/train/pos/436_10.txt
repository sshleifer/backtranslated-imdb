I absolutely love this movie I'm not even particularly sure about it but I think it should be wonderful and available for DVD. The women were strangers and spent the time in Italy's Villa, enough for them to go alongside. Actors, my opinion, did a wonderful job. The characters are so different and yet clever stories that made all the work so. Good times all have fun, drama and relationship problems. This requires 10 lines but I just can not think of anything else so I'll just be rattle until I get 10 lines. So sorry about this. I've probably seen how long I can say that it's been a long time. I look forward to seeing again but it is not available.
