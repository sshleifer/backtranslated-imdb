How exactly is the title of this picture described - an attempt to buy what the authors have to offer. <br /> <br /> First, 1996-style Toronto is very fun to watch. I have stupid haircuts, sunglasses, clothes, and attitude. It has not really changed; Just a nice, safe, cheap, provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film genres! Kenny and the Spaniard look at LA in LA and it is very fun to find Toronto again, only with the odd reserves of sea beach left, musician, lucky Taylor, and more indifferent film types. <br /> <br /> I do not see a movie as a movie to enjoy; This is not entertainment, as long as the viewer is curious to see some of the curiosities being trampled. I warned the pitch that the electricity and money are actually held by the studio to perform and produce the house. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Buy or not, but the message is still there.
