I can not add a scary thing to positive reviews here - great acting, balanced writing, versatile characters, a great anti-hero Tony, great commentary on thousand years of American life. The integral use of psychology combined with Tony Mother's problems is particularly fresh and funny. Many other letters add a lot of depth - in the fascinating history of Hasy's total unreasonable rage of Ralph as an outside muscle, the dual desire of Chris and more. <br /> <br /> I would like to dig a bit but critics, especially 'It has violated Violence in Italian Americans'. Most writers and actors Italian-Americans, will they attack themselves? There are many positive Italian-American characters - RTBook Chef, Dr. Beside Melfi and her family and Cupamanoas Sopernos. Indeed, Dr. According to Melfi's former husband, the small number of young American Americans in the first Italian American had ever had a mobile connection (in comparison to the African-American Americans involved in crime, I dare say it.) Both poverty and lack of opportunity are the main reasons. Most characters do not really choose their life; Family background or circumstances basically in their corner. The travelers (even the Italian stock) who try to integrate it, usually fill the annoying ends - for example the message and its friend in the 2nd episode. If you criticize the show, then I think Frasia wants to be psychologically, or Will and Grace Want to be gay? Probably you will not listen to songs that gang, or RN'b discusses about imperfection or rock music. Do you talk about narcotics (or any other combination)? Some people are not like some fools like you .... <br /> <br /> Not all things are perfect, many letters have appeared only once, when they are all Viewed by logic or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracey dancer, friend of friend, Alley, Unfiel Junior's LedFrade (supposedly not split for 20 years) Alone up to 1).
