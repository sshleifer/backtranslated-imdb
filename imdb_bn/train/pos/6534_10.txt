I've heard that this picture looks good to many of my friends, and they all said it was awesome, so I had a very high expectation- and Nancy Drew exceeds the high expectations! It was fun part, it tried to try to kill me and kept entertained with all the dudes, and was as amazing as the Enma Roberts Nancy Drew. The rest of the cast was very good. I would definitely recommend this movie !! <br /> <br /> "Wonder why these people were trying to kill us?" Karki: "Yes, I was astonished too. Actually, it hurts me!" <br /> <br /> Nansi: "I hate when people try to kill me. It's so rude!" <br /> <br /> ~ Nancy Drew
