This image has emulsified Emilie Watson by breaking Waves's reputation. This movie about a person's passion was held at a resort where a chess tournament is being held. A chess master comes and soon falls in love with a woman (at first sight) crazy, soon acting by Emily Watson. She falls for a oddball of a man, who is obsessed with chess. This is her mother's disappointment, who is more interested in meeting him with another young man; A suitable gentleman His mother thinks that this is just a momentary fad for this girl, because there is a tendency to do strange creatures and such things. What has happened is a journey through the emotional of most people. It tells the story of how closely its closely closely with its past. Emily Watson plays this amazing, as well as the actor who plays the main character. It's definitely slow, but the value of watching is good. The end was even satisfied as well. :)
