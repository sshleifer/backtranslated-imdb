This Chinese film makes me so close to the members of such culture that I am not involved and far away. Almost in Buddhist pursuit, the film helps in the happiness of doing each letter and general routine things. <br /> <br /> All the actors shine brightly and the juju tremendousness and spread knowledge, yet weak and mean. Bin Min, the disabled brother has shown us that intelligence and knowledge are not equal, and this knowledge comes to the most discriminated people of this universe. A different China, it is far from the reality of China, yet it has various humanity and reality. <br /> <br /> Get it. You will not be disappointed.
