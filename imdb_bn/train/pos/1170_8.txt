The 1978 film of "The Day of the Dead" (and the 2004's Remix) is a funny folly of The 1978 "The of the Living Homel". Only this time ... with the homeless. All of the homeless people of this episode are coming to the South Park and people do not understand why they treat homeless people like displaced people, who want change and end up on the roof of a supermarket like some movie movies. So now the boys have to know where they came from and how to get rid of them. It's like a fun episode, which boys have their own version of 2 packs. Dredged song singing "Love in California". This is a good episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
