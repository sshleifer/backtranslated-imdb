Really reading two Kaki brothers and their respective worship (through drug narcotics) and later release stories. A brother, self-proclaimed genius recognized by James Franco is your ideal but sensitive men and children. The other brother is a hard working future doctor, who becomes a little child because he becomes addicted when dealing with the pressure of living with the expectations of both his children's family. Drug paraphernalia is not very hands-free, and a nice realistic sketch of family mobility that brings all drug issues. I appreciate James Franco for his efforts as it suggests it to anyone interested in researching the character and was definitely the labor of love.
