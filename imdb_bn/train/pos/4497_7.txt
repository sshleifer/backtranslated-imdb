I saw the first part of this series when it started again in the late 90's and recently had the opportunity to see three parts through Netfix (convenient way of service). All in all, I liked this lighthearted, sometimes style, mini series challenge. The elderly woman seems to work on the story of a young man fallen and the actors are all fine. Yes, there are some goodbye romance clips in the rain or train station, but there is a chance to discover the letters so it does not seem like Chess, as it is Tom Hans's vehicle or similar. Robson Greene, who repeatedly reminded me of an isolated born Scott Bakula, kept his head above the love heels and threw the series with a tire and rejection of his will and rejection and kept it as a hired fare. Personally, I think the series can be completed with two episodes, but I think it's up to the debate. Apparently, there is a sequence, and that should be coming next through Netflix.
