I thought it would be a sequel to the original "36th Chamber of Shawlin", but in reality it is basically a light-hearted "sister". Gordon Liu has still starred as a hero who wants to learn dog feo ... but this time his lighter and more ridiculous. The film is located around the local Die Mille, where the wages are cut due to the appointment of 10 new batch. Liu played "Chao", who seems to have fooled Mess Messi, he is a Shawlene monk who almost earned the magical Kung Fu skills. But his fate ended, he was declared fraudulent and he promised the mill workers that he would learn to learn Kung Fu in the Shaolin monastery and come back to protect them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whereas Chao accepts efforts to make several. This sets up lots of really fun moments, and lots of great fighting choreography. Continuing the tradition of "36th Chamber" we can see all kind of handsome and attractive (and above all) hauling training methods as creative use of monastery and wooden benches. <br /> <br /> is also unique and a mixture of Kung Fu and Bamboo sculptural buildings. Chowk is not accepted as a student of Shaolin, but is made to build bamboo scaffold to "restore 10 years of monastery". I bought a special and inspiration on the Bamboo building building in the DVD that came from Lou Kara-Leng, the director. It is a hunt for hundreds of thousands (probably thousands) years old and the scars of Hong Kong are still bamboo in high altitude, although the Western only uses steel tubes and clamps. As a result of his horrific activities, Chao develops a special style of Kung Fu ... When asked what kind of he is, then he will happily "Scounding Kung Fu !!" Reply. Which he examined during the dust-up with the abbey of the first monastery. In the final clash with Manchus, there is a wonderful array of bamboo poles and creative uses for binding. <br /> <br /> From a comedy point of view, I think it is the best of Kung Fu's Sheraton. Generally as a Kung Fu film, it stands ... I recommend it to anyone!
