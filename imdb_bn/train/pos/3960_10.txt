According to director, this movie was popular in Asia. It is difficult to take these Matt Helg films seriously because most of them are shot in a very tough budget. Almost no USD total. But it is very interesting to establish that Matt Helles finally completes an action that can be called an action movie. Ninja Mission - I think - is one of the best in all the movies directed by him. Some special effects are quite enjoyable. This is not a "B" or "C" movie. This is a "Z" movie - but an enjoyable and funny "Z" movie!
