A LAUREL & Hardy Comedy Short. The boys come to the house of Professor Noodle to swim in the chimney, a crazy scientist who perfected his reproduction ceramic. Stann and Oli proceed with their dark work, spreading destruction inside the house and on the roof. Then the professor wants to try his new urine <br /> <br /> A very funny short film. The end is somewhat unexpected, but the slopstick moving forward towards it is quite awesome. On the opposite side of the chimney, the verses of the wills of Stan and Oli are particularly good. Professor of Louisiana Littlefield.
