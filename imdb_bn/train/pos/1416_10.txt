Earth must be seen for children and adults. My boy was great fun watching all these funny birds and ice-bear. We can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud of our great wealth in our world. There are some invisible animals in danger. Exactly that problem should be prevented by all authority of our planet. <br /> <br /> This documentary brings many exceptional images that I have never seen before. Then it's a heavenly music as well as well. The director received great respect that did a great job here. The world can not stop me and my family to give the highest rate. I hope so much that the stuff will create a sequel.
