It was an adorable movie. When you need a real feel-good movie. The story is light (this is no mass with wind) but sometimes, one needs such kind of plot. Funny and warm letters, superb acting and beautiful costume / costume. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie Parminder K Nagra (from TV Show ER) Wonderful He is definitely a new burning star for Hollywood. All should keep an eye on her, she is going to be big in the future. <br /> <br /> There was also soundtrack for this movie. Modern and Indian tune is an excellent mix. I dance to most of the movies. <br /> <br /> If you need any funny movie then it is highly recommended.
