This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie are so adorable. We love to see music and dance watching as well as camels along with Anne and Andy Bark. This movie is so popular with the hugged ears, singing her songs, "I love the sailors I love you". If you watch the movie Raggedi Ann and Andy you can see why it is a movie that loves kids, and adults!
