I remember that the trailer was very impressive for Jugi's legend and a Man Called Hero (always my favorite), as a fan of Storm Riders, I decided that I would also see it. I know that there is a lot of criticism about the acting power of Eckon Cheng, but he is one of my favorite Hong Kong movies (still better than Nicholas TS) and one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. Without doubt, this image is a work from the beginning to the end of the film. I thought that only actors were original and everything else made the computer at the end of this movie. They must have done a lot of work in this work and they deserve good credit for it. The story of the movie was a story of love and goodwill (I think Econ Chen easily drag girls). The story is not very intelligent and deep, but it's not what you expect when viewing an action movie. I wanted to have more martial arts action with the boxer and fist instead of fighting with the power of the witch, but well that life and whatever it is you want it. And why did they finally sound like a supersonic aircraft in the war through the sky? That's way too funny. Legend of June is not a man in my eye, but it can flow like a videogame and it is not a bad thing. If an organization decides to publish the game in this movie, I would not recommend it because it carries all the videosomic elements. Good job Please make more imagination movies like this
