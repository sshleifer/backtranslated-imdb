That was great fun! I never read that Chester-Gold comics but they do not need to know. Maybe I was not a little joke, but I did not understand what the eye is seeing. It's a satirical, colorful movie and all of the actors are well humor together. Is the setting like Batman's movies? But not dark and gray. Okay, the story is not so original, but a plot (which is not self-evident) and less surprising finishing. <br /> <br /> With this movie you can play an interesting game, if you see it with friends Do not see credits at the beginning and then see who is the best actor to find out under their makeup!
