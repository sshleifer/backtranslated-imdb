Contrary to the person listed above, I felt that this film was really fun, especially in the scenes there was a lot of mixing. I do not want to keep this plot and story away from the people, which I have not seen yet, but I would say that there is no such role in Paresh Rawal's past favorite films such as Hira Ferry and Hungama. Paresh Rawal made an amazing part by playing a minor role in him, John Abraham did the same thing, Akshay Kumar proved that he was not less in the film, like Walkt and his almost all the movies, Although the three heroines of this movie have played for the first time, they have done a great job, especially Nargis, who is very good and warm. I would say that if you like Humaara or Hera Ferry, then you must watch this movie.
