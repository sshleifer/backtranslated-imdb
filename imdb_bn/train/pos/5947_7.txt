50 years old, this musical comedy fantasy can see his age, but it wears with dignity. <br /> <br /> This picture is still very interesting. Crosby was not really a romantic lead element, but he needed the material to deliver with light ridiculous edge. Vedics is a wide range and a part of which is great fun to call upon its power. Hardwicke - How much joy for a knight in the kingdom - a real - cast such caperings yourself with such abandonment. And Ronald Fleming was the first to play the main role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So naturally it was fun because it was never its greatest power. <br /> <br /> The color is good, the word somewhat ugly in place. << br /> <br /> and the story - well, it takes some freedom with the original, but I think Mr Clemens is probably pleased with the result.
