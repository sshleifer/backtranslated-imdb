Charles Boyer was considered to be Spanish and came to London "secret agent", in 1945, starring Loren Buckle, Katina Paxenou, Peter Lor, Dan Seymour, and Wanda Hendrix. Boyer is Luis Denard, and without the bark stop him all out. His papers have been stolen, he is accused of murder, but he is determined to get coal for his people so that they can fight fascists. <br /> <br /> This image is not its good and good points. It has high rates for the atmosphere and suspension and it is extremely entertaining. Unbelievably beautiful, wildly enthusiastic, Paxino means, Laur's thin, Hendrix is ​​kindly merciful, and Kamour is helplessly surprising. <br /> <br /> Not so good points: Badl is considered as English, and Boyer Spanish. Ah, no. The role of Boy's wrong role is also scary, but Bacal is 100% American, British High Class. There are two chemistry. Conclusion: Bacall is somewhat miscast. His performance is not up to the bath; She is good at other movies. But she is a wonderful looking woman, and many can be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Paxinou is almost top and hateful. Dan Semur stole almost the whole film as a hotel guest who studies human nature. This is a great part and its performance perfect, the other actor is not good in some aspects. It was definitely a case of no small part, only small actors. Seymour was not a small actor. <br /> <br /> Even valuable value with its flaws.
