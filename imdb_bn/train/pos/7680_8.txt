"Holi" is an issue-driven movie, but it is not manipulut or too sensitive. Her heart is strong-deliberate but ultimately combined Vietnamese girl will not be so successful without drawing out a flesh-lost soul with a character driven film, which is Patrick (Ron Livingstone), slowly awake conscience, and Holly (Thuy Nguyen) From vibrant editing and vibrant editing, everything is accurate and orderly. Contemporary classical scores can initially be a bit off, but it is a top-notch composition and a whole, which highlights the excellent restraint. This film raises many issues but provides some clear-cut answers, eventually succeeding in generating condolences and condolences for sharing Holi and her grief. Kudos who managed to create it.
