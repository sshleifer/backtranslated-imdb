Michael Jackson's Munawallar is a real adventure for the whole family! <br /> <br /> Before the film's real story begins, we get a performance in the bad journey (man in the mirror), and it turns out to be a great movie. After this, we got a collage of Michael Carrier, as before the release of Munwalkar in 1988. The story begins after some song video (Speed ​​demo, give me away, etc.) <br /> <br /> This plot is basically being pursued by Michael and his three friends (the children) "Badger" by the bad guy in the story, because they have discovered their bad plans to be children's drug addiction across the world. During the Chase we see the fantastic part, FX. Mitchells Smooth Criminal Video, which is perfectly fantastic with its dancing sequences, and so on. But then one of the kids is abducted and Michael can save him before being drug addict. <br /> <br /> While filming, we do not just see the special effects for the day's criteria, but it is still effective today. For example, look at Michael's robot / spaceship to protect his friends! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Amazing! <br /> <br /> I recommend every family to spend beautiful night together with candy and popcorn in front of the TV. And now some parents can stand up and say: "But Michael Jackson is an alleged child repressor!" Yes, he is indeed, but, come, we all know it is not true! Wait and see ..
