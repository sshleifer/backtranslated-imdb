I saw this movie 100-200 times and I saw it every time I like it. Yes, it can be a little bit, but it's very fun and enjoyable. The camp shown in the movie was a real camp that I had been present for 7 years and was actually portrayed as a camp to spend the summer. All those who went to the camp wanted to go to the camp, or sent a child to the camp, this movie should be seen because it will bring excellent memories for you and your kids.
