As a waiver, I saw the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only saw music this week. It allows me to judge the film without gripping my musical or what was it (but when I saw the musical instrument, it bothered me) <br /> <br /> I really believe Michael Douglas has done quite well, along with Kasey , That role I think its one of the best parts of the movie 'Let me Dance for You You' is a good addition to music. The film is much better than a dancer and a musical instrument, as well as Cast is at least 10 times bigger (certainly easy to work in the film). Discourse, lighting, dance and singing are much better in the movie, which should be expected, and actually been delivered. <br /> <br /> The music in harmony with the musical instrument has been well-done in the movie, the new ones are quite good, and the whole film provides more music than my opinion, especially the few decors which are musical instruments. A bad point of the film is a clear cut among actors, and the singer has been dubbed while singing for some characters, but their dancing is faulty, and the last product was more enjoyable than the musical instruments.
