I first saw this movie in 1969 or 1970 on Sunday afternoon at the local station at Horror Show. Uncut I was just a little kid, but I liked it and did not really fear it. I thought it was such a cool and extremely original tale. Thinking back, I am still surprised that these TVs were shown on TV during those years. I've never found this image, I've seen it again and always like it. One John Waters would have thought that this image was statue. This is not just a horror movie, but one of the greatest, greatest films ever made at the time. And surprisingly, you have retained the movie "Sloth Feast" or "The Hills Hey Eyes", after following it, you're not listening to this. It is following a ritual, but it should have been my opinion really a classmate classic. As far as I know, it came out shortly before the bloodstream went out, it is probably one of the first true "Gore" movies. In fact, this film has been cast for the good measure of Herschelle Gordon Lewis and a good roya girl. <br /> <br /> However, I recommend this to anyone who likes trashy, sleazy, black and white horror films from anyone. The first of 60's (I think it will end date 1960).
