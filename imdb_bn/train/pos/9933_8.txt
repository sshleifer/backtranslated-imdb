If you find yourself running away, something that keeps your attention for two hours and lets you lose it in another country, the domino will fulfill that requirement. This entertainment, after all! The plot keeps your brain in motion - one of those movies (like the usual suspects) where you want to see it a second time to fully represent. I was surprised by Domino Harvey, his life became interested in Hollywood. For the sake of celebrity, celebrity is not shown in many trailers. And any actor who makes mistakes by making me forget their work. I do not think once in football uniform or pirate costume. And Mickey Rourke plays Mickey Rouke well and often, but here, despite the violence, he shows signs of being able to take care of other people.
