I love this show! <br /> <br /> When I see an episode every time I repeat that line and remind myself how its a good display. I am a huge science fan fan and in the history of Film / TV this show may be the most important science (fiction) show. There are many theories in this show about the universe, I can start a religion. Its amazing, the season becomes better and better after the season. <br /> <br /> I became a McGuiss fan from 5 years old (19 now) and it is very rude to me that my favorite TV show is always starring Richard Dean Anderson Each character is actually contrasted against the opposite. <br /> <br /> When I first saw the Strutgate, I liked it early and it was considered as my favorite scientist-fi flux, and I was really excited to hear it from the TV show, but the fifth season was not over Not got showtime until <br /> <br /> I heard that the Roland Emerick and Dean Dwillin wanted to do what the movie was a three-dimensional but rather a series of studio options. <br /> <br /> ID says it's okay. Maybe even better. <br /> <br /> This show is amazing, and I hope it never dies. We come here Atlantis!
