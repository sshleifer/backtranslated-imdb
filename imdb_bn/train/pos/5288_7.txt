This funny bug bunny cartoon still shows the unnamed Marvin Martian and his back K-9 green dog back. Instead of trying to destroy the Earth at this time, Marvin is on mission to mission in the world, capture a world animal and take it back to Mars. Of course he is the Bug Bug Bunny creatures. At first bug thinks Mervin and K-9 techniques or treatments, but it seems that it can not be right when Marvin deliberately increases the bug's rabbit hole with a rifle gun. The Bagh tried to get out of the situation in some ways, of which Marvin persuaded that K-9 is planning a rebellion. Finally, he used to take a pair of straight-jackets and was caught in solitary confinement. Surprisingly, it works for advertising for the AIM product and the bug is forced to help him get the K-9 release, the tables are soon made, and two dissatisfied martins are tissue and the bugs are trying to fly their runner on the earth. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it though the end is somewhat weak compared to the last story. Marvin's voice has changed a bit here and he became visible emotion when he was angry, but it made him less like a cartoon like me.
