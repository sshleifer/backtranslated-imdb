My and my dad just did not get lunch at Burger King. We were running in the house to see what this movie would be on Saturday. We went home to sleep, started the set and put it at 56. The Kung Fu term is a regular article of many Kung Fu movie clips in the background with words on Saturday. Then there was the title of the film. Five deadly genome said Then the movie started. I was surprised by the pre-credit order of my cat. I like the moment I came to this movie. My favorite character was Today Poison. It was difficult to follow the plot at that age, but it did not bring me what it was ... it was war The war was so ... amazin g. When I came in commercially, I used to cry and I finished the 24-hour film soon.
