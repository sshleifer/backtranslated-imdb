Although most Americans have little knowledge of Star Wars, but Alex Ginny, especially in the 1940s-1950s, he created amazing work from the theatricals to the Quikky comedy. I especially love his comedies, because they work very well and seem to be so natural and real on screen - far from the normal fares of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> This picture was sparked in my interest in this movie. Its plot was so weird and clever that the film was made anywhere - outside Yaling Studios - it was a special interest for "small" movies. <br /> <br /> Guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company. She wants to check to make an uncertain synthetic fabric, even though she is not working as a researcher, but for her work of generatorial work! So, he continues to sneak into labs (if no one is in the day or night) and tried his hand during the discovery. Frequently, he has been caught (as he flown the lab) and the boot was successful for a day! Then, despite the invention of invention, he closed the entire unexpected chain of events - and then started to have fun. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful mockery that is fun with industry, union and government. And ordinary people
