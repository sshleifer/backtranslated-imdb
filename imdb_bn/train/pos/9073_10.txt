To see this picture my wife and I took our 13-year-old boy and were absolutely delighted with the great fun of this film. There are additional appeals for boys and boys who remember their childhood, but even women enjoy the film, and especially the haley kitten Egerenberg's boring, "boys are very weird." It is refreshing to see a movie which shows that children are actually different in their mental and social makeup. Boys really do such strange things and usually live to tell stories and fear their mother silent! We enjoyed this picture so much that my son and my 11 year old friend, my daughter and my 23 year old boyfriend went to visit the movie the next day for a boy's day. We were almost more fun about the second time and everyone raved about it It played clean and fun with a classic teenage classic "Freaks and Geeks", a pre-adolescent cast. We all think that this is not against "fixes and jics", except for surviving in its first season, it will be a slipper hit until its DVD release is sold. Especially if you have a son and you will see it stimulate conversation about fun and security! Because of this love of girls, it will be said, "boys are so weird!" Do not miss it ...
