This show is about three young girls. (D.J., Stefani, and Michele) Drunk was drunk so that their father Danny invited his eldest friend (Jesse) and his old friend (Joey). So life is about the whole show life. Girls have to go through life troubles and have life lessons. They crushes, boycott, and much more develop. The whole show is almost basically about to go with the flow. If you just have to let it go, you do not have to keep distraction. I think this show is really good and fun. I grew up watching this show and still see it. I am happy to broadcast this event on television. I watch it almost every day. I rate it 10/10.
