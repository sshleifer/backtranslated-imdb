BrockDown Palaces is the best friend of Alice and Darlin, who goes on a spontaneous tour of Thailand and is captured in prison after being caught with their luggage medicine. In this way, the film was likely to have a serious and moving film, such as "Return to Paradise", but instead, the film chose to give little attention to the situation of the girls and to focus more on their friendship. Claire Danes and Kate Buckinsle both move around in wonderful performances, and the film says more about the interaction between them - doubts, jealousy, questions of their friendship and test and finally made in the name of friendship. This movie does not become too strict in politics or even the strictness of prison life (which is slightly impressive), and does not pay much attention to these friendship issues. To select it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were some plot holes here, and some parts that do not seem to be trustworthy or realistic. We did not feel the real fear or disappointment of their situation and we might have. And we are feeling very little out of the wall of the fort, Bill Palman's idea was a golden lawyer who actually found the heart of gold. In short, these rights should be a much more intense movie than this. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've enjoyed it. The acting was good, the soundtrack was perfect, and the storyline was active enough to stay twists and interesting interesting. Worth watching.
