This animated feature (co-production between Ireland, Belgium and France) certainly discusses one of the most important topics for the film: a famous illuminated manuscript of the 9th century, the creation of the Kells book. In this excellent reuse of this story, Brendan was a prominent boy who lived in a monastery ruled by his uncle, a rubbish garbage worn by the terrible afternoon strikes, preparing for the attack, should be banned in the neighborhood of a master illuminated book called Eden Forest to search the material. To do that, he unexpectedly found a friendly angel named Aisling in the forest. Fantastic and hand-drawn (some original article has some computer animations) that want to be similar to both medieval and traditional bridges, with a very creative use of colors and all kinds of geometric shapes, this movie is weirdly weird, but it's a strange Diverse curiosity, not extravagant but eye-opening types. If someone wants to do nicot without some immunity like an African beggar in the 9th century Ireland ?? One has to say that the combination of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism is never met. And comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad. That's why I can not give them the highest ranking. But this is a minor problem with otherwise pleasing and fantastic fantastic movie.
