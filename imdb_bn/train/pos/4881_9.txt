"Cabbie" illustrates the pain of a woman during the former and World War II, raising her children alone after being confined to prison for "worried crimes". This movie was directed by Yamada Youji, and it is expected that the atmosphere of this film is really amazing. Although the historical accuracy of some scenes, especially beach scenes, suspects <br /> <br /> The role of this movie is absolutely incredible. I am annoyed with how they got together this star-star for the 2008 film. Perhaps the most decorated actress in Japan, Yashinaga Sayari, has undoubtedly won more personal prizes for her performance in this film. In a supporter role Shoufukutei Tsurube was really good as well. Even though it was coming, however, who distributed the most impressive performance, perfectly depicted the deviation of his character and the difficult situation he was in. <br /> <br /> Movies with pre-war settings are not my stuff, but thanks to excellent instructions and acting, I was completely absorbed by the stories. Also, it was not a left leftist like "Unagi no machi, Sakura noon kuni", and examined the government's repression and the brain's controversial and sensitive issue that happened during that time. Excellent movies, highly recommended for all viewers.
