When I was a small child (thanking Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) when I was a young child, I saw this movie and it was nightmares for the next year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best animation of the National Film Board. Pojar was a consultant and associate for the great Drrouin. If you like the trunk you will see "Night Angel". <br /> <br /> The symbol is obvious, but it is used extensively. Opponents of beauty and life (plants) oppose the glove hand with no name. Despite the lack of political programs, the hero of the poor puppet was condemned. <br /> <br /> What I thought most was the feeling of torture in decoration. Where the action takes place in the small rooms of the character's entire world. A complete violation of the world by attack by hand. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and hunting movie. I found a copy of this transcriptor and other wonderful shorts in public libraries and showed it to my own kids. A must see.
