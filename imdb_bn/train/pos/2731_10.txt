Sorry, I do not have much time to write. I'm not a psychologist but have been known for 25 years. He said, Scott Wilson has uniquely portrayed a social way (a conscience). I agree! He also said that Robert Black has portrayed a person with anger and emotion control, who had a conscience but could not control himself wildly. I agree! What a cool and extraordinary film. I've seen more than 2000 films and ranked it at the top 100. Friends in my lifetime are regularly dealing with such clients. My only criticism was promotional description at the end of the movie. Many people are less likely to be in ideal situations, but only one in 100,000 will behave like these two people.
