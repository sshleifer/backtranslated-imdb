I managed to see this classic for the first time only a few weeks ago. Almost 30 years ago, scary moments would have changed. Boy i was wrong There are some great moments sent shivers down my spine. Even the performers were fantastic, jammy Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was fantastic. <br /> <br /> It can be rather slow at the downside, but once it is not going to shut it off. This creates all copies, for example. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scrum look very tame. I can not really say that it is the best of the centenary because I have not seen so many of them, only I can remember Stahman (I think he did it). Halloween Crash of Horror Sequences.
