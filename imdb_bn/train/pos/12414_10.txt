Renee Harleen's first American film is the best one of the best ("Death House" or "The Chair") films like Jail-set Horror in the late 80's. One year ago, Guard Lane Smith executed a wrongly condemned person. Now, he is a new re-open prison warden, and the human spirit has returned to bloody retaliation. This atmospheric and very Moody movie contains a lot of horrific roar and violence. Vigo Martensen, Tony Lever, Tom Evertt and Why Holder. Directly for entertainment killings.
