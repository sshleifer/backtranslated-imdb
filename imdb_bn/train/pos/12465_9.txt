I definitely recommend reading the book before watching the film. This book won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and it is a very secret reading (not intentional). It's not so hard to read who do not read there so do not be afraid! This book captures the emotion of the relationship more than the movie, and the film will be more knowledgeable after reading the film. After growing up in Melbourne, I could really relate to this book and the movie. Australian women writers were rarely close to 70, so during this era or class, very rarely documented about the way of life for women in an urban city in Australia. This is a valuable part of Melbourne history. It is shameful that it records something like soft pornography of the 80's. It is far away and another critic mentioned that please do not read the DVD jacket, it does not represent the film in any way. Those who hire this movie based on this story will be disappointed only. Remember that this movie was made in 1982, so do not expect this day to be a Hollywood dramatization, which they seem to include this day. What do I like about this In this introduction it looks very nice to Niehe Hahahurst, she is very nice as Naura and it really is very pleased to see her acting because if you are close to my age, then you remember her for Playschool and her better home and garden stints. Who knew this genius? This movie will give you a whole new impression. A classic Australian story!
