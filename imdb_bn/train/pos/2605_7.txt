This is a sensitive story of the relationship between two families and each family in Israel. Each family has a gay boy. The stories are absolutely related to that time, but this movie is not only about two children, but all members of the family. Each portrait of the family members is well-drawn in both families and the story is consistently attractive with some surprises.
