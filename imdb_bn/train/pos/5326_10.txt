"Beatle of the Beatles", as a US television movie released in the fall of 1979, is actually the best movie that tells the story of four leaders of Liverpool, which has revolutionized the music industry and the world. Beatle Peat has been told from the perspective of Best. The entire cast performance is great, but most of the time, John Lennon and Paul McCartney as the greatest performance by Rod Calvertton as Stephen McKenner. The film is produced by a legend of the Rock and Roll era, Mr. Dick Clark. In 1978, who made another TV movie a year ago, which has played the role of "Kurt Roussele" acting time in the main role of another musical legend; 'Elvis' The film was directed by an unknown director named "John Carpenter" who went on to manage other successful films; "Halloween", "Exemption from New York", and "Thing". The same can be said for the "Beatles birth" director Mr. Richard Murkond. He goes for direct management among many other theater blockbusters such as "Star Wars of the Jaddy", "Id of the Need", and "Jagga Edge". One of the other stories I know of Fack Four is the back-end, which was released in theaters in 1994. However, critics did not take care of it or even did it for the public, because it was not long in life in the theater. Beatles' birth is a very charming and simplified film that gives you the beginning of the legend and the strife and hardships they have overcome and reached the top of success after reaching NYC, and in 1964 Ed Sullivan introduced you to the show. . I highly recommend this film.
