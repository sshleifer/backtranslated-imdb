This movie is simply awesome. It was a very sensitive issue and the film was great. This movie has not created any controversy in India (as far as I know) and its publicity was kept low. Initially, I thought that this film is mostly mostly Indian directors and producers mostly sensitive and even though it adds a love story to the main story and destroys the whole thing, but most of the time is wasted ... Most Indian visitors agree on this, if they are Ashok Remember, Mangal Pandey, Elk etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If it does Calculate but I would like to thank Anil Kapoor (Producer) and Firoz Abbas Khan (Director). Making such a great movie ..
