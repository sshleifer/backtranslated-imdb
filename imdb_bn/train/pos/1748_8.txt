From very early I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is probably the most funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my pride this September. <br /> <br /> Every element of this film came together so beautiful. It often does not see a movie with so many sex, gay, and ethnic jokes so much appreciated by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast sensationally provide each raunchy joke. Carroll is sweet throughout the whole movie, from the end of the film, you can get more routines to achieve her relationship success. Supporting cast is brutal, everybody has some problems with women. <br /> <br /> One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes. This makes a movie fondly easy to remember. This movie will often be raised when the words "chest candle" and "condom" are mentioned in the conversation. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see how many people were there to see it in the theater. I saw four middle-60 women came in a group. In spite of the old audience, the film still laughs to the whole theater. <br /> <br /> I think people like this office and Steve Carroll will love it. Many curiosity reminds me of the kind of joke I want to see in a family. The film is still shallow enough for teenage years and still sweet and cute for middle-aged women. <br /> <br /> If I do not go to this movie, then you will not recommend going to this movie if you're not easily hurt. However, when you are in the movie, remember that this movie is all good humor. Jokes are "gay not a joke", they just joke And they're funny.
