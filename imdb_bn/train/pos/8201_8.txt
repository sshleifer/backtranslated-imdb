Suddenly, the Impact was considered an artistic failure of Eastwood during his career when he established a good reputation as a director. The reason seems to draw attention to the fact that it does not support the film, but it seems to support it. In some places it is actually more than the Death Wish than the original Dante Harry. If someone can do that, it can be delayed - a movie about crime, justice and punishment at the end of the day. For me, at the end of the day it is more sympathetic than sympathy. However, in view of all these arguments, it suddenly ignores that the effect is a wildly-produced film. "Proceed to the front, create my day view", it is symbolic but not original. But zooming through the air to San Francisco City scenes. The first 15 or 20 minutes is quite spectacular. Or the character of Sourav lock visited his mentally ill sister in the hospital where the brightly-watched view of the scene. The easiest way to mix the face of the bowl of the EastWu. So all Sudden Impact is a very visual film that really looks like how Eastwood turned into a director. And if I remember correctly, then for the first time, Eastwood kept screening in an action film of controversial ideology. Also, I think it is the first good film directed by Eastwood. Although Eastwood has lots of talent as director, the drama always has its weak points (see Play Misty for me, Breezy etc.) in the story space, the visual elements are well integrated into the film and not confusing to the story. The only thing that is really annoying is farting dogs.
