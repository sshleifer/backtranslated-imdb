A brilliant young man who was brave and brave to create a little romance film (Can I really say that? - This will call on Satan from his fans) for a small budget but just for taste, sensitivity and completely adult. Peter Sollet - You deserve more respect and respect. Thanks again for showing the "power" of the industry which can put stereotypes down the toilet. One position, rich character, low budget, good acting (and very amateur), suitable lighting - worshipers of the true indie movie look like this and stop watching ... well ... you know what
