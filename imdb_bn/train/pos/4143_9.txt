No, I'm not kidding. You sometimes have the opportunity to see this movie, as well. If you need to cut your arm to see it, see it. It's valuable. <br /> <br /> Fatty Drives Bus is different than any other movie. It takes a trash movie and elevates it at a work of art. Iowa has poor access to public access, stupid characters, bad conversations, strange acting and painting, although it has actually succeeded in achieving its goal as a movie. It's the most inferior, weird you've ever seen, strive to be the most perfect movie. And the boy is ever successful. <br /> <br /> I will set up a plot for those who think about these things for you (filmmakers are not clearly), but you do not have to pay too much attention. The plot of the whole film is presented in a very long part before the opening credits. In any case, FDTB (its supporters call it) is a Chicago-based bus travel story by Chicago. You see, Jesus is in the city and all the passengers of the bus must die and all their souls go to hell, except in the city, without the Jesus of hell, the barricades were closed, and this made them jealous of Satan. Well, he does not like to look like a fool in front of the public, so he agrees to get people to live on his bus directly to sign his soul, but he is a devil, so he needs to disguise himself, otherwise, who will go with him, so he himself Roger makes the camouflage and he goes to the bus, where never mentioned by the driver's name, but he is fat, so I guess that I have no fatty acids. Bus (and riders) on the road to frustration! <br /> <br /> Some manuscript examples: Repeats the title screen 3 times. I do not know why. Except for a character's explanation or role, it is displayed during travel times and sometimes others sit next to them, and they are not related to him, as it is not related to him. I do not know why. Two letters fall between love and exchange chronic glances, that is really the same shot repeated repeatedly. I do not know why. The devil gives a minute long solidarity to become transformed into a human, giving a title card a glimpse of "Satan is going to convert." I do not know why. One character is a woman, who is very clearly dragged into a male, and other characters are referred to as "Glamor's Breedgate". I do not know why <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br />
