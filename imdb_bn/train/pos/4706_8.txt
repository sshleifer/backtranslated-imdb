It sure is not a classic but it's one of the classic lines full. One of my films and I have always quoted and fifteen years later (probably it was once in cinemax!) Michael Keaton is actually the worst actor in this movie - he can not remember how to play it - but he is Who knows how to play this precision, surrounded by superb actors. Are you looking for a movie cheerful? It's renting it with friends - it'll make it even better.
