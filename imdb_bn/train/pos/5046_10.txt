There is such a trash in the cable movie channel that I hit a gem with this. It kept me from the start to the end and was eligible for the top marks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Apparently this is the opposite, because the drama starts from the beginning to the stagnant. <br /> <br /> and there is not a moment in the film when there is no completely unnecessary or inadequate sub-way in any way completely submerged. Plot, and script first class. <br /> <br /> All the actors, especially the lead child actor, who are completely credible. <br /> <br /> This image is just as good as 'silence of Lambs'.
