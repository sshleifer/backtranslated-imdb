In 1990, the world of Disney TV cartoons was essentially its head. Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers, Dickels and Gammi Bears were already popular and now Disney has produced another great cartoon and the cartoon was born in Disney Weekend. That is called the cartoon TaleSpin. This is the land of the old forest book, getting jobs in the business of the plane due to sand beer. In the series, he will show Kit CloudCoiker, former air pirate and good cloud surfer, business woman Lebka Rebecca Cunningham and his supernatural girl Mali. This series is very interesting and has a large number of spots that you can not understand as a child but realize later in life. It's a cute writing series and it's great to add to your DVD collection. Parents, buy it for your kids, but rather show those awesome nicolodondon cartoons. If you like Telescene, see "Darkwing Doc" and "Gough Troop". Turn it on!
