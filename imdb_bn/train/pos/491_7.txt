Four couples who were already on the stone and would take them to the islands of an island, where they would be tempted by 26 units. The premises of this show was simple, but humiliating and fun. To keep morality out of the window, leave Fox and flutter barbarism. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The best thing about the show is that it does not combine and manipulate each other for cash prizes. This was the desire and temptation, pure and simple and the final examination of the relationship. <br /> <br /> People love to show or hate. It was like a slow motion to see a horrible traffic accident. You do not know you can watch, but you can help but look. There was a lot of drama, eye candy.
