I was literally prepared to hate this movie, so believe me when I say that the film looks valuable. Overall, stories and gags are compiled, but the film has elegance and skill to attract them. Jason Lee thinks that he is crazy, and his boss / future father-in-law and colleagues do not try to poke him, he is not very intelligent, but it has sent me to fury of laughter. The film's Gaga is very low, but they smile at me. I said, the charm and charm of the film can go a long way. <br /> <br /> letter is very liked. I must say I saw James Brolin's character because he was hiding in a few scenes. Plus, I appreciate any romantic comedy in which the character of the wife does not act as the barrier between the plot) a total witch. The character of Selma Blair is probably unlikely, and there is no such scenario where I used to think myself, "Why would she want to get married in the first place?" The end is Hollywood-Is, but it can be a lot more surprising. <br /> <br /> Cast Gifters I have no favorable view of Jason Lee's mainstream work. I love him very much in Kevin Smith's film that I could not help but feel frustrated to see him in these doping roles. And he does not look comfortable in this dopey role. Even in this film, he does not look quite comfortable, but he contributes himself to two cents and effectively handles each scene. But I still miss her work in independent films. Julia Stilus again proves why she is so favorite. Of course, he is a very nice girl with a bright smile who wants to fade me, but he seems to have a unique charm and has good personality. In other words, its beauty looks inside and outside. I do not know the names of actresses, but the ladies who play drunken granddaughter are ridiculous. Julie Haggerty has a small part, and she's always enjoyable to watch, which makes me want to get a better role. I like him much "flying" and "losing in America" ​​that he is not ashamed to have the same opportunity to throw his skills. <br /> <br /> Do not stop terrible trailers and even more awesome box office records. This is a fun, charming film. Romantic comedy is becoming increasingly expected nowadays that the style is ready to break, so all of these bad apples are always there to look good. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
