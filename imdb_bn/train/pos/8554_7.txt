Wow, this was another good spin of the original American Pie, the band is not as good as the camp, but certainly much better than the nude mile. Diet and Eric Stefler manage this comedy, but I really like this conversation in the nude mile. This script was very well written and the comedy was flowing more smoothly, but most comedy came from sex, but it is okay because we see these movies correctly? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, /> <br /> The movie was a significant improvement in my opinion compared to the naked miles, if you liked a previous American pie, The room will be chosen, until you see all the waste of American pie spin-offs.
