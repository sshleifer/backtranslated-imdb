Boys are working outside a recording studio when they hear "an angel's voice". Miss Van Doreen, Audition and Miss Andrews, because his father did not approve him as a "radio singer". However, she hopes, a big wig, Mrs. Buxby, a friend of her father will take her rent, and then she will have to give her approval. <br /> <br /> She goes, but the boys are running within a few minutes after the recording session is destroyed, and creates violence in the studio and Amok to kill other musicians. Finally things calm down. "Whew, we eluded them," said Md. <br /> <br /> The boy is stupid around the studio, puts a record of Miss Van Doorne and chooses to wear women's clothing clothes and sing songs. Mrs. Bixby walked in, imprinted and rented "Sirness Cucacha" at the spot! For the extra $ 500, he told to sing for his high society society to come in the night. The rest, as they say, as the history pose to be an opera singer with some fun results in the quail as history. Oh, however, he was with "Senior Muncho" and "Senior Gusto" <br /> <br /> What happens in the party only really wins, but not just before some violent antics. All, a pretty good episode. I enjoyed it but it will not rate as something special.
