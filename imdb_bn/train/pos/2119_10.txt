One of the best films of "The Store of the Corner" director Ernest LÃ¼bitz In addition to the genius of James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan, it is filled with a terrific cast of top characters like Frank Morgan and Felix Brassart. They are the kind of characters acting in the heart of Hello. Actually, the film is not a Hollywood movie. (The creator of "You've Got" claims their film a rebuilding, but it's only a lot of spontaneous spontaneous praise.) However, if you have affection for the romantic comedies of 1940, then you will find "shop near the corner", something amazing would be small. Well with the repeat view as well. Enjoy!
