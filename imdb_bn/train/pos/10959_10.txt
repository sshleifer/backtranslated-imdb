What I can say is that if you do not fall in love with Big and Little Adi, then you are not a man! Even after seeing it for the first time, I was blurry. It's a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe, I'm sure other fans will have to verify. After watching this, you will not cry for this playwright and remember us again. At least we have the gray garden! I think we all took the two women with great freedom. Although I have always congratulated Jackie Onassis Kennedy, he will not keep your heart like Big and Little Adie. Such a man knows a rare behavior; I was just my wish!
