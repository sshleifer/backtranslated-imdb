This film works on one of the most serious geriatric diseases among the elderly. As soon as Alzheimer's or those who are in a constructive phase face many families facing them, I will advise that every health care professional will recommend this film to any of the family members of the disease. The film is primarily designed to communicate with the patient's family and reach the very heart of struggle. Casting Excellent and dramatic screenplay is outstanding with a very commanding plot line.
