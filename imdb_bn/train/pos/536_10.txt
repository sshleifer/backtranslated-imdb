After some 60 years, some films may be seen, but it remains as stubborn as this. Technical progress does not date this classic love story. The special effects used are extraordinary for a 1946 movie. Acting fantastic David Kniven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Lively did a great job. The use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the film. It has not been seen on television for 20 years, so few people are aware of its existence. It's always my favorite movie. For many years this film is waiting for the DVD release and it is expected that "life and death are a matter".
