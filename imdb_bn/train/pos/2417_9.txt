"Going Bershkake" is actually one of the most fun candy movies I ever see. Of course, this is a low budget, but it's a non-stop comedic tour de force. There are memorable coat tons. For example, when her father-in-law asks him how much he earns, candy says, "Oh, I can move somewhere between thirty to eleven thousand dollars a year, sir." Oh course, candy's delivery that sells it. Just the classic stuff. Eugene Levie turns into a ridiculous performance as a sleazy film-maker. Its clumsy low budget movie "Kung Fu You" will be rolling you in a clip. <br /> <br /> So if you're a candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem, I can not make enough recommendation to this movie.
