I saw a trailer for Afro campaigning for the film trailer collection for Afro-American composite films. It looked like it; A very trendy "mad" comedy where a brighter black man can understand that his son is gay. It seems that the Reddys Fox (RF) wife left him for his brother, who worked with him in "Store" behind Phoenix. He took the bus to see his son, Norman, in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> So come RF, Norman Powder-blue bikini shorts, but do not wear anything, came out under the water to answer the door. On what seems to be on the 60th floor, her old father is trying to buy time with stairs, Norman tries to wake her boyfriend, who refuses to be firmly annoyed. That's exactly where I wrote "Why does not he wake up?" When he suddenly came, and for me and my friend's jaws for the first time, such as blue eyes, horse-hair garners, Norman's white live-in boyfriend was presented with our first light, which is the only "maximum" dream dream? "Gerson is a kind of burning queen that can only be imagined to be spoken from 1976. She has a garment and a purse and bigskunkt jewelry, and it seems that from the Brady bunch, Carole Brady has made both models of her appearance and personality. <Br / <br /> Norman asks her boyfriend to find somewhere else during her father's trip. Gerson is going to be with Waylon Flowers, and Norman calls the phone when he calls. <br /> <br /> So RF tried to reach Mexico, he is in the phone, Gerson came to pack his dress and RF tackled him. An explosion of 70 exploded soul music. The revelation was meant to be revealed (but we are listening to a very special track by feeling), he realizes that his son is gay. <br /> <br /> His first emotion is "I The kill. I'll kill him. "Then the RF goes on a long walk, where he is thinking of a distraught parent-mother cycle through all the thoughts, such as" Maybe we train him soon. "His thoughts are all inspired by what he sees in his walk. That is, for example, an intelligent truck driver is just as thinking about a real man. Surprisingly, he is in a book Go to the store and buy eight books about homosexuality, it should be said, eight books on homosexuality than buying my parents. Then he goes straight to a park bench and read them all! <br /> <br /> RFF Cleopatra Jones Six feet amassed by Tamara Dobson employed the prostitute Odder (this amazing luncheon thing). For Norman, he has appointed him to try for neutrality. Lane, but it crushes Norman and storms to stay with his friend Melody. <br /> <br /> Then Gerson offered to get RF for the night. He decided to defeat RF's wife, and told the story of his mother, who Maintained unreasonable barriers against Pilipinos because "he had been persecuted in a lauvette." They were in Wayne and Madam Tired performance, which disrupts his head against piano until Madame's hair is loose. Once, there was mug face. <br /> <br /> It seems, just do not tell it, RF and Gerson have a big evening together! You see, staid, traditional old black men have to see the crappy, highly effeminated entertainment of the Magna queens so that just to be offered to gay world! It really is that easy! This is still "wrap!" Do not resist RF from yelling! When Gerson wakes him from a bad dream. It ends less predictably than you think. <br /> <br /> There was a lot that was off. What is the basis of Norman and Gerson's relationship? They do not seem to have any relationship, and Normon has no qualms about kicking Gerson, and even while standing up, he does not protect Gerson or talk about their relationship. There were some beautiful sweet touches like RF, who bought these books with homosexuality - ?? And sitting in the park bench for their reading! I like the opinion that a parent will try to find something about homosexuality, rather than getting drunk or compromising with his friends. Even more than that, it seems like: A slight adoption of a pre-era, some gay men in an era think that if straight people sit straight and see Magnit Performance, we all love each other and understand Can learn! And due to the complete arrogance of this thing, extreme stereootipes and message-driven conversations have ended very nicely and in the last 30 years there has been a lot of blame for discussions about how things have changed for change. I guess the only thing seems obnoxious is that the ladies of the game are extremely cruel in their love for friends, and are willing to get drunk for them to sleep, and transform them elaborately. <br /> <br /> ------ Hey, look at Cinema's Day Murda, Bad and Chasey films on my website (some good movies have been thrown).
