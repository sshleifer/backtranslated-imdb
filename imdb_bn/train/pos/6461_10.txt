At first I was caught safely by the film's first lyric and then I became fully enchanted with the manifested story and engrossed with the bright guidance. Characters were not fully developed, not bigger than life, but we live in anywhere in the world, in Sweden, in Turkey or in the United States, in the same way, friendship and ambition with all the completely dependable people. Hollywood can learn a lot from this beautiful film. It shows that there is no need for every little detail behind every step to make the whole theme clean and bright, and it shows the brightness of the director! Kayfelt Kay Pollak Thanks and throw awesome for this fantastic job !!
