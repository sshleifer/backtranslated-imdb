I liked the idea of ​​this picture that at the moment I saw a trailer for it. Einstein was always one of my heroes and his film was modest, playful, and quite a bit crazy to watch me film. The torch added to Matthur as Einstein makes it even better. <br /> <br /> The story is pure fantasy, but a delightful one. An individual mechanic fell in love with a beautiful woman, who became Einstein's nephew. With the help of four Fair Godfathers of Physics, Ed Catherine began a search to win the heart. An eerie fiancé (the worst example of those experimental experimental psychology) and mix in Eisenhower, and you have pure fun. [<br /> <br /> <br /> The picture is filled with great character actors and lovely sweet and daffy performances. Walter Matthew plays Einstein as a rogue IP; Cupid with a slide rule Ed and Meg Ryan play one step away from his normal Rome-low level, Tim Robbins is nicely respectable. Stefan Fry as a joy "RRRatman" and Ryan's fiancé; There is a romantic bone lacking in her body. <br /> <br /> The film has fallen under most radars, but it is a delightful treasure that does not fully grow with a repetitive philosophy. This is the first rate writing and performance features and a gentle behavior less than gentle world.
