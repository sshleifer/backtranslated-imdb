I found that it was the first of the Panhei films, at the Melbourne Film Festival. She was completely absorbed by various characters created and how they react differently and compared to children's kids and how similar to other layers behave. I think if more people see such films, they can see people as individuals and avoid racism which can often be ignored by unknown fears. There are obvious big political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture, but I found a more subtle difference between the characters that this film has swollen so successfully, very impressive. I think that the characters have idiosyncrasies, so unique I made letters to see it in characters.
