In this movie my breathing a bit, I like it easily! <br /> <br /> I acknowledged that the character's dialogue and story could have been better edited, but hey, this is a common drug (small story) that is trying to kill a dragon, there is nothing else in it <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> The overall design, atmosphere, beautiful landscapes ... it's all magic! <br /> <br /> They have many love in this film. Character design was great and fun. If you want a bit team Burton-Ish. I can suggest this movie to anyone interested in great design, an easy small, but lovely story to appear.
