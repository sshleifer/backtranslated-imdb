Here's an oddity: A modern day movie of a serial killer, where there is no war scene, no one is dying, no carriage is running, and no high noise ... and it happens in Russia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a very cruel film, and the "Monday" hero (Stephen Ray) personality is well described. Yet, the story is not frustrating and through it it is very interesting <br /> <br /> Ray, rated as the best, deceived detective. Jeffrey DeMunn as terrible horrible as the killer. Donald Sutherland's Russian accent suspect but he has the only character in this photo that has some warmth. <br /> <br /> Story again, here and there, together with two references, bias against contradiction, total legality of secular psychology, police and government officials are barbarous / unpaid / big, jad, jad, jadha. <br /> <br /> This is an intelligent and self-deliberately low-key crime film. This is something extraordinary that is probably not well known but people who have seen it like this. Since it is based on the real life account of this killer, it is even more cool. Do not just pass by this because you do not have anything about it.
