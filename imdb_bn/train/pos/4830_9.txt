Although some reviews are obviously leaking, I've completely provoked the story and even some critics have described the story of love as 'Mills and Boon'. It is good to see warm, sensitive stories of true love during these wicked times. Many of the audiences became silky and tear their eyes unconsciously. You really believe that young Victoria and Albert are in love with each other, for political reasons, it was a marriage arrangement. Although I think Sir John Cono, who was frustrated to control the young queen, probably played just like the pantoomem villain. As it was fierce that he was actually interesting to discover this theory of Victoria's real father (his mother's relationship with Danes of Kent). Emily Blunt is quite confident as a young princess, who was stuck in the palace with palaces and politicians stuck in the palace. He impressively depicted the power of character and firmness, which eventually made Victoria a great queen of England, which had never succeeded under her long-term rule. I believe the word sounds will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.
