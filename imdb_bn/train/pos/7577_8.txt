Who got Gold? (Unfortunately) HanZo The Roger has played the title character of title, titled Katu - multi-weapon expertise, authority-baking souvenir officer, rape rape "unknowingly" from unwilling female informants in the "unique" method. <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> This entry was started with Hanja, a woman "discovered" who is filled with foil bombs filled with gold stolen gold from a fraud Standing as a ghost to guard against corruption. It discovers Hanjo a loan-shark project and an orange ring operated by a blind monk. Required swords and rape - Finalists at a decent finish for this weird trilogy of movies. <br /> <br /> The sunlight (part 2 of the series ...) is not as strong and enjoyable as possible, but Samui is still great for sleaze and Japanese pinky-style film fans. 8/10
