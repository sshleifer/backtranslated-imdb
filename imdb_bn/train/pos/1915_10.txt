This show is horrible. I thought that the two episodes where Paul died were so sad; I actually cried. But other shows were horrible; Kerry was my favorite character, because she was "in the dark direction". I thought that Brigitte was funny because he was all perky. The guy that I played Kyle was really, really cute. When Kerry commented on chaos about everything, I liked it. The man playing Rory was beautiful, and John Rotor managed Paul was really fun. This whole TV show is fun, and they still show it on TV. When they show it on TV, however, I saw it every single time. The next time it shows, I will see it over again.
