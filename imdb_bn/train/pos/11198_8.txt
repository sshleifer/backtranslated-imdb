Hitcock's talent is found in the stunning use of the photo. Almost every shot is filled with the visual symbol. It is particularly noteworthy that he would give a boxer girl to another boxing before marrying. He clearly slides his hand sexually and shows everything necessary to let us know about a simple movement hit. Boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point-of-view shots, which prove how far their hits are in Hitko. The film gives insight into the treatment of his next women. Boxers' wishes are driven by objects and desires, because neither is love nor love.
