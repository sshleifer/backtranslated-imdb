I watched this photo at www.afrovideo.org, one night from Raffe Bakshi (Wizards, Hey Good Lookin ') and I did not see any racist (I'm stupid), I admit the designs of character are strange and unreasonable today, but I think this is a very subtle and old Uncle Rimus Stories, a very urban stylus that has been created in the main characters of Black American culture and "The Baby" and "Brewer's Pac . "These are not the story, you have to think, but also cultural icons made by black Americans, and I am a white woman, and the love story. And I found it an interesting time-capsule scene in the 70's in the Harlem black culture of New York. <br /> <br /> It is good to see the dancing of this movie: This movie is live-action / animated film, which starts from live-action with a colleague named Samson (Barry White) and preacher (Charles Gordon), their friend, Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) who helped escaped from prison, but was barred by a roadblock and the air in a shootout with the police up. While waiting for them, Randy heard the unwilling fellow Pulpie (Scatman Crothers), because he started to call Randie an animated story of Brother Rebitt, who was young young in the big city who quickly began to rule Harlem after being lazy; You know, animal versions of rabbit, beer and fox randy, sumpons and propagators to me. An abstract joke of styled animation and live action footage, the graphic of the film and the ridiculous ridicule of the stereootypes of the 70s? Ethnic, ethnic, and otherwise. <br /> <br /> However, this is another good movie; And should we shade like this under the hole? Do not pretend they exist? Hmmm ... I feel ashamed; I think we should add these movies and then we will have to learn what is going to happen, since then we are far away.
