Adam Jones has a brilliant sense of humor. I do not like anything about this image. Cross-eyed was shot nicely. Adam is a great job, not only developing major characters, but developing small letters. <br /> <br /> There are cross-eyed people who hope every low budget movie. That does not have to cost you a lot to create something to watch. There is some choice for everyone. You've got a terrible roommate. If you have ever picked up on a dork of high school If you have ever parked anywhere in the city. If you have any kind of humor, then you love this movie. This is a type of movie that will last for a long time and Adam will end up with the big name for himself once. I look forward to Adam's future project.
