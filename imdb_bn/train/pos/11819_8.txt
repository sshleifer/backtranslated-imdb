Just picked this on DVD and saw it again. I love dark imagery versus bright colors. Not a big Beatty fan, but this is a nice populated movie. Passino is fantastic, always and well, this movie marks the time in which Madonna was her full-time sex worker. I was stuck with the "throttle" look for a while. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, "What about Bob?". The effect of the makeup was then cut and still kept for the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood you transport directly into a comic strip environment. Cars, clothing, buildings, and even street lights and a great tone, not to mention the perfect light, although the red scenes can become a nostalgic, because it shocks a bit. Just got a chance to make a signal to BT. All in all, a few hours of fun.
