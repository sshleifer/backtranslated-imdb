Steve Bike was a black activist who tried to oppose South African-ruled South African opposition, just as Gandhi tried to oppose the colonial rule of the British Empire. Richard Attenborough's film Cree Freedom is not as much about Donald Woods as bioco or racist, as well as the editor of white liberal who tried to tell the biico's story. After the death of a prison bike by torture in the hands of the South African "Police", the film's picture has deviation. Woods managed by Kevin Kain, should choose whether to do the right thing and can run away from the country to publish a book about a bike or permit his wife acting by Penelope Wilton, so that the books can be forgotten and pressured. Vikram died in the afternoon in this regard. After the death of Biko, the numbers crossed the yarn of the border started from the beginning of the friendship of bioco and woods. Oscar nominated Denzel is good in his fourth film, Washington Beecho, but there is some dissonance in a film focusing on a white family trial for more than half of the film, which makes a mistake in a film. Instead of changing the beginning of friendship with Beto Woods, Attner could have used his subject better. Perhaps a black actor playing a major role in the 21st-hour film was not suitable for the big box office, but the film was flopped in any way by box office. On one side of film politics, the film is still entertaining and in PG-sanitized fashion, although a message or two sends. *** big 4
