What is this a great gem It's a fun story to watch that's fun. Yes, it's singing, but it's very well-made in the story and very gentle to hear. It was so pleasant to see; I enjoyed it from the beginning! <br /> <br /> This movie was held in England during World War II. It is a beginner witch who needs him to search for a missing part of a spell. She uses her rough "magic" to take care of her and 3 children in different destinations to find her. They joined the teacher of his correspondent, who were surprised to learn that the education from his school actually works! <br /> <br /> While special effects can appear first in a short time, once you use them, they will become part of this movie's kiss. Actually, the film won Oscars for these effects! <br /> <br /> The movie is not harmless and fun - and it's not difficult to pick protected songs. The characters are amazingly interesting to see. I think anyone can find something about this movie at any age.
