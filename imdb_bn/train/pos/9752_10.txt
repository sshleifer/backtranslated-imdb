When I was officially 3 years old, my parents accidentally pressed with a few cartoons in a few seconds. Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since then I realized better, then I thought it was a good film. Just a few weeks ago (June 2006) when I discovered the fast forward, it was thanks to some internet articles / video clips and it is not the same movie. I'm sure it's still good with kids, but we have got 20-30 things to get it "Coolat Status" on top of it. It's a shame that the original production went through a painful process; If Fox gives it enough time, it will probably be more recognizable in the eyes of the public. Perhaps if they can rebuild it completely with different stories, and it may be all the star's voice, then Fox has to decide. I'm rambling here, I know. I still think it's a great film, but it can be better than great.
