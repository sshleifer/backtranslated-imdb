This "upcoming movie" film works with the experience of two young Danny and Maureen, as they will learn about life and love a lucky summer. <br /> <br /> This film never made a false note, directed by Robert Muligan, "A Mockingbird to Kill Fellow," famous for his extraordinary work. All acting fantastic As Danny, Reese Witherspoon makes a stunning film debut. Looking at this beautiful photography and well-directed and edited film, I felt that I was looking at a window rather than showing a movie. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie at least 5 times and can tell the truth that it is one of the best movies of all time about young people, in love, and young adults who are going through the feelings, challenges and changes. Between 10 and 15, the children's families will meet it together and use it as part of the discussion, because it is about siblings competence, how to deal with love, how to deal with parental responsibilities, etc.
