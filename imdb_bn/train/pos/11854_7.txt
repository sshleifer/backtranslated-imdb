I agree with "Jerry". If I remember correctly, this is a very partial space film (of course, not how low budget is?), But 2001 is a diversification of the mystery (but "rip off"), because the spatial controlling computer was actually a man It was turned into a computer in some way. And like HLA, they tried to disconnect their "mind" connection, but not with its mechanical parts, and like HL, it also created disasters. There's at least a fun moment. When Christopher Kerry's character finds no food, the abandoned pet bird finds it, there is a kind of harmful moment, but still there will be no obvious thing.
