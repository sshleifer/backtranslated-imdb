It's difficult for me to criticize the Matizi Captor of anything. She just radiates beauty and grace on the screen and is an amazing actress. Whereas, yes, the plot was predictable. I think that if Richard could sleep with Jill Hadda, he might have been a little crazy than that, adding more to suspense. Jill and her husband might have liked Richard's little problem with his ex-wife, perhaps a little more story. I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie. I liked seeing Jake's death more likely to stop, and perhaps close his husband. Although I have to say, I will never be able to see a fireplace gun and take a picture standing there. It was a very suitable end for Richard. Of course, Mike Rokade! So I look forward to his future project.
