If you enjoy fine (yes, I'm fine) action and John Candy's responses, you can not like this picture (pronounced "Filam" by Salvatore DiPasquale). The untiring (and unidentified) observers always watched Candy as an elaborate actor - a big buffoon. And sometimes he was (see "stripes" and "splash"). However, when the opportunity is given, he can really be razor sharp and quite fine. It is very bad that he had played such a wide role which showed only his broad side, because we would never see him again. Oh, yes, movies. You can see "Going Barker" over the over (I know I have) with the frequency of "Cadence". It's just that good. The plot, though a little slowly, is actually fairly deep for such a French. It's candy and always allows low-rating joe florawy and Eugene Levi to bounce from the candy ... and they bounce hard. The price is definitely worth a look for everyone who enjoys other activities of SCTV or Candy.
