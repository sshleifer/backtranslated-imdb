Just good writing, directed and played ... Woody's best is not its best after the 80's of 2000 !! Hugh Jackman was the perfect pick for his roll. Scarlett Johansson's rebel has proved that she has become an actress. <br /> <br /> It refreshes the leading lady with no romance on the screen. She plays the perfect bumbling magician. <br /> <br /> This movie has been a few reviews of maligning. Do not let them stop you seeing the wonderful movie. I saw people in the crowd that I could laugh so loudly in some lines that I missed the next line. If you like the 70's Woody Allen movies, you will regret this absence. <br /> <br /> I suggest you watch this film with an open mind, if you do, you can laugh.
