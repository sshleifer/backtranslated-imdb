For the first time I saw this episode that I had a shock, it was really the first time "24". Speed ​​things are amazing, and it's very surprising, exciting and even interesting, it's almost as if you're reading a book; Once you start it, it's very hard to stop. Jack was secretly talking to Richard Walsh that there was a joke between his CTU, I was sitting for 6:40 hours, which means 10 episodes !!! (It sounds funny and crazy, but I'm such a person, when he is interested, he can not stop) This series is the best of the seratom. And it is built in a way of having a few different stories that are being linked together. Recommend every way!
