Series 1 <br /> <br /> The UK's 'Lost' is looking forward to launch two series in series, the series one (which has been shown here) is not frustrating. <br /> <br /> Forty passengers fought to fight after the crash of their aircraft - landed on a secluded island. They pray for salvation. However, the days are turned into weeks, and the living expanses the rainforest around them, they start thinking that they are alone. <br /> <br /> Of course, after the series is explosive, it is difficult to speed up speed. Pilot Episodes, which is a gray cat on the island, a monster creature and others are at risk of becoming potential. However, after series itself, after the selection of the series itself and outstanding by the final episode. Perhaps the most thing about 'Lost' is that before we crash a series of flashbacks, we visit every character's life. This gives us more insight and, therefore, events appear as open and excited. <br /> <br /> Finally, this show is an extraordinary mix of drama, mystery and supernatural; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, 'Lost', series 2 started with our heroes, which spread to the deepest depth of the heart. They have jobs who discover a mysterious man. Meanwhile, Michael and Saiyar struggled to deal with what happened on the streets. <br /> <br /> With the progress of the series, viewers will be unable to turn off their television set, like every episode the series has more twists than the Curly-Wurley Chocolate Bar, which introduces the full host of a new character. Five brand new wooden works came out of the solution with the mystery of the mystery. After the 974th Plot Twist in this series, it finally sank to the viewer whether the survivors left the island for the plane crash, it does not really matter. However, despite the anti-climatic ending, that stunning series gives more than half the answers to the questions of the end.
