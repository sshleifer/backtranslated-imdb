I'm going to say I'm not going to say lightly. I have seen many movies and have reviewed them a great deal in print. So when I tell you that the only funny scene I've ever seen in this movie in a movie, you might want to listen to me. There are many diversity of opinions as it makes this incredibly stupid movie such as amusing. And those just do not get, well, I can not blame them, too. The scene that I say comes in the 30-minute mark and adds a dead body to John Kandy. To that point, I found the movie to be ignorant, confusing and it started to lose me. When this scene came, I laugh a lot, I know my pants. No movie ever made me that before. When the project begins, "Going Barshak" is supposed to be a SCTV film. I remember it being announced. When the time was over, John Candy, Joe Flawworthy and Eugene Levi were cast. Universal must have a regime, when it is being shot, because after release it was shown in almost zero theater. During this second time, I heard the theme song (which is not how much the plot can be understood in the song), reducing my logical nervousness and determining what is happening. In addition to the above mentioned routine, there are many ridiculous views to recommend for "Going Barksark". This is about 3 stugs flick, without much fun. Director David Steinberg's razor has a sharp time, and he will smile all through this. As Candy, who originally charged here, he has never been funnier. All the plot comes out through the device and interpretive window windows, it's a wild run. Flahherty and Levi follow him continually. There is a plot, but it was a plot like "Plant House", a plot, and yes, the script is uneven, and a little slow at the beginning. Once you know it once, you can fully appreciate that the SCTV style transpires that crabsiness. It's stupid, but stupid at purpose, and you need to remember when you see it. Check it out, and discover for yourself, if it has the most fun scene of all time.
