I think this movie was seen in the 1950s or 60s on TV on Saturday afternoon. It was well presented but it was kept in mind that the last human death for release was a message of hope from the hidden transmitters in the lamp. I'm sure squares with events <br /> <br /> Still the film is made well. The German High Command sensitively reports that "Russians are moving ahead of Fred Strauss" as everyone went according to plan. <br /> <br /> It was my impression that this movie and later Americans were based on Hitler's last days, based on the accounts of British historian Trevor-Roder, created for the design of TV. I was surprised to see Trevor-Roder's credit. <br /> <br /> I presented Danplol as a classic as well. The American Knock was a little flat. <br /> <br /> Some of the images have attracted much attention from the movie as Adolf. Yet, I find it interesting that many movies and books that Hitler's double ambiguity have been inherent to pass in John Johnland's great historical piece. <br /> <br /> Was the jigsaws?
