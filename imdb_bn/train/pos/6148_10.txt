In the memory of David Thompson (1917-2000) <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time when I was 4 years old and I was fascinated by this story drowned in World War II. The scene, which affected me the most, was the fight between the Nazi soldiers and the medieval army. The army was extraordinary to watch the singing of the wonderful songs, except for the body walk. This movie is fantastic, from Portobale Road travel (which became the most beautiful place in London) on the way to Nagambut. Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson are really a fantastic couple He is always great, it seems to be a good aunt of family and David is always his great co-hero of his wonderful face. We'll miss him a lot.
