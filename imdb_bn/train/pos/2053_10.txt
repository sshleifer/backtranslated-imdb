Firstly I want to tell this film that Haloid cooked from his heart is more rawked than the recent punk no. MacBein is a true action film with more violence than most viewers can handle. It has all the classic elements of the 90's performances in the late 80's. It is the unpredictable humorous work of handsets (ie, when the Walken and crew face to face the drug dealer, they see and kill them, rather than saving their money and taking their money. ), Snaping of the neck, the people in the fire, the buildings are closed, and of course fire People stopped bhabanagulike burned. Waken has provided the best remembrance line in this movie, "Come on let's date .........." And others want to buy this film as the top of the local video store clearance rack. If you have bloodshed for your unprotected irregular work, rent this movie today and fill your thirst.
