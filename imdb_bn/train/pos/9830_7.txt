Nobody really understands the reason behind Italian zombie-flick's numbering, but ?? Really ?? Why would we be disturbed? Each single movie of Zombi- "Series" supplies great fun, nasty cows and inefficient flashlight, and "Zombi 3" does not make this exception, despite all the production problems that happened during the shooting. The film started as an interesting Lucie Florisi project, which had to be explained in more detail with its "Zombi 2" success, but it ended up with more errors and stolen concepts from previous films as a special Bruno Masheri product. The playplay is frustrating and ignores the continuity of all kinds, at George A. Each impressive idea of ​​Romero's "Night of Living Dead" and "The Cruises" is repetitious here, and it is sad and painful to really see the performance of the performances. Yet all this did not bother me for a moment, because the glorious over-the-top Gore compensates everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, scientists have completed the "Death One" bacterial warfare virus and prepared it for transport. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, a contagious dead body of a terrorist is buried and nearby Zambi-Ashe pollutes the entire population of the village. The last group of survivors was a hyperactive and inhalant strong zombie as well as soldiers had to fight in white chocolates, which ordered to kill everything that went to the polluted area. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenny's "City of Nightmares". Really bad ... many incredible action sequences and incredibly entertaining with many creative zombie-madness situations Unwanted birds were originally, for example, and in the solitary hospital the whole zombie was born well with the order of birth. The notorious Flying Head Scene is not nearly as horrible as it is made and it is perfectly suited to this delicious and thoroughly Italian Jamby Flick. Recommended for supporters; Do not miss negative reviews.
