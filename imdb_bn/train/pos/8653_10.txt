I saw this for the first time in July 2001, since I saw "calorine" in the first ever showbread. You might think that with the recent wave of serial killer movies, some of the previous films of "kelifailer" are not worthy of mention but are not. Perhaps this movie was released sometime from 1996-1999, perhaps it could be more successful. In my opinion, "California" is much different than most serial killer films released in the late 1990's. Most of today's serial killer films are almost entirely different from "seven" or "bone collectors". Many series of killer films have shown a killer but the person is always behind the mask or we do not look enough to know enough about them. "California" is a film that actually tries to break that barrier and actually feels guilty. It tries to answer the question, "Why do they do what they are doing, are they due to some of the events of the past, do they feel superior or stronger, or do they do this because they love the thrill of murder?" "There are some things that try to answer, that we find out something for ourselves and leave the room to think. Brad Pitt makes a lasting impression as early Grayce. When we first meet Early at the beginning of the first film, we see that he must be a boring person. When we first saw him, late at night. It is initially drunk. Then we saw him raising a rock, threw it out of a bridge, and then it fell into a moving vehicle windshield. Pete is awesome in this film. Always good to see him when he plays psychos or really bad people It is interesting that it will then run a true loon like "12 monkeys" and he will be at the other end of the David Fuancer "Seven" spectrum.
