Spoiler for anyone that is lucky enough to see this film (so after all really spoiler). I have seen this picture while being released and can still remember some parts of it. This is in the west of a small town or the rest of the city. It is similar to a ghost town with few more residents. A couple of them, where the wife is especially evil. At the end of the film, he let his people die and leave the city, but to go to the desert. We do not know what happened next day, but the man after his death shot him and deliberately did not hit him before the water was supplied. She is not aware that she will soon be thirsty. Mark Dammon has killed two bad people in a funny manar - but this is another story, which I do not remember very well. The remaining reminiscence of the film was that for the first time I had actually seen a wicked woman in the movie, who pretended to do anything other than the wicked - can not be compared with the 'witch' of Snowwhite, who compares it easy to find out. Very tight west with very original characters and still absorbing.
