Like his previous movie "In a Glass Cage", Auguste Villaranga achieved an intense and highly poetic canvas that is more sophisticated than its predecessor. It is one of the most spectacular and hunting pictures it can sometimes see. The ambitious drama, intensity, and violence are threatened by composers or missiles, but they never take action. In this way, it can drag almost unbelievable achievement: so much and still so much painfully restrained, so much charged and still isolated and even the ultimate eye of the explosives is the eye-catching festive occasions. Unabashed, gorgeous, and highly imaginative ... this image is simply superb!
