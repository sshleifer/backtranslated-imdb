The seven-pound Star Will Smith, an interim motive for meeting with IRS collector agent Ben Thomas, who returned to their tax payments. Thomas made seven people dead while talking on his phone, and tried to try for the film for its proper, irrational, inaccessible crime. <br /> <br /> The line of the story is a fine green house window like a brick. What you are seeing is happening - even the end of the Titanic was even more surprising than seven pounds. Whatever there is no wrapping, there is no confusion or doubt about what is happening. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I usually like Bell Smith if in Bell's mode. While playing a gun, running a Ford GT and whenever he tries to do serious work, the person is his best player while saying "A Hell Nah". To try to achieve Oscar, he comes in a fire effort only, which he is definitely frustrated. For It was probably the main reason that I could not look at the movie, although here she is very different. The flashing comedy but they are subtle, in fact I was the most shadowed Will Smith Smith's performance that was ever seen and that's the reason he should be nominated for a major prize and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> All of the supporting actors were grand - Rosario Dawson looked much more at the door of death, the whole film and Woody Harrison and Barry Pepper were fine as any other bit player. <br /> <br /> Overall it is a cry - but it is not throwing all normal clich√©s and sentimental violins to give you any other option than crying. Even my hard heart was broken several times. You will be given a strong pressure to find out one of the situations that are not related to your own life which makes it even more realistic. <br /> <br /> I'll give it 8/10. Will Smith will move on to the drama without any disappointment of happiness, and look for something better.
