Possible spoilers ********** ************** I saw this film is only one reason and that's because I have a massive crush on Richard Belzer there. I do not know a lot about humor) Some parts were fun and Barbie was like Spuff and Dealer and President Skit. Remember, cook from time to time (dare, I say weird?) It was funny, but it could have been better. Most likely, if they spend more time in humor and wear at least women's clothing, the movie was fun. Some skits just want to joke on you, and cringe, others skits you to smile and think enough to maliciously. Sorry this is the date of the movie. Richard Belzer (if it's valuable) is a crazy crash but it's worth checking out and the Choice Chase.
