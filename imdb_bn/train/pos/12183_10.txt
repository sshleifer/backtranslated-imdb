A reviewer thinks that Wales does not seem to matter what he or she actually says, he runs you. I agree. She was and has a unique strength in the film. A triple threat can work, who can write and direct, he is a unique talent film suitable. Anyone can consider that if he used to do a painting at his earlier age This film certainly reinforces that impression. Is a musician, theater actor, heir to Shakespeare? It's hard to say but I am very grateful for Cam during the film and he has taken him into the film. I like the pronunciation. I like face, size, style, mind and games. I love all his movies and much more. I especially love how the other actor film interacts with her. Many were not well or at least different to him because he was firmly there. Even when his beauty was destroyed, perhaps because of his own will, it was impossible to ignore and he created the scene he saw. Rita was a fantastic blonde - Lanna Turner is similar, but perhaps even the boyfriend and even the eyes go to Wales and one greeting for one minute, another film, another hour of her company. So we all want to cut the scraps we lose from his films because we know, we all know that his part is not worthy for our time. See it and appreciate it for the opportunity.
