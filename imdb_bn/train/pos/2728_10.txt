Just the best one ever! Richard Brooks's adaptation of the rough novel of truman dome is really an artistic success. Stunning black and white cinematography (which will win Oscars), Hunting Quincy Jones scores and fantastic Blake and Robert Wilson's extraordinary performance as murderers. This photo was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and more. When Dulitle was not nominated for the best picture. Go figure! <br /> <br /> Although you do not know the clusters of the book, it is a good decision to give more attention to Perry and Dick and to treat this boy's pain. Down John ForSmith Elvis Davey is also impressive. This one has no errors easily. 10. Best Performance Between 10 = Close second with Scott Wilson and Block Highly recommended!
