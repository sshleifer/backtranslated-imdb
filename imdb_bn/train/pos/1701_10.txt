This is a thinking movie stupid movie. If you do not expect Star Wars and enjoy British humor it can only become a religious classic for me and my wife - Keri Grant and Jack Nicholson's "Voice" is one of the big boons that you can sleep or watch carefully and Can enjoy <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, but if you enjoy simple humor but it takes a quick look at the fun it will enjoy this movie as it slips by you.
