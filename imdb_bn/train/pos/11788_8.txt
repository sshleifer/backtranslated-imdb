I really think these people are taking the wrong approach. After all, I think this little film is very entertaining and interesting. I take it for what it is. I think the mystery on mystery is mysterious and mystery in their mystery. Another thing to catch my fancy was that it was not a clear story, it involved viewers immediately, only hints and punctuation and feelings were played by letters that impress you that it's going to be a story. No one else could do better than Lynch. This is the essence of lynchianism at its best. Of course, I would agree with anyone that the spectators would like to see it without any fantastic work, they would disappoint themselves. And good rights. Lynch is not about that. This aspect of Lynch is not at least. The Lost Highway / Mulholland who helped anyone to help Dr. is completely shaky, and they want to enjoy watching anything they can not just get what they get. My opinion is that the darkened room is involved with your soul-core, your spontaneous nature, that you are spontaneously reacting with money (images, words, situations). It's not about any kind of pleasure, it's about getting a favorable response from you. And, that, my friend, the pure art.
