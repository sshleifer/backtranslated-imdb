Have you ever gone out for a sporting activity, in your life, tried your best, and then found yourself in an important segment, where for a brief moment you were given a chance to become a hero and champion. . . Failed? I believe many of us are in our lives at that moment. The movie's premiere, "The Best of the Times". In this story, a middle-aged banker, whose name is Jack Dandy (Robin Williams) suffers from deep misery of football mistakes, which took place many years ago, it was inspired to play again. . Again To achieve this, he must once again return to the fantastic football quarterback, Reno Hitaway (Cart Russell). For Reno, who is very satisfied with his current life, there is no need to change his past record, which is as good as his age. Their problems are both added year after year and as well, both of their weddings are floundering and re-vampires are needed. His father-in-law (Donald Moffat) is actually not easy to remind him of the biggest drops. Nonetheless, Dundee must constantly try and do the best to try and correct her life. Great fun for anyone willing to enjoy their youth again. ***
