Seeing the film, I was very moody and the film was light, but the end of the film was unexpected, which left my mind long lasting memories. <br /> <br /> The film begins to be obscure and its job is registered at the registrar's wedding. Soha comes for marriage and her boyfriend does not leave Soha alone in the street, she can not return home and in this situation she has nothing to live here, Abahani can be her helper for her. The basis of the story. <br /> <br /> The rest see only and the end of the story is very sweet that you have to face in front of the seat which puts you on the edge of the seat. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dialogues and music are just as good songs as good music and so the screenplay you think is slow, but the movie is all about looking at the claim of the story. <br /> <br /> Especially light mood I enjoyed this house with coke and peanuts. For this my rating is 8/10
