It was a top notch movie with a top notch throw. Danny Glover, Tony Danza, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and especially Christopher Lloyd Engels played this charming movie about the real-life angels of the baseball team. You do not know, it can happen. I like Lloyd's role. He was delighted The story is about encompassing your life, such as Angels' children's anger, anger, harsh, and lazy manager helped Glover to see the best in humans. The film is well-made and has been created to see the best among people and reach your dreams. It was fun, charming, touching, and sad, all very nicely done. You want (or love). I'm sure <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
