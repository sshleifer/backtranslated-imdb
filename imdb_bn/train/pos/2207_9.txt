Not really bad words to say about this film. I was not initially impressed by it, but it quickly increased on me. I like it a lot and I feel ashamed that many people are not seeing the fact that it was banned in some areas, one of me is being. The image provides shock, gore and atmosphere sections. Score Suspense Equipment is a beautiful piece providing. Chris Young became the best musician of the business. Acting in this movie is a bit high, if there are some wooden structures in some scars and the effects are very real and great. This is a high praise for a good slash of my book. I have mentioned in some reviews that this film is a famous killer P.O.V. Got a serious gap with the shot. And I ask: what's wrong with this ??? This is a classic shot which expresses concern about the fear of a good fan of the section and is a great way to keep the killer's identity secret. The only thing that has been the bookmark of this book is that the wonderful twist (killer expression) is not handled more carefully, I mean it is very fast, though great performance only makes it credible. Along with that, a great film from the Practice (although I like the original title), and it is shameful that many people simply stop it as a cheaper piece. Even more, but only a few people know that it seems to have lost the first slash of the 80's decade. What a shame .... It's a really good movie people! Believe me
