Fantastic actors, beautiful scenery, fantastic reality I do not want to comment on other pictures because you get the picture! However, the film is not for the sticky. In order to survive, pigs and other animals are being killed. My Alinor's Randall Stewart has a residence book. I read it many years ago, I have to read it again, since I only saw new releases, the movie's remastered DVD. <br /> <br /> I have tried to buy the video for several years, since I've finally used it in a video store that went out of business. But EPP! DVD for sale now, I bought it at amazon.com. Not cheap, but it's a good price for me. This is a movie I will be watching until the end of my day!
