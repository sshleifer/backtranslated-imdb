It makes me amazed because I was often frustrated by the past Adrian Pasteur, but he took the perfect balance in this performance, while avoiding both mad and devious while providing humor and real emotions. Always wondering Julie Waters is fantastic here, and anyone who did not see her in the edited retreat in 1983 must immediately rent (Incredible Film). Other supplementary characters have played well, many are incredibly bright. This one is fun.
