An excellent explanation of Jim Thompson's novel, this neo-nir thriller has all the necessary ingredients - the overwhelming former boxer has become an erroneous, alcoholic widow with a widowed widow, a former superintendent of police, and a kidnapping plot scheduled for abduction. However, this movie has sometimes not been clayed in the country, but fresh and playful. All of the performances are fantastic, especially Bruce Dern's mischievous sleazeball, role as Uncle Bude. There is a tension uncertainty in the movement of the movie, which adds to the intentional or not, a serious process. Highly recommended.
