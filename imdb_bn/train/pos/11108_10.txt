Well ... easily my favorite TV series Call me a walking mail but include violence, mafia, sex, gambling, medicine etc. on a show and you are already earning points in my book. Combine what you have done more than what you saw on the small screen, which fits the wine type movie and most of all the articles that hit the mind, and your own <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One way to not express the word, if you have not seen him as Tony, see it now! <br /> <br /> I will not be able to stop me on every character of this show and in the brain, bright scenes, but I can say that it is about the only show with signfills, that I look back from the beginning to the end and So far more able to enjoy it.
