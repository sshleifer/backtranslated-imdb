I've always been a huge James Bond fanatic! I've seen almost all the movies except Die Arora's Day, and The World Is Not Into Everything in the graphic or nothing is exciting! Voice talent ......... WOW! I love Piris Borshan! Finally he is a video game bond! He bonds! I enjoyed the last bond games: Golden, The World BrickNote, Agent Under Fire, and Nightfire. This one is definitely the best! Finally, Mr. Brosnan, (can I call Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect? Yes I can!) He was amazingly excited to play in a video game ... .. this is the end! Duh! I met him with Robin Williams, and tell me, they made a great team. Pierce Brosnan is funny, naughtyly handsome (I want to say goodbye bad) and one of the actors who want to walk and wrap your arms and hug: "Pierce Brosnan, thank you James Bond," "If it is not for you But I do not know who James Bond. "He is a great actor! Although I have seen him in a few movies, I am a great fan of Willam Dafor. His role was as bright as Nikolai Diwali. (I spell the character's name right?) LOL !!!! He does a great job with a pronoun. Sometimes I can not even hear a pronunciation. I saw Will, I mean Mr. Duff, acting in two movies: Finding Nemo and Spider-Man with my favorite actor: Carsten Dunst! She is awesome! However, he did not stop to wonder. And Richard Keil, wow, he must have got a nail piece of jaw. I saw him in the movie and he is awesome! In fact, my grandmother saw Mr Keel, and they told me when I was jealous. However, Kirsten Donst is at the top of my list of celebrities that I want to fill. John Cleese was breathtaking. Like advertising I have not seen good people play, and the question of gadget preparation! Mr. Claes are happy! I worked with Pearson Brosnan in Golden, and Tomorrow never died. She is awesome! John Claes's most recent project is Shakek 2, Mike Mayer, Cameron Diaz, Julie Andrew and Eddie Murphy. (Shackle 2 now in the theater!) Good luck 007! Oh, yes, and Alway says as the question: "Increase 007!"
