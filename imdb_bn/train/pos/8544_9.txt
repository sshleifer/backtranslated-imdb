It never received attention to get this movie attention, although it is one of the best pieces of great acting and one of the most realistic stories I've seen on screen. Definitely a real VA Imagine a small budget. In the hospital, the story center Joel, played by Eric Stoltz very well. Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident and comes to a ward hospital with other men due to injury in the spine. Joel Anna, with his marriage boyfriend, Helen Hunt, showed the first signs of his next Academy Award-winning job. <br /> <br /> Although the Joel-Anne relationship is the main focus, many other advanced characters in the ward. Wesley Snips, like Walsley Snippets, did a great job. Even more impressive as William Forsythe bitter and racist blues. I think Forcesith's two best scenes when he was frustrated and angry over the square dancers and later, when he felt sorry for a young Korean person, who was kept in a liquor store. My favorite view of snippers in the round table discussion of post-injection sex alternatives. Chemistry is very strong between stoltz and hunt, and they are not two very close, but unused sex scenes. The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and fun. Another memorable scene is where Joel and Blas and Korean boys take specially equipped vans to the strip bar. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The real life is paralyzed. It's basically his story. This film is not real, shiny or dazzling. Such a small budget has amazing amount of talent in a film. I see this movie everybody so that I can see it because it is a film that improves in other aspects. It is a shame that such a great work is ignored, but it can probably draw attention through video.
