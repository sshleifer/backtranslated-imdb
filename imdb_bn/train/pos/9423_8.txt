I can not say that the WWII British comedy produced in Yelling Studio does not taste achieved or not, but I'm completely addicted, and Man in the White Suit is the best. Both the textile industry and the textile union do not need to go into a well-known plot about threat through an unforgettable, dirty-resistant fiber. In view of the polymorade, it is enough to say this for a curious pleasure by the pessimistic idealist Sidney Stratton, and an interesting pleasure from the arrow. The British character has many of the world's famous characters - Nervous Seychel Parker, undoubtedly tragic Michael Gough and the intelligent Ernest Thesar - in wonderful performance. Guinness - forever and always - fantastic, and Joan is as attractive as Greenwood Duffen (only she develops the full movie to watch the word "Daddy"). <br /> <br /> "Knudsen !!! !!!!"
