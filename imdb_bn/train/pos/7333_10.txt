Thei is a great movie. Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen I see again over over. I'll give it a 10/10 star because I've probably said it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. This movie + popcorn + coke = the best mix you can imagine. If you want to watch some movies then I definitely recommend this one. The first thing I saw was that I liked it so I bought it and now I own it and can see it every day. My boys love it and think it's the best movie ever seen. In this movie Gaya In about Fantasy World I do not want to ruin all the movies so that you can enjoy it after reading my text. Lovely movie boyfriend characters, lover stories, and just great things. To see a movie. Hope you enjoy my comment <br /> <br /> Jim Make
