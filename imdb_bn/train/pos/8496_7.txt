Wow, I've finally seen years in this movie. Looking at it in 2008, it is definitely different from seeing it in 1986. Initially, I do not think that I will make it through this movie. Hunt Stevenson (Michael Cutton) is so despicable, arrogant and disrespectful that I got hurt to see him. He embodied the negative stereotype towards the Americans. If it was not bad enough, once the picture of the best-known American city was shown, the image just got worse. In contrast, the Japanese were presented as an emotionless, robotic workhoril. The movie was not funny, I just hanging there due to the nostalgic price. And I'm happy that I continue to watch. <br /> <br /> Just like boxing, how the judges are ending the round. Finally, the movie lasted about three to seven. The last was excellent. You always want a harmonious end and this was just right. The city was very good to keep a job there and keep the factory, but the marriage between Japanese customs and values ​​and American customs and values ​​was the most special. It is a medieval film which ends on a high note.
