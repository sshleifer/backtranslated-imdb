The film revolves around Japanese culture because it is a modern Japanese family living. Risks are caused by physical contact over 7 years (especially in the public), so you are patient instead of panic despite having close friends / relatives. Ballroom Dance involves putting your arms around someone else and that's very public! Less Bollywood dances are not very popular (several). Ballroom dancing people in Japan look somewhat like the nudists in the West ... much more want to do but are influenced by culture. A delightful family film, any amateur dancer will enjoy for solo dance sequences alone. I understand that Japan was more popular than Titanic. I guess Japan just like us left-- they'd like to embrace too much.
