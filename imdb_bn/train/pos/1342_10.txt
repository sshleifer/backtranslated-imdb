The movie that inspired the fantastic Martin Scorsese is a wonderful, wonderful look. Most of his films relate to his work, especially related to the previous, silent era. Despite being a little more enjoyable, I still could not find one of the best documentaries in this movie. You met Martin Scorsese and praised his work if necessary.
