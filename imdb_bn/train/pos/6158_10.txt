What can I say about such a story? This magical story has followed me from my childhood, has warmed my heart. Characters bring you to many visual places where you want to do more at each scene. For example, there was a lot of different taste in the market. I like that foreign dancer with style drums. <br /> <br /> The story line was amazing. I wanted to keep the kids for the laundry and stay with Mr.Brown for it too bad, and find out half the part of the spell so that men could win less armor fighting. <br /> <br /> I'm still a child inside, and this movie is appealing to someone else like my child. This movie is my favorite favorite all the time. I hope all children will be able to see this classic and move away, and will be transported at another time.
