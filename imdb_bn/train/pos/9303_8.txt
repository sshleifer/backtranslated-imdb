You must not see a normal movie if you see this movie. It does not have any true stories, a bunch of gangster characters that combine with a perfect harmony. The dialogue is wonderful, you can just keep back and listen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Love the movie and recommend it to all those who have one-liner and "normal" Like something different from You can not really put a finger on the wonders that it's a wonderful world where gangsters rule. A place of love and danger. A movie that you can see more than once.
