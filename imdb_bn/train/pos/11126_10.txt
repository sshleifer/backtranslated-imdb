Sopranos controversy is the greatest show in the history of dramatic television. <br /> <br /> It is more difficult to criticize such intellect, glorious writing or first-rate performance. <br /> <br /> It is fresh and it produces a constant level of icon and high quality of the epic. A man surrounded by Tony Sopra's life, who lives in two families. One of the traditional wife and two children of nuclear family is another bigger New Jersey Mafia group, which she is both the boss By James Gandolfini, by the true romance and Mexican fame, Tony is a fascinating, scary but preferred man. Feminization of gandlupinis and gruesome identifiable and perfect leading people should be fully appreciated for the fearsome aggressive barbarism. There was no such arrest and symbolic image of Tony in Contemporary American drama. <br /> <br /> Hundreds of cast never face face-to-face performance and these stand out carats, such as Polly Walloons and Ralph Schifter, will remain in your memory forever. <br /> <br /> <br /> The true genius of this story, Creator and writer, has taken a series of brave and revolutionary series. Powerful and original use of twenty minutes long dream sequence, symbolism and metaphorical imagery and true sudden scenes of violence. Yet all these styles are really met by touching the respect theme for love, respect and family. The series is never cold heartless or unwanted. <br /> <br /> Now TV is competitive and often poor. Soprans is taller than rest as America's most original and compelling play. Forget the family rematch. This television is redefined.
