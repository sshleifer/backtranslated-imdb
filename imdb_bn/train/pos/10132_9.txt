Friends In this first episode, we have been introduced to six main characters in the series: Monica Geller, Phoebe Buff, Chandler Bing, Ross Geller, Joe Trabbian, and finally Rachel Greene. <br /> <br /> We discovered that Rachel, a friend of Monica, who was a wealthy girl repeatedly in high school, left the violet on the altar, because she discovered that she did not love him. He decides to live with Monika and is independent of his father, get a new job as a waitress in the Central Park. <br /> <br /> Ross, on the other hand, discovered that his wife was a lesbian and lost to him. Susan, her partner. (We see him go to a new apartment during the episode) <br /> <br /> This episode, Monica, brings out Paul with a "wine guy" (and finally sleeping), who gave him an excuse to be cruel because he divorced his wife. But in reality, she was just cheating on him. <br /> <br /> PS: I am looting Joey and Chandler's thorn in this first season! =)
