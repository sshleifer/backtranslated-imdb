You probably already know, Jess Franco is a cheerful guy. HES made hundreds of films, which are many browns. However, he occasionally managed to sneak into quality standards in all assembly line absorption. "Sukubus" is not his best work ("Diabolic Dr Z" or "Vampiors Lesbos"), but there are many trademarks that should be interested in diving in his big catalog. He combines alternating and surrealless into loving (showing full front nudity and leaving somthing left to the imagination). This is a very dreamlike film, full of great atmosphere. I especially like the constant naming. Despite being incredibly motivated to stop, it is delighted to see all the effects of Franco <br /> <br /> There are still many users who do not like "sukushas" and I can see where they are coming from. Its leisurely paced, but I can deal with that. There are more problem-sensitive inkchanges. The script ran here clearly, and within five minutes of the film, I had no idea what was going on (and it did not really come together since that time). Those who want some substance with their style, look elsewhere. Also, if it's a horror movie, it does not become really scary or even suspenseful. Yet, all my psychical syllables were entertained by the fact that I did not really think of these big flaws too much. (7/10)
