A beautiful surprise! I hope more downgrade along the line: The Rock (9) -> Con Air (7) -> Armaggeddon (4). Especially for such an overhyped film. Perhaps the reason for this new type of brookhammer hire is so much as possible. Instead of skeptic one-liner, shiny conversations, instead of Shake-n-Brake stereotypes, have a good background / motivation and you're really thirsty when you come back. An Armageddon Rollercoaster Fanboys: Stay away! This is one of the more intelligent action fans. It does not even bother me even Jolie appeared very little.
