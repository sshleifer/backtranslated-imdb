During WWII, one of the many Mary Melody cartoons entertaining American moviegoers, Bob Clamett's "Inch In In Time" settled on the Elmer Food dog. While creating a house behind a dog, the little man becomes truly naughty, but Elmer warns the dog: "Another skate and I'll bathe you!" Meanwhile, the glasses are set up on a dynamite! * And do not end that! I saw that in one scene, reading a comic book featuring Elmer Baughs Bonnie and Pinkie Pig. Obviously, Elmer and Bugs often play, but Elmer has never cooperated with the insect (unless you have a very short "no bond today?") But to me, the idea of ​​Elmar's emphasis on these other famous characters of this same pattern emphasizes the spiritual nature of his world, even though he knew about their existence in this universe, even though they do not appear in this cartoon. <Br /> Of course, I'm probably going very far in my analysis. I'm sure the cartoon has been called pure entertainment, and it must be entertained. Since the "I can like this" line, it was something that the sensors did not allow but was not missed in any way; I was not supposed to sound like like it, for one, actually. Was it something sexual? In the end, I thought that I saw everything, I was tempted to look for something more than a cat's job. Although it was a tasty tactic. <br /> <br /> * Boys behind this cartoon were sure that there is one thing for TNT, is not it?
