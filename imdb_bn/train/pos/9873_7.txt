A small town living in Indiana, Lily Mangal, dreams of growing up on Broadway and a lift to show her desires was given when successful Broadway producer John Thorne returned to her home. Lily tries to get Thorneau to watch everything, but she is annoyed with her antics only. When Thorneau returns to New York on his show, Lilly follows (obviously unknown to the person) and Thorneve gives her little role in her subsequent show, only to please her family, but Thorneau started to fall for this young man. Girl and a romance flower, which makes the show's leading lady, Isabel Rekay, jealous. When Jeb-Lily gets dressed up with romance in Izabel, she gets disgusted, she goes, and decides to make John Lilley a star. Isabella comes back later, and Thornwell is forced to tell Lily that she came back to play in her little role in the game, which could endanger romance. A very relaxing film for Gerald and a consolationary change in her role has humorous (her study of Lady Macbeth, seems to be ridiculous, does not threaten her singer's career), I enjoyed Halflin's character (Thornway) when she was bothered to be Lily, rather romantic. The film can be somewhat predictable and does not combine together in the scene, but a very enjoyable film. Ratings, 7
