I have seen a few comments about Brando using the Southern Act, some of which seem to be a mistake. When this movie was made, racism and discrimination in the south were very strong. The Jim Crow laws were still effective. Civil rights were his childhood. Could this possibly be a delicate social commentary, a human being in love with a woman in another nation? Was the MASH a subtle criticism of the Vietnam War? Any thoughts? <br /> <br /> Another comment was made about the presence of Missy Umsey's "cold". Anyone has understood Japan has been. Japanese people, at least in my experience, do not tend to show an unknown front emotions. There were strict social rules, especially for men's singles women. Americans were completely foreign to this culture in Japan, and women were disappointed because of their tremendous efforts to interview women. A feature of Japanese was frustrating or uneasy when it was sunny, which took as a sign that many American soldiers welcomed their progress. Also remember that Japan was defeated during the representation of the film and the captain was reluctant to recognize the force. I think Moyoshi Umeki gave her a very reliable performance of what her status was. Seeing his interaction with American actors, several memories of my own experience in the country were highlighted. I was able to show a pair of lovely young men, who believed in me, I'm not American American, teaching their language about my time and language in their country.
