Wild Bill Hikoc, Kalamity Zen, Baffle Bill and General Castor are all in this movie. Gary Cooper played Wild Bill and played John Arthur Clematy Zen and Charles Bakerford, who sells Indian arms to the bad guys and you can rarely recognize him. For the first time, Cecil B Demil and Gary Cooper worked together and the next film was originally the same, but it was set at another time. This movie started with the assassination of Lincoln and also faced an Indian war. The disaster Jane Genie Bill and Baffle Bill married and now wants to stay home. This film is also related to the end of the cast and it is far from the correct. Gary Cooper is normal and I do not usually like Gene Arthur but I like her here.
