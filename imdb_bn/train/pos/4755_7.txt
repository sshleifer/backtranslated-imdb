The buses full of passengers stuck during a snow storm. Police closed the bridge - saying it was unsafe and trapped in a cafe until the road was cleared. However, after a while, their indifference became worried, there was basically not a bus between passengers and could only be an alien! It leads to a conclusion that is harmful but less nasty, funny. <br /> <br /> This is one of the fun episodes of Tivialight Zone. Instead of usually twists or social commentary, this one features any permanent message. However, it is very watchable, so who care? You have to see what happened exactly for yourself. <br /> <br /> In this way, John Hoet - you can recognize most of the faces from countless old TV shows and movies. In almost every case, he played a really important game (like Charles Lane in the same era), but I love seeing him as a boy - as he perfected Gauchi's personality and was funny at the same time.
