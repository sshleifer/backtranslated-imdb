This movie is a true copy of a TV series on Indian television channel Television, which was broadcast at least 15 years ago. The balloon was known as "Gababar". Each episode was a new little story. The story is wonderful and the original is very sweet and "believable" Abhay Dell does a good job, but he does not fit the role of a "normal" and "third class" son (as he called himself in the film). In fact Shayan Munshi spent a short time with his hair and the designer would have played an indispensable role without clothes, but Shayan did not just have the talent to stop it. <br /> <br /> I recommend watching the series is readily available. It is the same story, without the mother of the mother and the initial roles running around. The acting of TV actors is much better than this "big". <br /> <br /> A flop of these movies is the only reason the director is about half an hour (or 45 minutes) for managing 2+ hours of story. So it has to get draggy. Even Nasal could not produce sensation songs. <br /> <br /> These movies are good for lazy Sunday afternoon and if you really do not see the original TV series, it's really fresh. The end of the script and the serial was much better <br /> <br /> ##### Speaker Ayode ############# Spirith Abha ############ ########## Speaker Officer ############## Speaker Aid ############## Spirits Above ##### #### The main draw of the series is due to the protagonist pushing the girl herself, even thinking that she agreed to marry him. He is aware and told him that he does not want to be "paid" and that he did not help with that intention. The director or script could not hold the real end in any film. The real end was purchased by tears in the eyes of women and they said that the contract workers would have been there. Not only was the right to give. <br /> <br /> But personally I think it's a kind of copy. No credit director / script writer should be given. The story is amazing and one of the famous novel writers of Pramanchandra Munshi class. I am not sure that it is Premchandra Munshi's story, but it is one of the short stories in the series Pramchand Munshi and other great Hindi authors' stories.
