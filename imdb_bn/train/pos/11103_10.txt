Television "The Godfather", but both of his praise and brain characters are not the same. Tony Soprano was forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks. His psychology teaches that Tony is actually part of two families - in a family he is a loving father who is not yet a perfect husband, and he is a ruthless among the other family. After the analysis, Dr. Melfi concludes that Tony's problem comes from his mother, Livia, who is suspected of having borderline personality disorders. Gandolfini is truly appreciated as the main character; Still, BRACO and Marrand are not recognized for their equally and gifted performance as psychologists and mothers respectively. Falco, Imperiali and Dematto are acclaimed for their brilliant supporters. Van Jundett (from the E-Street band) has played his first and only role as Tony's best friend, and it is quite strong and alluring. Actually, the only recurring actor appeared in the movie Godfather, Chianez, Tony's uncle and On Off Namedness. Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore, Ventimiglia, Curatola, Proval, Pantoliano, Lips, Sciorra and Buscemi. Tony's children are "OK" but not significant ("The Second Coming", without the stunning performance of the third-to-last time Isler); Siriko and Sherpri are disrespectful and at the top, but for them it is very strong to show. Although the program is going on in six seasons, it can end in a neutral or anticipated moment. <br /> <br /> **** (four out)
