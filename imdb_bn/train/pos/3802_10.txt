Dragon Hunters will be the best animated movie I've ever seen. It was jaw dropping. The film is about two crores of cash, about the search for the blue dogs of their peculiar animal and the dream of a girl who was dreamed of becoming a knight, and they were sent to search the world's edge. The world's Gobla, an impossible immense dragon. But the truth is, the matter of the film does not even matter. Because, it's jaw-dropping gorgeous. The gravity of this fantasy world is different, so wood architecture and labyrinth pots are buried in the graves and forts and villas with equally flowing and floating lily pads. The world is so creative, so unique, with its beautiful observation story, its search Looks like a set of world's fantastic paintings. As monsters as visually stunning as well, like a fire dragon consists of a swarm of evil red bats. Some plot is not very basic, like the main characters, their farm is asking for uncle and male la and the world does not seem capable of making it; But excellent graphics, some serious sinister scenes, and emotion-evoking dialogue makes this film spectacular.
