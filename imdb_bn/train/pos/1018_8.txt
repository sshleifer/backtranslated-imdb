The movie was a sub-par, but this television pilot is a sophisticated fan fan program that delivers a great springboard. The actor's rendering and special effects (for a television series) are spectacular. Do not hurt to have an intelligent interesting script. <br /> <br /> Straggate SG1 is currently one of my favorite programs.
