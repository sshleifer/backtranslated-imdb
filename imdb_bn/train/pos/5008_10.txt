The whole show on his shoulder alone. The risky move has been largely stopped, as my name Barbara Television has set a new standard for musical programming. <br /> <br /> My name Barbara is shamelessly-conceived and eagerly shot on glorious black and white (which actually shows the effectiveness of the show).
