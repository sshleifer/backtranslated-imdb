"Welcome to Collingwood" offers the most ridiculous dialog for recent memory. The brothers reminded me of another film that we saw in the past, seeing the comedy of Anthony and Joe Rousseau, but since we missed the first credit, so we had to wait that the Italian movie of 1958 to discover what we were reminded of. "Madonna Street A Big Deal", directed by Mario Moniseli. <br /> <br /> Raso brothers combine a nice cast to illustrate all the characters in the picture. William H. Messi, Louis Gujman, Sam Rockwell, Patricia Clarkson, late Michael Jeter, can not be anything worse with this. As it is a piece of shoe, so get a chance to enlighten all the characters. <br /> <br /> This movie will present us a team of free-to-the-safe crackers from hell Nobody can think that they can work like this. Whatever may be wrong, and more, they are successful. George Clooney has created such a small appearance that is like a master safe cracker, who disguised as Robi, only confused with a priest by gang members who came from the funeral funeral. <br /> <br /> The movie is to sit back and relax, and all this small time crooks do not do their thing. Their funny lines allow you to laugh, because someone who can see this gang is destroyed from beginning to end!
