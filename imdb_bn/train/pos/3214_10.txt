I fell in love with this silent action drama. Kurt Russell and only Cart Russell could have played this well. Raised to know nothing but war and war since childhood, Tod (Cart Russell) was dropped on a planet after being obsolete by genetically engineered. <br /> <br /> The stage is set and other classic icons of action movies were born - SOLDIER. Not Roberbo, Schwarzenegger, not Bruce Willis, not Mel Gibson, not Jason Statham - Kurt Russell is the owner of this role and it has completely created its original, bold and all people. I feel the feeling that the seagulls were never made. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
