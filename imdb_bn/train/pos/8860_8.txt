I started looking at a very consistent pattern form for the 2007 film. The year of 2004 was the year of political film and the year 2005 was a year of political films, as a year in 2007, it can be characterized by a wide range of morality stories, films, tests, challenges, and human ethics and the objectives that we have to do. Although this identity is rather broad, I think this year there are few movies of Liberation War, like 3:10 Yuma, Eastern Promises, American Gangster, Old Man for No Country for Old Man and others who specially question and research human morals. That purpose is to drive us to act as violence or betrayal. The devil is dead before you think of a deviously stylish morality story, and a dark, bleak and depressing one. And better, it is one of the best classical directory forces of our time, legendary Sydney Lloyt, who has said that his master has passed but is completely back with this rogue rich crime thriller. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films, whose plots are so thick, which is very reluctant to know. This is a movie that is best enjoyed if it is released without any prior knowledge, such as twists and turns. But there are no thick and rich objects in the center of this film. True Focus, as I've mentioned, is the story of morality; The purpose of these two men to run films. In a plot like Coen Brothers (such as Bloody and Fargo) and Quintin Tarantino's Co-ordination, we see two men running under various incognito situations, which are incredibly, ridiculously wrong and absolutely offense is committed. Reciprocates with full power and inevitable tragedy. And to make it more interesting, the film is called an isolated chronological language, which tracks the tracking behind, and shows a series of events by following a different character each time, and always end when leaving the last time. Intense, intense, thick and uncertainly depressed, Kelly Masterson's screenplay is surprisingly appealing and well-rounded, especially with a salute screenplay. <br /> <br /> But this film is going to be much more and quite a depressing plot. First and foremost, looks pictures and looks great. Sydney Lumet has consistently cinematography throughout her career and has set an interesting style of discussion: at the same time natural and yet stylish. The film carries with him a distinct air of style and class, which looks excellent only in excellent natural light. The edit is top notch; The combination of sizzling drama-thriller with long long is a combination that really takes time to draw the picture according to according time. And add more style to the animated, dynamic camera angle and movement. The image is also supported by Carter Barrell's Fantasical Transformed Musical Score. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> First and foremost, there are two leads. The top of the pack is Philipp Semur Hoffman, who was always a great actor, but after the superb Oscars-winning performance on the Capeto, he was disappointed with the status of the new football's top man. His turn in this film is chic: seriously defective, broken, manic Hoffman's film has some really strong scenes that really allow his full dramatic anger to come out, not only his neutrality and intelligence. Ethan Huq beside him, who has delivered some extraordinary performances in many movies, which are often spread by larger, great actors. Here, he bounces off Hoffman and complements him incredibly well; Above all, the dynamic acting of both of them are pretty cool and convincing, the audience is quickly lost in letters and forgets that it is watching the actor. And then there's Albert Finney. Such a supple, ample supportive role is required for an experienced professional for him and here feni gets his best performance for many years as a tragically obsessed father of two brothers who get caught in crime. I love how to play dynamics among the three of them. I love that Hoffman is clearly influential brother and shamefully liked his younger brother, now they are middle-aged men. And yet, it is clear how Finney's father supports Hayek's younger, weak brother. Also cast subject, two supplemented female characters ?? sister-in-law ?? Also shows fantastic performances from Emmay Ryan and Marisa Tomomi, whose looks are better and better. <br /> <br /> This image is not revolutionary. These themes and this style have already been searched by The Coen Brothers preference and it is very easy to imagine them for the film's management. But the familiar role, which is known for a place, it simply excels. Lumet uses her own extraordinary directorial talent and uses the unique and delicate idea of ​​the scandalous and stylish screenplay on the screen for the first time in the bright, intense, and painful frustration of the brain. The lead performance is incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turn from Hoffman, Hawke and Finney; But the film's real wonder is that he was honored as the final signature of the film business after three years of achieving lifetime achievement, Sidney Lumet proved that he had a truly wonderful, resounding, intense piece of his golden year's memorable movie.
