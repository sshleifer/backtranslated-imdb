Despite reading the "primitive comment" from the person who oddly dislike the film - (why was the first comment in the first list?) It was very nice to think that everyone else likes it! Clearly the Church wanted to impose certain issues and positively portrayed the prophet Joseph Smith ~ The whole idea. And actually, those points were extremely effective. We've already said Joseph Smith as man ... but nevertheless, and was provoked by the opponent in its dire negative efforts, it showed how he was able to accomplish the extraordinary, God-given work. I want to recommend it to someone!
