This is one of my best movies ever and I would recommend it for. Only Lord of the Rings series, Spirit Away, and Fly Away Home, keeping in mind the list of favorite movies (mental list, mind). <br /> <br /> I can honestly say the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a little strange background, who has more friends than girls. She really sucks you in her life. I certainly would not be able to blame any other actor or anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> Football was interesting to see someone like me who did not know anything about the rules. The movie is not boring. Romance was really clever and blush me too much harder! One thing that really made it though was the Indian factor. Yash's parents have many colorful Indian conferences throughout Indian and film, which provide very interesting cultural insights and everything else. Indian people are ridiculous! Basically it's an age movie about choosing the way you love and fighting for it. <br /> <br /> This is a good comedy of my favorite movie for this movie. They are funny, they are refreshing and they feel good to you! ^: _ ~
