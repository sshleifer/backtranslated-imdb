Oh, those sticky Italians are In this case, they are not encouraged on any source for the first time without the author, permission or knowledge of the novel. Of course this is not something that is usually Italian, but it does a lot of work in the first days of the movie, because in most cases they think they can leave it. James M. Cain's publishers were able to keep the film on the American screen until the 1976, however, the film itself has gained a bit of a well-known classic. <br /> <br /> This film is not a great version to watch as a 1946 American version but still a great movie. Of course this is not least because of the film, it is a very strong story, it is a playful and provides a movie with some great characters and reality. It follows the novel very closely and it is very similar to other movie versions of its story, it is certainly considered to be a difference in the Italian environment. <br /> <br /> Leave it to the Italians and create a movie about real people and it's real people. This early play has always had a very realistic feeling about it and so much involved in watching the clock. Unfortunately, the film has lost some power to the end, when the movie began to pull slightly overlong and some parts. The movie could easily have ended 15 minutes earlier. <br /> <br /> Still, there is nothing negative about me to talk about this movie. It is made only on equally awesome and strong source elements. An impressive director for Luchino Visconti, who continues to point to many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies, debut. <br /> <br /> 8/10
