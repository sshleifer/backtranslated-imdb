In a photo-service drop-off station, a minister Wallace started the film with Lifestyle very slowly. His wife was limited to his ankle bracelet as a sentence for arson. Wallace is a voluntary fire department member and is heavily involved in fire-fighting. <br /> <br /> We see helpless living instead of Wallace, suddenly something new comes and jarring: a travel came to Carnival town. Wallace's brother, Wildard Napalm, is one of his brothers. She is a shoe, but she has a special talent. <br /> <br /> So Wallace. They are both able to start fire through pyrokineticists or "pyrotics," psychic energy. Wallace keeps his power secret; Willard could tell his acquaintances what he could do. <br /> <br /> Spolare: Their differences go back to childhood events, where they unexpectedly cause Vanant's death. Wallace kept back from using his power; Wilder wants to go public on national TV. <br /> <br /> Complaint about the matter, wants the wife of the wife of Wallace, whom they had been dating many years ago. He became a bone of contradiction and eventually became a cause of the literal fire of the brothers. <br /> <br /> The film is entertaining, but not sunny. I think enough of my library has a copy. This is a good off-film film.
