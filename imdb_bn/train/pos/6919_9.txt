"Winchester '73" marked the first West Indies series with James Stewart and director Anthony Mann. Most of them have a violent side of the Stuart hero who threatens to explode at any time. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the "one thousand one" rifle which is ready for a rifle shoot competition. Dodge City on 4 July 1876 In the town, Lyn McAdam (Stewart) and his Sidekick High Speed ​​(Miller Mitchell) Dan Henry Brown (Stephen McNally) have been called for past work. They arrived at the time of running the Solon girl Lola (Shelley Winners) outside the city of Marshall W. Yarp (Will Geekar). It is seen that Dutch Henry is also the city for rifle shoots. Lin and Dutch Henry Lynn won the award for the Iron Winner, but Dutch Henry managed to escape from the gun's gun shot. <br /> <br /> Dutch Henry across the country of Lin and High Speed ​​where her greedy wife Steve Miller (Charles Drake) is in the US Calorie camp who is waiting for the attack of Indians led by the Young Bull (Rock Hudson), by killing the killer John McEnter Earned valuable rifles. He got arms by Dutch Henry Hood at poker. Young Bull was killed during an attack and the gun went to Steve. Meanwhile, returning to the Palli, Lola and Steve met with the notorious gunman Weko Johnny Dean (Dan Durrice) who killed Steve and took for himself a valuable rifle and Lola. After meeting Dean Dutch Henri, he allowed him to kill "his gun" plan later on. In Tascoza town, Dean was killed in Lin Henry's plans to keep the Dutch bank bad, and he escaped with Lynn to the mountain with Lynn. <br /> <br /> I believe that this movie was the only one in Stuart / quality collaboration that was shot in B & W. It has been nicely photographed, especially "wide open spaces" and especially scenes, final showdown. Playing against Stewart's type, starring heroes with a motivated sense of violent retaliation, is an emotion that he will go to future films with Mann. <br /> <br /> Like most Universal Westerns, it is a Cast and a day contract player for an experienced senior. In addition to the above mentioned, J. C. See Flippy Cavary Sergent, Steve Brodie, James Millikan, John Dockets and Chuck Robertson as Hechenchmann, followed by Ray Tyl Sharif, and Tony Curtis and James Best as Rookie Soldiers and Edmond Cobb. In the dose city chronology, the role of Chief Yoalechi and John War Eagle <br /> <br /> A classic Western in every sense of the word. It was responsible for the production of Stewart's career as an employee star.
