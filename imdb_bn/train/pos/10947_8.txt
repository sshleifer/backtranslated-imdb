Sarah Silverman's program is very similar to Sara's own stand; It's topped with a bias that you probably will not be able to take in the heart. In fact, although most people will "get it", this does not mean that they all will be grateful. This is a very constant and one dimensional show, so if you do not like it after 10 minutes, you can leave it there. If you like it after 10 minutes, then stay safe, because this episode is just as good as the end. <br /> <br /> Like all Shows but it is not perfect. Personally I love the program, but there are some big flaws with it. Racist Gun is funny, but gets older than Silverman's perception - I had a problem with "Jesus Magician". It seems that Silverman gave himself quotes for every episode that does not require existence. Note that the songs that he wrote about songs are good, music, good, no Another thing to remember is that this show will appeal to fans for some reasons, Monty Python, The Top Citizen Brigade, etc. It is nothing like the Shows. I can see Monty Python throughout the day, but, as much as I like this show, I can not see half an hour more than once. It gets flat quickly The repetition price for this show is very low - around one episode is a bit rough second time, and for the third time, in my opinion it's annoying. <br /> <br /> Yet for the first time, very funny. Give it a kick.
