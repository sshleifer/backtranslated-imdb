As the show was originally broadcast, there was only one child, I recently selected the DVD set and shooting more episodes. This show was the 70th edition of the popular 90-episode "X-file" - but more with a comrade / light hearty approach. But do not make me wrong, some of these episodes are filled with horror themes, some of which are beautiful beautiful plots (of course left to imagine - this was the television of the 70's). <br /> <br /> Some of the plots that are somewhat stupid and acting, but the attraction and attraction of this series Whether you love mystery crime drama, comedy, or sci-fi / awful themes, bring all that together in this series. I see almost 50 minutes or more in each episode (1 hour with commerciality) and it's 50 minutes faster I always want more. A great classic show that belongs to my book!
