I was not just extra in this movie, I went to see movies by selling in Boston. Thousands of Boston Red Sox / French fans awoke to watch a comedy in a movie theater near the Commonwealth of Boston .... about them .... red socks fantasy! This cute comedy about Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon star love and wish. Love is between two young lovers. The red series is desperate to win the series in the world. Although Fallon is not a great actor, he is the best actor for this role. He gets enough fun and most smiles. Barrymore, on the other hand, is the same old Barrymore. Occasionally, I used to feel a good actor for the role of Sky Acting Actress Act. All in all, all fans of Boston Red Sox will love this movie. For the rest of the world, it's a fun movie.
