This is a great movie !!! <br /> <br /> I saw this image when it came. I recently saw this picture again and it still holds up to my memory. When we were young we saw many movies, when we did not monitor them in the next life. The film is a great example of 80 well-crafted film genres. Keaton is his best, all the actors have actually done a very good job and Ron Howard's story was very good for pushing the movie with it rather compulsory. The speed of the movie is seen gradually and it is very interesting to see 80 cars. From the 80's I like to see the ugly pacer again. The film is a comedy for the comedy lovers and a great movie for the movie lovers of the 80s.
