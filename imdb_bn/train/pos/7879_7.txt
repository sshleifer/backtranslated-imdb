Like most of Alan Powell's movies, it played along the most brighter edge of the plots. For some reason - oh it is explained! - He was selected for a magnetic mine transport in Cuba. Good guys and bad guys are competing for mines and who get confused. However, as always, Powell's dancing is fantastic and worth the price of admission. And in this way, Lara played his cowardly singer in 1932 with the warm memories of the film of Technikola. A frank benefit is listening to a young franc, the excellent voice and skinny weakness that he later leaves for his cognitive. In addition, the great drummer, Body Rich, showing her virtuosity at a wonderful time. Specially look for Dorsi's Trumpet Man, his unique twin with Jigi Elman. I might say "unique" by default, but I do not know about any drum / trumpet sequence in the film or record. This picture is fun. Even Skelton's spy personality is relatively controlling. Powell again shows that he is the greatest film dancer of all time.
