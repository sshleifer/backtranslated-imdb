Gimmicks At first I would say I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but I was a believer in the show, and I was watching the stupid talent of Abe Forsythe. I can safely say that I'm happy now that I did. The story was well developed, and all the letters had a strong foundation, and most of the information was not available. <br /> <br /> The only thing that can make this mistake in this product is overwhelmed by some annoying voice and pronunciation character Lizzie. Some good actors with a tunnel plot really get this show on the line. Here is the hope for another season!
