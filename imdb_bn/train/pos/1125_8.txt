Michael KokwaniÄ‡ had a relatively long career, but his name got some surprisingly credited, some of which were original fogs, such as the tragic cold war abusive The Day Fish Cam Out. Ephesina, however, is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the game by Euripides, it created a superior rendering of classic tragedy and recently courtesy of the United States Flix Channel to make its first television appearance. The film is shot on an epic scale but not simply a 'big' film, the simple story emphasized: On request of the gods, King Agememanan (Kustas Kajakos) was forced to dedicate his daughter Epiggionia (Tatiana Papamoschou) to. , A lot for the narrowing of Queen Clememann (Irene Papas). Both Cajakos and Papas are extraordinary, but this is the stunning Pamamoscho, who brings the most interesting elements on the screen, mixing childhood innocence with the horror of animals in political play. Strongly recommend for international cinema fans.
