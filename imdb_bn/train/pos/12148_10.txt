There are many comedy in this movie, not dark, and Gordon Liu has published it like this. He showed his humorous aspects and it was really weird to see the bit up. His training was "overwhelming" and who thought that tie-ting could be so fatal? Lots of great stunts and choreography. Very creative! <br /> <br /> Add Johnny Wang to the mix and you've got a great ultimate showdown! Manchu does not mess with thugs; They are cruel!
