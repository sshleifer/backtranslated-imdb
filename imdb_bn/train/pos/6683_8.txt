Forget the depth of the money, leave your reasoning at the door and take a great time with this humblely funny, totally unreasonable, ultra-camby live-action "cartoon". MYSTERY MEN You have sent any superhero flick text, but its unlikely super-vans are so attractive, diverse and well-thrown that they have memorable characters in their own right. Dark humor, cruel silliness, honest action, even a touching moment or two, lover gathered to visualize this trick about a true winner.

Laugh, and say "huh?" Enjoy ... more than once!
