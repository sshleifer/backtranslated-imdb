A beautiful movie about Mukshin's first love story. Everyone is probably one, and the story of writer-director Yasmin Ahmad, a son named Muchsin. We know that his movies attract half-autobiographical attention, his personal experience, and actually translates and translates these emotions into big screens, which his films always blurted out of a sincere sincerity and honesty. The mouthpiece is no different, and probably the most polished advertising is confident today (though I can certainly add it as a personal person that still has a special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> Our favorite family is Paktu Akatan, Maak Inam, Orchid and Kak Yam, although at this time we returned to the 10-year-old Orcad. From the movies we have given from Rabun to Garabara, all of the characters are small, and here, Sharifah Amani's sister Sharifah Ariana and Sharifah Aliya took the role of Orakad and Mak Inam respectively, which is probably responsible for their excellent chemistry on screen, they do not think That they are playing the role of siblings. It seems that the only constant crow is played by Yama, Adivah Noor, even the husband has a hair on his head! Through Mukin's film, we came in the whole circle with character, and Yasmin introduced us to the world. We learn more about the family and to learn, the day they are still camping (returned to RUBUN), where Orcades visit a Chinese school, and packing some serious adjustments of the fifths, you are surprised by the explosion of the Guru's strength, well, at the young age Had him!). Family's annual dome and pointing child, she likes to play with psycho-musical players with girls' Mashak-Masak, and include favorite outfits to accompany family to football matches. <br /> <br /> Calm for the arcade to come in a village called Matsin (Mohammed Saifi Nasheed), and provides a cool colleague for bicycling, climbing trees, bites flying, and flying through the village. And the way it can be done, the crossing of the line between friendship and romance is both beautiful. <br /> <br /> There are fascinating moments of Mushkine which brings stories and brings smiles, because in some cases, we could have experienced it myself, and sometimes our own recollection of childhood will serve as a threat. In short, those scenes shouted "fun"! We see the life of a common camp, where some neighbors are very nice, others, dirty Parker and rumors spread, which are bored of jealousy. There are two more family dynamics in there, one from the immediate neighbor and the other is Muksin's own, both of which work as adequate mistress and in contrast with Orcad itself. [6] <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a special song for the superb music and Muksin, along with the song "Hugan", as well as the song "Ne Me Quiet Pass", which has been arranged today by Jasmine The same characters, its beauty is that you can see them standing alone, or when watching and penning together, a separate family drama is divided into different themes and various romances, Works on universal issues related to love and forgiveness. The spokesman will definitely see many links in previous films of Mushkine, when the new audience must be curious to find out the significance of the strange character or the phenomena of events, such as the little boy stealing the sight of the ordeal <br /> <br>> and whys, The part of the mouthpiece is very weird, which is probably Yasmine's style distinctive, or deliberately left such as. I remember remembering from memory as a story about childhood, then the details will be confirmed. And undoubtedly, I felt that Muksin has shown this perfectly, with so much detail and focus on what can be remembered in important episodes between the two. <br /> <br /> Another highly recommended movie and one rare one I feel suitable for all ages - bring along with your child brother or sister!
