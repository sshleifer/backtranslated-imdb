A very weird and compelling movie. This is a very painful and hardly harmful person who tries to navigate his life as a fund / salesman at the door. The director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served well stories. Finding a great deal of humor in the millennium with life is original and uncertain. There is a sequence in a test facility that really stands and laughs loudly to me that I can not do as often as I can. I've seen it for a long time, one of the more memorable movies. I have not lost my mind and I look forward to Bronstein's future efforts. Excellent performance around. Simple line "I really appreciate it." Now I have a symbol.
