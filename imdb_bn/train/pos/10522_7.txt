This is a good adaptation of Aston's novel. Good, but not bright. <br /> <br /> The cinematography inventor, crossing the border to the towel repeatedly, but of course it can be avoided by watching this as an annoying TV soap in the curiosity, since the whole story is spoken in conversation. <br /> <br /> capable of acting. Ms Paltrow differs as needed in her character, but the necessary distance from other characters along with much less suitable isolation from her own action. In other words, he does not seem to take enough care in his match-making effort. Supporters cast much more for praising some of the extra - guilty status but without a place in the motion picture. Personally, I had problems in accepting Alan Kumking as Mr. Elton - without any fault of his own self, it is difficult to accept any serious part except leaving this impression as a gay trolley-dolly in "High Life". Acting honor goes to Tony Colette, who was able to develop warmth and Jeremy Northam, who took his character to the right level.
