I have not read Kurt Vongut's novel, or anything else, but now I want to start. It keeps you from the first frame and does not release the last credits until the rolling starts. You do not expect space, you are interesting around the plot. Passing is spot-on, nothing is very long lasting and it does a perfect job to keep balance between unexpected twists and process the viewer that we saw. It is well said and thought well. I have never seen a movie that I think I can compare it specially. It's intense and exciting, as well as fun and sad. Acting is remarkably brilliant, the goodman again proves that he will not have to go for a smile, and Li and Armin Spellbinding I could go, really ... no introduction is treated less than the performance of the stella. Editing and painting are wonderful, and with all the wonderful, awesome and wonderful one visible, great. In addition to other films directed by the book's author Keith Gordon, along with other two apparently related to this. One view of sexuality, and many of these annoying and insomnia content. I recommend this to anyone that can appreciate it; It's not nice. 8/10
