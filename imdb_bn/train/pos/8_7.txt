Very good drama, though the spectators have found some free space while filling the work for themselves. I can imagine that no one can lead a life that can not read or write. This picture only crushes the real world: The wife who suddenly is the only supporter, the live-in regional and their quarrels, the disturbed child, who gets divorced, and then leaves normally, to school, a jacks husband who takes Nest eggs and buy beer with it. 2 thumbs up
