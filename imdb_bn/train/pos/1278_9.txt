"The Last Big Thing" is a wonderful satirical film that gives the whip of pop culture simply on the point of humorous self-determination. Characters are so sunny / funny fun and interesting. Which brings me the role of what I liked most ... <br /> <br /> In the late 40's by the late 30's, 40, who created a pop-cultural editorial, "The Next Big Thing" Things are, this magazine does not really exist, and it's just an excuse to go around the actors in Simon's interview, just to duplicate them, to insult the ways of buying in pop culture His resident friend Darlao also wrote a magazine (which is real), which is mainly with him and Simon and his father, depending on how Darla looks at his neutral neurotics behavior, a true loving (or disgusting) character. Magda is a prostitute, character I Good choice, Brett is a flat character that does not have much to do with him, such as Tedra, the music-video queen for a bunch of rock band of B-rated. Naw, this character is a very interesting web weave together. And in this film, and why they are the motivations for all of them is the question. This is a wonderful movie and I indie / art house crowd can see it without. Mark my words <br /> <br />
