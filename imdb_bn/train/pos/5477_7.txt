In 2004, a truly unrecognized print of this amazing movie was discovered at the Congress Library, and in 2005 it was shown in several famous theaters around the world. According to the online reviews I received, the original has all the nastiest dialogs and intuendos intact; They were removed in the studio or completely re-shot before being released initially to pass the New York State Sensor. I can read a DVD that is "expected in 2006" and hope only one! If we are really lucky, it will include comparisons between version 2. Note that the released sensor version is basically available in Laserdesk, which I have seen. Stanwyck rules!
