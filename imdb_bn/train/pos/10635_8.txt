I appreciate photography, textures, colors and light, unlike a comment, often. What was lacking for me was a coherent story. I found it difficult to often disjointed, badly edited and followed in difficult times. My version was 110 minutes, IMDB shows one at 125 meters. Perhaps the cut and subtitles did not help. I congratulate any film that exits from the Hollywood mold but this left me frustrated. Miss Guilan was brilliant and the performance was all right, I wanted a little more dialogue. If someone wants to see some other film related to this picture, try 'Hydus Kinky' with Kins Winslet.
