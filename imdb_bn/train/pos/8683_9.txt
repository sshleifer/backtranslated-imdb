"Death Lendes and Hand" is one of the early stages of "Columbo", which helped define show for next thirty years. It identifies Robert Culp's four appearances (as the three murderers), playing the same role in every show. <br /> <br /> In this case, Kulpad plays the chief breeder of Big Intelligence. Asked for an investigation whether the manager of a wealthy newspaper Major Generator Kenyenik Although she is, she decides not to tell her husband, hoping that her husband can blackmail his wife to return her information to business partners about snippets. He responded poorly to this suggestion, an argument that quickly becomes violent and Bermar faces him. Because he is wearing a big ring, the blow hits him on the ground and kills him. <br /> <br /> There are some infinite moments of this episode. One of my favorite scenes where Colombo seems to be pretending to palm-reading, although it really knew that a ruse to discover the shape and size of the ring of Bermer without recognizing that the murderer would wear a ring. Columbo is Columbo, revealing what he really knows exactly when he only starts to screw a little. So first he secretly plays a part of the available man, who is "lifelong living on the waves of the moon" or is critically acclaimed by a palm-reading Mumbai-Jumbo. <br /> <br /> A great view is to try to stop him from blocking his nose, while another Colombo tries to give Bermar a job for his firmness. Again, Colombo does not say that he knows what is happening, he pretends to be respected and excited by the offer of this work. <br /> <br /> Another place where Colombo tells Kenikot in front of the Brimer, he wishes the good wishers can listen to their conversations. He wanted to indicate to Bremer that he was directly on his face without accusing him, so he decided to play Bimmer in Minggu (but understand the circumstances) cruelly and decided to fool him a bit by making fooling him. Of course he does! All the time, the tragedy is not aware of the symptoms of this conversation. Colombo is explained to everyone by the end of the conclusion (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not publish how Colombo is finally able to prevent the killer, but say that potatoes are involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> A really really good episode, probably the best of the first series. If you like it, you will like "Double Exposure", also features Robert Coolpe.
