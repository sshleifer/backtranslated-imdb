This story is known throughout the long running Tom and Jerry cartoons, especially in the 1940s, the only difference is that instead of one, two cats are threatened with no threat by the mouse (Jerry). Tom has an anonymous friend ("Boch?") Living in his house, so it really takes away "Mammy to Shoes", who can not believe that there are two cats in their house with the mouse. <br /> <br /> However, Jerry can be captured while others are still in the boot, so the competition is going on! <br /> <br /> Although it's a familiar area, I still enjoy it because the cartoon's real eye sight was entertaining. You just did not compete as a parody of the cats as well as the opponent of Jerry, so if you gaga enough to recommend to Tom and Jerry fans.
