Actor Harman Hussain plays football as a football entrepreneur, who earned the passes of two African players and tried to sell them for a very small amount to Benfica (his heart's club), FC Porter's rival club, so did not play well with the players, and wanted that FC port was wrong with this. But what happens is that these two players are well and FC Porto sells them for a lot of money at a foreign club, doing a good business. The film, for a small country like Portugal, without a great predecessor in the great movie, is a very good and funny comedy, which shows all the challenges existing between North / South Portugal (FC Porto / Benfica). Highly recommended
