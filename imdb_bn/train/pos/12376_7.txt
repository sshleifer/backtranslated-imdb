An all-star actress seems so impressive that it appears as "Mad mad mad mad world" of horror images, "The Sentinel" (1977), but still an effective hazardous film centered around the unexpected actress Christina Reyns. In this case, he plays a fashion model, Alison Parker, who thinks Brooklyn Heights brown stone (which is very far away on this late date) that is very close to Hell's entrance. And as a tenant of this building, he is suffering from a very bad condition of lucky plumbing and occasionally watering bugs to soften! In fact, the scene of Alison facing his suffocating neighbors is really horrible, and of course the visitors should send ice water to the fork. Despite the complaints of many critics about the ability to act in the rain, I thought he was good, wanted to hold his own position in the scenes of Awa Gardner, Barjes Meridith, Arthur Kennedy, Chris Sardon and Eli Wallach. The picture effectively turns out to be an effective conclusion, and although some plot points are undefined, I feel more than satisfied. The book "DVD Dealerium" says, "Beverly D'Angelo and Silvia Miles can not be as bad as any of the canned lasers in any movie writers!" As well as keeping an eye on Sentinel House, I went to 10 Montague Terrace of Brooklyn Heights. Yes, it is still there, and the upper cavity breaks the huge quote and looks like it's in the picture, even though there is a blind priest / noon in the upper floor. If this room is actually sitting on the entrance to hell, I'll take the hell out of Brooklyn Queen's Expressway. But we know that for some time in New York!
