Before that, I wrote that I liked the "Titanic", at the end of it (repeatedly) screaming, and I was a 60-year-old man. I wonder why this wonderful movie has received so many awards and was appreciated by many critics, given the rating of 7.0 only by imdb.com users. <br /> <br /> Well, I broke broken user ratings 29.0% of all votes got 10 ratings, 10.7% rated it 1 rating. This 10.7% of these unreasonable IMDB users, overall, overall rating pulled down 7.0. <br /> <br /> In my previous comments, I blamed the pattern of this unusual vote (only 1 rating with high rating, gradually gradually, and then suddenly returning the course and jumping to the rating level) is only one Thing: Hate for Leonardo DiCaprio. Believe me, I've tuned in ample chat rooms to see young people (young men, mostly), who are ironic by her left and right defame. They absolutely hate people and will have no part in giving them a loan in their "Titanic". (To answer another user: I'm not talking about someone who does not really like the movie and gave it a 5 or 6, etc. Everyone has their own taste, but no one can trust me that for the "Titanic" Only 7.0 overall IMDB ratings, dragged by each other's ridiculous 1 rating, is an appropriate reflection of overall motion picture.) <Br / > <br />> Show my point in the 5 randomly selected box office and the IMDB user voting pattern 5 randomly selected box office and critical "bomb" (there are many more, but this will prove my point). The "Hevens Gate" (1980) was quickly pulled from the theater after showing at the very box office, and IDDB voters had ratings: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 rating (overall rating of 6.1). "Big Top Pie-Way" (1988) 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% rating (Total rating 4.5) "Cat man" (1982) received 6.1% rating and received 2.6% rating (overall rating of 5.8). "Blind Date" (1987) 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 rating (overall rating 5.3). "Junk" Jack Flash "(1986) 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% received 1 rating (5.2 total rating). Are all these movies COMMON with "theoretical"? Their 1 percent rating is all low !!!! Compared to "theoretical", and these stenchers were sometimes nominated for a single prize. Again, "Titanic" received 10.7% rating! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
