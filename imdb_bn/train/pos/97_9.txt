This was my favorite Christmas special that I hope they leave my VPS or DVD, because my 33 RPMs are lost, and I've made any cassettes. <br /> <br /> I was a big fan of Denver's fan but was very impressed with the song, which was mostly traditional favorites with Muppate Spin (SP Little Saint Nick!), it contains some less familiar songs (original?). <br /> <br /> At the end of 70 this event was over. Hope to find a copy soon !!!
