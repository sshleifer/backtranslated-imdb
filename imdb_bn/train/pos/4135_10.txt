This is a very charming movie, one of my favorite romantic comedies. It's very ridiculous and cast surprising. Lawrence Olivier is mostly associated with Shakespeare's work, but he sees in the film that he is not limited to playing in classical theater only. He manages the transition of feminist divorce solicitors, who try to avoid the lover's love for dogs, who try to avoid women and their treacherous ways, which are easily operated by Merrill Oberon. The dialogue is surprisingly surprising and refreshing and the atmosphere is wonderful. Ralph Richardson was a joy to look good. I highly recommend it.
