This movie was beautiful. It was memorable imagery, well-played, and touching subject. It's very easy to write because it's very sensitive, but it's a feeling that is trying to achieve this movie. I was completely involved in the publication and presentation of the story. There were some Chess shots, but a religious promotion was expected on the film. The only complaint I can accept is that there was not a ton of details. However, this movie was not designed to explain Joseph Smith's life, ministry, win, debate, failure, etc. It was designed for a quick surveillance on some highlights in one of the most wonderful American and historical religious identities of all time.
