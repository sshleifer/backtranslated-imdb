It is a free adaptation of Clarence Mulford's novels; Fans of William Boyd will probably feel a little bit of the ocean (and reviews here reflect this). But I knew about hopping from the first novel, and I did not care much about bad movies for them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead, he reached as a part of the cassidy story which we had known as America; Or what old critics once called 'homeopun'. Until the film was unveiled, I thought more about Mark Tower's "Ruffing It" version of the famous "Hallmark Theater", describing James Garner. <br /> <br /> These two films remind us that even though movies for the Americans 'Old Western' may always be mythological, they do not have to be 'Western'; They could only be movies about what they were going to be in America very well at that time. <br /> <br /> I never saw this movie; There is no effort to prevent the Boyd-Cassidian heir to be below our throat, no mockery, no camp. As a result, I got a feeling of these characters - such as roaming or riding a horse - I could walk around a few hundred years ago in some real Western America. <br /> <br /> Similarity of this picture - it can positively avoid anything we call "style" - all are on its side; And actor flat play fits nicely with this; Well, it really looks like some stories near Campfire in a cattle drive - no visual clothes, just jokes and good humor and sudden violence - which we hope from a good description of the adventure twist. I was surprised to see this picture very surprised, and if the spectacular expectations of the audience were kept aside, they would enjoy enough of it. <br /> <br /> I could have given this picture 9-stars, but I'll only do it for ten days because most reviewers have missed the point altogether; Note 1: One critic complained that Hapalong shot dead people in this film but rather complained of gunfire in their hands. (Cassidy of Ala Boyd); First, in the cassidy novels, dead people were shot; Secondly, if the cassidy was a genuine cowboy, he would kill people - the problem with guns shot from human beings is that they could always get another gun - which could be part of the film's theorem. Note 2: I admit that I am jealous of the Coppola family, among them there are directors of "The Godfather" who can get the chance to make films that I can not; But a good movie is a good movie; And it's a good movie. If it is by someone named "Kopola", well, it's just like that. America's land of opportunity (or not to the office until Bush) - it's all about America's famous novels.
