A brilliant movie about family, crime, sacrifice, betrayal, and love. Macy is such a great actor. It was almost embarrassing to see Campbell in the same scene, who saw part of a neurotic sex object but did not need to work with script level for the script. But he was such a good actor that he played towards his level to create the scene. I appreciate Tracey Ullman welding as a neglected wife. Who knew Sutherland is very good. The character of the way he's going to appear is tall (and even small in some scenes). Almost everyone knows what they are doing. <br /> <br /> Illustration of Messi's only situation, which is not able to beware of her character, nothing less than full skill.
