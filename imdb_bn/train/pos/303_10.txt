As it came in 1981, I saw this picture from that day, it is my top 3 favorite. I wrote to Amazon for the blogger below, and I am very excited that it is coming out from the DVD on 10/17/06 - the 25th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br /> The final credit for this photo has given him an explanation - "Thanks to the people of Manhattan, whose island was painted on it." A charming and wicked romantic comedy, a love story written by New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify each location (West 12th Street, Ansonia, old FAO Shiverts, Plaza, Roxy, Chase Brigat, and a city and the west Club City Simi Limits). Many people think that by clicking on the whole group they click on the off-screen, and this intimacy is clearly communicated. I laughed, I was crying, it was better than the CATS. Dorothy Stratton was not only present in Audrey Hepburn's last feature (her subsequent fall in the film) and her inner beauty screen from the screen. Buy it, make a big pop of popcorn and curl up with your love.
