Swallow Green I found an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want Logan's run you would like it. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is old and has no special effect and some of the acting can be described as a "chessy" but the story is wonderful. <br /> <br /> How the world can be and how bad its impact on society is. <br /> <br /> Finally, the mystery was not a mystery, but the story was easily revealed at the right pace. <br /> <br /> How it is displayed in the United States will be "Dark Angel" equivalent to the modern day. Be the third world country.
