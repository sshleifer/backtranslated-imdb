"All of them have laughed." Among these little films, I always recommend finding something from ordinary friends. It is firmly rooted in past sculp romance traditions, but seems more contemporary. Even in the 80's decade it does not have too much dates. Bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole lighting enterprise on his feet, the fact that it is not crashing down the earth. But, that said, sweet small movies depend entirely on the actor to continue this type of, and "TAL" are happy by a dream cast who understand the requirements of such stories. This is a film that will not be delayed in memory if it is not available for a little while by a nice cast: The call of the Colin camp together with John Rotor and his dog; Blah Nova unleashing all the hair from her hat; And especially Dorothy Straton falls for John Ritter and says, "how ... weird." It is a piece that does not want to give too much on it to fear the lungs, but it is certainly a light heart and goes with a smile on face.
