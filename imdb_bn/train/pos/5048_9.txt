It is a very dark and playful horror genre thriller based on the concept of religious murder. In Texas, a Texas resident who ordered the release of bad people in the United States, he suddenly happened to be assassinated with two young boys. <br/> <br /> Bill Paxton, who commanded this film, known as the Father of Despair, who was known as the Hand of God Killer, and Matthew McConaughey played her best as her oldest son, Fenton Mix. The film revolves around Fenton and decides that he and he can not keep the burden of his childhood childhood, and the FBI agent Wesley Doyle (played by Powers Booth) uses flashbacks to tell the story in hunting. <br /> <br /> I do not remember many movies that literally end up seeing their audience end up with their seats and it is certainly one of them. Even if you want to stop watching, you will not be able to free this movie. <br /> <br /> Directors have portrayed this film very well and they help set up the plot through good scenes. . The acting of this movie is great but if there is a flaw, some parts are very strong and can disturb some people. <br /> <br /> The concept of this film is very dark, but young children reflect ideas through brilliant acting. It is really a spinal exciting movie and it is sure to have you edge of your seat across it. I'm very scary, annoying and powerful, or anyone who just wants to see something different, would recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
