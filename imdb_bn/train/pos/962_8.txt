I just finished watching this movie and I must say that I was so impressed. Everything about it was fantastic. Acting characters, stories Grow in a credible child brave, always willing to help others. Her mother would be proud. I could not close this image for some absence. It's morality, clever and scary sprites and 'monsters' but prefect fable / story with heartwarming folks. A child who became a hero poked and bullied. In the local village festival, a rider and a journey to Goblin Mountain, where he invented Yokai, has invented wonderful phenomena that will make Brian Fraud proud. And the bad Kato and his closed sider who definitely need a hug. These evil people hold Yokiye and throw red utensils beside unwanted objects like motorbikes and other mechanical things, and they enter into a terrible violent robotic monsters, whose only act is killed. Takashi is a young boy, a red man / dragon, a turtle and a river prince, along with a beautiful little creature as well as the United States, because they could turn it into an ugly toy and sell it. It's all good toys stores. The line is good, especially if it does not try to bring your kids kids and other splendor that smiles on your lips. Believe the suspense and see this with a baby or enjoy! Although I must admit that the end was very bad. And not necessarily so. Cheers Fornon
