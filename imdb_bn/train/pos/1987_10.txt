That movie was awesome! I can not get over the song. I think I'm old for musicals, but the movie is worth getting some credit here, guys! My special favorite was Jack Wild. I am a British actress lover, you can not prevent me from appearing young people in front of those beautiful faces. I did not know that when Jack was working in that movie, he was 16 years old! She looks like an eleven year old. He is short, that helps. Try posting your answer, colleague poster, so I can relate to your experience. Oh, and Oliver Reid, that guy, Bill Six, I think the drone appearance is really familiar. Any idea where he played before? If so, post it, I really want to know.
