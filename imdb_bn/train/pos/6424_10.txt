As a child, I think, nine or ten years old and love this movie. It was the whole Bollywood action / comedy film. This is probably an imitation of bad boys! The identity of the whole swapping but two pair pairs pull out everything from the window of arrival and then the arrival of the colorful villains of dance and singing! Photo action scenes are revolutionary but still not surprising scenes. The film was really very funny and Amitabh Bachchan had very good expectations. Govinda is always a jewel and probably it is probably his best work, he shines as well as shine as well as providing the best comedy scenery available in Indian cinema. <br /> <br /> The song ... is both interesting and interesting .......... When you least expect it, laughs laughing ... Amitabh Bachchan is surprisingly very funny and you have 'Bade Mia' As laughing ... its pronunciation ... body language ... bright ... <br /> <br /> 'Aashi Chattki Nab Ray Dal' is the best song ............ .. ridiculous.
