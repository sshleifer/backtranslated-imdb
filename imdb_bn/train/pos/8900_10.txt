This is a terrific classic giant flick from 50! I just love the look of 50s of normal cars and songs. However, I like the way Blues looks. When everyone is in a horrible night of the theater, I love it and the blob comes and cries the party. Another thing about it is that it happens all over one night, like Halloween II. <br /> <br /> When Steve and Jane are out, they see a meteor fall from space. The tattoos are inside the blob. Whenever a person eats blob, it becomes bigger and bigger. They try to convince the people of the city to blubby giant, but nobody then believes them. Can somebody stop this blobi animal? I highly recommend blog !!!
