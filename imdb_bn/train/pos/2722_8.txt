Based on the Capitus book, this entertaining feature of the 1959 infamous comedy Brooks and the cinematographer is made in black and white, it gives a documentary feel. Killer from Blake and Wilson and as a police force in Forosheth, they are doing their best. The scenes leading up to the murder, in the actual room where the image took place, is presented with a storm wind soundtrack, quite intense and cool. Brooks Vero indicates a lot and uses various interesting conversions in the scene. The only complaint is that it is overlong a bit, dragging the denouement and with a little preacher.
