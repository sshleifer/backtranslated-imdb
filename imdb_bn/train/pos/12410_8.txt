This is a great example of what can be done in a small budget movie. The performance is excellent considering the script and the entire atmosphere of the movie is very predictable. The gourmet is well-done and used at least (look for excellent barbarian-wire death) and when using it the action is fifty. It is true that the script has a dodgy line, but it is rarely comparable compared to other movies in the same movie (or big!) Budgets. Overall, these are recommended. I believe, it is better than shown! 8/10
