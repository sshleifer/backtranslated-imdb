And this one is mine. And not just me, I can see the time when going to IMDB or the theater. Why do people love it? It is clear: Everyone now knows Jumbo (at least in the heart of the devotee's heart and others, through the "Donation of the dead" renewal or Resident Evil Cinema etc) or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... as long as This movie came along. And you'll see zombies in a new light (probably). This is not a horror film, although it has some violent scenes but it's a comedy. To be precise a mockery. And it does not run out of steam! So I rated it so high. According to pissing it is incredible, great acting and there is no (obvious) mistake of the script ... the opposite side: it is a jewel and if you are interested only in zombie you will have to see it! Even if you dislike them, check it out! Because it's a great comedy movie!
