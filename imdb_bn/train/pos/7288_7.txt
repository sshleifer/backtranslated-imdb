This is an absolute classic for pictures camp. That's why it was an Elvira and MST3000 classic. Everyone knows the story. The Scientist lives in a home-based pan in his home in the head of his boyfriend, when he moves to the city and tries to find the body by examining local girls. Finally he encounters a square to find a real hour glass body at the top of the head of the chick. The scattered head makes friends with the failed examination of the closet and the remaining "good" arm of the cone assistant (not right from its previous failure), comes out of the closet and rips and the whole place is burnt down. <br /> <br /> The film was so afraid of us that my friend could not go for one year for the basics. Like the kids we've played in the greatest movies of all time and this number was four. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the impressive effect due to impressive production and strange sex centers when the scientist looks for the body (sound Full of words) fears hell from innocent children, but ridiculous aspects make it the main ingredient for conversation and smile. I could see this picture tonight and enjoy when I look forward to seeing "Chicago" with the dentist. <br /> <br /> I can give it the most, because its entertainment value is merely a fate. Movies, as a movie, a disaster.
