This movie is the best film ever. I can not remember the fact that the film has tears from me. With a tear in my eyes, I appreciate this movie. It contains elements that must be accompanied by a good film: extraordinary dialogue, music, acting, stories / plots. Loyalty in a street acting with friendship, courage, sincerity and brain and selling a small girl who sold as a son in the Sarf market. The little girl liked her granddaughter and mask king liked a grandson. They were not conventional in the real. Each scene they were together was invaluable. The camera work is flawless and you grip The acting is inspired. Zhu Zhu was excellent as the mask king. Zhou Rening "dog" looks beautiful and very well played her character. Jiang Zhao was great as Liang São Lêng. He is very helpful, played his helpful and kind character. If you do not find this movie, try it once, see it.
