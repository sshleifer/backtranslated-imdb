On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the liberation war of the film, I had the privilege of watching Scaffeas with its beautifully restored 35mm print. It was great to watch on the big screen because it lost most of its television sets and overall the overall emphasis of this project is not enough. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this edition, in the early 1980s, people in Cuba came to America with America. Tony and his associates quickly shut down the political personality of Tent City and get green cards after being briefly at the Cuban restaurant; Tony turned towards the complete destruction of his destructive way. <br /> <br /> Most characters in this movie have played with efficiency, which seems to have forgotten the film in the last twenty years. Robert Loggia, Frank Lopez, as Tony's sponsor. Her character is very defective by the believer, and Tony figures as quickly as soft,. Lopez's right hand, Omar Suarez is our best actor F. Murray Ibrahim (Amadeus.) Suarez is extremely fat and will do something for Frank; It's like it has a mind of its own. Tony quickly saw it and he always fought with Suarez, but on the way to the top, he saw him as only a minor problem. The character that is so completely played back to me is the mischievous Miami Narcotics Intelligence Intelligence by Mail Bernstein, Harris's Eulin (Training Day) mail. Seeing signs of both departing from Frank and Mail, he stopped Frankie from Taunki. It's impossible for Frank to hear that Mail is being asked to interconnect, Tony told him to kill him only to kill him, 'this is your tree frank, you're sitting in it.' This Frank came from Frank's protection! <br /> <br /> Tony's brightness has turned upside-down and his speed and brightness resonated with speed and intensity. After Frank stopped and after taking his wife and business Tony's greed and he does not seem to get enough. Tony goes deep into the world of inadmissibility, such as drug abuse, greed, and faith, and eventually he loves his eldest friend and sister and dies and gets married. Till now all of this set up that Tony's compounds were dropped by the soldier from his supplier, who felt betrayed because Tony would not go through any political assassination. These conditions became a sympathetic moment when Tony refused to be a partner in the assassination of the murderer's wife and children. <br /> <br /> All this is a great example of extra cocaine culture in the 1980's. The fastest ongoing three-hour movie around DePalma makes it an excellent job holding together it together. Violence is extremely graphic and there are some scenes in which a viewer's mind will be purified forever, especially the terrible chances are seen, two point blank shots on the head and the entire bloody Melie ending in the film. This is a highly recommended stylistically complete movie which is not for Schuimish, or for those who need end-to-end and potential sequels; DePalma let it fly all right here.
