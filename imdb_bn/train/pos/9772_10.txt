Theodore Rex is perhaps the greatest film experience ever, and certainly a milestone in human culture, civilization and artistic expression! This compulsory intellectual, best poetry, Jonathan R. Beluel has fostered himself with the best filmmakers of the 20th Century, such as Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scarque, Orson Wells and Roman Polanski. Special effects are nothing less than breathtaking, and no work by Spielberg trite and initial look. During the liberation war, Theodore Rex was such a revolutionary jewel that it promoted the film making bar to the level expected by filmmakers. Not only is it the concept of creating a motion picture with a dinosaur, but an action packed, adventurous detective novel, an action packed, thrilled with a "dialogue" dinosaur with a modern name called "Theodore" and an existing female police officer. The concept of adaptation of the detective novel. Humanity we know it. The world can not face such a beautiful beauty. See Theodore Rex, you look very much to look at God's face and listen to him "You're my favorite creator." This is just one of the few movies that easily sinks !!!
