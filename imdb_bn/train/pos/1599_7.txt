A beautiful little picture directed by "Moonstrack" great story Taylor, Norman Jeussison (Night Hit, Fidler on the Roof, The Hurricane) Many levels of film are great. It shows a good part of Italian culture, has a touching romance and (best of all) a ridiculous humor. <br /> <br /> I liked the most about this movie, the relative unusual appearance of actors. Nicholas Cage seems to be a bit weird for the film, and the chairs ... Well, the chairs always look a bit weird. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a fun movie and easy to offer. <br /> <br> 7 out of 7.4
