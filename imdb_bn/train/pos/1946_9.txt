I was not a really big fan of Star Trek until the last 2-3 years. Thank you for posting Netflix Arrival and 2000 Video Technology Vocabulary, I've been able to get past all the great Star Trek episodes. Those who do not see every single episode and do not know by their heart, TNG, DS 9, Viagara etc, the general popularity is to say - "I like next generation" is the best. Because the Captain Picard and his crew were fresh, the first stars appeared after decades of starvation trekker's hunger. But to be honest, I appreciate the creativity of Viger's episode more than TNG. Episodes of the Voyager also proceed through time against the TNA. The information obtained from TNG is great, but it is old but Voices doctor - now it's creativity! Instead of making artificial intelligence curious and disgusting, give freedom to express beyond what you imagined. Picardo is not just such a great actor, but has established himself as a doctor for his extended, self-growth, self realization now science fiction! Endgame illustrates him as a married husband in order to disobey the captain's order to discover "biological", "discovery of neuro-implant transceiver for human interface," and even to invent an episode before the endgame and to create "human" errors. Blessing 2 beautiful women from the 1st episode, like the DS 9, Voigar will have to survive for 3 seasons except Jeremy Ryan and I believe Picardo carries it with their personality. Of course Castor chemistry of Viaguer is simply flowing through the rest, Harry Kim and Tom Paris - very normal. Despite being Vulcan I, Tuvoc occasionally ludicrous love. Finally, I'm glad they got rid of that real lady captain - oh, if you see rare footage - thank God for Kate! He has been developed into a highly confident, credible, and respectable female captain for 7 years. What a great job! Thank you Star Trek for creating Viagara, I enjoy each episode, creative search of possibilities, morality and our cosmic expansions.
