The first of two Jim Thompson adaptations to be released in 1990 (the second most well-known crew), after the Dark Thompson has all the hallmarks: dangerous women, self-confidence, and characters that do not suspect others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jason Patrick is a great boxer who was incapable of playing for life due to a ring incident (Director James Folie Raging Bully-Esquier Ramsing Bull-Esquier order used to use ROMs. Back story) and very little-seen-Rachel Ward delivered a great performance. But Bruce Dern's secret weapon: his sweet-talking Uncle Bud always ordered him in every scene. <br /> <br /> There is almost no comic relief in this movie, so be prepared to make it void. .
