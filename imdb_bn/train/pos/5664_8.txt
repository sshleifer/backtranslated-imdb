I really like this show. I can easily see how it has achieved the status quo. It's original, and stimulating thoughts. However, for some reason, I did not feel similar resonance that it could be. It is open door from a public premises, and does not pack winter cooler types. Every time I see an episode, I persuade myself and impose it for answering some unenumable, ineffectual questions. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying just following this opinion, and my opinion is just before I continue. Different strokes for different people <br /> <br /> I liked to see more scenes in the "American Gothic" shoot at night. There is a lot of stir in this show, and I think it was the tendency to prevent suspense. We are not afraid of daylight. We are concerned about what's in the shadows. The devil always does not have the details. What we are not seeing is often the most horrific. <br /> <br /> second - and probably that which is probably going to be Tor, and feathers: Gary Cole is an extraordinary talented actor ... character actor. I followed her career in the film of Brady Baugh, that is why she hurts to tell me that she was probably mistaken as Lucas Buck. He is very much liked to be an evil embodiment, almost too petroichan, even by biblical values. Lucas Buck is a narcotic. She is heroin. She is freebasing in a kitchen laboratory next to a gallon of Drain-O. If you go back, you know that the end will be madness, and death. He will be like the final debt shark. He is a creator of books, but illogical condemnation. Of course. You've got the money, and many times before you are also going to break the finger; An isolated arm, a decapitated head, and finally, an enemy soul. One of the frustrations to look at the speech is, and whenever he is surrounded, there should be an immediate, surrounded finality - with daily air related to the air. <br /> <br /> It's all big, all strings attached, and you understand that time, you will know that it's too late. <br /> <br />, which led me three: they showed a little more. He is, in most of the scenes, in fact, that can defeat his side. The next door to the Sheriff will be like the Puranas. She is known for the apocryphal. Many people can 'recognize' him, but only those who are unhappy can recognize him. She wants to be the perfect person for flashback stuff, and cryptic conversations, and this plot exposition, Nick Sheri's film was sub-directed. <br /> <br /> Four, the show is very self-respecting - for a fault, something can say - and it is characterized by the stairs of the serial pilot "Meet Meat at the Fishing Hall". I think we've already established that Cassidy, and what Rommy is shooting for Andy Ander Taylor. We probably did not need the idea of ​​distributing it through the FED X. I got together in the first five minutes, for me, the head piano was unnecessary. <br /> <br /> For these comments, for me, created a good show. I realized that the producers had their own, unique style and there were many hands in the soup. In their endless search of LCD programming, this network plays a specific role in the death of this series. <br /> <br /> These at least can accomplish this corrosive-off sues properly. <Br /> <br /> Get real. <br /> <br /> In any way, it is the same serious damage to fans of both guardians, and casual visitors.
