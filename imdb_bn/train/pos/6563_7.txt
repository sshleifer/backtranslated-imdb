Jack Speed ​​is a movie that lacks a thing ?? A charismatic lead. Unfortunately this is something that really captures the whole film and it's a shame because it's a fun enough script and an interesting, if derivative, a fun action movie with prizes. Even though its origin could probably go back to the success of the Indiana Jones Trilogy ?? The film actually plays a little bit like 'Stone Romancing' on the opposite side. It is not a romantic adventure fiction writer that leads her creativity into some kind of courage. It is an adventure fiction character (which chronicles its own events) that leads to a normal woman in one of her events. <Br> <br /> When a young girl goes missing in Paris, her sister Margaret (played by relative Karin Coppins) is involved with the decorated hero Jake Speed ​​(Wayne Crowford) and his Sidekick Dennis (Dennis Christopher). The real and the very defective people who have taken their lives in the history of their African War in the heart of the African state, and finally the delicious evil Sid (John Hart) and his ridiculous camp brother Morris (Roy London) among the two brothers' drunkards. That plot It's not a laboratory and it's not complicated, but the story that tells it does not require deep depth. <br /> <br /> Action sequences are offensive to start and it is true that the heroic fighters have entered through their necks. Whether caught between the government and rebel forces or thrown into a hay full of lions) and certainly there are some quite funny lines. However, it seems that the film ends and unfortunately struggles to find action sequences which do not begin to go on most of the places and eventually it becomes somewhat soft and annoying. However, if it is possible to choose Jack Speed, it is not a problem because of the performance of Wayne Croftford, it is difficult to care for what will happen. Now I do not know whether he was making himself a bit thin, because he was the producer and writer of the movie, or he was not only a good actor (as I have not seen him much), but he never believed Doc Savage, Indiana Jones and Jack Colton As a mix of rustle. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing because most other characters perform well in their role ?? Karen Coppins shares some nice banners with funny and firm and her character Jake (unfortunately it never believes). Dennis Christopher is perfect as archetypal sidekick and plays part with John Heart Camp tastes ?? Almost as he was a sixty years old Batman. In another film that he played almost strides about his few scenes excited in a ridiculous bitch accent. Not Sid Mariahi (she is portrayed as Nemesis of most of her earlier literature / books) but she is always keen to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack Speed ​​tried the same funny channel channel. Comet's Night '(A movie by Crowford was released a few years ago) and almost succeeded but missed ?? Which is embarrassing because Jake was good to watch in a few more events and might have been well served by a television series. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this curiosity application, but eventually it will leave a bit of tastes because most of the ingredients were there to do something really good.
