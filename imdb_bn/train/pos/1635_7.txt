In my high school days at Sallyina Kansas, they filmed something called "the brave young man of Weinberg" and the filmmakers were more prominent than the week. Finally, we learned that the film was "up academy up", and it was less "ummm" than it was to be credible. <br /> <br /> I saw it, because I was there, and was less than happy to show the local audience. I was 17 years old and thought that this was an effortless effort rather than an "Animal House" comedy post, which is directly fart jokes. <br /> <br /> I have seen it many times, and my opinion is somewhat lighter. It's stupid, but sometimes it's a crazy comedy magazine, at least for most of the "Mad TV". Ron Libman may hate it, but he is almost perfect, and unforgettable. For me, my favorite moment was a short scene of Santa Fe Avenue, where I parked my car, when I bought some guitar strings. My Pinto's short look is very bad, usually seems to get cut for TV. The new DVD was not seen, but if my old pintos are visible, they have a sale.
