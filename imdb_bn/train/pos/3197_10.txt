If you're a Crispin Glover fan, you will see this. If you are a Shan Pen fan, you will see this. If you are a movie fan in general, you will see this. If you have no idea what Craigspin Glover is, and you have no idea what is Shawn Pen, this film is probably more valuable, but you have seen more work by Krispin or Shan. <Br /> <br /> This movie is so funny, but also pure genius. There's nothing I know about this picture. This is its own section. I doubt it will ever be something like it again. I can not say anything more about why I did not spoil it partially, and here some other reviews have already done such a good job. <br /> <br /> It has given a bad review in response to any critics, I repeat that you see the film again. Actually, there is no movie that this movie can be called "boring". This is probably the most fun, most entertaining, and least annoying movie. And it only gets better with age and repeat visit. Unfortunately, very few people can claim to be able to show. <br /> <br /> The bright triangle of Trent Harriss, director of Beaver Trilogy, is also responsible for the amazing Rubin and Ed, which is also Crespin Glover. Unfortunately, this photo is very rare and difficult to find. Although I was able to find a VHS version after some diligent searches and there are a few ways to know about it. But I really wish someone would keep this onto a DVD.
