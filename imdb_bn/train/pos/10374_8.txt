I am sitting with a 45-minute roll of very good enjoyment. <br /> <br /> Roll is a country boy, Matt (Toby Malone), who dreams of becoming a sports star. Travel to Matt City and be picked by his cousin George (Damien Robertson). Well, whatever the plan, whatever. Joining George Gangster, Tinny (John Battelho) and a delivery for her. Needless to say, Matt is dragged into George's world. <br /> <br /> I thought how Matt George taught some morality and respect, when George can learn how to relax and enjoy life. Toby and Damien thrown together and did a great job. <br /> <br /> Every character in the film praised each other, two police were great. David Nagigumbujar brought some extraordinary humor in the film. Tinny played a favorite gangster who reminded me of my favorite character 'Pando' from the two hands. <br /> <br /> The other thing I liked about the roll was that it showed the growing cities. For 20 years lived in Perth and Frampton. I was good at seeing the sights and landmarks, especially the old Ferris wheel. "<br /> <br /> This rocks n rolls
