Like Arabian nights, this movie plays with story-centric conventions, so that there are plots, plots and other plans: it opens with a blind person's frame device that tells the story of his life, then it opens the flashback that takes us directly into the presence of blind people, where We discover that almost half of the stories have not yet been found. (It must be admitted that the second half does not live completely with the promise of the first one.) Like Arab Night, it is a mediator motif trying to chrome as much as possible in a task. A free genie, a beautiful princess, a flying carpet, a fantastic mechanical toy, a sea journey, a crowded market, a wicked vizier, jewels ... I do not know why it all works, but it does. Everything is just so beautiful. Set beautiful. June dupage is beautiful. Rozsa's score is particularly beautiful.
