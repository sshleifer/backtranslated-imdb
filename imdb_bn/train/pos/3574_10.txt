Sometimes a film is so effective why it is difficult to say. From the moment I came across "The Stone Boy", some told me it would be a great movie. Nevertheless, it seemed to me it was not actually the opportunity to see it. Then, one day, while searching for the online catalog of my local library, I found that they recently purchased the DVD release of this movie. Which I am very happy, because cinematography is a stunning depth and quality that can never replicate the old VHS copy. <br /> <br /> And cinematography does not say, as far as I'm the most stunning aspect of this film. As a photographer pursuing almost the ultimate visual style illustrated in "Stone Boy", I firmly believe that a great artist can carry a movie almost solo. Here, he helped a lot from the very talented Cast and a director who fully understood the story's needs. But behind the camera, Juan Ruiz officially gave Anciya something of beauty to every scene. And you can not say that almost. Most movies will not expect anything like this. After the scene the scene holds some details, some of the visual magic magic to take your breath a little bit. <br /> <br /> Director, Christopher Kain, had a long and exciting career. As far as I can collect, this film does not represent much of it. But, sometimes, before the start of his career, to get to the director, before all the big budgets and focus diminishes, there is a real fine magic. Kane returned to the film, let things happen to her life, and even more. Like early San Jose movies, characters are given space to breathe, while talking. Side stories are happening because they are, and that's how life is. Kane showed the pictures of human nature in a unique, raw, even painful understanding of this film. <br /> <br /> Most of this story is played together. When people are present in this movie, they act as real people, they do not play the characters. The Gina Berylt script allows the most talented and respected actor Wilford Bermelli, Robert Duval, Glenn Close, and Frederick Forest to spend time easily. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems strange that almost such a photo is almost forgotten. Perhaps the "Stone Boy" was more than what was made. In this decade of the 1970s, the movie feels that this picture reminds me of my own childhood. According to modern style and music people spoke in the 80's, but in 80 I did not live or think. The appearance of the images, the different acting and the intelligent quality, and the overall result is found in North America under the skin of any person or around this age. I see this myself. I saw how I saw the earth. And a movie like "Stone Boy" shows how it really looks for the world. <br /> <br /> For this feeling, please see: <br /> <br /> Black Stallion (1979) Never Cry Cry Wolf (1983), Tender Mercy (1983), Testament (1983), The Space In the Heart (1984), Matwan (1987), High Tide (1987), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), The Secret Garden (1993), The Secret of Royan Innis (1994), Wondi and Lucy (2008)
