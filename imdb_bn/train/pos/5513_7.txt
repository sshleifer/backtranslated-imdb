From what I read, many people were frustrated by this picture compared to Part 1. Initially I could understand it but after thinking a little bit it seems that they are wrong. Shadarbaugh is telling the true story of Che's life that he started from Part 1. Part 1 is a story of a revolution that started from the beginning of the beginning and eventually came to the conclusion of the successful conclusion. Part 2 tells the story of a revolution that concludes completely from the start of a worrying start. It is not a sordargue fault that these two parts of Cheyar's life have found a completely different result. He bravely likes to say both fairly simply. After part 1 of Part 2, it is much better to see the audience out of the movie, but Che's life is not my opinion, and my opinion is no blame. The film is far from perfect. It's probably too long. Successfully with the Guerrillas, we saw various aspects of war in Part 1. At Part 2 they could not catch a break and we see their numbers are being reduced by continuous death and capture. Che's capture and death are well dealt with. This film has increased greatly through the Spanish dialogue. Benicio del Toro is again as nice as the Argentine Argentine. So if you have seen Part 1, then you will see a very similar story in a different story in Part 2.
