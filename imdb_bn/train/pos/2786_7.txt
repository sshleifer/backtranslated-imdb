I am not surprised that this picture attracted viewers. Similar movies like Anita and me did not achieve such popularity as this movie, although I think probably the title of 'Bekham' in this title is more than anyone else. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant film by adding a brilliant message - If you are strong enough, then you can do something and remember it, which is a positive message to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it's a better film by Keira Knightley, and I think she was a brilliant actress, and it was nice for her role. Parimindra Nagra was also bright. Sadly, I can not say for Jonathan Rice-girl, because I do not think he was a good actor, and honest, his eyes were a little scared. <br /> <br /> Above all, a brilliant film, and a brilliant story
