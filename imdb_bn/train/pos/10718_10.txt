SpaceCamp is my favorite movie. It's a great story and inspiration to others. <br /> <br /> The acting was nice and I and his wife went to see Lee Thompson in cabaret a few years later due to his performance in the film. It is unfortunate that the Challenger accident is delayed and the film is hit. <br /> <br /> The 20th anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming. I knew one of the astronauts of Challenger and my father went to school since childhood at Karnigi Mellon campus; I know the late pilot's close friend. <br /> <br /> I had a technical squad for the National BSA for the Boy Scout Astronomy Merit badge last year and still found a great movie to recommend the SpaceCamp scouts. I teach about the space-related merit badge. <br /> <br /> I was running as an adult and once the late astronaut ran and when I challenged the challenger, we were simultaneously following the schedule of engineering education. I'm sitting with Willard Rockwell and his engineer, "Invisible", so after the accident of the attackers of ostretek stockholders, something happened after the incident happened, so I'm much closer to the accident and the similarity of a movie. I was convinced that I was a good student, and four years later, Rakwell suggested to the engineer that in 1986, the challenger had earned enough degree of excitement in order to not fly and later on to create Endeavor.
