The documentary began in NYSE in 1986, where black and Hispanic drag queues contain "balls". Where they dress up where they strat their stuff in front of the audience and where are voted. We learn a lot of members and see how they all keep together and support each other. As one man tells others - "There are three strikes against you - you are black, gay and a drag queen". These people (sadly) are not accepted in society - only in the balls. There they can be anyone and whatever they want and take. Then the film was released three years later (1989) and you will see how the things have changed (sadly for some). <br /> <br /> Depressed but it does not. Most interviewed people are really very funny and get lots of humor from their situation. They are well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor - just as they should. We all live "houses" guided by their "mothers" and everyone helps each other. The feeling of the community in this movie is interesting. <br /> <br /> This movie is controversial when it was released in 1990 - and a big hit. It won the best documentary awards in most of the festivals - but was not nominated for the Academy Award. Their reason was "Black and Hispanic drag is not the element of Queen Academy". Is not it extraordinary? Homophobia and racism all together. <br /> <br /> Today it's still a great movie - and pieces of time. It's just not like that - they're no longer existing NY. The ball is still kept but the spirit we do not see here. It has also become more "acceptable" in society (for good or for bad). And I heard the house was gone. That kind of sad I want to know where this letter is now - I know two people have died from AIDS but I have no idea about others. And what is 13 years old and 15 years old? <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary - interesting, funny and writing. One must see all the ways! A Specific 10. Where is the DVD ???
