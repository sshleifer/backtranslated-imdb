A humorous Blue Simon comedy that raises a smile from start to finish. At the end, Walter Matthew is a former comedian who agreed to join together with his ex-partner (late Oscar winner George Burns) for the final renewal of the stage. <br /> <br /> Benjamin Martin Mathher has many chemistry as agent and nephew, and both Matthau and Burn. I love Matthu's impressive character - he's always the same, and still different. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " I got coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Barnes: How is a plain cracker? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I got coconut, pineapple and graham. <br /> <br /> Burns: OK <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burns: Maybe <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> See the movie to understand it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They just do not make them! At a time when all the new tricks are filthy, teenager and fool, it actually goes back to the tender core of the comedy - funny characters, smart and fun conversations and great entertainment. <br /> <br /> One of the best friends, comedy, "Plane, Train and Automobiles," "Lethal Wipon" and "Hard Way" right there <br /> <br /> <br /> This is for you It can be difficult to find fare or on TV, but believe me, it will be valuable to you! <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 5 stars. <br /> <br /> - John Ulemer
