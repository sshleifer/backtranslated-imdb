I saw this movie for the second time on television. It's beautiful, warm, sensitive, very romantic. I rarely see actors capable of expressing their movements and gestures - Sibyl Shepherd, Ryan O'Reilly, Robert Doney, Jr. And especially Mary Stuart Masterson just surpassed herself. Masterson probably has hard-hitting role and just adorable. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I hate to say this, because this cast was nice and I could not make any changes to them - but I think it was not successful with the above mentioned films because the box office application was not only big but Meg Ryan, Tom Hendes, Michael J. Fox and Kathleen Turner. <br /> <br /> This is not great writing - for example, the lines of letters are not particularly memorable. Yet it is executed in perfection. <br /> <br /> The romantic desire is really clear, the "feeling" of people reading is absolutely communicating, the timelessness of love and the broadest dispute, the feeling of loss and the willingness to restore that connection, so sensitive distribution. Again and again, you will move yourself. Indeed, a comparable movie is made in heaven - the same romantic wish. See it - it's beautiful.
