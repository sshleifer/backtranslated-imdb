A person who does not usually enjoy boxing films, they just keep an eye on boxing and the characters themselves are not, the film has really moved me. I saw so much in such a short time that I saw the main character Diana (Michele Rodriguez), it was amazing to me. Michelle (Rodr√≠guez) did such wonderful work with Diana, especially since she had her first acting experience, so she showed real emotions and Diana's amazingly illustrated. All actors were chemistry on screen and this movie is even more amazing. I highly recommend this movie to those who do not see Moving Cinema. 10/10
