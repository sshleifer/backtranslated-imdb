For a while, I was caught in the trap where I saw myself independent and foreign films and felt myself a liar. Fat drive bus exception. It's true. This is the best "bad" movie ever. <br /> <br /> "badness" of this movie comes naturally. Half of the word "Hell" is displayed below the word of the word "Hell". Glamor Breathtag is a wig and a torrent shop is an untamed man in the dress. A discerning couple who tries to kill each other for walking on the stairs. Jesus went to an empty soundtrack. However, Fatty believes that anyone has lost their tenure to suggest a senior film project. But how bad it is that sincerity makes it so nice. The creator believes that this is going to get worse, but it has never been forced. <br /> <br /> Never be surprised, fatty distributes. Very highly recommended.
