All right, I know this is not a good light project in India. But the overall theme of the movie is not India, it is the power. The power of a war criminal, and the power of a mother. The relationship between Nandini and her husband and son devours you in their warming. Then things go terribly wrong. Interrelationship between Nandini and her father-in-law - The power of the relationship of their effectiveness - and life changed by this is the power of this film. Shahrukh Khan's performances seem to be less than just the credible frustration of Karisma Kapoor. Finding love, violence and life in this movie is easy to get, and find yourself feeling relief and sad at the final stage. The musical interludes are power, credible and well-done.
