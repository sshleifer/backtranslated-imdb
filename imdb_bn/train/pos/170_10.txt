Do not listen to the dirty critics about this, it's a jewel! The young man Joan and his brother thinks themselves desperate after their father dies - and now they have to work for their livelihood! He, naturally, became a journalist, and naturally he is a driver for the crowd! Thanks to Gangster Clark Gable, meeting the heads of their staff through wild co-incident. Already in the light of the moon, there will be swim for some of the beautiful things of underwear and for Jovan, a number of racquet dances (with all the grace of a steam-shovel) must be done. <br /> <br /> But none of these is considered seriously acceptable - it was really naughty when all those good fun from those wonderful pre-code days. Joan looks great, and displays a lot of mental range that will give him such a long-term career (thanks he dances off!). Gable is remarkable as a slimy gangster - he was not yet a star and would not be so hero. He is great for some different game. And William Beckwell is as nice as a poor confused brother. And there are some great montages and directors of Harry Beaumont's courtesy tracking shots, who run the pieces with a cracking pace - and an occasional surprise to the viewers! Great joy
