Atlantis: The Lost Empire I wanted a good movie. I never thought this movie would be my expectations. Indeed, this movie started slowly, but when I started to wear the film my choice increased further. The story takes place in 1914 and is about a guy named Milo. Believe Milo fabled Atlantis. With his grandfather's friends, he started his own amazing adventure. On the way, he has to endure friendship, betrayal, trust, and much more. Voice Cast is great. They know how to convey the movie with their voice talent. Music is nothing special but enjoyable anyway. Animation is not the best, but it is still good enough. Overall, this is a good family movie for all ages. I rated this movie 9/10
