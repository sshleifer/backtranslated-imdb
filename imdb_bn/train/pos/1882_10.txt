<br /> <br /> What can I say? It is one of the most perfect films ever made. This is a threat to the 1940s Glitxy, Starling romantic comedy. But with a modern touch The screenplay bursts with intelligence, charm, humor and softness, cinematography is exciting (NYC did not look so beautiful), and certainly cast! Dudley Moore's boyfriend, drunkenly active in his career as Arthur Bachch. She is very impressive and practical. One of the best lines in the film is his stupid "Anyone who does not drink is a poet ... some of us drink because we are not poets." The great Sir John Gilgund earned many qualifications for the Oscars for his outstanding performance as the Oscars valet and caretaker Hobson. Although he thinks it "take money and play the role", nevertheless he tragidian all genius, experience and curvy expert character and an intelligent comedian. Geraldine Fitzgerald's sassy Grandma Bach is also out of this supporting cast from Stephen Eliot's bombing Mafioso. <br /> <br /> This score is very memorable and congratulates the film completely. The only real problem with this movie is the sick fated sequel it spawned.
