It is a very dense, dark and complex film that unmasks very slowly, reveals a novel story of attention given in the novel, and a novel is published by this novel "IS". Although I did not take care of the narrator, I felt that he was not consistent with the rest of the performance, I have seen some of the best pairs in this film, and lead, Summer Phoenix, is amazing. Her innocence and naivete might find something unlikely, the kind of cross between Wonderland between Cinderella and Alice. The criticism I can buy, but she is still awesome, because partly she is different from what I saw. <br /> <br /> This picture is incredibly beautiful, portrayed by Eric Gauri, and is so unique about it that this picture does not show how you would ever expect. This is always surprising, and despite its length, the film does not reveal much more than that. In 163 minutes, it's too short, for a blame, I would say, which is a wonderful one in this movie. This is simply stunning, which is full with short moments, perhaps the best thing you can see throughout the year, and all these moments are added to the end of an extraordinary film experience. Family moments are unique, Ian Holm is brilliant, and what the movie has to say about the theater can not be seen from the "opening night" of the Casavetas or perhaps the "Limelight" of Chaplin. But, do not believe this film is much less "popular". I never knew where this movie was going, and now, it has seen, it still has many possibilities. This is a powerful, incredibly exciting movie.
