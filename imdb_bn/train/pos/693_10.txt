After going through Jack, offensive, hallucinations, it is often viewed by fewer filmmakers, dead friends, closes a building, and most of the time, the reality from hallucinations can not be said. << br /> <br /> Dominic Monghan, like Jack, is really believable. Confused, and awesome but impressive and sometimes he just takes what he sees, trying to find out what he's seeing and find a way to sleep. <br /> <br /> A talking dog (another misconception) and in Jack's bathroom and bedroom, suddenly it is easy to see how they reached it and make you interesting, mind-blowing, 43 minutes and the shower scene Enough for returning to the Domin fan.
