I really enjoyed the girl's fight. Something I could see again over again Acting was great and I think Michelle Rodriguez did a good job in the film. I could say very strong. The film shows how women should stand up for what they want to do in their lives. He had so much compassion and same hatred at the same time. Treating with an unconscious parents really does help her a lot. Although he liked him he was really hateful. He died when his mother was younger and expressed some sadness in the role. Love story is a part I enjoyed in the movie too. I felt y had passion for each other. Then set the drama again and then like it is choosing between his boyfriend and his long dream of life. I just finished it right. It was such that you have to decide what happened in the future. For those of you who like a movie based on a game with good intentions, I suggest you check it out for them.
