This picture brought tears to my eyes; John Roberts really knew how to reach the heart of the audience, this beautiful picture indicates that life can be seen by the mind and heart of Paul. We have discovered from time to time that, with the help of publicly sensitive and talented managers, there is a heart of young animals like Polly. Although the film is happy, I just could not stop my tears. This is great, after thousands of movies I saw through my life, "Poly" really touched me deeply. After this "Ugly Duckling", the second picture that turned me turned upside-down.
