Honors men have many great aspects of it. Good action sequence, lots of "good" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is a great acting. Almost by Robert Deniro. The story of Man of Honor is played by Carbon Brasier, Cuba Gooding Jr. who wants to be the first African American Navy Deep Sea Diver. It's getting to be a poor farmer diving school and even more in his rough struggle chronicles. This is a good story, but it seems to have been long ago. A person against all hatred, do not exempt them until they achieve the goals set for many goals many years ago. This can happen, but Bras√≠s face confrontation in the film is mostly suspicious, including COO. Diving school tampering with its final test. But Robert Dickie finally made it to the scene while entering the movie. Mainara, who heads Denver, was a teacher at Diving School Brasier on Sunday. As soon as Deniro arrives he can not hate this vibe of extreme arrogance that you do not have incredible wilpower. Prior to the end of the film, Deniro has given more than one lecture that you laugh at how cool you are, but you are very surprised how you did them out. At the end you must doubt some aspects of the film, but acknowledge that if this was true, it will snooze your seat in the first 20 minutes.
