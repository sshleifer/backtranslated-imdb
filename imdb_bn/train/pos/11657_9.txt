Awesome nominations for this year's best animated feature. It was an Irish film by heart, but it was produced by Belgium and Brazil, I'm guessing, animators are working in three countries. One of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory of products. Character Design A few years ago French animated film Persepolis has a very memorable, thick, black look with very simple characters. This image is not black and white. Oh no How does this film use a great color, some of the most awesome and striking uses of color I've ever seen. The general design of the pictures is even more geometrical, which is mainly rectangular or ovals, with letters. Most movies can be spent on finding circles - a key aspect of visual design is a circle in the center of the image. All these geometrical designs have a purpose - this story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working in enlightened manuscripts (the book is a real illuminated Bible; based on the paintings of the film industry.) The story of the film is not particularly profound, but it is a beautiful fabulous story. A young boy named Brendan Kells, who is surrounded by a wall, is a city, built by his uncle to maintain the Vikings. Brother Eiden, a new person from Kells, inspired Breath to portray. He inspired him to leave Kells and explore the nearby jungle, in which one of the nymph lives. Bruno Cullies gives a fantastic score, which is better than what he did for Corinina, which I consider to be the best of the year.
