This is one of the greatest love story movies I've ever seen. Yes, I agree that some part may be a date, but it is not confused with the movie. One should try to criticize and enjoy, keeping an industrial form from time to perspective. By clearly standarding "sex in the city", Charlie Chaplin was terribly annoying. However, he was superb to judge from the American feudal system of 1925. Likewise, Saorarna is a mixed nation love image, an American "manifest fate", a successful film in search of arrogance and antipathy, and the complexity of different cultures. This is the next natural step for these films like Gentlemen's Treaty. However, its purpose is not simply social commentary, but it is entertaining and enjoyable, with countless lines that do not just forget. <br /> <br /> However, when only taken as a love story, it is still horrific. Although, Brando's expression is some of the attacks, he is neutral and characterized by its closest to the protagonists. Button and Umeki (both of which have won Oscars) and the rest supporter add a lot more to the custom film. <br /> <br />, the true star, being broken by the feeling of a great job, obligation and feeling of loyalty to his passion for Brando. Sometime when he first met with Brando and talked about his lectures matched a classic and sometimes movie. Tokyo's money is equally good for the dialogue between the bald and the brand in his dressing room. Of course, it is mouth-sucking, sputum and not bad, which gives examples of love in today's film, but it makes it even better. It is true love and passion, and just "heat." If this film does not touch you, then you are very young, very empty or dead.
