Gandhi My Father is a well-made movie. It beautifully portrays the life of Harilal, the eldest son of Gandhi's life. His character, his difference with his father, his love for his family, his own position, his failure, his arrogance of arrogance. Akshay Khanna supports Harilal's role perfectly. Not just him, everyone did the right thing in the role they played. The spectacular Gandhiji is the greatest Gandhi of all time ever. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film will take more than fifteen minutes more than the first time. Secondly, Harilal's character needs more research for this film. Somewhere, the character looked incomplete. Also, his relationship with his brothers was not shown. There is no mention of any other child of Gandhiji in the movie. I believe the character like Hari Lal could have had at least some brothers and sisters in consideration of Hari Lal's arrogant nature. However, despite some flaws, I like the movie. Recommended ...
