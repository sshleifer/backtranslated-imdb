This review dedicated to late Keith Moon and John Antivistell. <br /> <br /> The main drum and bus. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> . To be fair, none of them have to prove anything to anyone, they have earned their respect and overtime. <br /> <br /> This concert footage for me is their best. Nearly 400,000 strong angry observers take skills, charisma, intelligence and full bloody good music. <br /> <br /> We all know about the other works of the bill, the doors (their last Jim Morrison will be seen few weeks before his death), Moody Blues, Hendrix, taste, free and more. The point is that anyone was there, most of the people came to see. This show was only one year after the Great Hippie Festival of 1960; Woodstock The film and the record came out, and so Hu's biggest work was Tommy. The hungry crowd ever wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to "Gov and Love" the knowledge that these gigabytes had their own To do this, you need Rock N Roll to throw the crowd of hungry people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, "Ladies and Gentlemen, Sheffields Bush" is a small rock 'n roll band from London, ' oo '. <br /> <br /> The skirt black skin of John Antivistel's body, a line in front of the front of his neck, the skeleton of the toes, Roger's tall tessel and long-running hairstyle, Keith dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, Pete liked to wear her white boiler suit and Doc Martins. None of the high power rock stopped their attack for more than two hours, the greatest tracks of all and other artists such as Young Man Blues, Sucking 'Over Over, and then in Rows, Keith Byting Tokyo, The Rock Opera "Shut up, it's bleeding opera". The anger went wild. That's what they heard, and who was not frustrated, went straight into overture and "Tommy, you hear me?" The final note is not coming for the wind? Amazing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> English DVD comes only in English / Linear PCM stereo soundtracks, I think you can get it with at least 5.1, "Check local press for details? ? " That's okay. <br /> <br /> The DVD is not 85 minutes extra, which is frustrating. Yes, for this part of Rock and Festival's history, this DVD will send you a nostalgia trip under the Memorial Lane when you hit the game, which is the best footage, live, raw and in your mouth <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> I said, I said, I said, I said, how? Keith
