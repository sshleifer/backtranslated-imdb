I can not quite stretch into this and wait for each episode. Acting life should be a passionate person, together with its closest effects together. As a family we were only the problem that at last it was quick to 'interpret' it. We did not hear what we said and did not have any idea what was the part of Gary in the whole thing? Why did Kyle call her and why did she go with him? After five hours of investing in the series, we felt cheated that only five minutes were left behind for this decision. I've asked about it and it was not my friend who saw it. Very weird but perhaps we missed something important ????
