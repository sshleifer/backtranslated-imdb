Only seen this show a few times, but will live in my memory. <br /> <br /> It is very frustrating that it is hard to find anywhere else to buy it and still feel like repeating things like friends! I think it's even more difficult than being in England. <br /> <br /> They say it was a low rating or was it a complaint from Bakersfield PD? Maybe it was too clever for some people? However, I would like to see one comedy again but it is almost impossible. Did I hear it or repeat it on another network? But not too much here !! Summary: Suspicious.
