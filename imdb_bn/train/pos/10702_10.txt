What is the suggestion from critics and audiences, the birthday girl has to be a big fat clinic. Yet, because I love Nicole Kidman, I decided to rent last night. It proved to be quite capable of watching. Of course, this is not your basic American comedy and it does not accept a genius that it's a very British movie, but that's why I like it. It changes from almost all other movies, breathing fresh air. Of course, there were some plot holes, but overall it worked. First off, Kidman was very different again, very different, but still had a pretty sexy role. He just keeps on proving that one of the top talents in the holiving is proof. Although he was not effective in English, his Russian accent was not only, but he and Nikol Kidman did not know during the Russian long conversations, you would never ask questions about its authenticity. Harrison Ford will have to take a "K-19" note. Despite a terrific buzz, the whole little little movie works.
