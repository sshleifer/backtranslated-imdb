I recently hired an animated version of Lord of the Rings on the video after watching the film's Fantastic 2001 live action version. The Lord of the Ring Live Action Trilogy directed by Peter Jackson will be much better than George Lucas 'Star Wars' prax. " Trilogy (episode 1-3) will be like the 21st century original fantasy film series! <Br /> <br /> I think to see the animated version as a child, and I do not understand the depth at that time. Now I read books, I can understand what the whole story is about. Make sure that some characters are quite stupid (belonging to the Gay Gangetic, especially annoying, often in one of Star Wars's episodes as far as Jar Jar Bink), but I'm not saying that it follows the book closely, and it is in book two, two towers Goes. Good thing is that the action is somewhat interesting and some animations are great for its time. The worst thing is that it ends up halfway through two towers without the consequence of destroying a ring of phodo and the animation shows most of the time than today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, they are not as bad as they are. But the 2001 live action version of Lord of the Rings is the new Hallmark! At least Ralph Bakhshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read books, which led him to create the greatest fantasy series ever in the film, so we can thank at least Ralph Bakhshi! I will take an animated version of Lord of the Rings in Harry Potter's live version! <br /> <br /> 7 on the 2001 scale, much less violent than the live action version of 2001, but good as near NOWHERE! For the book of The Lord of the Rings and fans of the movie fans.
