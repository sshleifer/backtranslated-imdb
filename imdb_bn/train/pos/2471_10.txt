I could not read Shakespeare's Hamlet before seeing it but I had Shakespeare's books and could follow the dialogue through it. My view of the film can be partially biased, because I have never read this game before, but I could pull it from the realization of this movie. Shakespeare is undoubtedly one of the best writers to survive and Hamlet's story must be one of his best achievements. <br /> <br /> But now in the movie ... <br /> <br /> I have seen that all the actors in the movie have been able to understand it very well and in this way it was able to express well. Romeo and Juliet are nothing compared to Leonardo Kenneth Branagh and King. The thing I like is that it works very well as "movie" and the drama you are studying is not. Do not be rich with Shakespeare, so that all nightmares have to go through. I would recommend this movie to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> This is my two cents.
