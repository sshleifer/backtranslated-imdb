This movie is one of the most provocative Jesus movies I have ever seen. It does not want to tell the whole story, but only represents an interpretive publication on the last day of Jesus Christ. From the elements of Jewish heritage and modern Scriptural explanations, it is deeply diverse, slaves and seriously faithful. Judas is much more common than ordinary, dark and sinful evil, which we sometimes do not imagine, but a serious wrong man, terribly misguided by his initiative. Chris Saranden's Jesus is playful and serious, trustworthy and committed - very human when divine. The final conversation is completed by thinking and acting as a tiny conversation that two powerful men can only act as victims of an oppression. I will watch this movie again and others will recommend it.
