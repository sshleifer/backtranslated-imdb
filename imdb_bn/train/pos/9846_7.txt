Well, at the beginning it looked like "Shake" - Lonar which is followed by continuous comic relief. Then it is set to gambootlet, really developed into some compulsory. And as a result, an enjoyable movie, which at the moment I agree that a little more dramatic to watch the kids (for example Manny's past) Persistence has probably been working for a long time, so that they can be successful in creating a different set of sets (only ice caps and rock) and a film set with three characters. It is a good thing that it has succeeded to make it out of something psychic. As I said, it may tear some times, so kids will be warned. The real letdown animation is. This toy story was not souped up like a movie or Shrek, and it shows. People are unreal, and we saw good examples of CGI before. But do not mark the record: Like the single attempt, "Ice Age" is pretty much appreciated. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, those tiny mouse moments are priceless and show-steal.
