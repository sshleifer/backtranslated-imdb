At the beginning, I liked the whole of Canal 1, there were a lot of classic jokes in which the unfortunate guy who always appears to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, still he is acting the same guy on the whole Canal 2. Movies, but in my opinion, HD performance was not as interesting as it was in the first movie, but you do not think so much about him. One thing I think is bad about this movie, which boasts a boat, this movie only has a boat boat, they are sure to quickly but do not create waves like big floating sculptures used in the first film, I like the old ones and the last ones in this new boat When a man in Canada seems to be ridiculous, suddenly "big waves" came out of small boats from them. Really a minuscule You have to accept that you are not living in the same Sweden in 1974. This movie has more violence than the first. Although the movie was all great at all. I just pretended that I was frustrated but the rest of the movie was in my expectation, so I see! It's worth the money.
