Tell me a teenager but I really think it's a great series. If you did not get the chance to experience several episodes of the latest Star Trek series, but of course you must see it. Viagara's caretaker is more compulsory, which started the series with the CPT. Janway, the adventures of the rituals are completely different, yet weird known ... the music is very interesting. A true science-fan fan can not be seen at least one Star Trek episode - and these installations can make it worthwhile.
