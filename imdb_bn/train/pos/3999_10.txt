I'm sorry to miss "Mom" while I'm in the theater. I saw this evening at the DVD. I gave it a 10 vote, the very few one I gave here. This English Independent is impressed with such great care and quality. It draws me uninterruptedly. The story, humble and purely human, is cruelly honestly and thoroughly absorbing, thanks Ana Reid, Daniel Craig and Kathryn Bradshaw. Cinematography is stunning. Score plot is hard-wired. The story is brilliantly written by the writer Hanif Kuraishi in epic and glorious life. This story addresses big issues with a dominant illustration subtlety. And these big things are very controversial, which probably explains the lack of awards despite many nominations. This is just one of my favorite movies.
