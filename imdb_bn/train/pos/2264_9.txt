Vonnegut's word paper is best experienced. The stories he made were Gossemer, the words and words that are not easily translated into the world of the explosion of Marilyn Manson or Jerry Br√ºckheimer. His words have been treated well once, the extraordinary Slaughterhouse-5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Probably one of the three novels, Vongut has written that I can go to Slaughterhouse-5 and Desert Island. Bluebeard <br /> <br /> The film's version is worth 10, but books are a permanent partner of my inner landscape that I can not do ... Some scenes outside of the movie are my memories ...
