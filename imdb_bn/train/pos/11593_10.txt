I think watching this movie was a child when Disney was a day in the wonderful world. This movie has been in my memory for more than 30 years and I am looking for it. I would say that all of the children's movies I have seen again, all of these spread more than them and after seeing it only once, I really hope I can see it again. The story and the pictures of this movie were burnt to my memory. Today, in the 70's, I did not see it after that day, actually, until I searched the Internet, I never remembered the title that it had revealed to me earlier. I liked it and my kids would like to see it. Can anyone know where I get it?
