As well as from the great film Matropoli, it is about the old pure scientist film. Sometimes the film is a bit promotional and the actress can be a bit broad, but it's a great film for two reasons. First, it is extremely original both in style and content. Even in the 21st Century there is no film that I can remember that there is something like that. Second, for his time, special effects were absolutely incredible - using matte paintings, models, and huge castes to create an amazing view of both the post-apocalyptic world and the big city of tomorrow. Sure, because you can sit back and lose the film, by today's standards, the effect is only so. But, you must be grateful that this film came to the film in 1936 and it certainly surprised the audience. In many ways, the set shows a very memorable look of 1939 worldwide featured "Modern Cities". <br /> <br /> I think this film is also interesting because it seems broken by the question "Are humans really fool or we are determined for greatness?" The end result seems a little bit of both! <br /> <br /> <br /> A final note: I saw this twice on TV and in a short time before the video. Stank all three times the word and print quality - especially the words. If it is available on a DVD, hopefully it will provide many cleaner and alternative captions. Because of the video's words, I really appreciated this!
