Let's set my scene. It has absolutely nothing to do on school holidays and cinemas. I want to see my friend We started a movie soon and came to "Greenwich". Do not buy tickets to what we expect. What we got was a fun roller coaster. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey (which I can add to my No. 1 actor in the whole world) was fantastic as Ron Howard's best movie grin (next Apollo 13). The way this movie was made, the scenes, actors, promos and music were just amazing. It really brought this childhood film to life. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the story of Greenwich. We all know Grinch is a terrific person who can not stand just Christmas. She lives high on the whoville and does not mingled well with the dude. But a little girl is changing the look of the grin and many are looking at each other. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> He tried to help break the barriers and help Greenchok and meet the urban people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a laughingstock for both kids and parents both families. A SOLID 10/10 Good gym <br /> <br />
