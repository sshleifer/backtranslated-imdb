"Brokeback Mountain" (about 23 years ago) Earlier, "DeathTrap" for the first time I ever saw two men to kiss on the screen, and to be honest, I was shocked. I understood this in terms of plot, and it did not really bother my sensitivity (much more), but it was the first time that it was seen in the "mainstream" movie. I think this was a great step for his time, and dared to try his time as a PG-rated superman, especially Christopher Reeve. Men's hesitation on the screen may have been hurt by "brokeback", but it is interesting to keep in mind that long anticipation is interesting.
