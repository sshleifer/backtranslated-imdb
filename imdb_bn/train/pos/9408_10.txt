Often tagged as a comedy, The Man in the White Suit is here and there is far more than a chocolate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . On the way to the path of Barnley's Textile Mills, he used his laboratory for the discovery of fabric that not only clothes but also needs to be cleaned! He first announced a talent and those who ignored him at first suddenly wanted a big piece of them, but then the bomb blasted into the industry, his head came back and the praise became a bit awkward. Yes, the picture is very funny, actually some scenes are sunny, but it is the satirical edge of the film which usually comes up to me. Contradiction about the emergence of technology is an important issue here, do we want to innovate that can save our fate when we shut down our industry? I just want to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain that I want to see. A decade of making the film is an important issue, notebooks have become more than just surgeries, science is increasingly moving towards new ratios. You see this movie and see the main playwright Stanley, the hero repeatedly about the enemy becoming a fool, in an enemy of his own way of life! It's so dark that the film should be called Man in the Man Black Suit. <br /> <br /> I can not find any real mistake in this picture, Roger McDougall, John Dyeton and director Alex McNeckrick's script can be illustrated today and it does not come out of such a way that ideas and ideas. With sound and setting waking, seamless in direction, tonal space operated adroitly by Macendric. Some scenes are very surprising, especially a hug on the heart strings, and after 29 years, David Lynch's elephant combines it to think about a specific scene of Man and still after the fatal event, the film is still looking at the future of Stanley's view of Vineck as the talent of Alex Guinness. , But this is the fastest advance Ira worried the world to shut down the movie. <br /> <br /> As a timeless masterpiece, theatrical and art pieces, 10/10
