This fantastic hoodit has soon become a very popular movie genre that is a primary prototype. William Powell manages a charity story with charisma and elegance and is happy to see his nick Charles character (in the "Thin Man" series) with a stupid attitude. Although the story is good on its own, I think how this movie really makes fun is the fantastic fantasy aspect of Michael Cartridge. From the perspective of the scene, it is a rich textured movie, showing cartridges medium an incredible command; From the split screen image, from the weird camera angle and the fantastic flashback, Cartesi shows that he is one of the best Hollywood directors. If you are a fan of such a movie then it is highly recommended.
