I recently saw this film in Winnipeg - given the appropriate, used position. I first read Lawrence's book in the 70's and for me, it was always a very powerful picture of adult justice in our society. When I was young, it was revived, and it is now felt more. When the picture came out I was interested to see if the story could survive. And was particularly impressed, with Ellen Burstyn's performance. He directs us to give a complete man, although the character is usually unclear and extra-judicial - you do not want to live with anyone. It's great to be able to see the preferred characters so come true life.
