From the spot of Austin films in the 1990s, it's more than my favorite, "Perseusion", which transformed me into Austinia. Before seeing this "Emma" I saw two previous versions, but in one case Lady Tizzell seemed to be more wrong, and on the other hand, she thought half the wrong, a potentially impersonal, though she is right, young and stupid and vivid. In general, I think the atmosphere of production and attitude is very well-published in the novel's novel way; Actually this is a sweet thing that I have ever seen, but rather in the nature of Christmas behavior. The scripts are abnormally well-formed, and adaptive additions, such as the section of the light that reveals to the church imager Harriet, are all observed. Not so much as Mark Stroud as I expected, but I enjoyed him a lot: he is firmly spoken, the practical aspect of the character, in contrast to Emma's influences, and her playful explosions against Frank Churchill are quite interesting. Bernard Hepton M. Woodhaw has almost made an image of the carnival helplessness; As Emma's protégé Samant Morton is just as soft and just as firm as she ought to be. And as the "Pride and Prejudice" of the same producers, care is taken to assume that the final lines of characters can be believed - in some cases uniquely This was my production for me and remains a delight.
