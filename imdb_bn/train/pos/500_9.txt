I have been experiencing seven seasons of "Star Trek Voyager" for many deadly trackcars (or Trekky! I do not care!), When it is finished, dream of a good show, "no deep space" 1999. Prayer, answer "Enterprise" is pretty fantastic. The fresh perspective, essentially a pop song for various characters, stunning new visual, role. (I was shocked!) I can not think of what I do not like. Sign me up for this show's 10 seasons. "Star Trek" has come back - "Voyager," someone miss you! Keep tracken! <br /> <br />>
