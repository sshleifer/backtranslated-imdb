- Jim Blandings (Kerry Grant) finds a property in the country for his wife and children when he is tired of living in a race of mice in New York City and a living survival. She is hoping to find simple life. However, building a house is easy but proved to be something. Headaches and bills start suddenly, so smile Will Mr. Blonding ever get a dream house? <br /> <br /> - This movie is so special that three main actors - Grant, Marina Loy and Melvin Douglas. Three are able to carry a movie of their own, so when you combine their genius, almost every scene is special. Grant has always been my mate favorite of this type of role. She kept playing on husband so well. Fever always enjoy watching a watch Thin Man movies made with William Powell perfect. And Douglas has become my favorite in the last two or three years. Douglas was also present at the Old Dark House, my special favorite. <br /> <br /> - The film is a product of its time. When I figured out a time when you can earn a couple of stories, three bedrooms, four bathroom rooms, house $ 15,000 a year. Stay in the private school of your two children and you have a live-in maid and it's almost fantastic. <br /> <br /> - However, for anyone who has bought or made a house, many situations and splendent blundings are found among themselves, easily related to today. And wherever comedy comes. There are so many stupid things in this movie, which can cost more than expected? My biggest complaint about Mr Blondings is the "wife of love with the best friend" mistress It really is not necessary for the plot and seems very uncomfortable as presented.
