When I saw the trailer, I only came to see the movie. And when I was there, I felt like a feeling dissatisfied. It was a great movie, do not make me wrong, but I think trailers already have large parts, if you hold my drift. It went too fast and it rolled over, so I was not bored, and I enjoyed watching it. The ridiculous was absolutely great. My first contact with a sloth (or something like this).
