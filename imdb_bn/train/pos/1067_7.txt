Like many of the pilot pilots, the dark angel opens the grand prospect and a little problem in finding his own foot. This is not abnormal in any way, but there is a feeling that if the story becomes stiff and gives little attention, it can do a better job. In today's world, where some immediate or face-off can be closed, the series does not come out at least half the attention, all the guns are burning. <br /> <br /> The ninety minute pilot really feels like two episodes glued together, and there is a problem with the focus of both episodes. In the first half, we introduced to Mac and filled with what was driven by it. We've got some interesting routines with Matt, such as to win the bit, interact with PI or use his capabilities to sort out domestic problems of co-workers. The problem here is that for general people it is not common for television or for other people by the general set. <br /> <br /> When we hit the second half, we get a story, purpose and focus. In two half, Mac attracted attention from a pirate journalist, who thinks that it is the goal of saving the world by releasing a dirty dealer once in a while. In the second half, the reaction was caught with him, and Mac unwittingly clears the mess. It sets the premiere for the entire rest of the series and it works, but it does not quite click if I understand my meaning. It has mostly pieces, but a couple that has dropped a complete image. Perhaps they will be filled with episodes later, but beside that point. In fact, the contents of this episode can be easily stated in eight eight minutes. <br /> <br /> The last negative aspect is that many support throwing is quite neutral. Especially the original syndery is a boring, and I suspect that the next twenty episodes have changed over time. Although acting is not as bad as soap in the daytime, it is not a quality that I appreciate. Jessica Alba is not the worst actress in the world, but when the story is needed at least it comes in short-term believing. <br /> <br /> The good news is that the proofs and production values ​​are all above the groove. In fact, this series was considered quite expensive for production, and it is unfortunate that it was canceled for being replaced by any other competition that did not end the season. Especially when there was enough time for both occasions - they could easily cancel a piece of superstition trash, which they spread under the reality TV banner. In fact, we need to hear more like Dark Angel, where imagination, rather than overhead, is used to draw attention. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave seven of the 10 to the Dark Angel pilot. This never goes up to the level of televised television and it does not have the chance to survive with the potentiality that can be seen in its running time. But there is potential, and that is often all matter where the pilot is concerned.
