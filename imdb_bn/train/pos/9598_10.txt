I trop track on the Internet two years ago - now I've seen the movie !! What a ride! And finally Darius Wemes know what a trip! Such a brave, wise, funny and gifted soul! And what a crew! To hear Darius from laughing in the water of Panama City, he was afraid to stay near the heel of Louisiana, wondering in his eyes that he was roaming in a hot air balloon, rafting through some rapids, a spoonful eating beta in Wasabi, and phone calls at home, And as always - the boy will be the son. This film needs to be seen by everyone - both young and old alike. Darius and his mother's strength and courage model. And members of the crew are testaments from the heart of the young generation. They got a new wheelchair from Darius; They document accessibility issues; They led Darius to the journey of his life; And they touch a lot, many lives. By encouraging funding for DMD awareness and research, this film will help Darius Gove achieve West's ultimate goal - DMD Remedy
