The majority of people who follow the comedy films of Audaire do not realize that Amelie was a character - it is not actually the original life of Audrey Tautu, hence the picture that he took is Emelie Part 2, Part 3, etc. <br /> <br /> Now that I have said, I also simply presented this movie because Audrey was in it. Yes, this is true, there is a big gap after the first scene where he is not seen for 45 minutes at all, but I did not miss him because I got so much fun with other characters. The person who lies about everything is very funny, the person who supports the people who came out of his caf√© and found out the coupon and got out of the bill and kept the balance of the loss, in fact ... here all the letters can get a long time, But in a while I saw one of the best films. <br /> <br /> Irene Amelie, the character of Audrey Toure, was not an extra sugar girl. In fact, as Irene, a left to ask for change caught me close to the first guard of his harshness. In this film, Irene is a girl with good intentions, but during a (very awful) day, her temperament becomes more awkward and depressing. <br /> <br /> Does this picture make a great deal? All of these are really interesting stories and plot building ... very entertaining to see, great scenery and shots, very colorful and very slow, and all the characters can actually work. The best part of the film is about 20 minutes left .... That is when the plots begin to mix together and combine this journey and everything is related and induced and the effect of the whole butterfly blown. I swear, within a few minutes, I saw it was the best 20-minute film, and it ended .... It reminds me "I'm really lucky to find this movie". The top end of this movie ends in the groove. Anyone who wrote the script for this is brilliant, because all these subpages are not running, but unifying them in a similar way (and in an intelligent way, which is here) but also to feel and feel every character, it is only a punch to create effects of this complete butterfly Used as some old personality is not ... very impressive. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie that it is a great movie to watch at any time. No mood, no company or alone
