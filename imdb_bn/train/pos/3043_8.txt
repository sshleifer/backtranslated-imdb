Why Amitabh Bachchan is a man industry? Why would this movie tell you why the Indian filmmakers are the great buyers <br /> <br /> Amitabh was at the helm of his Bollywood debut when he once decided to use his film Gadhafiar Prakash Mehra. In addition to the selection of themes and the ability to publish stories outside, there is added liberal doses of Bollywood sensitivity and clich√©s. Zanjeer saw the creation of the Angry Young Man. Laureus was frustrating and the Namak was about the loyalty master-friendly loyalty. <br /> <br /> The theme was limited to remove scrapple in three hours of song, dance and drama. What's in the movie is a sketch of Hariwani which goes to Mumbai and becomes a fate hero. Seeing Amitabh's voice skills and imagination, the movie earns him big money, because Hiranyavi thanks to his counterfeit stock. To me, this single movie is the biggest draw. Everything else is written in Bollywood screen. <br /> <br /> Amitabh now has some comedy scenes in each of his movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie was a good dose of them. Party Shoes Shoe Shop, Bijoy Merchant and Bijoya Thousand Consideration, Mosquito Challenge in the Boardroom and the usual drunken scene that Amitabh has now been rented. <br /> <br /> His Moody, with an impressive character, reminds me of an extra mile in the movie (remembering "Shawwadup" after the poisonous cake incident). Amitabh was his faithful servant, but Master Mehra played his important role. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indians ... and so Shashi had to continue his work with the rest of the film. It was a character that could have been better for making a serious movie. But it is a mug, remember? And until this way, people came and Amitav saw wearing a new hat and roamed back home. The last thing is always predictable, and the good people get cheeks and the bad guys go to the lane, the old age of loyalty has once again been emphasized and all the good that the good is the best. <br /> <br /> So w hat makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bachchan as Hariwanabi! Mehra has revealed another icon in the name of a photo. Chuck story, characters and plot. My sign is for Amitabh alone.
