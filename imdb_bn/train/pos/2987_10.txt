These beaches are the nasty that ever were. As much as I wanted to love the beach, it takes me very fast to feel "feel" for me (one of my favorite albums, though its soundtrack). On the other hand, Stella slowly (and sometimes very slowly) moves in motion, and although it is somewhat impressive in its tears-inspired story about the spontaneous mother, it works because Bates and other Castes become a great performer. 10/10
