The story is called Ankesh (Abhay Deol) - a professional wedding witness, she worked as a witness to the couple in the marriage wedding ceremony and married Megha (Soha Ali Khan), who ran away from her home in Nainital. Love interest slow (Shayyan Munshi). Story begins with Mehra waiting for the registration office of Dhirajay, but for some reason it is not seen. So Akkush came in the picture, who came to the clouds to earn money. 200 witnesses for her job and she gives her shelter and ends up helping her. Ankush is working as a bank and works with the bank ... Ankesh falls in love with the cloud and falls in love with her (or falls in love), both agree to the marriage and come back to the slow movie. It should happen in unexpected situations, it should be really, the unexpected response and then ... ... <br /> <br /> In fact the movie movie we see is different from movies and I do not think it will accept the public but if you are my If you like to watch a movie freak and something different, then you definitely like the movie. The film is just a story of innocent love made by Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan's characters very well. Characters are so natural that you think things are happening to the next person. The background of the film plays a very good role, it is very good. The manner in which Delhi is shown is very good and gives a new feeling. <br /> <br /> So let's cut it and let it be rich. <br /> <br /> Story: Carries a very common story very well. Transformed into a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> Music: Well, Himesh was born of Rashmiya, so I did not expect much, but still I liked some of the cinematic songs along with Kaawali. <br /> <Acting: Acting Deol is the most impressive, very natural and innocent act, but should stay away from singing. Soha Ali Khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll I would say. Again very harmless and natural acting and both of these actors perfectly fit into their character. In addition to these two, Shayan Munshi may need some acting lessons and only a few layers of fat can cover the bones. Other actors did their job well. <br /> <br /> Stars: I'll give it 3.5 stars out of 5. If you look at the theater you will enjoy the movie, if you are not, then I would recommend seeing it in the theater. The movie took the strange and unusual stories. Otherwise wait for the DVD to reach. The film will not be clearly public to the public, and the work that can be done is the word of mouth promotion.
