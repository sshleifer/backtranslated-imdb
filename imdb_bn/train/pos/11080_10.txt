After all, when people hear 'Guy Ritchie', they think of SNATCH immediately. Yes, snap was a good movie, but the problem helps everyone to snatch Guy Ritchie. They do not hope to explore new borders. This movie is different than the Revolver robbery; It's too dark and very complicated. Because I did not give 10 ratings because I had to see Revolver three times to understand everything. So this movie toys your head. It is very cleverly written. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from snap. It was amazingly done, cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize Gay Richie's personal touch (style of instruction). <br /> <br /> What has won me the complexity of the drama and how much more answers than the answers to the rest of us.
