Pinna is a movie that really leaves a sign and you feel difficult. Partition set in India, this picture shows the true reality of India split. Urmila receives a full sign for a distressed woman for her beautiful and deeply emotional image. Overnight is accepted due to its independence, personal identity and respectful land dispute. Manoj Bajpai is just as bright as his remorseful kidnapper. The film is crying for a long time. The film at the point is deeply traumatic. Some parts of the partitions of the spinal cord, but both of Kermir's patience and survival are remarkable. Women have been given freedom in the same situation from women who loot women's freedom from women. Intelligent character and storytelling should be given credit for an extraordinary film.
