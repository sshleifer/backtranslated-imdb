I wanted to find this movie for quite a while, and how wonderful it would be in the DVD ... <br /> <br /> I saw this six-year old movie, In Netherlands And I was very impressed by it. This was shown before Walt Disney's Junagel Book! <br /> <br /> I remember this movie. I remember that an Indian boy had friends with Eagle. This affected me a lot. For some reason, he came out of his village (the cause could not be known). When the other boys threw stones at him, he threw a stone. At that time he turned into an eagle and fly away with his eagle friend. As an eagle she was still wearing her turquoise necklace. <br /> <br />
