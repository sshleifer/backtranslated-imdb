For me it was a marvelous role of Marine Davies' talent and beauty. She is not only gorgeous but ridiculous in this film. (I believe that Lucie Ball can make her Davis Style's next career model, which can be called "Johnny Beauty.") Vidor's direction is light but surely handed, the story is certainly a brown, but surprisingly contemporary contemporary, and silent era fans For star-observer elements, with many kiosks, adding overall fun. It perfectly associates slapstick material with good adult dramas and good old timeless romances. For all movie fans who see knee-jerk reaction to silent movies, sit through them and it can change your attitude. <br /> <br />
