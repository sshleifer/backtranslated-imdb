Tensu is imprisoned and sentenced to death. When he survived the power station, the government official preferred him to electrocute with more degree or agreed with some tests. He liked the test and kept a big metal cell, who was a bad ass criminal, who was electrocrossing. They can stay in the room (want) in whatever, but they can not go. After a few days the food is cut every day and room temp is set up very well 100. After some time, the word is made in the heart so that they can not sleep. One day a 'witch' comes to their cells (though in a closed part of a glass) I will let you find out what will happen next. I might be a minor here but I liked to build up, it was intriguing to me. Now if the salary is half good then I could have given it so much ratings. <br /> <br /> My grade: C + <br /> <br /> Media Blaster 2 DVD set Extra: Disc 1) Cut the director; "Versus", "Aragami", "Attack Gas Station", and "Deadly Outlaw Rekka" trailer for disc 2) Theatrical cut; Heidi Sakaki, Rowie Kittamura, Sakaguchi Takkunda Tutu Taahashi narrated with; Cast and crew interview; Make; Original trailer; And preacher Teasers
