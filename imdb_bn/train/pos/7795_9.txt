This will be a different type of review. I have seen this movie twice on TV and want a copy because it talks about the beach in Panama City and winter which is my favorite time. I saw the first movie of Ashley Jod and he was very good and enjoyed any other thing that I saw him. Sundance's response has an impression on me, as directed by director Victor Nunze and writing about various movies about Florida. This movie talks with me and I have not seen anything to compare it. Plot talk less than me. Well, I told you it would be a different kind of review.
