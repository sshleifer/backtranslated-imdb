Detroit centered in central and outside the city, this comedy I found is a terrific new comedic duo. 'Norieu Pat Murita' is a very funny person who is a policeman in Japan who is stealing a thief who steals the 'Prototype' turbo super charger in search of a secret industrial secret, he reluctantly traveled to the United States. The thief, being ordered by his commander. Pat's character speaks quickly with the character of 'J Leon', but the collision with the business-player type Detroit Police. Although they cross the road, Japan's respected 'ways' old school meets Detroit Police investigators 'ways'. Two stumbles first move towards each other, but then develops a 'right' which becomes a two-layered powerhouse team of explosives, which cools down the case. After fighting with a city criminal for stealing 'equation' and after closure of the case, these two dislike one another to be friends and work well together. If worn for wear and the need for the most extended vacation on it, they lead to a winner closing. I rate this one 9. Lewis's direction makes' this near perfect comedy. Fun for all ages. I highly recommend it. (***)
