After praising Stephen King in high heaven, for the first time in Yahoo movies, the trailer was seen for fraternity. Not really a star fan, I still wanted to see it because I'm a huge thriller fan. <br /> <br /> I was not frustrated. Acting was fantastic, especially from two young boys. Usually I hate child actor, but Young Adam and Young Panton were nice. Bill Paxton really did a good job of directing it too. It was shot nicely. <br /> <br /> Plot twists must also be remembered by one. At the end three twists hit hard and fast, and I do not see them coming. With the gravity of what was published in the final cover of the film, this makes me feel cold, though I have seen this picture many times. <br /> <br /> a real jewel.
