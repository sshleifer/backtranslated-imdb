Again, I was browsing through the discount video bin and picked this movie for $ 4,88. The fifty times that I found in the pins are pure shit (horribly better than faith), but in half an hour, they get surprisingly well. This movie is much better than I expected. I found it very compelling, though it was certainly made by a amateur. <br /> <br /> The direction is not something special, but the story is engaging with some good thrill. I expected it to be more of a comedy, but I was not very disappointed. <br /> <br /> For a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good nature. There is no bloody violence, no dirt, no nudity, no gender. Generally, these elements are required in these movies. PG rating is good - "16 candles" is not where the word "f" is used twice and there is a short, undesired nude scene. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to romance in Cori Haim and her love interest has been improved. The film tends to be heavy-to-plot, and is likely to be pushed side by side with good subplot. Instead of developing a chemistry among them, we saw their three-minute helpless surveillance in their romantic efforts. Finally, they end up eating kissing, but there seems to be so much chemistry that seems to be. <br /> <br /> "Dream Machine" is not a gem, but it is a good, clean entertainment. It's forgotten - especially with no other unknown than the frost - but it's even better than you. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
