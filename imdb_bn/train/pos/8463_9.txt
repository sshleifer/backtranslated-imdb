The fourth series of mobile suite gundam wing running gangster chronicles Contrary to previous entries focused on the huge war, it is a little different; Rather than having a military-versus army situation, these five teenage boys (the ability to mix more easily than their normal adults) and their machines are known as "Gondams". . The problem arises, because thugs are supposed to be destroyed, replaced with a "mobile suite", which runs less destructive weapon platforms and "dolls", which are run by Ai. And is used as molded infantry. <br /> <br /> The whole point of the series is an institutional question that gives the bulldog wings the edge of the greater part of Andy, which makes its way here. Especially since most of the animated magazines such as Naruto, Dragonball, One Piece, DragonBall Z and InuYasha, which are found in the dive found in America are available. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Is. Very discipline. Generally there are a few series of anime which think that the best way to fight "small" is to take half an hour - something that will never happen in real life. Gundam ensures that everyone knows that the letters will die, the machines will be destroyed and rebuilt, the war will be lost and won, and it does not seem that it scoffs activities. <br /> <br /> But the magic details of the bully wing, and this series will be grateful for having more anime. Passion Instead of mythological predictions, magic, or excessive martial arts, gangland wing is hard-line science fiction from a country that hates hard-line science fiction. (Note: The authors want to describe that Neon Genesis is not a hard-line-placele-in-real-life science fiction due to the series of religious issues related to its series) they prefer star wars, but hate Ai. (Film). Since then, Gundam Wing and Gundam CDD are producing both voice and simultaneous programming for both Japanese and US versions of the team. American audiences must wait two or three weeks at the end of the Japanese season to catch the edited CDD episodes that have just moved to the dualdevel or subtitle versions or cartoon networks. <br /> <br /> Emotions are technically behind the sides that these two are fighting a war. The heroes who protect the rights of the world's richest and noble people from the band of suit terrorists, their mobile suits win winners' winners and win any and all costs. It is not war, it's "total war" Each person, each building, a target for every road attack, both the earth and the closure. <br /> <br /> My only complaint, and did not get ten scores because, on the way to going through about three, it just died for some episodes and nobody remembers. Like the current flashback, it is a penalty for what it reveals about the character, but at the same time it dragged what should be between project: meteor and ozed. But the final two episodes and over-play-cartoon-networks (back in 2001-2003) mobile suits: Gundam Wing: Asim Waltz is more than the film's drawback.
