Japan is a serious problem. Satan repressed Edo, took the worldly form and pushed them into disobedience. Above, the resurrection of Ashura, Queen of Giants, near. The only thing that stands against this deadly threat is the Demo Wardenes, the horrific team of fighters, who may themselves be bad as ghosts. <br /> <br /> Ezoomo Retired Damon Warden, who five years ago, after the murder of innocent innocent child, took the theater instead of Dames Slaying (a battle that was remarkably memorable from Dusse to Don Bar scene). One night facing an opportunity he met a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki. Their fate is sincere (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your ordinary Japanese fantasy / swardplay epic, you will be wrong. In fact, there is nothing common about Ashura. It is a hajj-pajam of different types. Only those who mention, as well as a comedy, drama, and romance. Director Jojo Jogi jogel with a fair respect (though, comedy appears to be forced in some scenes), and the end result is a ridiculous, but really funny popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Make sure the film is in error. Humor seems contrived to some, and places. And acting is not the greatest. But seriously, watch the fantasy / swordplay / comedy movie for the great acting you played ?? No, we look for their actions and crazy CGI visuals, which are on Sparis in Ashura. Due to not being confusing, the film is not all work, but to keep the average audience happy, it is substantially shifted with a lot of swords and green blood bucket. <br /> <br /> bottom line; The film has its fault and it is not an epic of martial arts, but does not try to do it and it has attractive visual and good sword activity. The reason that the film is working for me is that it does not take it very seriously and if visitors do the same thing, then this funny and stupid sword will be delighted by the fantasy action flick. <br /> <br /> My rating is 7 out of 10. Fun Popcorn movie.
