Opening Credit: Great. Music: Right for this photo. Cinematography: Lazy to great effect. <br /> <br /> Here's a way to tease the horoscope. What could be life out of control? The "Wonderland" drug-induced wildness (and its consequences) is not as a separation but it shows how it actually happens in our society. It is better than other wild group illustrations - because of all the masonry films, books, etc., the humorous mindset is so astounded that today's overall rhythm and randomness of the overall picture. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some of the best "method-acting" films, then see Kilmer in this movie. He shows how "method" can play the right role. <br /> <br /> Here the filmmakers only succeeded to raise the "controlless" level of the industry, giving us the cheap thrills.
