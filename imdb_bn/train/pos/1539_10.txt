I saw this at the Mill Valley Film Festival. It is hard to believe that Mrs. Blom is an operative debut, it is beautifully portrayed and performed. The big stories of the characters can be out of the novel Anne Tyler, as if they are back with stories and potential future, a false note, a wonderful explosion of humor in self-stimulating concern, and a world-isolation conflict is very real. If you've seen "Best of the youth," you know how much the characters have been drawn through the shortest moments, even the story continues intensely. I really hope this gets distributed in the US. I live in a fairly sophisticated film market, but we rarely get Swedish movies.
