Director Douglas Sirac scored again with this, all the inconvenient family films grandaddy. This lovely, trashy Saga is a wonderful composition, mixing all the elements of the Sequk Tombes nicely and strategically putting them all in one movie. The 1980 TV series "Dallas" and "Dynasty" were very strongly influenced, because it is mainly the length of the characteristics of the next night's sops. <br /> <br /> <br />, New York City Secretary Lucy Moore played, who married oil baron, Kyle Headley (Robert Stack). Their unknown, Mitch Owen (Rock Hudson) is quiet, but falls in love with sexy secretary. They all go back to Kyle's family palace in Texas, where we meet her white trash-of-sister Mary (Darthall Malone in Oscar-winning celebrations). Yipee! Sparks begin to fly - from romance to catfights, it's a camp trip. Mitch does not have to fight against the feelings she has only for her best friend, but she can not keep true love together with her, because Mitchell tries to sleep on all of them. Topping it all off, Kyle learns impotent, but anyway Lucy's pregnant ends. <br /> <br /> it's pure soap and pure melodramatic relaxation. How do you like it? This image is one of Universal's most popular films and Directors signals one of the best works of Sikk. Few blurred and visual metaphors of the conversation are cast in every way - the whole theme of the wind is a great one. Cast is superb, even though the top bills behind Hackson are completely unused. The loss of the stack Oscars has ruined him. She was very happy to consider this his best performance and apparently lose someone. And he introduced a fantastic performance as drunken drilling. What a stunning movie! This movie proves that I am thinking of age - Sirak Classic Melodyma Masters. Where is his Oscar? <br /> <br />
