I saw on TV last night, and was quite happy. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that makes your heart feel beautiful and warm, and believes that there are still some love in the world (all neighbors see what is helping to do any mercy and protect it - old police My favorite), although you know that this story is not quite realistic. <br /> <br /> I like acting (they are all ordinary, common people, English coastal cities of small resident films), but the best thing about the movie was that wit and humor! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the whole story!
