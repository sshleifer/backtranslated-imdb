Yusuf's right <br /> <br /> "Rolph Bakhshi", the film "Coonskin" has seen a satirical complaint of blacksmithing films and negative black stereotypes, as well as black color in Modern America. Modern for the day, I mean - 1975). Paramount It explodes in a flame that just sprays like a hot potato. <br /> <br /> But it's a vicious film, controversial, thrilling, and almost certainly must be seen by definition. Another random "shock-jack" in a movie trying to shock the shock is not. This is by Ralph Bakhshi. Anyone who knows this name knows that if he creates a movie then he has something to say ... <br /> <br /> Although its roots are in cheap blackploiting, "Coonskin" is not just another camp. Mainstream white film or blank type of blank flicker. "Coonskin" wants to be more By targeting it, it is a higher place and some big fish fries. <br /> <br /> This movie does not just make fun on the stage. Or is it just blame black people, but in a really strange place love, beauty and heart can show. <br /> <br /> "Kansakin" tells a story about some prison breaks waiting to be broken. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Italian crowd performs all the real tasks. <br /> <br /> The big name is Black Musician star: Barry White and Scammon Crowds, as well as Charles Gordon, with the first black playwright Pulitzer. Obviously there is something big happening here <br /> <br /> This movie is running like a dynasty at the end of the ethnic division. A angry, hip, deep, spirit black man with a gun in his heart and his hands <br /> <br /> Bakhshi's movie "know not to mean sublety word." Looks like this word is never heard. But maybe there is such a need of extremism. Real sledgehammer taunts Some things can not be tackled silently. <br /> <br /> Bakhshi God-cruel ruthless. Here, no member of the Harlem scene or minority seems helpless. <br /> <br /> Here the characters are "animated" depending on what "mood and situation" is "real". Animated characters and people all share the same reality and take it literally. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He always has something to say. No black face is inevitable. Here, unlike Spike Lee's "palms", it seems to be using and using it to really say something. <br /> <br /> 99.9% of all movie hits include animation and live-action. Usually at the same time. Baski is not just shocking here. All of these techniques are intertwined, meshing together with something to say. <br /> <br /> Somehow, this feels an uncertain date. Many such films (included in Bakhshi) are very topical, at this moment very clear. They reflect certain trends for the day, but after a few years looking back at them, there is an irrational feeling of only one nostalgia (as well as timeless truth). <br /> <br /> While music, clothes, carpets and cities clearly appear like a picture which once is a capsule, attitude, soul and heart, it does not matter whether it is F-King's ear. Let me know what I am saying about real movies, state situations and people's company. <br /> <br /> Some of the black letters also include a bunny (jungle), a big ol 'beer and a fox. One of the most annoying and helpless racist characters is a dirty Harlem police who warmed the policeman after the death of "dirty n -----s" train. But for that, it's not just business. It is for the rest of the brothers who wear shields. <br /> <br /> The sequence associated with Godfather and his lady is one of the ongoing pieces of the film. There are many of them. It's like playing an opera or a ballet. <br /> <br /> Preacher Line: Caution: "This movie blames everyone!" This is not just hype. Proceed with extreme caution. <br /> <br /> You have warned by Dan Yusuf <br /> <br />
