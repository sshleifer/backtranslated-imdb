New York does not look so good! And there is no one in this movie. Although the script is a bit lightweight, you can not help in the film or like a letter in it. You almost like this people really existed. The appeal of the actors is actually put on top of it (John Ritter, Colin Camp and Darthy Dorothy Statin are especially good.) Go ahead and rent or buy this movie, you'll be happy.
