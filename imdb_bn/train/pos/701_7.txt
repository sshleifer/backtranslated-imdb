I do not know what to be omitted, so I think it was not much better than that. My mistake is that it does not get a bad small film. Tess Nanawati is a relatively new director and writer, so I think she deserves a lot to make this film. You can say that it has been a work of love for her. Acting (outside of the domain) is a little hungry and the film quality is not big, but it is actually good for low budget movies. There was a time when the line of story goes slowly and some parts are dragging, even though I do not realize that it is very bad for someone to understand the film. If you love Dominican Monaghan as much as I love, I'll ask for it. Gag Reel was fun, I'm not gonna loot it but it's a special scene which makes it right for the DVD to buy so you can see it over over. If you like the film, see The Pink Minar, a movie by Jagga Edge. I know Dominic fans will enjoy this little piece of heaven.
