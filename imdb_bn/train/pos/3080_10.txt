I have complained ABC about canceling six degrees. If enough people do the same thing then this extraordinary show can be enough to bring life back !! Just go onto the official site and the rest is easy enough. I do not understand why this show has been canceled. What a fantastic show, cast and characters. The whole idea is gripping to see! I just amazed that my favorite show ended after one series. Why? Six degree phenomenal, it's better than many other TV programs there! As long as I have heard that it closes it from a friend that it has not happened to me that it can happen.
