The ship can be shrunk but the movie !!! Director, James Cameron, again made this amazing picture from 'The Terminator'. One of my favorite scenes is the 'Dinner Table' scene, in which Raj's family and friends meet Jack after he's saved. Rose watches over her face that when you fill 'one' every woman should be ... I hope I will see that face while living with my future husband. <br /> <br /> Jack and Rose have a connection to 'movie stuff' but this is good movie stuff. We have a greedy mother and all her elite partners have been stuck to the lives of their husbands. Rose committed suicide, but the Gilbert Wine Starter saved her. I really liked hanging over the boat scene It was a good risk. <br /> <br /> The movie is long but it is fantastic !!! Good story, good flow, good actor !!! If you want to see it twice, its value !!!
