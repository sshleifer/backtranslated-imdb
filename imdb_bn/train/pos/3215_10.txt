This was excellent. Touch, action-packed, and perfect for Kurt Russell. I liked this movie, deserve it bigger than 5.3 or more. This movie is a story of an outcast soldier who lives more than a soldier, and who can learn that there is war, they need to protect. I cried, smile and mostly sit in fear of this story. Good writing work for an action flick, and the plot was suitable and fairly difficult. The finishing was not twisty, but it was still excellent. If you want to escape from New York, or rooting for the underdog, this movie is for you. It was not difficult to observe that respect, not the inappropriate amount of violence or violence. Something for everyone.
