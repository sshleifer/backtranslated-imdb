I have seen a couple movies on eating illness but this one was definitely one of my favorite ones. There were problems with other problems that those who are eating food automatically become better at the end or they accept the need for their help. I thought this movie is more realistic than the original because it is not only better but automatically. She gets better and then there is an error. I think this movie shows more than others which I have seen that is not only good but it is not happening, it takes hard work and time, it is a long way to recover I think that this movie looks very good at all. This will be more movies like this.
