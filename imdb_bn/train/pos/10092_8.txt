Elizabeth Taylor is in love with the owner of a tea farmer from British Kamlaon (now Sri Lanka) as a young girl in London. After the arrival, he immediately came out of the place and was compelled to adapt to the new culture as well as be constantly aware of the ankle of angry elephants. The Life of Emil Zolla and William Dieter, directed by Portrait of Jenny, who is somewhat dark, and almost dull, has been inspired by this romance and the setting is the most beautiful one to see with black. And white themed palaces and fantastic island scenery.
