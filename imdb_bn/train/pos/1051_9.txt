This is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in Cameroon. "Sister" legal female lawyer and judge who successfully accused husband for offending behavior in 2004 and divorced a woman who strictly wanted it through a woman council. It is about two hours - but almost two hours - but the autocrat and the defendant and the two lawyer who were successfully represented in the courts rooms, preside with the chairmanship of both the women judges. With so many questions about how exactly this change happened, it leaves me as it leaves you. When and how did the authorities occupy the position of women in Cameroon? Most of the cases featured in this film usually have a significant effect on the treatment of women by their spouses? If a Muslim court divorces a ceremony against a husband's good wishes? I'm not suggesting that filmmakers could answer this question. They made the movie two years ago, not yesterday. And they deserve a broad audience in the making of the movie.
