Ahista ahista is a small bright. I started to see it, and at first I was a little bored because the pacing was slow and the original concept of a guy was not really new to fill the lost girl. But because the film was going on, I started getting involved in filming and writing, superb writing and charming romance. The film was very simple and natural, and after some time I felt I was seeing a real document of a man's life. This feeling of the film is a very good reason, and it's a new genius named " He is a very strong believer like simple, kind heartwarming and struggling Ankha, whose new love motivates him to live a better life and correct. Throughout the film, she is presented as a general rogue guard, but also as a helper and loving person, who would do something to protect her love like others. Deol shows various shades of his character, whether positive or negative, naturally and completely relaxed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With Ankush's relation screenplay, among which his friend and his love interest is in the meadow, which he is ready to do for anything. Nair said to kiss his friend aloud loudly loudly He likes to drive his crazy and annoy him with every occasion, yet we see that he occupies a very special place in his heart and as proof of many scenes him as a mother-figure. Other stories except Abhay did well. Although Soha Ali Khan was not standing in my opinion, he was good and had some mother's charm. Ankush's acting actor Ankush's 'Khaala' was very good acting actress. <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, the film was outstanding. The conversation was still fair in general, and the script was also fantastic. Although it was not a new story, it was never too extra and harmonious and it had no effort to look bigger than life. The most vulnerable to the film was the obscure music of Himesh Rashmemiya, which was inappropriate for this movie. Otherwise, Ahistaa Ahista was a delightful watch and it was even better with each scene. The idea can not be new, but the movie looks fresh and with the story gone, it becomes increasingly heartfelt. The finishing was bittersweet, kind of sad but hopeful. In short, this film grows slowly gradually, and it can easily be considered as the memorable work of wonderful writing, moving moments, charming romance, realistic process, and of course Abhay Deol.
