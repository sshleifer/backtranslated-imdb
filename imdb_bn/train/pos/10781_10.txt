Road Rovers were a great show of the canteen superheroes chosen by the master to commit crime in the world. The show was humorous to say the least. Simple and complex joke which can apply for all ages. Running across a series that might spawn a drink game. The action was mesmerizing, and cleverly set up. Characters were very original, each had very different personality. But to enjoy this event, I had the most characteristic depth. Each of them publishes struggle and mental problems that are never published, but the theorem includes. Hopefully, one day there will be a way to see Rover working again.
