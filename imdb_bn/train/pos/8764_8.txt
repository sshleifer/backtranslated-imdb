Alice (Claire Danes) and Darlene (Kate Bekinelsel) were always best friends and after graduation, they decided to go to Thailand. Due to an incident, they meet a young interesting mysterious newborn, who invite them to go with Hong Kong on weekends. But Alice and Darlene at the airport misinterpreted drug heroes and they were sent to jail. Now it's time for absolute survival and true friendship. It was a beautiful movie, I saw it a few times, and after some time you noticed that they had some plot holes, but the film still gives you relaxation. Claire Danes has done a great job as usual, she is a great actress. I'll give the Brokodown palace 8/10
