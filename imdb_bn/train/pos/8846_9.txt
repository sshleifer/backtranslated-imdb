I really enjoyed this drama from Sydney Lumet. The best word I could describe it is insane. It threw the viewer for about an hour and fifty minutes and the credits did not give you breath until the roll started. Believe me, this movie will assume you the whole way. <br /> <br /> The story is very well-made and almost bright. It's almost like a complicated Tarantino type story All played and even small parts, all of the wonderful cast from the wonderful cast. I like cinematography, it gave it a real feeling as an independent film. It was all great. <br /> <br /> This movie is excited, tedious and heartwarming. It's almost hard to see but you will be glad that you
