I like this movie. It was a very good job! Great acting and drama and historically correct. I love romy schneider movie. This stone is not big like cecci but still stone! <br /> <br /> and Scorpiolina, he commented and said the French dubbing. Well it's not a German movie French. So yes. The second one was a plot, probably not familiar with your history. Oh and his mother played the part of his guru, not his teacher. And the story is not actually Cinderella, but Queen Victoria, you probably missed the story. <br /> <br /> However ... the history of this movie is great, I like historical movies and Queen Victoria is very impressive! I love all the historical elements. The man who tried to interfere with his mother was trying to intervene. And when she fled and her future husband met and she showed him "new kind of dance" Waltz. Waltzing was new when couples danced so much because it is considered kinda scandalous. Oh my glory was my god! <br /> <br /> And clothes, I like clothes. The style is awesome, the hoop skirt is awesome. And of course Romy always looks very nice.
