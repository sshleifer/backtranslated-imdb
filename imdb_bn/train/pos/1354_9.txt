For business and interested people in the corporate world, this show is simply the best of the best. One of the former competitors of his show on this innovative show wrote: Business people were finally an audience. The whole idea is perfect; A group of traders compete with each other about business-related work, the best place in the world, New York City set. Donald is perfect as a tram boss, although his ego is bigger than the infinite bar of the universe. He made many suspicious decisions about burning the fire, which is negative about the show. <br /> <br /> Season 1: Overall of the Great Season, the best season of "normal". This season was most about actual business efficiency. Later, the series often sinks in marketing related work with many products. Overall Great and Attractive Competitive, Never With The Most Characterized In This Series: Troy I know that I'm not the only person that Amy and Nick agreed to win this tram world tower-episode where he was shot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The work was still quite right, and it was a lot interesting contestant. Jane Mm was terrible and could not make it final, IMO Also, this season was the worst firing ever (Pamela). <br /> <br /> Season 3: terrible. In fact, I liked the idea of ​​books on smart v. Street memorabilia, but throwing was so terrible (it proves that trams also hate cast) The whole season was a total disaster. The best moment was the second episode (the renewal of the Muto), Prime Minister Brian was fired, a man who did not add anything except a lot of comedy values. <br /> <br /> Season 4: Attractive episodes and interesting because in this season (especially Randall, Al, Marcus, and total disaster whose name was shipped). The "Take Me at the Boardroom" episode is one of the most classic of this show, which concludes with the well-known quad firing. Sadly, I think we've been robbed for the Random vs. ALA Final. I think the tram is afraid that he can win, and it prevents it from happening. <br /> <br /> Season 5: It's a boring season with some special things. Brent was just an embarrassing and apparently only to create the drama. The work was grossly terrible (how to make jingle to do business with?). I suppose to win the best man, but personally I can not care less. <br /> <br /> Season 6: I can see why they wanted to try LA as a new location for the show, but to look back it was a mistake. New York will always be the place for this. Many new things have been added this season, most of them are terrible (eg losing to sleep outside the team's nostrils, for example, the Prime Minister wins the PM candidate). The work was terrible and the tram also elected the winner to the wrong. James suspects it, no doubt. <br /> <br /> Season 7: Celebrity Edition. The best season ever. Completely different rules (like using Rollscape), but all fun and entertainment. The biggest problem was that most of the contestants were not real celebrities, especially women who were unknown to me except Omrsa, which she participated in total disagreement. It started to be a seasoned genre, but after making a complete fool at the time of Kodak Task, another man came out of the shadow: Pierce Morgan. He has never mastered the season like that. He crushed his opponents and came to a man with a great sense of humor (although some insane Americans (certainly not all Americans make mistakes) sadly did not understand the social skills. <br /> <br /> I recommend the UK version to play Sir Alan Sugar for this fan. Actually, the British version is even better, and America (and originals) really say something to a great show. One aspect of the UK version is that competitors generally behave like a decent man in the boardroom, that constant and irreverent behavior in the US version.
