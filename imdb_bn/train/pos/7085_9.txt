I just bought DVDs and of course I would say, (after watching Brazil and hating Las Vegas) Terry again. Along with being a fan of Monty Python films, Terry Gilliam's talent follows this scientist, who plays a great role in Bruce Willis James Cole, and along with (perhaps my favorite character) Brad Pitt, who played like a madman, Jeffrey Gains One must definitely be for science fans, or any type of movie fan because it contains suspicion, drama, action etc. In any way, in the future, 1% of the world's population survives a disease aimed at eradicating the human race, which was exposed by the "army of twelve monkeys" in the past. James Cole (Bruce Willis) was sent back in 1996 (when the virus spread) to know about this disease, so scientists of his time could find healing. Before I go further, James Cole lives in an underground society, and because of this disease, the world is ruled by the world which kills people. However, when sent to him again, he was actually sent in 1990, where he was sent to psychiatric hospital due to his speech in the virus. During his stay, he met Jeffrey Goen (Brad Pitt) who was later responsible for the elimination of mankind. He meets his psychologist (Madeleine Stove) finally to save the world with Bruce (which he sees as correct in his speech), sent him from earlier times and finally sent to Asked about his sanity, but later to release a suspicious ending of the film and after a little frustrating claw Mex created, where she virus (in fact it is not Brad Pitt), and instead of trying to stop the shot by the police as the killer gets away.
