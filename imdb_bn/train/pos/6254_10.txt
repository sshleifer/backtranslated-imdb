I saw this picture at the 2001 International Film Festival of Toronto. The title of the work there was 'Dog Days'. The audience response was mixed. Some people are too much for graphic sex and realistic violence. Others have actually understood how good this movie is. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is not meant for heart disgust. It's like 'happiness' with a less-optimistic view of explicit sex and humanity. Animal poisoning, strip-tease of a senior citizen, shopping center in the purple bathroom, anal candle penetration, and mentally disrespectful. <br /> <br /> If any of these sounds that this film is not too much for you to handle. This image shows her the most noble and kind humanity. The style of our existence has made our consciousness cool with extreme glide. <br /> <br /> There is no interest in Sill for the release of humanity. And why should he? This image features excellent performance from all, always interesting, and in some time the film will probably make the most intelligent social statements.
