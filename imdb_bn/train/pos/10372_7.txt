Roll is a wonderful little film. Toby Malone is an 18 year old child (played very well, football) who plays in football. Mallon cousins ​​take out two gym bags, a drug lord, some tough bikes, some policemen, and some prostitutes, most twists and turns in the night before brave night with great boldness ... and the movie assumes us that there are no signs of the law, What is the content of the gym bag and even the key gender is a key biker. Some parts of it remind me of lock stock and two smoking barrels. <br /> <br /> Roll for me has strengthened three opinions that I have kept before roll. These opinions are: 1. I really want to visit Australia one day. Country and city are beautiful and it looks like a cool place for a holiday. <br /> <br /> 2. Some of Australia's best filmmakers Role in cinematography was particularly impressive. I like the many visual styles and lighting. <br /> <br /> 3 Australian women hot!
