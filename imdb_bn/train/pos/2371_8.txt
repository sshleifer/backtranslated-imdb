I advised to hire this image to my friend and he has already seen the film and he is obliged to say that he is right. I felt that this title was a small camp because the title version was known as "The Fear: Halloween Night". I'd like to be somewhat disappointed with the Halloween rip with this film's killer woodman. But it was opened with a good view, and the killer immediately killed two, and 20 years later met with his son, where his son saw him (with his mother) and he saw the death of his ancestors that he was going to an isolated cabin, his friends and his girlfriend With a wooden statue where he encountered his fears, a wooden statue is with his father's spirit Come until the forest. Beautiful for a sequel and I did not even meet at first.
