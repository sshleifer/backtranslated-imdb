My grandma bought me this film at the age of 5 (I always like scary movies) and even I enjoyed it. The atmosphere is awesome and stories are original and entertaining. I especially like scenes where the scenes are under attack in the desert. The stone is actually believable for such a low budget flick. For such movies, the performance is more average and the music is lazy. This is definitely an uder rated jewel. I first suggested those who liked these weird films in the late seventeenth century, such as "Alice, Sweet Alice", "Pure Pretty Eddie", "Nightmare", "Massacre of Hospital", and "Alien's Return of the Deadli" Of course, a classic !!
