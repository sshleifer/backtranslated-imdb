I have never seen the 'Next Action Hero' program, and although there are no other comments here, this movie was not a 'award' from that contest. I was just exploding the channels and came across this, saw myself, saw the courage of encouragement, in the end all the way. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot has ended (the most dangerous game, etc.) But I Expected, and almost got, 'Gopa' - how the hero was finally going to beat the hunter. I think high tech overdone (GPS) and provided me with Knight Rider's cold-woke flashbacks, but it was not too overdone. <br /> <br /> My main problem with this movie was the degree SOD (suspension suspension) that needed visitors. Do we really think that anyone flying in a helicopter can hide numerous firefight grenades in public bridges and show any COPS for the investigation? A limousine can make countless donuts in a Las Vegas intersection and show up any COPS? Pleeease The kind of things that are too much - make fun to watch the clock, but keep it at least spacious, thank you very much. <br /> <br /> The final solution was good, but after the end it was frustrating. A Bad Star Trek Episode At least now I realized why acting was so silent - except Jane, who was unable to work as an IMH - she was a winner from a reality show. <br /> <br />
