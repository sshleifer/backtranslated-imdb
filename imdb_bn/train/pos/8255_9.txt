Fido is an intelligent comedy who deserves greater recognition, especially considering mainstream shit which is supposed to entertain us today. <br /> <br /> It has already been mentioned that it employs a real zombie movie rather it is necessary to spare a sweet ironic finger pointing. Although there are some bloody scenes, there is almost no gorgeous and how the film is presented (feel good 50's style), I can not imagine that anyone is not afraid to be frightened by Fido and his colleagues. <Br / <br /> <br /> Although Cast is generally good, I felt that Moses and Nelson were standing. Humor is not in your mouth but has changed; The details have a lot of attention and I find myself catching smiling differently throughout the movie. This is certainly not an excellent composition in the movie, but does not try to do it - instead of curry heart-warming is successful in providing black comedy.
