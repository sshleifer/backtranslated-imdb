I did not read anything better than this movie and finally got a chance to late last night and everything I expected was all there. This should be the true horror movie. I think because it was horrible because it was realistic. Wonderful sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood. I like the dramatic opening scene and enjoy how the rest of the movie plays. It was very easy and easy to follow, some complex movies which were very complex. Special effects were very good. I would love to watch such a horror movie. This is my darling easily. A realistic thunder and thunderstorm set up a beautiful environment for this film. Otherwise all the elements in this movie were awful. I recommend this movie to someone who can not praise a great scary movie, which makes fifty pieces. I'll add it to my collection. The DVD has some interesting features.
