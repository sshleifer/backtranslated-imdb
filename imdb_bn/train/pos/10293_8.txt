'Bruce All-Time' XI won the 11th Oscar win! This will be the highest earning movie of 'Titanic'! Jim Carrure's brightness will be at such a high level for his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Then the Almighty! If these glorious imagination only the filmmakers (in the carn) will enjoy the power of God. Carrier's new smile is the same premises among the 'Bruce Almighty' riot. Carr played Bruce Nolan, a television reporter who was so obsessed with the original anchor that he kept God completely blamed for his competition. God, played by the heavenly Morgan Freeman, gave Bruce the "gift of God" (his power) so that he can challenge him if he can do better in God's work. Obviously, Bruce goes away 'cariad' with his new happy faculty and uses them selfishly. Carrie Bruce 'almighty' returned to his habitual almighty comedy form. Jennifer Aniston was not 'mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, director Timothy Shadyak does not go out to leave the dog for # 2 to my Premier Kudo director, and we always show the sunny dog ​​bathroom show! 'Bruce Total' is not the maximum depth of a career, but it is still one of the best glittering exhibitions of 'Carrierism'! **** Good
