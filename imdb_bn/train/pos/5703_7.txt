I'm a fan of Crash and Blade Runner, and this movie is a highway death and a movie of 80 that searches for the noir themes that I like to see, so I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> In general, the silent play of the stupidity of the film is not well dragged by the female leadership and its hero is almost neanderthal, so the cautious caution.
