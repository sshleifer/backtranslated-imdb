I will admit, I thought the movie is not going to be any good, but I changed my mind soon. Guess the direction the movie directs you. His role as Pearce Brosnan Hit Man is amazing, who were burnt to death suddenly and asked a man who met in the Mexican bar for help. Greg Kinneara is a very nice man, as his role as Denver's flexible man, who started innocuous conversations with Pierce in Mexico Bar. The film will be laughing by giving a peacenous laugh (mostly about sex). The film's fantasy is done very well, especially in the BullFight scene and when Pierce himself tries to finish himself, his last job is to see himself.
