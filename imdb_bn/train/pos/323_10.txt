This is not really a great movie with a revolutionary message (both form and content) that should not be missed by French New Wave or any fan of underground film. There are only open or closed credits - we have only excluded the consumer industry, revolution and the world of youth. This image is nothing short of the documentary and it is more interesting to play with our ideas of advertising and its relationship with the reality. True and true lines are excused by the familiar way with the films discussed in the documentary, but at this time we do this for giving real description, eating and marketing.
