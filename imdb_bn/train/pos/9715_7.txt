Skinny here, it looks like it's too old, so I think. But it's still cool. Bicycle dirty works for cool and the most part of the story. There are problems with some characters which I hope to work by part 2 and it seems to be a macros closed my biggest allegation. Not just animation style but different character designs. For example, all the girls in this movie are like a microscopic line. Matches are similar to other characters as well as macros. This is not really made for kids, it contains graphic violence, nudity, and graphic sexual content. So to make a long story short I'm off of this cool macro 7 star.
