Now this show looks like most of the other genres from the mid-90's, but it's the only one that's different, they use a lot of comedy and action and maybe some of the drama too. I personally had a good show on it, I do not understand why they would cancel it. The best thing is that fan base of this event is still alive since 1997. <br /> <br /> I hope the World Bank will bring mourning or do a movie which I know is impossible to do, but it does not hurt in the dream, is not it? <br /> <br /> However, if you do not see the 13 episode DVDs, I would recommend it. The characters are great, the story line is good, the comedy is good and the good show is just great.
