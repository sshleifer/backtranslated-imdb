Jerry is invisible when diving into ink bottles and forgotten that cat and mouse are involved in normal chase. Instead of seizing the chance to change the mouse mouse or room to spy some, he uses his newly discovered invisible Tom torment. And it is quite funny and quite inventive despite being a funny cartoon. And never do the work house interior, which typically features below average T & J shorts. Still worth 7/10. However, I'm not sure any invisible mouse can shade a wall on the wall, it reflects the nature of physics and invisible.
