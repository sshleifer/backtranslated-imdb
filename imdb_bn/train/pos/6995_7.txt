Rather, as a crazy scientist (yes, a Ranfild-like assistant and his mother, a dwarf, and yes, the scientist's wife (actually sounds like Greenway movie), like the lugosi is a nasty piece of business. Logosi gives his wife injections from the dead Who knows them?) So that his wife can look beautiful. He carries the brides with some asteroid after the cute clever Which breaks the prostitution on the altar.Another bride bites the dust, the newspaper correspondent just feels to be around for the scoop, and snoop around for a story, she sees all kinds of things about Orchids and Lugosi.Heaven knows where the police was. Lair closed, when he met a sort of strange detective doctor who could not be neglected or could not. The crazy scientist plans to have a fake wedding, but it seems that the scientist has an X-ray vision, because he failed his plans, oh no! What would happen? I really like this movie as a bit of a guilty pleasure. The logosi is great here, its hangers-on is all too weird, the story is actually somewhat nasty, which makes it the most spectacular. Have a fun little look.
