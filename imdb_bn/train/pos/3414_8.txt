This interesting documentary tells the story of an unusual trip to the blind Tibetan children in the Himalayas; But a personality conflict between two extraordinary people. On one hand, Erik Weihnmiera, the first blind person to climb Mount Everest and the guiding guide for the children (visible) climbers. On the other hand, there is Sabrine Taberkeken, a blind woman who immediately operates the first school for the blind Tibetans, who agrees with the campaign, but later on how it is suspected of progress. At some level, Sabin does not just understand the visitor's view of the hill (it emphasizes the compilation); He is probably right to detect differences between climbers and children's desires, but his certainty of his accuracy makes him sympathetic to his tough person, especially his veto. This (reasonably well-known) conflict in the background, we can get insight into the children's own life. I enjoyed the movie, though it definitely provides a message designed to upholstate - although it describes the quarrel in detail, but the film is a bit louder and louder. But it is difficult to debate the assessment, even if the viewer is presented somewhat uncertainly.
