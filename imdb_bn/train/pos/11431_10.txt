My third year French class always enjoyed this film. In a multi-cultural, inner city high school, many things have been provided for movie discussions (in class in French, but I know there are many discussions later in the class). Proteo and Ax are more pronounced in one and the other. <br /> <br /> I always mentioned that I thought this movie was one of the "sex workers" scenes I've ever seen in a movie. One year, 17-year-old African-American cried out, "Yes!" When he drew out the scene: While Pretty helped to replicate Amy on her evening, both of them tested the reflection of the mirror. When the directors use "Irish Technique" in one scene, one or more characters want to focus on internal conflicts in a scene: this is a perfect example of the technique and it is "sexy". <br /> <br /> Most students could understand the end of this movie. According to one, the theme of the movie was "Africanism" and no one could love African or African people who loved it (such as trying to drive a driver): be an African.
