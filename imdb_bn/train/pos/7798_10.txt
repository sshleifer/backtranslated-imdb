I can not start to describe how amazing this movie is. Do not be afraid, I am depressed about how bad I think of any wrong thing at any time, I rent this movie to keep it in the right mind. Background music realizes how to give you simplicity of the existence and simplicity for maximum happiness. The Indian girl who sings is an example of a character in this film which does not work hard and is happy with it. Percephaina, Ruby (Ashley Judd) Laundry co-worker = Another's eye and smile can make the day of the most difficult person. I see this movie and dream about having a good conversation or good conversation with friends, and I realize that living alone - Ruby is not alone - not being alone. Recommended to enjoy the contemplative enjoyment of any movie.
