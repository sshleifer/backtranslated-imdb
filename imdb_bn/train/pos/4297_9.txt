Now and then a filmmaker gives life to a unique group of people and lets us see something that makes us human. Lawrence Casanen has done this again. I always think that his age was in BG Sylli and he was able to manage it again in the Grand Canyon. In each of us we find ourselves in a place where we have a chance to choose life and often we blow it down. This is a movie about people who find courage and have a taste of life. Our real talent is to see what we think of little and big events which often we think about trivial things. I have seen this picture several times and I am amazed at how deep it is to play through this movie. Danny Glover and Kevin Kline played their role in the superb acting, and Steve Martin's film-making rendition was invaluable. Thank you again
