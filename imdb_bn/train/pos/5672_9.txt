In this installment of the series, Edmund Blumberder is stuck in Britain's Regency era (George III in the later part of the regime). During this time, the possibility of BlackDowder is far more poor - instead of Royalty, he is very much a slave of the fourth (price controller). In contrast to the historical accounts of George Square, it is as bright as tomato and, often, BlackDader is able to take advantage of her and take schemes in her heart. The only major difference between this one and the styles in the past is that the series ends on a very, very different note - you have to believe it. Since the other, there are all the usual story elements and the show is pleasing. My only reservation (as always) is that this show is not suitable for children because of its filthy language and adult circumstances.
