This movie is a must see movie for all. Congress must see this true documentary from the point of view of the soldier, as it should be in America. The previous critic has completely missed the point - to point out the truth of our soldiers' education to kill people who are not terrorists, but who do it in our "enemy" areas and what the soldiers do to it. Before another person is killed or wounded, we will have to support our troops immediately to bring them home. It reveals that the government is not helping its veterans, mentally injured people, physically harmed physically with the sufferers. Julie A. Roberts, Streamwood, IL
