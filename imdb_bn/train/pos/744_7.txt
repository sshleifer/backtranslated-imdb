"Foxes" is a movie that I remember for teenage girls in the late 1970's. I'm just about the age of Jodie Foster, I related to this movie. It is related to disappointments, temptations, relations and youth rebellion. The soundtrack is great with such inspirational rock. "Feel more" than the tragic numbers like Boston and "The Radio" Doona Summer My late thirteen music Yes, I will always remember it even if it is not huge.
