At the age of 70, Ero Tolbukin burnt seven people alive in a mission in Guatemala. He announced that he killed more than 16 people (he killed pregnant women, and then he burned them in the fire). <br /> <br /> This movie is a documentary that depicts Aro's personality through many interviews. People got to know through some scenes that played by actor and actor based on the facts of the events. <br /> <br /> "Ero Tolbukhin" is a serious work, so analytical, it is not morbid at all. Such terrible testimony about how some childhood trauma can make a person a monster. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
