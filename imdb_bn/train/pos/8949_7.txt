Steve's other "Christmas movie" has moved above the middle-level entertainment, along with the Verito co-star Stuart (ending her romantic lead) and Novak raised it high. Chemistry is made for a fairly moving experience between the two stars, and more revelation can be generated from film if magic is seen as a metaphor for many personal relationships which threatens the relations of many people. All in all, a wonderful separation with the legendary stars, 7/10.
