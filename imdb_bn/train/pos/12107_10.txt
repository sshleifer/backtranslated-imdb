While living in New York, I saw this film as a child's animal specialty. It was a fantastic unclear movie, though Horror Hotel is not as good. I bought this movie on DVD and it is different from me, because the DVD I bought is where the actors speak French and / or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then another actor responded in English. Strange kind of Also in the DVD box, some actors have been made differently than the IMDB. Besides this, the character of the different Alas in this movie lifted his clothes and nude fired into a scene, and in another scene, with Julia Elizabeth (Barbara Steel) pushing her bed and opposing the steel kiss with her. Trying to come out. The scene that exists in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any additional footage that can be included in a remastered over-version? It is a sad fact that these older low budget classics are divided into bits and sold for all types of versions. Where is master tape and all unused footage? <br /> <br /> Allen's first annoying 20 minutes before reaching Kasle, the rest of the movie is quite good. There is no very special effect (but after the Julia Club Herbert's face makes him well). Wonderful atmosphere and Barbara Steel's strange, exotic, and seductive look will be much better than the movie. I can honestly say that if the style is not repeated in this film then it will be a big zero. He makes ten in the movie!
