William Powell starred in 1933, Mary Astor, Paul Cavanagh, Eugene Palette, Helen Winson and Ralph Morgan, "The Kennel Murdere Case" in Filo Vance. A dog show in which Filho enters his Scottish Terrier Captain, the locked room works with many suspects as a mystery background. The mystery is very clever and hesitant both complex and interesting. Since the conversation is still young, the camera work is a little stagnant, but Michael Cartridge does a good job of managing this work. <br /> <br /> Cast Cast is excellent; The whole cast brings a groove-up film Most actors, including Paul Lucas, Basil Rothbone, Wilford Heide-White, Edmund Lowe, James Stevenson, Allan Curtis, Warren William and others, played Filo Vans. Powell has played this (five times) most and it is most suitable for the role - very easy but at the same time serious. Before "The Than Man", it was made in large stardom. He spent 12 years in the film at the age of 12, in 1921 he started his career at the age of 20. An extraordinary person, great screen presence and outstanding actor who lived at the age of 92. We are lucky that his movies are available on DVD and TCM nowadays. "The Case of the Killer Murder" is a great story and a funny movie - do not miss it.
