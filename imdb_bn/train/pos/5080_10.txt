If any of the mail-backed films are produced or managed, you can bet on your life, any of these images will be seen for generations to come later. Only Claudette Colbert, (Allen R. Eving), "The Egg and Eye", 47, appearing on the film and performing it will create more of a great classic movie. In this film, Ellen Eving is married, and then she faces all kinds of mental problems and even murder. A lot of mysteries are involved and Robert Ryan, (David McLinn), "Battle of Boulogne", '65, Ellen comes with help and sometimes you even wonder about David up and up. When you look at this picture, you just start to understand yourself that the real perfect person and how suddenly you will finish the film, you start to change your mind. Claude Colbert and Robert Ryan played, who played a completely different role than the screen image. I forgot to mention that Maler was married to a big film star Adre Haipburn. Great classic film, with great classic actors!
