I used to say to some friends one day that "Scarfus sucks ... some offensive tried to set another godfather in the 80's." Now, I usually listen to the idiot / CNN, so I decided that I will stay away from here. Then my partner gave me the DVD and said, "# 1 with this #pelikanj", I tried to get confused. This is the best film ever. About stolen cars, these expensive cars are expensive for someone in the area, expensive for them (* cough2Fast2Furiouscough *), and more humorous than ... such as Paliking and 80's music. Still better than Al Pasino M203? I ***** out of ****, Suitable for supporters of Al or GTA: Vice City
