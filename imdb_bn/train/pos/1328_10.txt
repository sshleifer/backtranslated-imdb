Apart from "emotional immunity", this film that I want to find in DVDs offers extraordinary diving in the essential and psychological context of people's thinking before the "world's ruthlessness". That's thirty years, a director and a scenario writer can test such sympathy and for them it's a romantic fact that excellence makes me amazed. We are able to see and re-examine our film to keep it better and better than the temporary and cultural distances, because we have the necessary / insight, analysis and finally "basic idea". This concept of securing a secular world is almost impossible, the specific key to our behavior There is only adequate relevance for their future generations If anyone knows that I can get any egg copy or VHS? Thank you in advance.
