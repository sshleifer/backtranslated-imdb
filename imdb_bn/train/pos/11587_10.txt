I absolutely love this movie and really like it in a day. It's just a fascinating legend about an eagle we wear a shiny necklace, I like it and want to see it again! I do not think much about this, but a native American boy lives in a beautiful village with his family, and I do not think what will happen, but he has to go alone in the desert. His sister packs him some food and he goes. He's out there, some other Indian boy is coming out and he has some feathers on it, and he's been eagle. Legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing an animal necklace, it is a boy. I was always fascinated with legends, especially Native American legends and I like to release it from a DVD, please publish it, no one is concerned!
