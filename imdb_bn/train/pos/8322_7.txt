IQ is an interesting romantic comedy that has two great actors who make good clicks on the screen. The plot is wrong for a common guy girl, guy gets the girl format, but must mind with a heart, and makes a strong point with the mind. Albert Einstein's supply and his band band provides excellent comic releases. Overall, a good movie. Not great, but good
