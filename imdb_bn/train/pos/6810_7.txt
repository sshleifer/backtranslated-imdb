After reading the book, I went to Wal-Mart at 3 rupees across this DVD and worried, sure, what was ... I got the DVD and saw it last night. When I started to see it, I checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes. I thought, okay calm ... it started moving slowly, to know the story and how much it was. When I reached the real killings, I thought, "How many days are there in this time?" Check in. "One minute ?? What the hell?!" I felt incredibly deceived, thinking that the movie only progressed through one-third of the overall story. <br /> <br /> I'm happy to note that the DVD view selection menu is part 1 and a part 2. I was going for another hour! I was sitting very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie, even more than the first one. I acknowledge that I did not see the original film in 1967 (despite my sincere desire), I have read but the novel reads and feels that this is a fairly descriptive film, which is for a TV miniser in two parts. I think the role of Perry was completely wrong, and some slight inconsistencies leaned towards me, but still worked very well. The first half drags on a bit, while the second half is more gripping I think they have made more books in the capitol than the movie: 1/3 before the murder, 1/3 later, and 1/3 of the assassination of the killers. Instead, killing this image, 1/4 after 1/4 and making it more 1/2 before 1/4 of the murderers being arrested. Again, this second half creates sensational, but at the same time, it is less compelling when dragging the first half ... <br /> <br /> Now I look back and realize that I have made the same mistake, it is wrong to drag things, So I'll close the hell. Watch the movie and make your mind feel bad! <br /> <br /> Nick Huaston
