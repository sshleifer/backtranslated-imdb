With a bunch of boys at school we will give this a thumbs up. Even Grim Riper smile us. Those two alien things laugh at me, Bill and Ted were the most stupid but funny of the whole movie. It's much better than the first one. And yet for some reason I think it missed something. Some big Something important Made a nice house and girlfriends. No, I want to say good villains. Use Clone instead of Robot. I gave 7 out of 10 because of these two robotic decimals. <br /> <br /> Grim Ripper, do not be afraid that he is not like death, funny When I fall from the sky, I split a gut. Splat, I'm not sure about those aliens. Where are they? Scientists? No way.
