Although John Woo's Hard Boiled is my number 1 favorite movie. But I must tell the police story my number 2 favorite movie. I say this because my favorite part of stunts, fights and movies is when Jackie Chan climbs to the top of Mosul and walks in a pole around Christmas Lights and breaks the poles through a stylish and finally hard marble floors behind her land. Seek! Buy it at amazon.com for 14:98. (Or something between $ 14.) VHS new line home video. Please feel free to answer any questions or comments. (I'm only 14 years old but I know that you can find any movie.) If you look everywhere for a movie and can not find it, please answer me. Thanks and good night!
