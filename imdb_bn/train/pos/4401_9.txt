Check out these pictures and you will visit a sad piece of America. In addition to some fantastic action scenes (quite bloody at times). It is a story of love and devotion in particular men and a lady. It's Toby Maguire, Jeffrey Wright of Scott Ulrich and I've never heard or seen him before, as young lady Jewel I want to see more of him). Acting Top, genuine production quality, very good writing (adapted from this novel) <br /> <br /> This is a long film 128 minutes, but good value to see. <br /> <br /> My Ratings **** <br /> <br /> respectively <br /> <br /> Jay Harris <br /> <br />
