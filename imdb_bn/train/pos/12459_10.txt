This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies. Interaction between the respected and morally vulnerable characters thief and honorary code of honor among the members of the police. It deals with themes like beliefs like duty, crime, sound, manipulation, and a few movies, and unfortunately, I can not remember since the death of 'policeman' in the late seventeenth century. The sequence is delicious, indispensable, there is nothing to do and thus leads to visual and spectacular scenery, to lead visitors to the wrong and accurate spectacular plot for the needs of fewer samples. No such scene is present or required. Flawless and honest to the viewer, which is often an important asset of the kind that is achieved by betraying the audience, often a suspense. No, it does not miss the marbles ... a note for congratulations for the song, to see a movie and not to sleep every minute, not just for viewing.
