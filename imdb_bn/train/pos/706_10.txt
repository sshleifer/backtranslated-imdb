I must say that I wanted to watch this movie for a long time, and I was not frustrated. Dominink Monaghan is simply superb acting. As a part of the underlying myself, I can relate to how the story develops. I have never experienced anything like this but some awkward moment overlap sleeping and it can be scary. This is a great film, worth every penny. I hope that one day I will be able to work with Tess, it will be a respect and then. I can recommend it to everyone. Maybe small children may not be scared. But if you're insomnia like me, you can understand the world, mystery and fear. You like it <br /> <br />
