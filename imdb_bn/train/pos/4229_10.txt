Do not waste time reading my review. Go out and see this wonderful episode, which can be written very well in Colombo! Ruth Gordon has thrown herself completely as a fascinating mystery mystery writer, who killed her father in retaliation for the murder of her daughter. Columbo features its usual rumpled, befuddled and far-cleverr-she-feel self, and this special installment features gorgeous chemistry between Gordon and Falk. Ironically, it was not written by the Herald Builder Levinson or Link, perhaps the dense, most thoroughly rooted and packaged-colored plots in Colombo. Almost every section is satisfied and overflowing with droll and malicious dialogue and thinking. Really unexpected and innovative climax all tops. 10/10 ... Find it at Netflix!
