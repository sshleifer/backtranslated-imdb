You know, Robin Williams, God bless him, he has done this decade in front of these stupid comedies shooting in front of himself (probably the exception of "Death to Smokey" which was bombed when it came out, but now it is religious classic). He has recently made the drama spontaneous, especially "insomnia" and "one hour picture". Despite the mid-review and quick DVD release "The Night Audience", his best work, in time. <br /> <br /> It is a very cool story, although it is physically dangerous for a matter that does not include a serial killer or anyone else. The idea of ​​this film is a genuineness of deception which is not yet officially confirmed. At the high school, I read an autobiography by Anthony Godby Johnson, a child who had been subjected to terrible misuse and consequently had contract with AIDS. The story was removed because I could not read the report online even if the public was not in existence. When I saw this movie, Robin Williams revived my mind in such a brilliant mood that confused feelings <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> There was a lot of crying in her role in the film "Little Miss Sunshine". At that time he looked at the camera where I thought he was looking at me. It takes a good actress to play such a role, and this is a separate (yet a good review) role that makes Tony Colette one of the best actresses of this generation, even until nominated for the Academy Award (as of 2008). It is incredible that there is at least one woman in this world and it is very scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good, dark movie that I highly recommend. Be prepared to be uncertain, however, this movie leaves you with a strange feeling as soon as you get surprised.
