I lost my father at a very young age. So young, I do not really remember. Over the years, I learned a lot about him. One of them was that he loved the West and every Sunday evening he had a complete ceremony for Bananza. I myself think that the last point of the series is remembered, when the program was closed in 1973, it was 8 years old. Seeing this event in years, I became very close to my lost father. Shock has all the rights material to succeed; Smile, tears, your seat is the edge of mystery, and sometimes it gets angry at you too. The real run of my most breathtaking show came shortly after the death of our beloved "Hos" cartwright, Dan Blaker. Ending a special episode and closing credits, a picture of the blocker flashed and blackened, and I also reminded my oldest sister by looking in my eyes. I think like yesterday. From my late father, who is not here to tell himself here, we love Bananza. .
