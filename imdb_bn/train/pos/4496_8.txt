To make it simply, I enjoyed this picture. The reason for my interest and enjoyment is not related to anything other than content. I have heard stories about my mother and grandmother about how the use of the working class of the North American community (as experienced by them), and it is an interesting illustration that they presented to me faithfully. Especially, patternist but hugely parents who "challenge" this challenge when his "stubborness" is best for his family with "know". (There was not much change there !!) <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who watched this game will probably be frustrated with the film because the story does not easily move across different media. But in a sense, this film is a historical document and I personally enjoyed it, only if it reveals a social event.
