Year 1896. Jeff Wester (James Stewart) People do not like. He has only one friend and he is Ben Ttum (Walter Brennan), an old sympathetic man. They are running a cattle with them. Sheraway Gannon (John McIntyre) at the time of taking cattle, they are in danger at Skagway. Now Jeff will only have to get this back and take Dawson on the Canadian border in the United States. Now they have a group of other people like them, like Ronald Castle (Ruth Roman) and Rene Vallon (Corin Calvert). Here two men enter the gold business. The Fourth Cooperation of Anthony Mann and James Stewart The Far Country (1954) is a truly fine western. The acting act is fantastic Walter Brevin has created a wonderful sidecar near Stewart. Roth Roman is bright and happy with Calvin Calvin. J. C. Much like Flippon Dawson Marshall Ruby Morris. Great Jack Elam and Caslin Freeman watch in small roles. How could Jimmy Stuart be overwhelmed? There are only people and their rifles. But he is too weak.
