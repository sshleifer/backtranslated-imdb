After reading some negative views of this movie, I'm not sure whether I will have to pay some money for renting However, it was a beautiful surprise. I did not see the original movie, but if better than that, I'll be in heaven. <br /> <br /> Tom Cruise gives strong performance as a seemingly troubled David, he believes that he laughs more than he is (for the third time in his career - another example was Magnolia and born July 4). Penelope Cruz met a little light but demanded for his role, such as Diaz. The only clash is the little hug Kurt Russell. In the film, it does not act like it is really influenced by it - its film making. <br /> <br /> The Director of Cameron Crohre became superior to his role, which is welcome at the pace of his usual education. The growing frenzy of the film is fully effective by the CROs (Cruise is an incredibly effective short sequence of walks through time-time squares). Soundtrack (a prominent feature of the Crow movie) is excellent. <br /> <br /> You will be disappointed and challenged as a spectator. The plot seems to be a little bit, but the things behind it are steadily debatable. The film is not perfect, but it should be a welcome for Cruise and Crowe and a revelation for those interested in the Hollywood Glass enthusiasts.
