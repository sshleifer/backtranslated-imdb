It can not be war and peace, but if two academy names are not genius of James Wang Hau, then it is not coming ... <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies. Has fallen into love with a child and has gone back without dissatisfaction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, but the look of this movie is amazing. I love everything about it; Elsa Lancaster, Cats, Crazy Ho-Doo, Retro Town-Ness; But how it was kept in the movie is exciting. <br /> <br /> I have the inconsistencies mentioned above on this page and "special effects" which now seem to be backward. It creates all the really consistent worlds.
