After all, I'm asking to start this comment that I'm a big nightmare on Elm Street fan. I think it's the greatest horror series. For me, Freddy Boogman! Of course, Freddy Dead, who then tried to become the last chapter, it's a weird movie. It is not the same atmosphere as compared to previous movies. Freddy screen has a lot of time. Some people think that this makes him less frightening, which I agree. And that, my opinion, just point. This movie exists, so we can know Fredy better, who she was, she was, how she hunted our dream. For some people, this is a bad thing, if it is not good then we do not know it because it is not known why the recession is bad. Obviously these people would not like Halloween Rob Jabber's remix. To truly enjoy this one, you will see things differently. It's not waiting for you to scare the hell out of a strange person who is hiding in your dream's chest. It was the first, and it was awesome. Over the years, Freddie has killed more people and no one is well-off for him. Now while learning about the nature of this evil, Freddy's mental aspect of terrorism state. Along with Freddy's past tales, I really like the atmosphere of the movie. More kids in Springwood, raised just crazy. Nightmare view is all great. The soundtrack is great, especially the detective song "Go I Gaz Dls". In my opinion, Final Nightmare is a terrific masterpiece and I can not believe that it is so intrinsically. Maybe it's wrong, or I have a taste! However, all Freddy fans should see it. There are so many fun moments as well as funny moments, and many cayos! Get ready to do something different and you will not be disappointed.
