Foolish, ridiculous, sad, sad, inevitable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Great idea ... if you ignore the screwup factor Do it. <br /> <br /> Looks like George Clooney is doing something really interesting to change. Welding is perfect and the quality of acting is very high. Although it can be said that the motley crew is not new, I think this movie is managed in an interesting and unique way. That's enough to stand out from what has gone before. <br /> <br /> has done a very good job.
