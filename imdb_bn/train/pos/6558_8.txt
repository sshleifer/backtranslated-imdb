I disagree with the previous comments about this movie. I think it was nice and funny and it was a good message for young girls like my daughter. You do not have to dress like a cheap hooker to be cool. You can be smart and beautiful together and enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> I think the cast was good and the story was good for the audience. All-my wife, daughter (10) and I was all a good film. I certainly recommend it. It encouraged my daughter to read the original nancy drops, which I am sure she loved Hardy Boys. <br /> <br /> It was a struggle to sleep tonight because he wanted to start reading directly. I could not think of a good result for that movie than to revive the interest of that classic series.
