I guess this movie will work only those who turned off by those ring lord monster hype. Well, I was so. And so I really love this movie. Especially I'm being parodied completely from all that flawless superheroes so perfectly and disrespectful. Most brilliantly Gandalf (brave and intelligent and completely laughable to know-it's all wizards) equivalent: Almghandi, coward and brain dead transvestite Solaron's opponent (from East Germany to "Solar System") is wearing a simple bucket with eye hole as a helmet. Aggrosses is the arrogant, another accidental fool, who tried to fix his broken sword ("Uri" legend) with a scotch tape. And "Strunjadam" (the era of Warmang) actually has some strong similarities with Brad Darf! And do not forget about gripflies and hey ... huh-hoo
