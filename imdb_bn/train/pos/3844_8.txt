When you read the essence of this movie, you might think that it is something of a strange film and, in some ways, for the initial character of this movie, is frightened by Gerard Rave (Jeren Krababe) outlook and hallucinations. Gerard's views all (less or less) give a clear indication that what would happen if the story goes on and it's great for the spectators who try to illustrate the use of the movie. Despite the use of the movie and some hints at the end of the movie, the film maintains a high level of stress throughout life and is not annoying for a minute. This is mostly due to the great performance of the great side of Geranee Crab and Renee Soudendzich (Christine) and Paul Verovan. His indicator style is clearly visible and anyone can say that it looks at different angles, 'De Vieed Man' is a standard VeroVen movie. Due to nudity and graphic violent scenes it will not seem ordinary to the people only known to American movies, but because of the same thing and a talent telling their talent, it will also be common for people familiar with Dutch movies. . When people watch Verevens American films, then little people can say that she does not have any talent to tell her a good story and focus only on blood and sex. Some people think, although I think he is a very talented director who tries to publish a deep message in each of the movies. Although not a good movie, Holly Man (her last American film) is an example that can do more than the Vereovan science fiction splatter movies, and perhaps companies should believe in it more and she will have to provide more movies. He needed that. Just look at his Dutch films. Only they do not show that they need a certain amount of independence, but they also showed that they have outstanding talent. 'De Vieed Man' brought her one step closer to Hollywood and of course her best one. <br /> <br /> <br />
