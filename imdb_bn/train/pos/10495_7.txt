Savings C race is a great movie to watch in a boring afternoon, when you're looking for something different from regular scripts and want to have some fun. I mean, the whole idea of ​​this movie and all the marijuana are so insane! The first film that I saw with this theme (Drugs / Marijuana) did not really criticize it, but only made jokes about it. Grace Trevithin is a widow who lives in a small town in the UK and her dead husband has many financial problems because he committed suicide after he committed suicide entirely. The problem is, Grace, who conceived to save some money for him, has discovered that he must lend all the pounds of debt to lose all of his things, especially his house he loves. She has never worked before, and in a tragic situation until Matthew, her gardener who found a smoking pot, decided to partner with her to sell her large marijuana.
