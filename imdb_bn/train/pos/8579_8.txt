Plot: A crime lord will work as a money-laundering facility for organized crime, which combines 3 different mafia in an entreprise to buy an island. To frustrate this, the FBI tries to kill one of the Mafias. The thing goes wrong, and by some unforeseen plot twists and turns, we are presenting a "police friend who does not like each other" movie ... A woman is an FBI agent, and another male former DEA agent <br /> <br /> <br /> So stupid! But the power of this movie does not lie in his story - a great joke. It's funny (At least synchronized German version). The action is very good, with a memorable scene involving a shotgun and a rocket launcher. But the focus is fool-blowing. Not intelligent ridiculous, not quite sticky, but somewhere, you get a lot of funny jokes. <br /> <br /> However, this picture is contrary to political purity. Legal drug abuse is featured specifically, outside criticism and even as it is displayed. This is a movie bit that bothers me severely and my opinion makes it inappropriate for the kids. <br /> <br /> Take all the steps taken to entertain some fun jokes to watch the beautiful evening, this movie is perfect. Just remember: In this way, it is normal to leave your brain at the door while entering the movie / TV room. Then you will have a good time. 8/10
