I was stunning in this movie with a complete performance by Valentina Sarvie (Artemisia orphanage). <br /> <br /> Sarah has shown Artemisia so beautiful that the idea has been mapped before removing her own models. Place Artemisia is the only spectacular sight to see the emotions that give her art. <br /> <br /> Although each character was not very beautiful, the film became more realistic, as the hair and clothes of the head was appropriate for that time <br /> <br /> I thought this picture was fantastic as a whole.
