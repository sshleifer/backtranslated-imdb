Lovely Danish actress Sonja Richard stole this image from under his nose, and there is no small achievement in the face of terrific performance around him. <br /> <br /> The actor, played by Anchor, is a spontaneous, neutrophic (and possibly suicide) actress who is an engineer, who is Hillchair-bound, silent, Wal-Martin (this Danish actor, Frates Helmuth, who created the film at the age of 77 Under the supervision of the deceased) took a frustration. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> I said, /> <br /> Writer / director / actor Eric Clauson, son of a scholar merchant (Jorgen acting by Clozen) loves a father who never accepted him. The film goes to the end, but there are some important things to tell about Clauson's happiness, the nature and quality of the loving and the care, and how a person can change the way of life of unknown people. Highly recommended. Golda Richard's performance alone is the price of admission.
