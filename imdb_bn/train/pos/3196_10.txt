This movie is amazing for various reasons. Harris takes a very awkward documentary and it turns into a relevant social commentary. Groovin Gary is a small town child who likes good (supposedly) for his many reflections. When she plays Olivia Newton John (for which she is very enthusiastic) to show local talent, Gary's actions show that he is in conflict with conservative social environment. As a result, justification for his actions is made so that people do not think that he is actually transvestite or other social doctrine. In the second installment, Harris exploits the struggle between Gary and Beaver in a novel attempt to create a narrative from the original document. Truly amazing for Harris' extreme sensitivity with the third and final installment issue of triangle. In contrast to the second installment, "The Orkilli Kid" shows Gary as a genuinely problematic character. He does not struggle to get recognition in his own way. Her secret passion for Olivia Newton man dressed her away from people who already consider her social campaign. The film is so fictitious that it is like reality, it carries its own responses. Of course, one can see Gary as a ridiculously repetitive character, but he may also be familiar with her.
