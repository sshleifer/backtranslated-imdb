I saw it in a fur movie theater where the audience is usually white, educated and urban. The show that I participated was the dispersal of African-Americans, and the audience-reaction between these two countries made the difference between a wonderful social commentary on ethnic relations between this nation. Originally, the white people laughing laughing laughing laugh and there are many! Because they "smile at blacks", while the blacks were pretty silent because many could not laugh in front of white. <br /> <br /> I was, on the other hand, related to Asia (and thus related to the group), it was a great time to see this satire of rap culture and its arrogance / touch / value / pseudo-philosophy. Casts are not being described in the gifted and great work. The songs are believed to be very funny. <br /> <br /> This picture is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come, including "a strong wind"
