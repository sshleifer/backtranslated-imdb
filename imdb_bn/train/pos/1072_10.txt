I would like to comment as a great effort in the series. Although there were some improvements, the story lines were good, especially in the season 1. Season 2 however became a scary show and lost the main draw of the DA. A story line of the season was more interesting, jam Tony turned his life toward a light, while a fierce plot with a Mantore behind the X series. I was looking forward to the new season, in fact I still have to. I hope the FOX boys and the DA production crew realize that many PLPs are still waiting for DA to come back. Even after the cancellation of 2 years, DA can make it big when it works properly, and I think a challenge like James Cameron should take this challenge.
