<br /> <br /> I have seen this long ago but I will tell you, whenever I hear some songs from this enam, then I remember the story, beautiful animation, character and my feeling when watching it, and it makes me cry Such a happy but sad feeling). But I think the story of love in it has become furious and they did not properly explain things, but it did not destroy any part of the viewing experience. <br /> <br /> I was so enamored that at the end I had to do some research (and ending a few times) and I found all my answers and much more. I love how I've configured historical legends to fit this anime, it's amazing and just wants to find me a lot more. (I was always very interested in some historical images related to this anime) <br /> <br /> I think it should have been a series, but if all of them had to work with them, they were pulling it nicely. I recommend this to anyone who likes an excellent story, a well made character (some mysterious) and a bit of fantastic steps, including the mental anime. <br /> <br /> Also, it is based on an H-game but it does not have any elements in it and I really like it. (I have no problem with mature anime, I mostly like it)
