"BRAC Show" is good. Compared to "Aqua Teen Hunger" or "Space Ghost Coast to Coast", there are many wonderful moments in it, but it definitely has a lot of great moments. However, it turns out to be life-threatening and life of BRAC and goes to school in an area of ​​50 sitcoms. The humor and animations of this show are as many as "odd teen hangers" (and you can see metwar in one episode) with odd situations and strange characters. But it's good, it's fun part. Some songs are great, others are not very much, but I like this show. BRAC's father's most interesting character. (That's a man, why nobody knows)
