A stupid young man gets obsessed with a woman - so he is obsessed that lose perspective and general sense. An evil sorcerer approaches him and tells him that he can give him lots of resources which he can use to conquer the heart of the lady, if he wants to give something to his house. Foolish people agree and stole reflection of people from mirrors of magicians - and bad things can happen naturally as a result. <br /> <br /> When this image was created just over a decade ago, I'm sure I did not have so much charity to review and score this image. Finally, the plot of the film is somewhat vague in spots and the performances are sometimes slightly lower. However, when you consider the "full-length" movie in 1913 - and often 20 to 30 minutes long! Also, the whole concept of a complex story like you is very unusual in this movie - the stories were played very small and widely. So, given the limitation of time, this picture is quite good and one of the previously horror films known.
