~~ I got to see this picture yesterday morning ~~ <br /> <br /> I am a mother of two children, who extend from 11 to 6. So I'm sure many parents can be related to seeing so many "kids" movies. This was refreshing for me. I have not read this special book, so I do not know whether the book is true or not. But it sure took a high level grossness factor. The story of "new" kids in this town and it happened that has created a group of boys who love to love and love kids .... the word is known? We all do not enjoy this one or the other. He has his little brother, he is standing and parents are embarrassed about it. I had enjoyed the most how each character was completely different from each other, all they stood up in. Fools (Why do they always make rapes red head? My daughter has a red hair! And she is not mocking.) Lol is very awesome, who screamed herself with her older brother. It takes twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself routing for all the characters! Even great connections between parents, fathers and sons. All enjoyable, sweet, funny, gross, etc. ...... Take your kids !!! They will enjoy as much as they enjoy!
