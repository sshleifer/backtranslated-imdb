Greetings from this Portuguese person :) <br /> <br /> I believe that Sotrans is one of the best products ever, mixing reality and fiction in such a way that the difference is difficult to see. The same quality as Godfather! James Gandolfini fits in paper as a glove! I would love not to end all of Sopranos. It's okay! It should be a subject in school :) When I was young I saw Sopernos, but I used to stay awake until the episode ended, so now I bought all the episodes in DVD format and I have already seen all the episodes. And after dinner and I'm getting addicted, just like I gave a break in jail. In my opinion the best series made for the Prison Break and Do Sopranos Television. Both arguments are fantastic and the actors are perfect. Congratulations for such a job. <br /> <br /> Sorry about my english. Thanks for reading.
