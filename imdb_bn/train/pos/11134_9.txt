35 years ago, American graduation was far more inhuman, Acidic, Obstructed and Beautiful, John Schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective. The film could not be created at any other time in the history, because at the end of the 1960s, such a rise took place: the ultimate solubility of the Great American West, the intensity of Vietnam war, and the clash of social ideals <br /> <br /> 'Midnight Cowboy' is the only Academy Award-winning film Is known as the 'X' rating, but there is more to its fame; It crosses the norm as a work of art. This picture (from James Leo Harley's novel) has a lot to say about the loss of life in America, it has crossed the politics of the 60's by treating people with known conflicts of friendship and dealing with people's known themes throughout the ages. Actually, the two main characters are Standard Anthrose - people who do not have a grand offer but have enough to go to our world. <br /> <br /> The primary focus of 'Midnight Cowboy', 28-year-old Joe Buck, physically-charged Texas-based John Voight. In the opening scenes, we follow Joe's bus journey in New York City, where he plans to use some of his genius - the ability to please the woman - and achieve his fortune as a hostel. We learn about his arrival that Joe is laughing at sex trade.

Every moment of understanding we get from Joe and the night, more questions about their lives are made. There is no doubt tatters of both men; There is no clear idea of ​​direction until Rato falls into the storm of illness and Joe finally feels a purpose to survive. This revelation has reached the conclusion of Midnight Cowboy, which is more optimistic than a very fierce story. <br /> <br /> Although Joe and Ross need some luck, the instructions of John Schlesinger have been clearly explained and Waldo Salter's scrappleer atmosphere to play Voight and Salford. Their interaction is very natural and supporter cast, which shows the features of Silvia Miles, Brenda Vekker and Andy Warhol, it offers itself as an essential part of the story. The flashback sequences of Voight, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt, especially for dealing with lost heartbeats, are particularly impressive. <br /> <br /> A young man wondering about the cycling age, has suggested to watch this movie, thanks to Adam Henderson's excellent cinematography ('The Boy Who Fly,' 'Smoke') by Ham Robertson ('Shafts') and edit .
