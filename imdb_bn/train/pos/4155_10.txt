What is a stunning episode for this fine series? This is the superiority of television at its best. The story was held in 1968 and it is nicely painted in black and white, almost deeply with its deep shadow and printed film. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I do not want to spoil this. It is a rare representation of homosexuals facing America in the 1960s. Written by the fantastic Tom Petite, and managed by the great Genoty, we went through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking such a sensitive issue makes this episode all the more stunning. Our emotions are torn as characters and as the edge. During Bob Dillan's fantastic performance, the chills were over my spinal cord, "Ah, but I was so old, now not less than that," singed by Bayard. This one goes past away 10 and they are all the way. Beautiful
