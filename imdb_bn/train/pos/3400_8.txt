Dominini Enfilren (Marlin Dietrich) is taking care of her father most of his life. Now he has died, he is free - but he does not know what he wants. Boris Andrsky (Charles Boy) is a monk who has fled to a monastery to take a life of more taste. They meet accidentally in Algiers, fall in love and get married. But she will not go past her past and she can not live with her ... <br /> <br /> Western bad conversations and overdone full romance of situations Diarych and Boyre did their best to give good performance but their lines could go away with something! Still, in a way, it's a classic. It's shot in a gorgeous technicolor (try watching it in DVDs) where each frame is breathtaking. Dietrich is always the 9s (even in the middle of the desert) dress and dress and hysterical poss strikes off her body show off. Boyer just walk around looking stricken (no shock there). Still I was not bothered. It was wonderful to see and non-stupid stupid dialogue kept me sewing. Finally I got out of my chair because I was so laughing so hard! Now I love authentic romance and I can give them lots of space but this is incredible! It runs a very short 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> As a camp classic I think it's a 8. As a serious movie - a 1.
