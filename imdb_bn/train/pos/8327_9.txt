It was a great romantic comedy! Historically erroneous (Einstein did not have any brother or nephew mentioned in elsewhere) but he made a great match-maker. He has played two best actors in two very nice people. Supporting Cast (Lou Jacobi, Joseph Maher, Gene Sax, Stephen Fry, etc.) clicked on all the screens and made a great viewing experience. The car that he had taken to travel around him is against all the pictures and posters going around. And he wore socks in one scene ... in the report, the professor did not wear socks! (Two new entries for the IMDB Guff division.) On one side of historical error and inconsistency, it was a great movie to watch with a great cast. I give it a 8!
