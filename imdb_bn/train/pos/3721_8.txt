This is one of the best war movies I've seen because it gives more attention to letters after the actual war. Cast is not an excellent job at all and most of them are relatively unknown because it seems to be more believable at all. The camera footage was great so pacing and editing. This movie will actually come to you and take care of visitors to the church.
