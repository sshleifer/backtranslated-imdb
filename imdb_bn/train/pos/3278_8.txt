This is a fantastic written and well-played mental drama. It's a really awkward flick so those people who are looking for something like ring or defect will be frustrated looking. This film really makes me wonder about the intriguing and intriguing efforts of intelligence and fine attention. I appreciate the absence of Phil Fill Psychobabal or New Age revisionism. Instead of going ahead with an agenda, filmmakers just say the story, it's good and lets viewers think about it. Wonderful dreams were memorable and surprisingly effective in the painting of the painting. <br /> <br /> A great budget, no big studio, star performer, big name director (much better than many movies of Hitakoos), a special example of making good films in a good budget, special effects or "cute" plot twists.
