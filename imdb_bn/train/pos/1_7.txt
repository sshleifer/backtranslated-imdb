If you like adult comedy cartoons like South Park, then it's almost similar arrangement about the small adventures of three teen girls at Bromwell High. Keisha, Natalia and Latrina have blasted the blast and behaved like beats, I think Kesha is a good leader. Small stories are also going on with school teachers. Stupid principal, m. BP, nervous mathematics teachers and many others. Caste is also fantastic, Lenny Henri's Gina Yasser, Eestenders Crisi Watts, Tracy-Ann Obamaman, Smack the Pony's Don Mccann, Dead Rinkers Mark Perry and Blonder's Nina Conte. I do not know I came from Canada, but it's very good. very good!
