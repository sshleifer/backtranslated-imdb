I found this show really late night, and tried it out. If you take my drift, it's a refreshing change from other types of late things shown in the night. The harmony of values ​​and the sweetness of the heart reminds me as a child of friendship. Whenever I find it, it's something like that (which is rare, maybe I can check the listings!) Oh ... and the tension between Joe and Nick is so beautiful. No good chick likes to flush, you really get involved in the characters. Good Ol 'Luisa May Alacott is still good story inspiration :) So, to make my opinion valid, I must complete 10 lines, so I think I'll tell you more. The kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are beautiful and filled with nature - the other thing you do not see a lot on television. I hope everyone gives it a shot. I am worried and completely aware that it is sad, but it is good heart. Like before, refresh it.
