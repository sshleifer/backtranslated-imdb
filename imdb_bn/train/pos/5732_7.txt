Since September last year, I've borrowed four to six films per week from the Harold Washington Library, which is about to capture an impressive DVD. (Hwl is really a promotional library: at least three-quarters of its films outside!) Recently, I was excited to find the short films of David Lynch. Yesterday, very rarely about the animated series, I picked up Dumbbell. I want to report here, for fans of David Lynch, eight half-hour periods spent half an hour. <br /> <br /> The most notable feature of these short pieces is their soundtrack. Each episode has its own rhythm. Providing respiratory and digestive system circulation. Abusive voice accent break 'end. Physical violence provides beats. Brush along the shrimps bird and chest socket tower. Many other elements have met orchestra. Cropping of crude animation is often consistent with the term, but the soundtrack itself strikes me as the primary interest of Lynch in creating and promoting this work. In this case, these eight shorts are unique Linchian Lath. <br /> <br /> She says, situations are weird, ugly, deep, stupid and funny as fun. And they have enough space to reflect on how stupid people can be. I can not say again that I can see the collection again, but for those suits in the Swittland Inland Empire, Dumbbell is worth half an hour of your time.
