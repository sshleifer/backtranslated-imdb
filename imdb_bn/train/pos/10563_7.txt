Wow ... what ... a ventilation In a decade of 30's, with many movies I can imagine, especially in phases, initially. There was a movie that was painful and neutral, like "Dracula" with Bela Ludosi, and who did not give it a rest, sometimes in a good way and not at other times. This is a movie that will not stop for a minute, and this is a wonderful and unfortunate one. Lloyd Bacon, directed by "42 Street Street", was the king of the musicians of despair, and perhaps he was excited about the possible words in the movie world because he filled it with her. Talking to music or someone does not have to be a full minute or two. It's totally crazy! Pacing was very poor because I was thinking the movie was worth 5 (or a 6, top), since it was very fast and I do not know what is happening and what I sometimes do. The characters just started moving and roaming around the place, talking about something that did not interest me and probably nobody else. I thought I was just going to be rewarded with a small headache. I noticed that Lloyd Bacon played the "42nd Street", Ruby Keller and the "42nd Street" female lead, it was a movie whose ending was the best part of it. And you know what? It happened the same thing with "football parade"! The end is absolutely incredible! It's down, hands down, the most impressive musical I've ever seen. The final part presents some of the musical numbers in us and those who are, believe me, look at the other left of that movie value. Numbers are flawless! Three big bits and the most impressive course is the second one. Suddenly the screen was filled with superb and innovative camera work, beautiful people and plain entertainment which made me forget my little headache.
