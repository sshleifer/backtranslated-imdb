This documentary follows the life of a mother and daughter named Big and Little Eddie Bear, who lived in the middle of the 50's in the mid-50s as a remake of their family palace in East Hampton, NY. When the filmmakers find them, the palace is separated, and women, one 78 and the other 56 share a schall room. Old Edi Bell Jackie Kennedy Onassis Aunt and her first cousin of small The women were leaving mainly due to the reduction of their house, but Jackie sent money for their repair so that they could stay there. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Little" Eddie blames his soil for his current condition, and his mother comes back that Eddie could never have succeeded. The "Little" Eddie often seems trapped in the past, he concentrated on the choices he had chosen decades ago and loved showing pictures from his young man, where he clearly made a beautiful debut. His mother seems to have resigned more and more of his fate to save the rest of his life. Both women have once been given specific indications of glamorizing life, pictures of happy families that show the pictures, beside her bed, in a large portrait of old Idi√©. From what we see, most of the rooms in the room are empty, the walls have been cracking and separated, and the "Little" ed eats attic food to eat. And of course there are many cats going on. <br /> <br /> <br /> Although, in a woman's life, they do not feel overwhelmed, they are very scared of the squares they live in. Although there is even water running in the house, it is not clear, and you feel that they have been abandoned by their families. <br /> <br /> However, like a documentary, the film is a wonderful sight to watch, and highly recommended.
