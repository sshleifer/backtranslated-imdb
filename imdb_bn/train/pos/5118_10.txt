******** Spoilers - Carefully ********* <br /> <br /> What can I say? I favor when the urban cowboy comes. I love it and have seen it countless times - and usually it finds new things to look at. <br /> <br /> I think that what I like about it is not about the rich people living in urban cowboy work class, L or New York. Well, it's true except Palm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> And the Travalla actually plays stereootic bad guys / good boys in big budget movies instead of playing Good Saturday movies like Night Fever. This is a really good movie - the mechanical Baul riding contest and two-step dance can be stupid, but it's a pleasure to enjoy it for you. <br /> <br /> Merged with Sisi (with whom Debra Winger played) slutty Brightness) - And soon after, they are married and live their dream trailer. But gender is a real life war in their relationships. Bid wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But the role of men in the modern era is not clear. Where can Bud prove that he is a real man? He can do his dangerous work during the day and can fly mechanical war at night - he could be "urban cowboy". But CC wants to run his pickup truck, and he also wants to run mechanical lightning. So where does this bod leave? As Sissy demands her independence, she lies about riding a bull and flirts with former con and Gel Rhodo Star - a real bull buller--, Wes (played surprisingly by Scott Glenn). Bud has been threatened, and Bud and CC have broken. <br /> <br /> Shakes with CC Wes, who misuses him. Feeling more of yourself, Pad palm's son becomes a toy, a rich girl whose father drinks oil and what it means. Sissy comes to the trailer for cleaning it - palm is not that kind of thing. He wrote a make-up letter to Bud, but the evil palm tears it and takes credit for Sissy's housework. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a chance to combine Bud and CC, but very vivid. After that the mechanical bicycling competition is towards Gilly, and you know that Bud is going to win. Palm knows that Bud does not love him, but Sissy - he did it for him. Wes Gilleys tries to try robb, but you will save that urban cowboy, Bud, he day and win the woman he loves <br /> <br /> Of course, you can ask yourself why Bud and Sissy will go about every night Gilleys and "buses like pigs." Perhaps that's contributing to their bad marriage. Why did not he stay with Pam - he was not bad and had money. Or why they were to kill Uncle Bob. Why was Bud and Sisir Marshall and Jesse's fools friends, who always tried to break them: Marshal said to Bud, "He (Sissy) runs the bull!" But the urban cowboy has made fun some interesting - and saying, Bonnie rait on the stage!
