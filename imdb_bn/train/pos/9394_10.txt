"Red Rock West" was one of the best suspense thrillers (John and Rick Dahl) in the top 10 of the decade's classic scripts and it guides most of the film to the edge of your seat and to your borders. It was brilliantly directed by John Dahl and Nicholas Cage, Dennis Hooper, Lara Flynn Boal and especially J. There was an extraordinary cast featuring T Walsh (memorable performance). It will not miss a writing and an impressive thriller. During the liberation war, there was never a campaign in the film (I actually took it on TV first), and so one of the very special gems that you have to find, but this unique film is gradually becoming religious. <Br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage is Michael Williams, when he finds himself in a small Red Rock town and breaks out of work. Dallas has been remembered for a contract killer named Lyle, who has to pay $ 10,000 to kill Wain Brown (excellent JT Walsh) wife of the bar. He plays with the plan and decides that he has to go and warn the wife of Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boal), but the plots continue to grow and many twists, points and surprises - and doubling behaviors - which are thrown from one crisis to another And find yourself trapped in a horrible situation! Even then, to make the subject even more complicated, even the real line goes forward to the deal's killing (played by everyone's favorite heavy Dennis Hooper). Hooper discovered that what happened has happened after the cage, but no one can take away the wonderful facts that can follow it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I hate to see a innocent woman get hurt but it A terrible amount of money " <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (Cage): "Michael Williams, Well, Michael, you'll spend a little time with us until we reach the bottom. <br /> <br /> Boyle (Kegte):" You're not a killer? " Cage: "OK, no. But the person who wants me to go to the city just has to come out here. "<br /> <br /> Boyle (Kegte):" OK how are you? <br/> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ti Walsh is a photo taken and who My book and "Red Rock West" are his best one. In 1998, it was sad that the carrier of this exceptional actor's heart attack was badly damaged. The most profitable time of "Silent Silence" was unfortunate, but a modern example of the "Red Rock West" genre. All the time favorite movies have been jumped right in my "Top Ten" list. I feel more like director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts <br /> <br />
