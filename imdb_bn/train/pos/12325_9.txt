I was sent in 1988 by the BBC when I was working in 2000AD in the United Kingdom in 1988, when I saw this movie. My Paul Steve Parkhouse recorded it in VHS and sent it to me. Until this moment, I really saw Shou Bros Kung Fu movies, their hard light (so the audience could definitely play), so it was an unlikely revelation to me to see something that looked like it was illuminated. Readley Scott is coming out of Hong Kong. This was my first exposure to the Tuhey Hark movie (pronounced, apparently, "kowl hook"). However, all the Smokies, back-lights, outgoing and ambitious special effects (stop-motion? in Hong Kong movies?) is the heart of Chinese ghost starry, a simple and ongoing love story, which is the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheng Sad, tragic waste!) And make it more realistic by beauty. And the charm of Joey Wong Imagine Joey is fantastic, but it is difficult to analyze which gives her the absurd sex to her character, which is her ballistic hand gesture. And even though Joey is now about 20 years old (Gaude, none of us?), But the actress's continuous picture is always there. Here some critics have said that this movie is simple and lacks any surprise, but they feel that this film is about a famous Chinese story written by Poo Songing around 1700! A predictable ending of Romeo and Juliet, and just a bit like the allegations made in West Side Street. (Just wanted to get off my chest!) <br /> <br /> For me, the Chinese ghost stereotype romantic thriller. It's a high tragedy, because we know that Chio Scene and Sin CN can not be together. It's getting mature, because some of us can not be mature until we feel a big loss. It is about sacrifices, an essential element of true love for self-sacrifice. And Um Ma's comedy styling does not hurt a bit. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to see it through western culture filters, enjoy the Chinese ghost stereo and you will be fine with it.
