I could not stop commenting after reading a very brief "bad" commentary. This movie is just a lot better than bad. Acting miracles, even from cast children, who do not play smart or anything else but act like my son's friends The film is smart and hopes the audience will be good too. Double-back flash story lines contribute to story instead of working as imaginary and time-filler. I saw this movie with my kids and then I saw it again a few days later. Check "hole" if you have children and are sick of the death of movies that inspired diabetic coma with the confection of the movie. My 6-year-old enjoyed my 11 years of age, and my husband and I enjoyed them. How many movies can you tell me about that?
