E Rick Valette is clearly a talented filmmaker, and so two authors wrote those scripts. Therefore, a great flurction of Malayfik, made with just a few bucks but tons of imagination. Well, I'm a little excited, but still I'm sincere. So, if you like dark, poor movies, go and see this one. It's really worth it.
