"Gandhi husband and father?" Always been discussed by the people of India. 'Gandhi ... my father' is a story that only a few know about such details. Surely an insight into Gandhi's personal life. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like movies for movies and movies. Jarwala, Akshay Khanna and Shefali Shah did good work to everyone. Most scenes in the movie will be a nice desktop wallpaper ... pretty work. As a background score across some parts of the film, traditional Indian folk gives a good feeling of music. <br /> <br /> However, what I liked was not the type of description. At several points, I've made the tone more dramatic. <br /> <br /> Overall, good work for Anil Kapoor Productions. It would suggest as "I should be seen once". 8/10
