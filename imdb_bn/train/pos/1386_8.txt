Three teen girls in an incomplete triangular relationship The triangle base is barely. Marie at the top, with a belondo-like facial structure a serious, short and thin tumbler. His best friend is physical and psychological opposite: Cocolet, Mustafa - I'm brave to say fat - and wish his son for the first kiss but he is not ready to face his first sexual encounter. Because of his whip, the boys do not seem interested and it hurts him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marie sees him at a local public swimming pool during a competition. Marie inspires himself in the life of a vampire by using the desire to become a synchronized swimwear as an argument. A vamp is the reputation of being a whore, which makes an orbit around him with any young man. Marie is not phased out by that fame. Put a pressure on the reputation. <br /> <br /> The first half is set up. We have got to know three girls as we can see many synchronized swimming. Eventually, the leaflet leaves behind swimming pools and focuses on the top relation between the three. That unexpected thing starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It is a trademark of French film hanging on the eyes of viewers. There is no alternative to it. Here it is about the roof and the death. See the film to know more. <br /> <br /> Director says that the use of synchronized swimming is motivated. That woman-only sport is a metaphor for a girl's life: the hard working and competition below competition is beautiful and feminine. The number of views runs this point: the public has the graceful steps and smiles, lay the staff on several legs. The headline in French also indicates: "Private", or octopus, suggests using multiple pressures with multiple pressures.
