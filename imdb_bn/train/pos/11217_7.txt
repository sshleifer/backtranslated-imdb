Because of the otaku from Robotek's day, I can still say that Gunbatter is one of my favorite time of all time. When creating it, animation is of superior quality. There is no loop and order to reduce the quality of the industry. Although the final episode is black and white, it does not diminish due to the pleasure of watching the movie. Although it is described as "hungry", it should be remembered that men do not react like men in the same way. Since the main character is a woman, it must be obvious that she does not have to resort to "macho-man" techniques to earn her colleagues respect. Seiryuu for Noriko, incidentally, Rana 1/2 playing Akane. Noriko can get a cartoon of a 3D level; Her personality assumes the essence of the first confident girl, which seems completely helpless at first, but eventually succeeds in the power of her will. My only complaint is that Mika looked like a teddy bear. Even the gunbars even use a suspicious "Homing Laser" and "Booster Shield" (which is nothing more than wrapping a giant purple cloth around the machine in the true dracula style). I was meant to be funny in that scene, but it cracked me up. Nevertheless, above all, I will award the best of 20 anime gunbats to the medal.
