Take me: A fool, yet fantastic mess. <br /> <br /> Keane Reeves (Yes !, Keane Reeves) and Alex Winter have returned to this signal two Punk-Rock Idiots in Time-Trotting Adventure Comedy Bill and Ted's extraordinary avionics, now a classical classic. In this sign, Bill and Ted are given much more than traveling through time. They can also travel to heaven and hell! At the beginning of this signal, Bill and Ted is preparing for the "band of the bands" competition, which can make them even more popular than ever. Meanwhile, in the future civilization, many years, the first movie time-wizard (always watchable George Carlin) is a university promoting the name of Bill and Ted. There, the evil rebels (from the wounds to Josh Ackland, Red October) plots get rid of two stupid rock-stars together. So he has sent two identical Android replicas (Bill and Ted: Robot Uses) for doing dirty work. <br /> <br /> Bill and TED get experience of death and must find their way through the hell. The two of them have the worst memories, and then their girlfriends through heaven ... and the residents living in their efforts to return to the world to save their shock. Along with this troubled journey, they play board games with someone other than death (from William Saddler, DEE Hard 2), 1957 Similar to the classic Seventh Seal of foreign cinema, a momentous memoir, help from some intelligent alien creatures <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, be honest, think of the film It seems to be freed in the wrong year, even for the 90's). But with this imagination and naturally, there has not been a change in life by both performance and direction, Bill and Ted's journey to the fun is fun, fantastic and yes, bogas. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 5 out.
