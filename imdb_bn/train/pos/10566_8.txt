Never seen this movie, and Cagan and other cast members enjoyed singing and dancing: Dick Powell, (Scott Blair) who was a great tan voice and Ruby Keller, (B. Thorn). James Cagney plays the role of Chester Kent, who wrote the musical instrument and eventually produced the ProGuiges, which were shown in the movies shown in the movie theater in the 1930s. Chester has had problems with people trying to steal his ideas for his show. It is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and laughter. Joan Blondel, (Nan Presskot) gave a very helpful introduction, who was very young and beautiful. Dick Powell was as a singer and dancer and started with his long and successful screen career. Enjoy.
