Excavation! Fun, fun, funny, interesting, stylish, and very well done. It is very surprising that it can be said to be such a story, especially for styles and materials, to know that it has been made in budget for such shoes for more than 7 years. If you are a music fan or documentary fan, of course it must be seen. <br /> <br /> A great way to show a contrast between a decent band that fills an intelligent band focused on Brian Jonastown Massachusetts and Danny Warhols. Rigorous mediation and compromising ability and gifted megalomaniac lead singers back up with various castings of the background, which harm their own success through drug, alcohol and madness. If I did not know that it's real people's footage, I'll swear it's an incredibly good writing and fantastic scripted piece. The story is mandatory, concise, and simply amazing.
