This movie is really rock! Jeff Vincott is great in the film! His war is incredible! He is so fast martial artist! Bridget Nielsen and Matthias Huss was very good! Mission of Justice is an action packed movie which is not annoying! Want to fight movies with incredible non-stop action, but see the trial trial today!
