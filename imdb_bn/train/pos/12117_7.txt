Although this image keeps Davis on the map, due to his wildly brilliant acting as obscure garterote wetter / prostitute Miledred Rogers, this movie is completely offensive to me completely. Acting is really fine in every respect. How can I not feel for my life, why Philip was a sensitive, well-established young man continuously behaving towards him, that is how: why I or why I have found some respectfully his silly tolerance. Yes, I know he's a sensitive club foot, intuitive intellectual. But Davis is such a poisonous witch that tolerates the attitude or actions of anyone who satisfies the culture and makes it credible. Davis was amazed by his role: Yes, he may now be able to break into his historians and later, but in some way creative illustration that you look at. Very bad he was not playing a gangster's moll. Her character will be completely credible as a trump in less lifespan!
