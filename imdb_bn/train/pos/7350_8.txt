I was a teen when I was in love ... when I saw the movie ... the songs were a huge hit but the meritorious class had dropped the Govinda films, then there was no quiz for the 'class' to watch the movies of Govinda and Karishma (Uk Karzima), but whatever Why did so many people lose more than 90 like this photo, and most of them were successful. I have seen it again a few days later and I remembered, people and riots were created for a long time. When AAUUUO came to the screen ... Govinda and Kareeshma's clothes were complimentary each other (the worst dressing pair of that time) Karimma transformed into the best 90 minutes but Govinda was still very loyal, her designer looks similar to her dress. ... but after all it was all good. Everything worked and gradually the elite class realized that it was absent and then ..... it was not looking back at the direction of this Jodi, it went nan to continue the series of Indians, but people loved by the people. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good time by not letting it rent or watching it on TV, I do not think you'll be sorry about it ... but remember <br/> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> I said, love stupidity and especially when it is done by kings of their time, it is obviously visible ... I recommend it to all movie lovers ...
