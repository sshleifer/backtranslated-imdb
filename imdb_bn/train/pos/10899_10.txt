I hurt my face in this movie hit so hardly Ben Affleck is very happy and this role reminds me of a beautiful boy Jack Black. Gandolfini gives her ideal a performance. The whole custom funny, the story is quite good and the moment of the trick is awesome. I went to this movie for too much hope, so perhaps I was completely satisfied with the flock and was tired of getting tired of the face. I can recommend this film to anyone who enjoys the comedy, during the holidays, to identify with loneliness and / or relatives. The best part of this movie (whatever it was to me) was a fine bit of humor that kept me completely blocked and after seeing the rest of the audience, it was a lot of sunshine. For example, scenes involving the light of the Christmas tree. See it and have a good smile!
