I can honestly say that I felt the movie in its exact summary, from the reality of the dream, the mind entered the spiritual aspect of the future, which faces Tom Cruise. I did not care too much about the performance of Tom Cruise's performance but I must say that he has impressed every point in the movie ... not only because of a compelling story but his voice is also being provided for his character. .. they combine and then talk and its beautiful. But I must say that this movie does not come under "Average Flick" on weekends, which you choose at random and look slowly; It carries strong feelings and letters, so do not wash it with your beer and pop-corn. It definitely needs more than that.
