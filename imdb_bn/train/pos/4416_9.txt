Harvey Keitel's best performance so far is the new century. Very nice picture, Pre-Castro Cuba is a beautiful snap shot. The story is surrounded by the local minor offender's nephew, who is building friendship with America with Hollywood. It really happens at the moment when a boy awakens the fact that he knows that little circle he really lives in a much larger, more complex world that he still can not understand. The script is strong and crisp filled with humor. After all, a professional career that fits well with the tradition of the Latin American film. One weakness is the decision to shoot sync-sound in English instead of Spanish - perhaps to improve sales in the United States. Unfortunately, this just makes the film a bit less believable. But if you can look outside of it, you will get a hearty trip to another world. Recommended.
