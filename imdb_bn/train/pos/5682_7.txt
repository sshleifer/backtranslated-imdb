No, it's not my ally fairy tale of my friends! This 'Wonderland' novel is based on the true story of the terrible bloody Wanderer murders returning to California in the 80's. There was no one except 'Janoni Wad' in this vampire center. Yes, John Holes! Daddy Ding Dong used other shotguns than his infamous 13-inch milk machine. Apart from being a legendary adult film actor, Hollywood was also a drug addict who had made friends with several Hollywood junkies. Kilmer was occasionally royal as Holmes, but once this Holmes character does not milk it completely. 'Who is there to support the film in this movie': Josh Lucas and Dylan McDermott as Holes Life's Lives, Kate Bosworth and Lisa Kudrow as Women of Holes, and Anne Bogosian as a Monsing Tinseltown entrepreneur. These characters can play direct or indirectly integral parts of 'Wonderland' murder. Outside of this support group, Josh Lucas was one of the most deadly and impressive like Ron Louinius. Lucas is gradually moving towards a big Hollywood player that is turning a charismatic like 'a beautiful mind' and 'sweet home album'. Director James Cox has sometimes proven a bit of a coxsucker that displays excessive exaggerated scenery, like the famous limbs of Holmes. Hollus was finally deported from the 'Wonderland' murder. He died due to complications from the AIDS virus. Wonderland will surprise you about what happened on that bloody night, and if Homer really drops his weapon. Oops! Wrong holus movie! OK! It was enough before getting 'pencilized'. Goodbye Holmies! *** average
