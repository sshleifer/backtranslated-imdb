All right, I'll admit it - I'm a gangster and I sometimes love really a stupid comedy. Although I've seen more pictures than Kurosawa, Bergman and Troubett, I still have a soft spot for a Dopi comedy that does not try to be sophisticated but it's fun. Monty Python and Holly Grill, UHF, Start My Revolution, Strange Breeds and Bill and Ted Films. All of them lack a soft appeal, but only a zombie or professional film critic may dislike them. <br /> <br /> Although Bill and Ted's bamas trip is not as surprising as the original bill and Ted's film, it's still a lot of fun. Also, unlike the original, it actually seems to be better with repeat viewing. For the first time I have seen that the film does not seem to love - perhaps another movie sets so high quality to smile. But, every time I see it again, I'm amazed at all the great moments - especially with Grim Ripper. And, however, this implantation as you can get is as different from Bergman's in the Seal Seal !! Apart from so much fun, the film has some amazing music - this is one of the ways that it is better than the first movie. Finally the kiss is a great song but the residue of hard rock tunes - but you're not an old killer like De Nomhols. Great look for kids and adults alike
