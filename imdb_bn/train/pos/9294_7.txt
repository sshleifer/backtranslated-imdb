Before I start, I should point out that I know this film editor. We have never met, but we belong to the same fanzine (messages that have happened before), and we talked on the phone, so I have a bias here. However ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the original rata packs, and which was made of similar fashion, was a flow. Just that, it was a critical flow; I believe Rolling Stone's Peter Travers is the only one who did not waste it (he gave it a mixed review, as I think). And when I do not think it's the greatest movie in the world, and I'm not a fan of the RAT Pack, or "cocktail" culture, I think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> For one thing, this looks stylish, and moved along. For others, core performance is all good. Richard Dreyfas has surprisingly stopped coming back from the anti-terrorism surgeon and has a drill edge. Jeff Goldlam returned to silly performances in his former blockbuster days, such as Big Chill. And when Allen Barkin wants to do the vampaign in this film, he does it in an entertaining way. Of course, this is not a great movie; The conversation is composed mostly of puns, and many of them do not work (like "Ben Jane" speech perfectly). And Gabriel Bern and Kyle McLachlan are terrible here. Still, I was entertained, and if you like gangster movies you can be one.
