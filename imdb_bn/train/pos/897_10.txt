What can I say, I grew up with my heart, seven hain, ham-up hine ears and mine pie. Saraj has always been different. Movies are part of our lives in evolutionary times. Sooraj creates something that is hard to find. Loving and loving that love and joint family. Vivah travels for a couple who are getting married to marry marriage by getting married. Shaheed did a good job. Anupamiji is always bright. Although Amrita Rao is different, I felt that nobody else played this role to me. We saw him in Ishq Poet and Ab K Baras, and neither is Chief. So he did different roles that he did not. He was not nice and he was nice to Ishq Vish, but he can do a lot more in the role. Barajataya whatever great work. This movie revives what we have forgotten. Sweet film of the year. Great music and songs. I'm not sure it's a remake but the brilliant story is somehow original. Sorj's movies are the best, so we always expect something from him. All works great by cast crew and everyone. Beautiful family film to enjoy with your parents, siblings, friends and loved ones I figure it out 10 out of 10.
