This movie is just great. If you have a chance to see it, then you should run it to see. The film has nothing to do with its original since 1932, although Passino Tony Montana does a great job of traveling around. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " If you thought that the pop fiction was good with the words of oath (if you have seen it), then you can see Scarface to see the other angle about how the actor can say. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, your eyes must always be kept peeled all the time. Personally, I found that the movie looks like three hours winds to watch, that's really cool. <br /> <br /> This film is a movie movie that is operated and directed so that you have not only forgotten that this film was made at the age of 80 but it actually makes you root for the bad guys ... "so Say goodbye to BAD guy "
