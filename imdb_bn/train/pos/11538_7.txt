Felix Unger (Jack Lemon) has just run away from his wife because he is the world's most annoying, neurotic people. Her way of suicide, but she just does not seem to get it done, so she is leading her friends home. Oscar Madison (Walther Manu) is recently divorced and graduated living in Heaven. Smoke, gambling, hitting, eating and cleaning women, sometimes he is in Paradise. Well, trying to suicide, Oscar decided to join Felix. First, it cooks a match made in heaven, cleans Felix and helps Oscars give her alms timely, but soon Oscar women and Felix (who is likely to be gay today) are not ready to move forward. They invite some British birds and they consider Felix so low that soon they and Felix are crying and chatting about family life, so Oscar denied. This, he burst and threw him, but Felix seems helpless as he thinks, and soon he has the upper hand. My favorite quote "You kept me a little note on my pillow. I said 158 times, I can not set a little note on my pillow." We're all out of cornflakes. F.U. "It took me three hours to find F.U. Felix Agar!" Based on a Neil Simon game (who wrote the script), it felt a certain theater. Set and look like repartee and look quite well (for better or worse). LeMon and Manu have excellent comedic chemistry and the villagers have appeared in the Old Men film and Out to Sea, rebuilding the same movie / slab role, but with different names (I'm sure to avoid royalty issues). <br /> <br> This movie dipped in chocolate like strawberry. Chocolate smooth, sweet and rich, strawberry tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get that nasty green). They are almost opposite to the poles, but together, the conflict will brighten each other and make an excellent confectionery. 7/10 <br /> <br /> http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
