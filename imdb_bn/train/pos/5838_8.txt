It blocks Block Heads and a chump in Oxford, which is the top two films. SAPS is not a bad movie at the SEA - it's the last good comedy (if not superb in the composer or any other film), Lorel and Hardy created. It's just a toss-of-small film, a blockbuster for Block-Head's crazy Destructive Crosdeno or Stan's "real" personality, it's a champion, it's a little movie to review at Oxford. It's less than the other two in 57 minutes. The movie is a bit, but that's not actually a bad point for it. It has enough time to hit the right note. It's not just as special as the other two. <br /> <br /> Stan and Wally work in a discipline factory. I suspect Chaplin has some effect in this continuation (in this case only four years ago there was a rally in the same time). Ollie's nervous snap finally, and she goes on a rampage. He does not help his roommate Stan at home and (naturally) - Stan has a musical lesson in his machine an intelligent professor (you've got it - a trombone). After beating the poor professor, there was a problem with Oily Disabled Janitor / Engineer (Ben Terpin in a beautiful appearance) and then his doctor (Jimmy Finson) and his nerve tester (a balloon that you threw in the air of Ollie's stomach). Finsonon has announced that it is a bad case of "shingipipoviya" and the oily needs to be very quiet and holidays with goat's milk. They're going to the ship, but Oli and Stane do not know anything about seafront - so they plan to go to bed. Unfortunately the goat broke down and the ship closed. Unfortunately, on the board, Richard Crumar, a fleeing dangerous criminal. It will not be a peaceful peaceful holiday. <br /> <br /> SAPS (like CHMPA) can have three shorts, factory one, one apartment and one boat. Each success has been a short, and they all have to be a fun movie - but together part shows sewing. There are some interesting moments in the film - how the turquoise disadvantages find various types of damages in the apartment with water pipe and stove; While managing Stan or Wallie, manager of Manila's manager Charlie Hall accidentally comments and asks Stan, "Can you help me find the basics?" - "Of course, you do not miss it - it's bottom!" Who knew that he had a stupid comment); And the torture of his two hostage slaves of Kramer. He sees Ollie "Dizzy" and Stain "Daffy" (a sign of the Dean Brothers of St. Louis Cardinal parties of 1930 - see the perspective of Dan Daily's ST LOUIS). The crackers have cooked some of the boys' food - and they make a synthetic diet (for example, boot laces for spaghetti) to make them sick. When he realized what he did, he forced them to eat. Their responses are bright. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Some years before it was published, there was a serious problem involving the cost of production of the boy and the rook (our relationship, where there was a producer in Stan Film), artistic problems (scenes of Swiss MISS were meaninglessly cut) and contractual arguments appeared with Harry Langdon in Genebiy. Stann and Oly returned with Flying Dukes, of which there was no rope production but Boris Marrows'. Finally, at a Chump, the agreement between SAPS and SAPS on two photo contracts and problems ended - and the boys left Roach in a high note. Unfortunately they were not as satisfactory as this in the next any film relationship with a producer.
