Elegance and class do not always seem to be the first words when people (at least such people can do such things) sit near and talk about the movie NoÃ«r. <br /> <br /> There are still some of the best films in the genre of "Style of Paste", "The Killers", "In a Lonely Place", "Night and the City". Which caught them in a moody phrase and its prediction shadows, fedoras, and feml-fatales definitionlill outlifts. The only copy of the best stocked video store in Manhattan was a rough confiscation from the AMC Cable Channel - in a section with these classics <br /> <br /> "Where Sidewalk Ends" > <br /> At this time the black passage of the passage of passage has passed, the lens spying draws a curtain around the growing world of Marc Dixon, and the momentum By passing, it is very close and threatens. <br /> <br /> Of course, he is known as "a police with a dark past", but Dana gives Andrew Dixon a desperate and annoying intensity that makes him feel uncomfortable. And yes, he has been betraying the suspects for a long time, and the newly promoted chief (Karl Malden, usually a strong and commanding person) warns him "for the last time". <br /> <br /> Dixon also hates this thug much to hate. And the boy is not coming? <br /> <br /> When he spit out, "Huds, drafts, mugs, nickel-rat gutter", when he rolls out all the accusations that a boss that demotes him with a tough nut and takes about the right hook of Bixau Dikon. Suggestions cool well for yourself. But instead he took the subject in his own hands. <br /> <br /> When he relies on his selfishness, he falls into a problem and goes back to a generation that can never leave a generation before. <br /> <br /> <br /> She is deeply involved with the police, syndicate, her own partner. Dixon's involvement with suspected involvement in the "investigation" assassination threatened his job, he was surprised that he officially formally came to the foundation. Like a bogart in "Lonny Place" is he "what can he escape from?" <Br> <br /> She does not have anymore, she discovers that she has destroyed the unexpected relationship with the unexpected relationship (extraordinary gene tearni) with the scenic beauty, it seems that she would turn the existence of her barbaric bachelor into some kind of home worth To do so <br /> <br /> This fantastic picture pacing is fresh and chic. By contributing to the production, the authors' team smoothened a high glossy script - the dialogue is not getting separated, spontaneous, melodramatic or naughty in the dated parody sheets. <br /> <br /> And all of these direction and acting are not very shocking or not to reduce the emotional stability of the film. Angel of Gene Tierney, soft-focus was used in great effect of beauty. She shows herself as a pretty actress, and her mild, nature's nature is unlimited as her psychology like "unlimited abandonment" here. Tianni and Andrews's Dixon scenes became even more intense and they considered themselves self-destructive. <br /> <br />, his rope has ended, cut, rash and tired, Dixon has said very briefly: "Even innocent people can go terribly jam." "There is a false step and you are on your head." Perhaps this film makes it so mandatory that this idea may be wildly wrong for somebody - especially someone trying so hard to do the right thing - a slight change in the wind, a wrong decision or Punch, or, most fearfully, because you have no control. Silence has always reflected the fearsome fears, bringing them to the page. "Where is Sidewalk ends" so a realistic fashion. <br/> <br/> (A little bit of a picture on one side: otherwise this is a pretty model of a blonde model that is a poorly dubbed, which will not find a place in mystery science theater.) /> <br /> But fans of the hell - Hack, no Film fans - Those who did not see it are for a terrific behavior.
