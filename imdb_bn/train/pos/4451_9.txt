The basic foundation of the story is simple: the old man of woods suddenly blows on the murder of a young child and the police confirms that the assassination happened. Although very little dialogue is provided throughout the film, the visible sight of the camera makes the film very attractive. Gray wood setting expresses feelings of loneliness, which complements the peace of the letters. We can feel the helplessness of old people's inability to believe in the assassination of the police, which is equally incompetent to tell the silent child's own story. <br /> <br /> The real horror lies in the feeling of frustration, helplessness and irrationality. . This film only solves these scenes by successfully visualizing scenes, rather it relies on the cheap word effect or blood and gore which is used when other poor horror movies are weaker. <br /> <br /> Shining, the story is a bit of a startling moment for the excitement for some weird and amazing moments. The end is also unexpected and trustworthy. This movie, which features "The Lady," "The Lady," and "Dark Water" or Japanese horror films "Lady lady in" and "The Innocent", gives the audience the true experience of horror. I suggest you enjoy good shillings for bone fright to try this picture. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen any movie that I mentioned above, you want to give them as well as try.
