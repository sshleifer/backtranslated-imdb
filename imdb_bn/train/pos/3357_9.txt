While celebrating Hitler's philosophy, Rome goes crazy - the uniform, the band, the paradises - outside of the two outdoor houses, in a big building, and in the air. She is Sofia Lorraine, the wife of a brutal government job and the mother of six children. He is a musical man, a radio speaker who was fired for his homosexuality. Both of them need to understand the company and both of them find themselves in each other. <br /> <br /> The movie covers a few hours a week. The color is faded and everything is performed with a sound track of military procession and violent radio announcers. Curiously, the Nazi song - Horse-Wesel-Lied - is becoming a romantic musical theme. <br /> <br /> Beautiful movie, an exclusive era of excellent history and a touch, tragic story in Italian history. We hope so much better than Marthoniini, and Sophia Lorraine does an extraordinary job, from her usual truck driver's pin-up, far from Nipolean fishing people. Do not miss it.
