I think when "Bit Street" created the national appearance, "flashdown" came at the same time. The problem of "FlashDance" was only a break dance scene and the rest were in jazz dance and ballet. That's because "Bit Street" was even better. The only movie that could be a "bit street" rivalry seems to be "football", because both films focus on how the dancing is used to express their maximum feelings to humans. <br /> <br /> Great dance scenes are just "midway" in the middle and just before the end. And I like them all. Almost all interplay techniques have been featured in jam scenes: Jackhammer, flyer, head spin, suicide, crazy legs, vivid, flip forward, picture four --- almost everything <Br> <br /> Like "The Warriors", "Bit Street", "Hip Hop" violence related to the gang life of the world ... but much less violent than before. The "main road" was the only major battle scene when graffiti artist Raman (which was filmed as "Ramo") was followed by a rival gang member in the New York City subway tracks ... the third rail to fight with each other and both of that rail Dying by electrocution. Well, although this Chase scene ended sadly, it was good that they died in a way like a gang shot from a gang gun. <br /> <br /> Most gang staff was involved in hip-hop. Culture, and rap music Many rap music would appear in the light, because hip-hop members used rap music as a conflict with the negative aspects of gang life. Even the theme song of the movie, which stops the screening of flashes, was not just respected for hip-hop culture - it was also a tribute to Ramon's death. <br /> <br /> During the dance scene of 'Tano, Tango', I think Pitt Orchestra's female drummer, directed by actress Roy Don Chong, was a kylo look.
