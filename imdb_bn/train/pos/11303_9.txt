The Viscounty's first film has all its trademarks, visual fliers, and immune system, with the exceptionally attractive performances of Massimo Giruto as well as the handsome drifter, as well as Clara Calamai, who also acted as a terrific, horrible geovana. Repeat several times as 'postman ring doubles' but never healthy. Can not believe this person's first picture! It shows confidence in someone in Zenith of their career.
