This fascinating 13th-century Fox movie-noire, a maze of metropolitan depression that survives by hunters and hunters save each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It has a microfilm, and the communist spy ring will go to any length for it to recover. Both espionage and police find unfolding two parallel investigations as valuable information. <br /> <br /> Avoid Anti Heroes Pickpack MacKay is played with a terrible assurance by Richard Widmark. He knows the police as his moral and intellectual inferior, so he taunts them: "Go," the captain of the captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Y) said, "Drop me a charge. Police is just one gang in the street. Like candy handler to lead Louis Luis, so the police are busy paying stool pigeons to know the information. It is difficult to believe that while Wyomker made this film, he was already in middle age. The 39-year-old star, coming up to the end of his contract with Fox, plays a Upstart Skip McCoy with a brutal brashness of teenagers. Romantic lead may not be acceptable to thrill his love interest in unconsciousness for the romantic boundaries, but after the beer slogan in her mouth she can be revived, but in time it is considered strong - and after all, Candy is a fallen woman. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pieters Can Candy is as bright as Here, in the middle of his five-year explosion of B-movie fame, he is beautiful and engaging as a whore with the golden heart. She hunted the story, something else as much as a martyr in her beauty. He means well, but being constantly strengthened by cynical men - Joey, skip and police. <br /> <br /> This movie is the original star New York. Hunting urban panorama and sniding subway stations offer a clustrophobic evolution of the city as a living, brutal force. Like maggots in a rolling cheese, human figures scurry through the city's byways. Elevators, subway turnstiles, pedestrians - even a fool waiter law, as a conduit for the flow of corrupt humanity. People have gone anywhere to safety: Muo is in his hired room, Hudson River, to avoid his shawn shake. Characters are moved and interacted, they are made by Bridge Architecture, or are divided by girders lattice or hanging hangs. The city's personality is constantly imposing itself. Viper wood corners and crossbaims are a reflection of the Gridiron Street plan and card-index cabinets in the Scouts Room similar to Manhattan's skylines. When Joe's exit from the subway is banned, it seems as if the city's signatories trapped him. <br /> <br /> The amazing ratio of this picture is extremely close. The character drives the plot, as it should be, and the close-ups are used to increase the character. When Kandy is interrogated, close-ups retain sexual energy among them, which maintain hostile enigma. Gin Peters' beauty is painted in fine, fine-sour focus closes up. Device tension height is employed. Initial sequence, purse snatch, no dialogue: the play is completely closed for its powerful effect. <br /> <br /> Snoopers on snooper and snoopers, populate the film. Bee (Theelma Ritter) makes it alive as an informative, and by its victims it is taking its place even in the hierarchy. When avoiding, "he will eat", he is chanting a repeat break. Just as 'straight' New Yorkers jump to collect information about rugs or wooden birds, lemon chops or tall <br /> <br /> Still, Starbuck Kabutara is better than Joey and her communist friends. Joe's feet in mother's bed symbol of violation of the most basic moral code. Joey is beyond pale. Joe will not even trade with Joey for the safety of his life: "... even in our weak business, you want to draw a line somewhere." <br /> <br /> "Pick up" was created in depth, cold-collision. Richard Nixon was elected as a Republican vice-presidential candidate, with his autobiography Algeria, his name was published - Bogass communist microfilm and everyone. McCarthy's show was a daily reality test. We see the investigation against the police in the film "Stalin the A-bomb that betrayers". <br /> <br /> New York can be seen as a giant reception, where human kidnapping, cheating, murder and murder The formation of a leitmotif across the containers film. Ladies carry their trade mark box, and candy's purse, carry the microphilm holder, plot engine. Skip his secret road-sense symbol, puts his only property into a submerged crate. Pupper's coffins are taking Hudson to Barrage, it is only moving the excavation of another freight carrier around the weak city. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent composition of the essay. Skip sketching on the rickety gangway of the chain is shown above skulking, its moral ascendancy signal. When the gun is placed on the table, the extreme point of view it looks bigger than candy - Violence begins to dawn. Lovers are eclipsed by the shadow of a stevedore, reminding us that their love is not pure, not absolute, but contingent on sinister city's whims. The shadow of a wall inside the Communist, or isolated puff of cigarette smoke. He is like a lane cat in the garbage - a predatory deceiver of the night. Under the tax hood, camera shots, inside newspaper kiosks and hospital beds, increase awareness among us that we are all trapped in the metropolis. We are civilized mulch.
