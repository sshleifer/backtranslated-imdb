The Journey of Hope (1990) is a journey that often creates inferior and poor Turks so that they can live a good life in Switzerland. These people are so desperate to live like Westerners that they will give up their lives and try to reach the promised land. Many of them deviate from greedy hunters, who stop their lives for charging huge fees for frustrated people, who are not in a winner. Only one family finds the cold, treacherous mountain ranges and predatory criminals that there is always a bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This problem exists worldwide, not just America. Some people tend to forget that Break the heart of a photo that makes you wonder why the end. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
