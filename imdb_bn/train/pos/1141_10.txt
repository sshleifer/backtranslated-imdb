Nobody has embalmed all smiles through this movie. I saw it at least twenty times and I still get tears in my eyes from many scenes. The Sally Field is completely perfect, like Sylst Talbert, a fading soap star whose supporter Cast is trying to return to his expectations that his own star will be raised. At the age of 45, the field still has excellent and beautiful quality and perfect image that gives birth to three children. I favor, I'm in love with him. <br /> <br /> Cast of "Sopdesh" they are full of accomplishing their role for fulfillment. Kevin Clayne such as Robert Downey Jr., as well as Hypri Elizabeth Shue, Hooper Goldberg, is her hat-trick in the Hatcher, Kerry Fisher, who is a foreign casting director, who auditioned an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt. Over. Kathy Nazimi is a nice designer in the beauty dresses, and best of all, like Catherine Morridge Nurses Nurses who lead the plot to remove the character from the character, it's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> This movie won Oscars, the best comedy, the leading female in the comedy, the leading in the comedy, and many other radio, including the writer, acting and actresses and actors. Get the DVD so you can watch over over for the next twenty-five years. You still have to laugh it when you wear discs.
