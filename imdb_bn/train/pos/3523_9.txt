As a wonderful and bright coordinator between the director, Robert Sydmak and Ela Rennes, her secret is trying to save her boss from an electric chair, holding a mysterious "phantom" woman and franchot tone as an insane and killer sculpture. As well as some fascinating small parts run by Elisa Cook Jr., an addictive out trap drummer, as well as other characters who create parts of conspiracy. If you see a better part of the rain, then she would allow her to go to the overboard, particularly with her in Cook. The Fran√ßois Tone also plays one very differently, and although it is not a strong part, he plays extraordinarily. Although the conspiracy is very determined, the film has a real environment and it is very interesting.
