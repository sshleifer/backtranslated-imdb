"Doors at Someones". Wow, how do I feel this show is so bad .. But now we are lucky "in-house". Thank you, Shaun Cashier. American Gothic, it was all in it. If I have to pick one thing that I like about the show, it does not have to be a "predictable plot-line". The favorite actor was Lucas Black. I bought the DVD Asap, and my kids are very fond of it. There are some hot n steamy scenes. There are too many odd ones. So, if kiddos will be watching you can edit (fastforward / dropped). It's a sunny, a Josh Wheedon layer, which lacks many shows. Adult intelligence and adult status, that is managed with finese. The DVD has some extras, but I have more to do it. If you want to be delighted and enjoy a great show, then see "American Gothic"!
