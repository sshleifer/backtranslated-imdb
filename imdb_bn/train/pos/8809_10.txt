My eyes open to this document, what the people outside the US thought about the September 11 attacks. The film was linked with expertise and presented the disaster rather than attacking America's disaster. After this disaster, different countries and perspectives have been previewed. I believe this movie should be distributed more widely on this point. It finally helps to see something other than the news report of terrorist attacks in the healing process. And some pieces are actually funny, but not so casual. This picture is highly recommended to me, and I pass the same feelings.
