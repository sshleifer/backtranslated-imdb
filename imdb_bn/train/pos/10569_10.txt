Shiny, diverse, malicious, expressive, sexy, extraordinary, sleazy, erotic, heartfelt and corny, football parade is a first-class entertainment, what about all the movies? <br /> <br /> gives a fresh edge to realistic, satirical treatment material and its speed and line delivery are breathtaking. Thinking they are thinking of making pictures just 7 years ago! The brightness of the dialogue does not match anywhere, especially the contemporary movie with "realism" and it is related to contemporary cinema. <br /> <br /> This image was created at a time when the forbidden content in the Hesse Code is being ignored and the result is a fresh, self-referential, critical and living movie that talks directly to contemporary audience with problems through frustration. I would recommend watching a film for a movie of this movie of 1930-1935.
