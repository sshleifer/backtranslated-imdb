The Dark Angel is a future science-fierce series, post-apocalyptic set in Seattle, it focuses on Max (Jessica Albu), a genetically enhanced young man directed by its creators. <br /> <br /> The Dark Angel is absorbed in the universe, with a striking and credible set of characters (as much as saying Buffy, but absorbing it). Of course, this is not for everyone, but those who give it time will see themselves the most enjoyable series. The dark angel is criminally ignored, and the lower-rating, and unfortunately, is canceled after the 2 series. Which was a great shame, because it was likely to be a great series, although 42 episodes of BBC Science-Fi comedy Red Dwarf are only 10 tall. Dark Angel remains incomplete, so check it out, and if you want more then make another series of Locks Fox.
