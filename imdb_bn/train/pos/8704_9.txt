It's sad and poetic at the same time. Hollywood will have to take notice of the new Russian movie, they are telling stories that are not about big explosion and CGI. It takes a common fundamental premises and tells a story, without a philosophy. It's a lot like an Asian film with a dark Russian twist. It is not supposed to be perfect, but nothing is there. But you do not know what power you have, but it is not fully understood. This is the emotion of the story secured. I do not want to see a remix, it's a very cool, Hollywood system, as usual, it will mess up. Acting is all the top notch around. Directing and camera work outdoors are mostly above. Quds for all those involved, and I will turn many people into this independent epic. A +++++ <br /> <br /> See if you can find me.
