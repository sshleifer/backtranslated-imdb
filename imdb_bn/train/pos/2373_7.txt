Pendragon's new film "HG Wells" War of the Worlds ", the first successful adaptation of the original novel, was promoted for almost 5 years. A theatrical release was intended for the beginning of this year (March 2005), but it never happened. The movie was released on 28th June after the release of the Spielberg edition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I like this photo with some reservation. <br /> <br /> How flexible is this adaptation? This is not 100% trustworthy for Wales books, but 90 - 95% trusted is good enough for me. At least a few scenes were completely new, such as Olivi, an astronomer's clash with a farmer, and anonymous writer / narrator was drinking tea abnormally with his cousin. But overall, this image follows the book very closely - certainly the 1953 version is much more than the classic version of George Pala. <br /> <br /> This is the biggest mistake that made it very cheap budget. Most of it's blue-screen has been shot and looks consistent with the digital rendered backgrounds. This is especially annoying for most of the indoor shots and the streets of the crowded city. 1898 London Overview See something from a video game. There were so many scenes in horse carts - I think they can not afford a horse. The only visible shot for "real" seems to be those of the open field or forest. <br /> <br /> But in those budget constraints, they managed to do much work. The artist, the film looks right. The Martians and their Trippasts have done quite well, and very true in the Welsh accounts. I was particularly impressed with heat ray. Although the Thunder child order, which should have been one of the highlights of the film, was very frustrating. It is a big shame that they can afford more real set capability or better quality animation. <br /> <br /> Acting and direction will not win an Oscar. In most cases, they are not suitable, bad, but not outstanding. The music is quite good, though not even with a big Hollywood combo. <br /> <br /> I'm really glad that it did not get a theatrical release, because budget constraints have made it look a lot worse on a big screen. It stands, I'll rate a BBC-TV adaptation similar to classic literature. <br /> <br /> Some nytopics: Most of the scenes are presented in various color filters (mostly red). It may be an artistic choice, but it is used very extravagant, and seems to be a great job to dominate the DVD. And the author / narrator is clearly moved from the view of the fake Mosaic scene. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - is it valuable? If you look at the technical and budget constraints and get the story, I think you will enjoy it, especially if you actually read the novels in the HH Wales. However, if you close down the cheap production prices easily, you can pass it well (unless you are an MST3K fan). Be careful, however, the film runs for a full 3 hours but I do not propose to recommend it to sit together. <br /> <br /> BTW: A completely different version of the World of Words (eg "Invocation") came in the same month on DVD Hit the Spirbert Theater: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. It was also made in a budget, but it has been updated like Spielberg's movie - but it's even better! And to stop it, Jeff Wayne has been making an animated film from his best-selling album since 1978, but it will not end until 2007.
