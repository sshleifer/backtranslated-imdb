* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find out harsh criticism (acting, date dialogue, unclear tale). Belfond is a great, touching, swearing spirit like a brandoceak who wants to earn his right bird but is actually sick in his past life. He was very late learning how his hosting, authentic life was without love. Mostl is just as great as a painful man with his dead wife Fannie. Despite his prayers for a miracle, his bitterness prevents him from taking (or believing) one. The two social world characters are organized together and complement each other, which result in a sunny and sensitive sorrow. <br /> <br /> The wonderful ending is in line with the rest of the picture. After seeing everywhere for the Belmont, look at the Mustal see a falling feather, and to reach it fierce as he is finally willing to believe in angels and miracles. But Bellfont was not allowed to finish his miracle work (for the recovery of Fannie's health or the confidence of MÃ¶tleel), so he never got his bird. Feathering exclamationly from the realization of the masters, a metaphor for both humans: it is too late and you will not get a second chance. Like "This is a wonderful life", this movie is magical, surprising, funny, but horrific sad.
