<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the end of the plot plotting. This is something very bad, quite obvious, it prevents it to be a classic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Hakuli, whose only killer can identify and a mental patient whose patient was the mother of the deaf brain. Nansy Allen, along with several other good works, including Kate Miller and Michael Kain, who were sexually fatal, as Robert Elliott, who are more hidden than the eyes. Although no one really outstanding by any standard. On the other hand, Dennis Frangze, later hit in NYPD Blue, is considered as an extraordinary character alongside the same line, it is embarrassing as a very harmful, cruel, disgusting detective, though it takes a little time to screen but it does not hurt much of the movie. The brain kid Keith Gordon is very good, but it's pretty smart to be truly credible. <br /> <br /> Most sticks with me in this picture are the sequential order. The scene with firmly and well-done scenes with mother disappointed in the museum, the next sequence leads to its impossible death. I like the order of the doctor's office, which reveals the identity of the murderer, which in turn combines the whole film together. And a split screen scene that I think was almost classic. Yet there is another situation when the lease is on a train, which can be killed by the killers, which are taken on the instruction, it should never happen with embarrassing ethnic tactics often. As a thriller it's tense and quite often credible. As a criminal drama it is often falters, especially incomplete, with all the ridiculous explanations that have happened in the end. Even an irrational, and a long way, towards the end of the sequence of dreams, of which some of them had the ability to shoot at someone's feet for a few minutes at a time. It was an up and down experience; One scene will catch me by the heart and spirit, and the next will ask me to squirm and why. It can be under 90 years old for more than 100 minutes and a good movie. <br /> <br /> Fearful movie fans should like it. Today it's still a good movie than Slicker Flickr. Maybe it was a good movie in his time, but recently I saw that I enjoyed it, and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes.
