Ti% s and * as, lots of boobies. Some great characters, gorgeous to fill fun and well-Amercan pie franchise, put together this spin off teen. It really feels like old school. It seems a little like Porkys for 2000's. Some funny funny characters combined in some very funny situations make this a real surprise for me. <br /> <br /> Although the original cast has gone apart except for all, this movie I got really entertaining. Do not let you be too excited, you will take it for that booby teen comedy, but what it does, it excels it. Characters are pleasing and funny, girls are warmer than hell. Fun and Sunny Games, with some stuff I have never met before the trick, they make me cringe but smile at the same time. <br /> <br /> So ignore hate and give this a run and see what you think. Do not expect the classic American pie, but hope you can smile and spark your attention for an hour or more.
