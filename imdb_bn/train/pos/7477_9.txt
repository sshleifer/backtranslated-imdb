This movie has such a great passion, especially its outstanding soundtrack that matches the film. Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm for filmmaking and entertaining. I did not see this movie for the first time, but after about three times I decided that it was among the best films I ever saw. It takes place in New York, and progress through its lifestyle. She discovered a delimma of her life with her girlfriend (Diaz). He goes through a state of depression and then goes through an extrovert blend of imagination. This picture was beyond my expectations, and was one of the best movies of Cruise ever!
