I just saw this at the Toronto Film Festival, and I want to see again because I get it widely released! It is a character-driven film, and more than Andrew and David Task. Any plot of the plot can be discussed <br /> <br /> It is considered broken, so I would say the story is tricky, acting supernatural, and the effects are amazing. Good shooting and well-paced. One of the best movies I've seen in ages, and dreary is refreshing this summer too <br /> <br /> Movies. It was a full-time smile for the audience. If you can see it (I especially like the "Candy Bar! Candy Bar!" Scene.)
