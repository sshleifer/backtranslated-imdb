I just saw this for the first time in a long time - how imaginative the pictures were and how wonderful I was in the movie. However, I have never forgotten that (with the view of the candlelight club candle club club in Waterloo Bridge) is the most romantic movie. <br /> <br /> Anyone interested in politics or history will prefer off-reference rewards for the movie - anyone interested in romance will be removed by Hunter-Niven and anyone who enjoys visual imagery will enjoy the image of the next picture. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie "Odd man man out" was created at the same time - but this one is fantastic. <br /> <br />
