Well, I've seen this movie at least 4 times and I'm still not indecisive to see it. <br /> <br /> The visuals are so good and together with the music that is absolutely awesome and perfect fit, this movie is making me feel bad. <br /> <br /> CGI is a very bad IMHO, but it had complete scenes with black and white feelings and complete sterilization internals ... just a genius perfect combination for such a movie. The whole feeling of feeling is not to be described, the plot is so good. <br /> <br /> However, the film had harmful errors, as liberal. Sometimes I thought the movie was too "slow", but by that I do not want to say beautiful scenes, I totally like them. <br /> <br /> I was often confused by the whole complex story, when he was in a thing like Digicorp's underground bunker, where all his data is stored and there is this conversation with him ... but it could also be mine: D and the last can be displayed in some way, they could make the back-true-memory part a bit longer and "loud", but all this again Without errors, the film would have been so good that I could never stop seeing it again. .
