Ah, cleanies, cleches, cleches; They are a major part of various types of horror films. This one, there are a lot of them. So far, it's Stefan King of Heroes, the master of Heroes. This movie was really good, just forecasts. And what horrible movie does not have stupid people? This one is readily overcrowded with beggar prey only for their life. Pet Semicir I got to be a little vague. The way to set everything up was really pounded, but not terrible. In most cases the act was credible, the suspense was not suspense, but the entertainment level was placed in a major position; My eyes were actually glue on the screen. All fans of Stephen King will see this movie, but for somebody else, expect a OKAY thriller.
