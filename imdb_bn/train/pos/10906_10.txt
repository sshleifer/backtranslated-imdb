My two year old son, Johnny Kennedy suffers from the same condition. I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard him talk bad. I hope he knows how much he has helped his colleagues of his colleagues by increasing awareness about this terrible situation. This man touched man in such a way that one million charity leaflets could not. I believe that this school will be mandatory to see. I agree with other comments - did I cry? He threw everything in life and he could still maintain humor. God bless I can not see the part showing her being changing clothes. I have enough trouble with my son.
