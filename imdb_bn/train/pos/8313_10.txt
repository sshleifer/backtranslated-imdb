After all, I think the comments below are ineligible for such a site. Clearly you have no taste and you do not respect the taste of others. Do not give you a history lesson but I think it needs to be done. There black actors only, if not others, more successful as well. If you are not part of the "Black" nation you will not understand the quality, creativity and vibrantness of old movies as "Sparkle" and "Loneliness" and "Kole High". Unfortunately you are not black, when we look at these classics, we will not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel, so you have to keep your franking mouth closed and only keep your non-dancing nation together. Thank you.
