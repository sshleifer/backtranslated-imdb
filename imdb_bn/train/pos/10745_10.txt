Let me make a bad start from the first path, it is absolutely terrible to describe James Hanln's racky training and what is happening with the events of the day. In fact, it is working brutally with other firefighters, who do not want to give birth to their normal desires. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary film that is impossible to see without tears in my eyes. I am an Englishman from London, but I love New York and have visited many times before and after 11th of September. This is my second home and I can not help but devastating on the loss of life, but the part of such a beautiful city is destroyed. With this real deal, everything falling around them with fire fighters. I was very happy to present the footage to show how many people were there. It is embarrassing that they do not use any footage from jumping to the building because the friends told me that it is a big part of their memory, it should be included to show how bad the generation was really in the future. <br /> <br /> Conspiracy theorists can go to hell.
