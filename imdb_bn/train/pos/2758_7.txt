This movie is a businessman and unlikely friendship between a person in Down syndrome. <br /> <br /> The development of the character of this movie is excellent. We believe that Harry is a businessman who neglects his family, and Georgie is a innocent man who is caring for loving and "normal" society. Acting is excellent, and Kan is best suited for best actor prizes. The imaginative scenes of this picture have highlighted that George has severely grieved his family to his abandonment, and that he wants to behave like normal people. The songs that play repeatedly also reinstate this message. The film shows that mentally handicapped people are of good nature. We're treating them with discrimination and negligence, a scene where Georges gives a gift to the waitress in the kitchen. If we can understand and share this human world, both we and mentally disabled can be very happy. <br /> <br /> I was so drawn into the pictures and the mental experiences of the characters. This is a sensitive film for the soul of good nature.
