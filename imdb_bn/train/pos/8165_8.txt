The dentist was created when almost every profession was psychologist. We were crazy police officers, ambulance men, secretery and that was just for beginners. The dentist was surprisingly late because the visit of a dentist is always going to be the nightmare of ordinary people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Super clean dentist Doctor Feinstone lives in her great "white house" perfect life, she is a wonderful blonde wife and great place to work as a dentist. The dirty IRS guy (Terminal Earl Bowen), the dirty pool cleaner reached his dark cloud as "clean" his wife and suddenly everyone's teeth seem to have gone through dark filters. She went to the nut and began to take care of the teeth of the nasty person. And you do not want to come on his way. <br /> <br /> The crew was professional. Producer / director Brian Yun has created stylish horror films like re-animations and Beyond. He operated the re-animator's signature and his first film society was John Spencer and Live Spin Off. Familiar with the film's producer Pierre David Scanner Cast was great. Corbin Bernsen really suprised me. I knew him from LA Law and Major League, but I can show him a dream as a new psychiatrist. He was actually great in his role and he was kind of sad person. Linda Hoffman Feintones was intelligent and stupid as the wife. Michael did not have many lines of StuDive, but I saw him with the women around him and later knew my future career. In the case of Cain Four (death of Don, Beyond), the police had a great sight. Virginia Kehen was a innocent teenager who is going to be the next client of Feston. Final Warning: If you are like me and have a problem with a dentist, you may want to leave it. But if you want to try, you should prepare yourself with dark humor and lots of nasty drills.
