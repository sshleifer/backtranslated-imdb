Once a movie "comes" and makes things easy for you. You do not make an effort to feel good about it, fix it. You enjoy it while watching it and you take it with you. I can not say it completely flawless, but it's also near. Acting - great, story-interested and with mystery material. This is a small family story, mostly predictable, but it is not a secret thing. It's the way to reach the blind girl. I am fascinated by directing a deep relationship (blind girl and her cousin) to the director. The only thing I do not like is that the actress played the mother, she was very hard and out of necessity. Keren
