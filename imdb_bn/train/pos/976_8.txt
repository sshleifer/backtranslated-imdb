Takashi Mike attacked the Kakirir region almost immediately, because he showed nerve and courage in his behavior with fantasy ingredients. This is a fairy tale which dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought mostly about some fairy tale was sinister; Most children have horrible things in books. Miike realizes that these classic stories are somewhat scary (and more annoying) than they appear at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid in a wonderful search outside the pre-school classroom. He ultimately accentuates a very real fear of a world filled with dangerous missions. Like Westerns downplay the seriousness behind the story in a specially written bed for kids. I appreciate the fact that Miike was more honest than American art makers. He goes for the story, but he also shows signs of restraint. But more than most filmmakers, self-owned Mika is still unfamiliar. I thought it was a great film. Highly recommended.
