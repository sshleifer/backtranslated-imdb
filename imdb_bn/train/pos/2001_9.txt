I was lucky "Oliver!" When I was a small teenager in a big movie screen in Boston in 1968. Later, in the summer of 1969, I saw this film after winning Academy Award for Best Picture of last year in a prominent movie on Leicester Square in London. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oliver's success! Both on stage and on screen remind me that not all talent starts at Broadway and does not end in Hollywood. This legendary story of Charles Dickens, which was lauded by Lennon Bert of Great Britain, a part of the literary tradition of all English speaking people, was lauded at the London stage. Her charming music hit New York and worldwide. Film adaptation was created in England in the summer of 1967 and then released in 1968. Set and musical numbers are worthwhile. The song "Who Will Buy?" Hundreds of actors and British film directors have qualified for his Oscars to keep up with each other in real life. Some Canadian and American talents are also part of this wonderful production, but mostly it's a tribute to fine-tech crafts such as British film studio, such as Shepperton. Good show! Elstree, Borham Wood, Bray, Denham and other Eileying studio have won fame many of the world's movies for years.
