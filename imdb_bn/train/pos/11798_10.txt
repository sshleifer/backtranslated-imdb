I saw this image 100 times literally ... it's jam-packed with absolutely fun !!! Power booth gives a star's performance. As an actor, I did not think that an actor could catch "intensity" in these roles as Shatner and Lebman until William Shutner (Imposes, 1974) and Ron Llmman (1985) until I saw Booth as Jim Jones! As far as I am concerned, Jim Jones in Power Booth ... this movie captures his best performance !!!
