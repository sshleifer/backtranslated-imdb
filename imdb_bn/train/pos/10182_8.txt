Good movies, good music, good background and an acceptable plot. But its movies are again seen as the main point, people can make the idol of the best actor and the dust in gold. Nan bettaker This could be his second best performance after the break (others might disagree). Although the other movies are not much behind. <br /> <br /> Good movie Although I think Shah Rukh was not a luxury but could work without this film. You can see in his movies, others try to reach their height and try to get out of their skin. But this guy is really a bit of Elises. <br /> <br /> The film is quiet, music and the direction is a little sticky, but screen play and dialogue are very good again. A clock is required.
