I love the series! Many stereotypes, which are depicted as a hicse, are very clear, but such people are often present. The scriptures of the Southern Government are really true, but sympathetic characters remind the good of the south as well as many good things. Some things are never changed, and we see "good old boys" every day! Every southern city has Lucas Bock, which calls a phone call only for making accessories and "PO" white trash. "The story is very familiar, as well as in the modern south as well as with the occult elements, I think somehow Trinity, SC Barnwell has been in the county!
