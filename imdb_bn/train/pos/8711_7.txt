It is beyond my understanding that Norway has been remastered for so much rubbish DVD releases, and yet such gems do not get a shot to recover their past glory. I can give it a 7, because it is not very good, but it is one of the few scientific films made for Norwegian television. This film is nothing less than a film-historical mony that first shows the alien movie in many ways. And, my words, blind pusjars were the first! Did anyone watch the mini series of Radley Scott or the crew? But unlikely, the incident remains very similar to the resemblance that remains. Well, the budget is lower in Norwegian Movies, but it has been given, it's a really good job from the brutal age of Norwegian filmmaking, which eventually went on in the 90's.
