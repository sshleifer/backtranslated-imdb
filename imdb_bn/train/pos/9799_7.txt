An enjoyable Batman animated film. "Joker Returns" or "Fantasum's Mask" is not the same, but still strong. I like how you kept your idea about how I was a buttonman. There was a nice turn. Excellent action sequence I always get feedback than any kind of Batman live action film signals better than Batman cartoons. The trend is going on here. <br /> <br /> 10
