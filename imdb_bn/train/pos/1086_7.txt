This movie is a bit unusual because it has got a very thin plot and the movie is done very slowly and retired. Although it is quite different from the average grant film, it is still very visible and entertaining. Some people say, "Let's just go to the house and get annoyed with the little problems that come home." The film works very well, considering that he is a great actor from the film and the great support from Morin Loy and Melvin Douglas. The film is quite modest tendency, it makes most of the components. This is a great film for Ary Grant fans or for the whole family.
