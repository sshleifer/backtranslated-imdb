That's exactly what it is. Actually, it's somewhere in my top 20 most favorite movie. Number 15, I think. However, I'm not the only one for plots, but I think the plots work well in Enam and RPG video games (for example Final Fantasy 7) and movies. But this one has it all. Planets, stars, animated drawing of an extremely well-written playplay. Although it is not really for children, they can still see it, there is no graphic blood, nuts and silicon. But I do not think they're going to understand it.
