'Epfgonia' is a great achievement by Michael Koconis. This skillful game is adapted efficiently for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast. Cacoyannis achieved impossible. He was able to manage Greek tragedy films on screen without losing its functionality and importance. This cable helps him in a Greek cast. Nakamara Tatien Papamoschou is very impressive as Iphigenia. Irene is equally impressive with Papas, though he sometimes feels upstairs, it is very realistic. A wonderful Greek movie, a beautifully adapted and directed by Max Kokwaniis, is a classic music score from Mix Theodorakis, which is ideal for every scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> The rumor spread that this image has lost the best foreign language in Oscars only 1 vote !!!
