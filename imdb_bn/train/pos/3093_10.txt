Why did the producers not give all junk to the show on TV, why the producers did not give them six degrees? Will the series go to the video? I want to see how it finishes. Put a season in the video and sell it. I was a devotee of six degrees and was waiting for his return. I set all my show tape recorder. Thank you to the Lord. I just saw that the show was canceled and I broke the heart. I knew it was going to be canceled, why did not they tell us? I think the show is just developing some depth of letters. The writing was quite good. Steven (Campbell Scott) is my favorite time. I'm sorry to see it so go!
