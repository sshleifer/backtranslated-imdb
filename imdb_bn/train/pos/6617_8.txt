Animation always seems to be fringe. In Japan, this may not be the case, but in Europe and United States animation it has a large fat "kids" tag on it. France is probably one of the more comic-liberal countries, the tin-tin, the asterisks, the Lucky Look, the classic home like Valerian, and more (if you do not read it, but it's not too late, there is no age for them, and they are either DC or Marvel It does not carry atrocities) It seems like a popular movie like France. It decorates my boyfriend with an art-loving, American-based and talented filmmaker. Thankfully, there is "a scanner in the dark" to suppress the scene - it seems the industry is much more international. <br /> <br /> However, you may have collected the Renaissance, perhaps Arts and French. If you are a normal person you will be scared of it. But there is no need! Its cool, sleek sleeveless look has a good thriller and overall good movie. <br /> <br /> I was afraid of this movie. Many animated animations like Sony and C have been bent easily: and they are working with their Pixar rip-off. I was expecting a confusing, sometimes annoying and very compelling movie, but thankfully I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it by any means for neo-noir stuff, but it was good that it was well that level too. Note: I saw the French Dob, which I saw was OK. English can be more attractive with programming and everything. <br /> <br /> The final word of praise for the animation. It was awesome. Future, orderly, beautiful camera-work, smart solutions (for example the eyes looked good, which is hard work) and so visually stunning I said "It's so awesome!" Then again, I really like the animation and appreciate the studio's efforts, so my judgment is a bit favorable. <br /> <br /> No matter what the good movie is, it certainly crosses "hostage".
