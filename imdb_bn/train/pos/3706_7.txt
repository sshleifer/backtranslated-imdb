The biggest surprise in this film is the performance of Daryl Hannah. Instead of playing the role of stereotypical ditzy blonde that he usually plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-tired character. She does not have a huge role but she used to cover, for her boss's indiscretions, although Los Harlan does a great job as a woman tired.
