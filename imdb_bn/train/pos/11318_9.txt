James M. under the leadership of this great Lucino Wissankt. Kenny novel The Postman is always a hunting of the Rings Twins, a strong Italian adaptation. It is so interesting about this movie that it can become something brave and more original with every means (interestingly, Camus believes his story novel as the original inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger). The film has more power and intensity than the novel, because Wisconi suggests more complex search of gender, even though it is capable of making the image of the alphabet frame. Kain's American novel is also brilliantly fascinated by the white (the main character is very scared that he would be known as Mexican and was ashamed that he married a Greek immigrant), which is not relevant in the Italian rural context, which works as a wisconsin. It allows the class to take antigenism to the central stage and dancing between two main characters of the passionate, destructive love lover's graves. This image is a complex, suspenseful, rewarded experience.
