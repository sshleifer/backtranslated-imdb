As an old Rokbarbar, this movie is mentioned in the hip and quo-my two favorite bands - but incredible cast (everyone) - and extraordinary tales - I love this piece of creative talent only. I can not recommend it more - and Mick Jones has added so much (the greatest rock singer along with foreign leadership and lead song writer - Low gram) - I've seen this great work more than 10 times - Bill Nike - no voices - and Jimmy Nail - Prove talent from genius - then Astrad ... and Karen ..... And what could be an old old rock! 10/10 - Bloody Bright <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
