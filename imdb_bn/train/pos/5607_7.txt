Once I saw the tenant and explained it as a horror movie. It uses most of the tropes in the genre: sinful apartment, suspicious neighbors, expedition, mystery, illusion. Hero life, Trailkovsky, surrounded by evil, secret forces are trying to drive him crazy. <br /> <br /> The last time I saw I challenged this basic explanation. If this movie is a horror movie, it is only horrific that a Kafka novel is awful. Actually, this film can be understood literally, because alone people are slowly becoming crazy without any external impact. <br /> <br /> Polanski has done three movies with insanity in his career: The fraud, which I did not particularly believe in, such as the development of madness in the heroine; Rosemary's baby, which is driven crazy by the evil forces of Nain; And The Tenant, which can sometimes be the best in Paranova made in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She became obsessed with her and gradually began to become her: She wore her clothes, made a makeup , Speak like him. But is he possessed by the soul, or did he just bestow his wild imagination? It is bipartisan between real and imagined, and no Polanski never solves it, it creates such a fascinating film. Many events in the film can be miraculously available because they can be for normal reasons, and it can convince the viewer that the decision has to be made. <br /> <br /> Although it is not my favorite Polanski film, it is a good example of the ability to create its mystery and the crazy illustration in a very strong belief. And technically speaking, it's a wonderful one. He collaborated with film composer Philip Sard and legendary director Sven Niquist (Bergman's DP) to create the film. A slow pacing and sometimes unwanted segments can enjoy this movie, but it's an experience.
