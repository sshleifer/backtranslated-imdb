Jack's closure has the mental strength of Kram vs. Crumar, which combines Pan's geographic imagination. Even at the beginning, the special effect seems to give a request to Pan's laboratory. But this is a story that takes place in modern times, not in the war 60 years ago, and so on this day more resonance happened. Jack's closure is a boy, only child, alone on a summer holiday, separated from his family. It's a horror movie like The Aurets and the Sexte Sense, a horror movie for the thinking person. If you are looking for a slash movie, it will not be your tea cup, but if you're looking for a story that is good for both acting and suspicious, it's a movie for you. At screening I saw, I swore that there was a moment where the whole audience screamed. I highly recommend catching this film.
