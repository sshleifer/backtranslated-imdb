'Midnight Cowboy' was excerpted with the original release in 1962. There are some scenes where you can understand it. The film about Joe Buck (John Voet) is sometimes a bit annoying when it comes to Texas from Houston to New York City. Clothed as a cowboy, he tries to live as a hustler, earning money by acting. It does not work as it is designed. Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a strategy on him and stole some money and became a friend. They live in an empty and very dirty apartment. Then Ratso becomes ill and Joe has to try to earn some money. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Editing this movie is great. We look at the sequence of dreams of Joe and Rausor, and in the world we stopped a beautiful and fun way. Dustin Hoffman, John Voight and supporting actor gave great performance. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine quaint lines. The score is great by John Barry and sounds great. This is a great movie which won the best picture Oscar for a good reason.
