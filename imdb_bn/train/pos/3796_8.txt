Jim McChoney has made one of the best films you'll see throughout the year. The quiet simplicity of this movie lets you get out of the start shot and never let go. There is no false note on the whole film. No one Everything works. Handheld cameras are never confusing and wherever. The three young women whose lives we follow are always real. There is no single beat where the audience is reminded that we are playing the role of actresses. Only real girls are trying to find themselves. There is no political agenda hidden or otherwise. This movie is its most fundamental subject and although it may be seen by a number of viewers in the movie, but it is a great publication. Special cap for the production of filmmakers to provide the necessary donations for Hugh Hefner to produce this special film. I can not wait to see Mac later.
