First you think of another Disney movie, it might be good, but it's a children's movie. But when you see it, you can help but it can not enjoy it. All ages will love this movie. I first saw this movie at the age of 10 and now I love it after 8 years! Danny Glover is fantastic and can not play any good part. Christopher Lloyd is delightful and perfect for the part. Trustworthy as Tony Danza Mail Clark. You can not help, but to enjoy this movie! I give it a 10/10!
