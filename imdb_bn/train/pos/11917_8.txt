Yes, a simple but inspirational movie archetype. When the whole crowd comes up in the stadium and when people see it, they raise their hands. That's just brilliant. Joseph is as lonely and sad child as wonderful who has been frustrated by someone and something in his life so far. How to communicate with Danny Glover and try to believe in magic and angels is fun and fun. With a very nice family movie - I admit - a rather happy happy ending. But hey, it does not really matter, the film maintains its basic quality through good acting and inspirational themes.
