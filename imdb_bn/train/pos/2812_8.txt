"Silverlake Life" was a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. Actually, it was like a house movie and if you want a dramatic illumination, look for something else. And that does not mean a teaser. But I mean that positive means. It shows two people who love each other and how they are affected by AIDS affect the quality of their daily lives. It was difficult for me to say that it was a quality film or whether it was looking for other ways to respond. This is a pretty movie, one of the most commendable, sincere documents I actually ever seen. These two men have incredible honesty, reducing the most basic part of their lives. It seems to be the hip and heartless on the hip-wood production add-ons. These men have created this movie for themselves, one of the best reasons for creating something. Tom is the real thing to tell where you "sing my songs" and say goodbye.
