I was tuned and riveted in this by independent film channel accidents. I was flabbergasted by a professional actor and I played. They felt absolutely improvisatory without affecting absolutely. I was skeptical or did not wait to see how it was shot and credit, and then spent an hour and a half to find this image in IMDB. Do not miss it. I have seen that the director-director also made a very good film, the name Adidai People, which I enjoyed a lot. The shame of the movie business is that these excellent projects do not have the right to distribute and advertise that they are living under radar. These images deserve high and proud flying. I request people to see it and see it.
