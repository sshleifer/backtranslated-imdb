Gretchen Mole's great acting. This image is sometimes one of the best biophysics to hit the screen. Although it is covered mostly in Beti√©'s young life, it depends on the most attentive path, which most of the biographies seem to lack in film. Dialogue and acting have some lovely and alarmingly funny subtext. This image is a nice break from Dir. "American Psycho," and I think it would look like its best date. Oh, and as a cinematography buff, I give this film 100% cine-dip. It was amazing how well they pulled the look of the 50s with modern film stocks. D.P.P. Very enjoyable nearby. Any recommendation I would like to see: 8/10.
