EA has shown us that they can create a classic 007 agent and you can experience the world in the 60's. The graphics of the game is outstanding and voice recording is very professional. I got this game in April 2007 (after two years of release), and I'm still with gameplay. It's embarrassing that EA no longer creates 007 games. <br /> <br /> I offer 10/10 for the levels of this game, especially for the "Consulate" level. I recommend this game to someone aged 13 years and over. In this game I do not like the level of Russian boats, it was too much pressure. Overall I like the game a lot !!
