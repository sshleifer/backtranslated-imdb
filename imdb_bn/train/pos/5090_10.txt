I like this movie. Great story and actor and good movie set. It tells a story that can easily be understood without understanding and falling asleep. I want to know where I can get the soundtrack. I can not find it anywhere Please email me if you know where you might get the soundtrack. In addition to finding the soundtrack, I think the movie is interesting. Swayze did a great job. I think this is something his good job is doing. His past movies were just fine, but one of these really told a story for the change. This is one of the best television movies ever made in history. Congratulations to producers and writers such a great piece of work.
