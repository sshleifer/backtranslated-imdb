This is an honest effort to make a wicked sweet love story. The obvious inspiration behind the successful TV series "Bewitched," this lovely sweet rom-less is a timeless treasure. The comparison is obvious. Hostage Stewart is a helpless but firm "straight." Kim plays a lady blonde wand who captures him using a loving spell in the novel. But when it is made by a powerful witch, she takes the responsibility of running her own shop and gets comfort from her favorite Peevette (known in her native language) who is taking care of her favorite aunt. You must recognize the aunt from "assault by assassination". This movie is funny and sensitive, bearing some spectacular wit and a wonderful witchy feeling. Price of a look
