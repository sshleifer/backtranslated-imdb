One of the best performances of Carlos Mencia is to date the strings attached. Mensia insects and ethnic subjects are known for fun fun. However, he does more than this stand-up performance in San Francisco. In general, Menaia's material does not just make you laugh, but it also lets you think about the true mistakes of today's society. <br /> <br /> In this hour long performance, discussing issues such as Mensia illegal migration, women should actually talk about the meaning of work, terrorism, Christ Gibson's Passion of Marine and influenced by Jesus or dealing with society. With an argument, he argued that they are equal to workplace equality, terrorism, physical or mentality Disabled. Mensia also talks about whether to have the right to speak and to have curiosity. <br /> <br /> Carlos Mensia is not afraid of abuse, which often gets hurt by his critics. For example, he is a joke related to Pope John Paul II and he probably goes a bit far away from what he is doing in heaven (and he admits). <br /> <br /> The main message of Mensia in all its activities is that we all have a voice and we should use the term that we feel and we are not afraid to object. He reminds us that we have the right to freedom of speech and we must use this right as an American. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this performance, of course, I would recommend watching Mensychic's mind, his show at the comedy center.
