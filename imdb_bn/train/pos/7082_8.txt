Above all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take most of his films, you'll see that the letters are at the same moment at the same time. His character in this movie has crossed each other so far ... and counting. This story (not even that) begins in the future, to find out the source of the virus that a person has sent in the past that has removed most of the world's people from the earth. The story seems to be moving towards the SF but it is close to a play due to the slow rhythm of the story. About that Movies are fast and slow in some points and further develops from beginning to end, but if you look at this movie, you will be aware of this series of stories and will publish information that is slow and slow. Its one and the same speed that flows smooth and superb well. But this does not mean that your nerves do not last in the end, it will be pretty good. As far as the direction indicates, it is a special effect. Such movies are simply destroyed by bad instruction but this one has become much better. So, if you're ready to see a sci-fi movie or some steps, you will miss it. B will have more movies like this.
