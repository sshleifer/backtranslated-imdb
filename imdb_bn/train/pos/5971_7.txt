Skippy from Family Relations This fairly cheesy movie goes from a clean cut in metal to the baby. The film seems to have been created as a response to psychological parents, who claimed that metal music is making their children worse or killing themselves - except that only a dead satan metal star is trying to return from the grave (help using the scopp). And when the plot is authentic and cliche, corniness (for example, a bad green fog off of a girl's clothes) and the soundtrack movie is so ridiculous (and great) to do. And of course, Ozzy Osbourne is asking what happened to the love song who played some preacher like :). Certainly a movie for having a few friends for a good smile. And when you're in it, then make Slimmer Party a double feature with genocide - black leather w / fringe has a "bad rock" (described in the video box) driller. A Chess movie fan must definitely see.
