I enjoyed this movie, mainly because I'm happy to see Shan Connie's law and it has additional bonuses to have Ad Harris and Lawrence Fishburn. The story is a grandmother for Kanhai's help, because her granddaughter is in jail and she says she has been wrongfully convicted. First of all, there are some racist cases in the case, but subsequently it considers the Chief Officer to be black and it seems that he did some bad things to strengthen the confession from the boy. The boy is trying to point out another killer who is locked in the same prison, who will be killed. He is particularly nasty, he enjoys much joy in what he did, writing for his victims and trying to match people. Of these, some twists and turns are a bit unexpected. I just enjoyed trying to convey the full emotional sense of Satan Connery's character. The movie makes me crazy in the area, especially when you finally discovered it. In Connery and Harris and Canary and Fisborne, you will get a very good interface because they all brighten it well. Ultimately this one makes for rather good mystery / thriller.
