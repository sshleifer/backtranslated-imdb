I found the film quite clearly, the main character was lost, but more than that, there is more than anything that has been mocked for her life. (For example, its flatmate). <br /> <br /> She was tortured and you loved seeing him tortured! It was a scary side that was terrible but we were happy to see him come out of grief again. <br /> <br /> It was like playing character or pan man by mine or enemies and we want to see him under a sniper attack or fire but ultimately we are happy to see him live ... <br /> <br / >.
