I saw John Cassettes films last week - beginning with 'a woman under the influence' and 'the opening night' ended. I totally and completely flown, especially by these two movies. From the first minute to the last 'opening night' I was completely and completely absorbed. I just enjoyed it on a few occasions, but it looks like this film was perfect for almost two-thirds, until the credits came out. Everything about this image, how it was shot, incredible performance of Gena Roolland, credit, opening, music, plot, feeling of depth, speed, softness, originality, character, stealing a little moment ... for me, really glorious. I did not agree with the previous comment about taking me to a desert island because there is something to see in this deep depth of film. If your bad luck is enough for home lighting, then I am sure you will save your copy of this movie instead of trying one last trick to retrieve the piece of money under your bed.
