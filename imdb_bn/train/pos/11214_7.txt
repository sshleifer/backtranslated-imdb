This is the first time I saw the movie "Walking Tall", I think with Hollywood Bloved a $ 2 movie theater. So, I do not have any reference to Joe Dawn Biker's first health. I am surprised to see the atrocities of McCain County's corrupt system and "Redneck gang". I was also surprised that a man decided that he would not let the slide go, and went out to do something about it. Brave I think so - a point where it spreads my spine. <br /> <br /> I think this film makes a great story about American courage to stand and something about an arrangement that only serves its interest. I flew too much about it, and it is still one of the best films of the hero / anti heroes, which may laugh, but recent movies like "The Punisher" are included, but much more, because it is the true story. The recent reunion of "Rock" does not just judge the real fire in the story of Buford Poussure. <br /> <br /> is a "classic" which I am sure it will revive again in the future.
