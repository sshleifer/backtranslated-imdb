This James Bond game is the best bond game of my life. This is my favorite James Bond game so far: <br /> <br /> The mission of this game is really funny that it can be really hard to be more fun to run a mission. The weapons you use are so good. This game works in a lot of workshops for cars and it's really fun. The voice over the actors is really good and it is cool to say that Shane Connery is the voice of James Bond as well as the way the bond looks really cool because it looks like a cinema connery when he plays James Bond in the movie and other character look is the same as the look of many beautiful movies. This James Bond game graphics is a pretty good one. The game also follows most of the movies, but not all, but most of the time it's great. <br /> <br /> Overall score ********** ***** *****
