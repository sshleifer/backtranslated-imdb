Genres: Dinosaurs, Animation, New York, Time Travel, Circus. <br /> <br /> The main character: Rex the Tieranosaurus Rex, Elsa the Pterodactyl, Deib Parasarolphas, Wo Tikritps, a boy named Louis, a girl, Sicilya and Captain New-Eyes. ? Actors: John Goodman (Rex), Yardley Smith (Seychelia), Martin Short (Jota Stubs), Falissy Kendall (Elsa) etc.? What happened: Four dinosaurs (see above) have been fed some "brain cereal cereal" and are now cuddly, friendly dinosaurs who are going to be good at children. They go to New York, with big plans? <br /> <br /> My thoughts: This is a cute animated film. Animation of dinosaurs when they are ugly and friendly, it is a little floppy and not extraordinary, but they enjoy the same. They prefer dinosaurs when they are cuddly and friendly, they are nice, friendly and good. I like almost all of the characters, especially Elsa and Sicily, but of course I like the others. Overall, I like this picture a lot! :-) <br /> <br /> Recommended: Those who love animated movies for good children, like dinosaurs, John Goodman and those who think that circuses do not think they always feel ?? Enjoy! :-)
