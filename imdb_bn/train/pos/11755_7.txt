I love this movie, but music is just stupid in all the former student gatherings. <br /> <br /> Lucky game was held in 1972. It means that in 1927 the theater was graduated. But almost all of the songs played at the music. Dance etc. In the 1950s and early 1960's. <br /> <br /> To reconsider my 30th high school, I can assure you that the last song of rehearsal or ex-high school dance is about the people of their parents <br /> <br /> I understand the difficulty of finding music related to the 1970s - we all know how much musical it was in a fool time. But it was not completely helpless, and the film's producers cared more. I found that dance scenes were very annoying to deliberately suspend disbelief in other movies. <br /> <br /> It was a bad director and / or producer decision.
