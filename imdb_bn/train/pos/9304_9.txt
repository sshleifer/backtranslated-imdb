This movie is great. Only. It is rare for you to have a comedy with dimensions, and this is such a bloody good example. When I first saw this movie, as a credit roaming, a friend and I looked at each other and asked ... 'Are you catching it?' For those doubters, look at the dimensions. Compare the comparison between VIC and humans, see the comparison of DNA people! See different characters, justify for each location, and if you do not see anything else, see the connection between Vick's healing and path through the film. It's a Victim! The opening line about the Vix World Close the camera with the camera on the head and inside, in the whole universe! Completely quoted, wonderful cartoon gangsters, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
