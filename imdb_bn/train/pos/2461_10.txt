Kenneth Branagh's "Hamlet" hit all signs. Acting is extraordinary, 70mm cinematography fantastic, Oscar nominated clothing and set stunning, and Patrick Doyle score (also nominated Oscar) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes - screenplay is not too bad by some people named WillS. Film critics accepted Brandanga for "preferred" branding to receive Brahanag's 'Fourth Oscar', but the decision to use the full text was frustrating. I can not remember the many good ways to fly for four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost all decisions Branagh works nicely: the use of the Blenheim palace of England for Edwardian, Edwardian dress, and "not to be" is a mirror, a few names. Casting of Hollywood illumination castings in small parts like Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemon may be confusing, but it would be condemned. Chief actor excels: Derek Jacobi Claudius captures the nature of conflict; Kate Winslet has firmly made the lineage of the Epilepsy crazy; Julie Cristie brings her Gertrude painting emotions; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as conniving Polonius; And Nicholas Farrell portrays Hauratio's possible grateful role as condolences for true friendship. Each lecture, each line, is delivered with passion and firmness in each sound; There is no waste of time in the whole film. Final scenes Shakespeare's tragedy is not possible with greater dramatic adaptations. <br /> <br /> Brangh's "Hamlet" is very brave, ambitious and successful in conjunction with Shakespeare's greatness and poetry. Is it controversial ever the greatest Shakespeare adaptation film ?? Strong praise, but deserve well.
