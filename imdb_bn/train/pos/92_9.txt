It's not an art-house film, it's mainstream entertainment. <br /> <br /> Lot's nice people, T & A, and action. I found it very entertaining. It is not supposed to be intelligent to be intelligent, it's a fun movie to watch! Jesse and Ches are very funny, which is just gravy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I would suggest checking it for a boy or even a few weekends with girls to entertain (if he wants to see other girls!). <br /> <br /> Villain is very good. Vini, Cori Bara, Haitians from Hero. Very nasty villain.
