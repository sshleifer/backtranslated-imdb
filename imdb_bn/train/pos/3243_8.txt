Do you remember the first day of Pay Per View? I do, and I can remember the call that I was actually going to make for the movie on your TV. As a child we always wanted to rent Playboy, but this means that someone calls on someone from PPV and wants to rent. And then you get nervous to do it and your four-hour soft core is watching any angle shit. The reason I brought it was that the film was also on PPV. And I think that there was almost every scene that was added. Over the past few years I've found all the great movies I used to see as a big kid and it was one of them. It's one that closes its hard off. All star cast tried to promise the perfect bank chest but nothing goes right. There is a lot of crazy bank caps and this is read in this section. It has enough work and laughs to maintain it. Check it out if you dare!
