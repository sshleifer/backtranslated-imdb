HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !! <br /> <br /> A good writing, funny movie that will appeal to everyone with the sense of humor !!! It's better to see an independent British movie rather than having a own ownership against the big studio! Of course, the value of adding any film collection. In this film scene I am sure that many people will be able to relate. You will smile at antics and enjoy great soundtracks. I particularly enjoyed Jimmy Cliff's version of Vietnam and the Tower of Freebirds in London. <br /> <br /> Let her go ............ You will not be disappointed.
