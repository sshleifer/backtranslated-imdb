I saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival first, and I have never seen Hong Kong cinema before. I felt like sitting in a roller coaster: the action was so fast, and there was not a boring moment throughout the film. It has martial arts, love, special effects and a fantastic plot. When my favorite scene is drinking a Taoist, singing for himself and fighting - one of the many scenes in the film's immense musical element. This film must certainly be a must !!
