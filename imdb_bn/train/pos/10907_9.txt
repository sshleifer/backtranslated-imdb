Wandering around TV and HBO was seeing the twosome blurry of incredible medical conditions, so I returned my eldest sister and said, "Hey, it seems funny" - I really like the documentary - so we started to see it. At first I thought that Johnny Kennedy was a young man, but he was given the explanation that he never went through puberty due to his condition, in this way a high voice and small body. He had a crusade to raise money for his cause. He had wonderful wonderful ideas combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality ... I cried, saw some more, laugh, get to get another Kleenex, then cried some more. Once Jonny Kennedy's "time was over" he went to heaven with the angels. She was more than ready; She learned her lessons from this life and she was free. I highly recommend this. If you do not love this person, you have no heart.
