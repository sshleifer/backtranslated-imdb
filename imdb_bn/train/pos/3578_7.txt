12 year old Arnold Hillman accidentally killed his elder brother Eugene. His feelings are not arrested by his family (or it seems to be not right) to contact him. His only refugee is his grandfather, who only shows mercy to him. The reality "true-2-life" will make movie lovers fascinating, but those who do not want to work and thrill them out.
