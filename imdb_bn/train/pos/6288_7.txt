60 seconds / (2000) *** (in fours) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " You are interested in this product by producer Jerry Br√ºhheimer ("Con Air," "The Rock"), interested in offering your eyes only in shiny vehicles. Although the film hides the flick of weakness in many cases, its specifications and specifications of its excitement make it a medium-sized summer thriller. The movie, Juvanie Ribisi ("Mode Squad"), a young crew named Cop Renaissance, who opened the film, failed to provide a long list of expensive cars to powerful criminal Raymond Calletti (Christopher Exelston). When Cop's life is threatened, his older brother Randall, "Memphis" Reinis (Nicholas Cage), retired but skilled car thief, is called to complete his work to survive his brother: Specific model, color, year by the steel car , And make-in only four days. <br /> <br /> Memphis helps him stop the hijst to recruit a team of batches for the first three days. Sarah "Sooie" Weilland (Angelina Jolie) is a sexy yet retired car swindler who knows Memphis through an earlier business, Mirror Man, an assistant (TJ Cross), elderly and knowledgeable Auto Halio (Robert Dual), as well as Tumblr (Scott Kane), Atley Jackson (Will Patan), Toby (William Lee Scott), and Donny Astro (Chi McBride). <br /> <br /> contributed to the movie's drive and the tension is a mistress involved in two police detectives, Roland Casselbeck (Deloitte Lindo) and Drakekoff (Timothy Elephant), who suspects from previous experience that Memphis and his crew are better and they Keep an extra eye. <br /> <br /> There is not much time for character development here; Audiences may be recognized by these people, although their nasty lifestyle and movies assume tough personalities through hard-core, stylish environments. To make things worse for the film, the dialogue fails to define letters with bold cultural voices. I'm not saying that prejudice and indecency are essential for the thrillers to improve. I really respect the decision of the director to protect a film from extreme language which can easily achieve a rating. However, I believe in a movie such as "Gone in 60 Seconds", to make the character illumination firmly, the conversation must be credible and authentic. <br /> <br /> Despite the problems, the characters are top notch, fully effective because of the responsibility of the actors. Nicholas Cage's composer's performance is intense and believable. Angelina Jolie's lazy appearance is perfectly suitable here. Delroy Lindo is deliciously sturdy and trustworthy. Giovanni Ribisi, Scott Kahn, Robert Duval, Will Patan, and Christopher Eicleston played persuasive roles. <br /> <br /> Studies in this movie have a satisfactory first job to describe in detail the style and character objectives, set up a fast-packed theme of action, but lack depth and strong character role. In the second law, we are going through some more problems: The story mostly loses time during this segment, sometimes it is not made for a third law. The film takes a long time in the middle, and the sexual scene provides strong mid-plot, not all of it happens. The third thing is mostly a continuous adrenaline ray, which is the wall of the wall from the horror wall and sometimes the most intense car charging sequences. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack "has gone in 60 seconds" to make a great contribution to countering inspirational action scenes. It's a car cassette scene that works in spite of many destructive errors in this movie. Dominic Senna, whose career is mostly advertised, has an attractive style and "decade of 60 seconds" is a decisive attitude that will give the audience two hours of sound, thriller and excitement to the audience. But nothing more. <br /> <br />
