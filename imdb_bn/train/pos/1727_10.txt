The wooden horse is a very clever film about a very clever and successful escape plan run by British Pound during World War II. It has been fiercely played with comedic feelings, especially the line released by acid-language Leo Zen. Anthony Steel and David Tomlinson (later George Pope's George Bank) are wonderful as two heroes. The direction is pulling and fast moving across. Highly recommended.
