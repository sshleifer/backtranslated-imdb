This picture was pretty good. I'm not a fan of baseball, but it is a movie that was created to help understand love, firmness, heart etc. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Brenda Fryker, Christopher Lloyd, Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr. are involved in the understanding of various gifted actors and sports. The plot was credible, and I love the message. William Precious and the boys put together a great movie. <br /> <br /> Most sports films revolve around true stories or events and they often do not work well. But this image has hit the 10th Completion Scale, although there are a few minor mistakes. <br /> <br /> 10/10
