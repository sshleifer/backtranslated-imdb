Martin Scorcese is a huge, wide and enthusiastic summary of American cinema seen through eyes. Not saying, its 4 hours running time does not have a dull moment at all. Instead of contemporary directors, there are more discussions from the viewpoint of Cineffill, many styles, time and directors are all tested. American movies, or movies generally for anyone interested in even remotely. One of the best compositions, and the best of the series of BFI's Century series. <br /> <br />
