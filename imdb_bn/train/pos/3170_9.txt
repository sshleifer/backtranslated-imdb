Writer / Director / Co-Star Adam Jones leads to great things. I feel after seeing his feature film "Cross Id". Seldom an independent film makes me feel better like him. Shiny Written and Efficiently Instructions, "Cross-Id" keeps you involved starting from the beginning. Adam Jones may not yet be a well-known name, but he must be. If there is one or two "named actors" in this movie, it can be a box office sensation. I think it still has an opportunity to show viewers of a movie stream if only one movie dealer takes the time to work on this movie. Whatever it ends, if you get a chance to see it, you will not be disappointed.
