Yesterday I saw this movie for the third time. It is recommended to me by a fry a few weeks ago. I've never seen it even before, because it falls in the "Swedish movie" section (usually) and those who get up with the Hollywood production (like me) suspect a foreign movie. What a changed transfer to hell! The film touches me because it holds my hopes, the humanity can change in a better way. Swedish village is the only pattern for all parts of the world where religion is united - Religion, misunderstandings, lack of courage, prediction, impersonation cruelty, but the ability to mingle, join, sing ... To open every mask, a trigger from outside (who One) and reminds them that we all are people with the intention of saving our own lives. Because I can not stop looking at stories like this, that puts my hope as described above. The story is one of my movie-highlights, with its performance within five minutes of Gabriel's song! Thank you, Pollock for just 5 minutes, which made me happy!
