* Spoilers * - Also, my quote can not be right. <br /> <br /> Everybody always notes the sarcasm in social commentary and economic parallel - how true. But to me, I see this movie a lot more. I love this glittering symbol of a shining white suit. There is so much confusion and dirtyness in the world around him, but it will not be lightened. Alec Guinness was the perfect man in this game - his children's greens and endless curiosity is so appropriate: <br /> <br /> "It's easy - you can tell me, how much is the ink ratio of petrol?" </ p> <br /> The only moment of defeat when he realizes that his discovered did not work all the time - almost naked. Yet, more general disappointment than shame is that "it does not work." He is not really scared by the people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Happened?

After his discovery Michael did not have true love with her and her father was completely incapable of caring for her, she gave cruelty and tried to unsettling.

If you say 'yes' I think I'm terrified. <br /> <br /> I love it, these crazy businesses come to nothing. But then, the bubbles begin to quirky beat, and Sydney is closed, its stride tune matches: Where are Daphon? We do not really know - but they were not really in love and he was not really a scientist. Ilena and that he "hopes for a shot at arm" was. (Pollyanna) a cont'd relationship was good, but as Billy Joel says, "It was more than I wanted to ..." <br /> <br /> <br />
