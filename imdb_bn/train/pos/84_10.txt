I educated this movie in the religion class. Golden fish swiming happily in the bowl of the upper collar apartment. A little boy and his mother away from home. The boy was given the money to buy milk. On the way home, he stopped at the carnival to play a game. A black suit next to him stood a man looking a little scary. The boys dropped milk bottles. Now break. The black suit man gives him money instead of milk. The options with what this scenario is happening in the home. A black cat flew to escape the fire and enters the apartment. He (?) Invented the fish bowl and watch it. The fish swims fiercely and flips out the bowl. Until now, some of my classmates love the fish. The cat takes fish in his mouth and we all keep our breathing. The cat throws the bowl into the fish. The double story line includes black and suspicious black cats suspected people. Both prejudiced views. Both are innocent It was a great discussion starter in my class.
