"Homework Band: The Incredible Journey" is one of those wonderful old movies about the House Pets. Together with films like "Old Yeller", "Napoleon", "Fluke" and "Airbuddy", they claim to have a great film and a place among even ordinary movies. This means that it is more than just a pet about a pet. <br /> <br /> Could it possibly be "remix"? This is a "remake" very good! I know this by my heart, my first two years (when I was 12 years old). <br /> <br /> This is a family movie famous. It's emotional, exciting, adventurous, exciting, entertaining, ridiculous, charming, sweet, nostalgic, beautiful, hearty and sometimes dramatic. One of those movies who appreciate such movies, make a smile on their faces. <br /> <br /> There is no lack of attribute qualities in this movie. This is a good thought story, enjoyable characters, fantastic and relaxing mechanical soundtracks, fantastic Sierra Mountains (in Oregon) have fantastic sceneries / landscapes. Speaking of Vistas, it is not all mountains: forests, trees, rivers, waterfalls, sunset ... conclusions, the wonders of all the pure nature - really a full panorama. <br /> <br /> The main human characters are excellent, well-developed and portrayed by good actor. Robert Hedge is a kind-hearted father, Bob Savar. Kim Greyhart Laura is just as good as Barnford. Veronica Lauren is equally good as expected. Kevin Chevalia is like the greatest and intelligent brother of Jamie (his face actually reminds me of Kevin Karko in "Old Yeller"). Benz thong is as great as Peter Bernford. <br /> <br /> When our queens come to friends, Shadow is my favorite. Shadow loyal, intelligent, mature, beautiful, caring and loving old Golden Proverb (spoken by great ameche). Chances are, American bulldog, shadow reverse. He is indifferent, stupid, indifferent, anxious, tired, ridiculous and loves to play (voiced by gifted Michael J. Fox). The possibility can not stand still The title of the picture of Sassy Cats: Elegant, independent, very confident and self-proud, with the attitude of a common cat, but with the attraction of a particular cat. Sassi is a seal point of the Himalayas cat, one of the most beautiful cat species. Sassie Field, Sally Field, who works well, is voiced by him. <br /> <br /> Our four eccentric friends, by nature itself, are the great "actors": Shadow as Benn, Ratler and Tasi as Sassie. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie, but it's a personal designation. Its continuity is clearly inferior. <br /> <br /> It should certainly be in the top 250.
