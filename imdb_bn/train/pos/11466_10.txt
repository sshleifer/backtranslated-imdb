I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night. This is an amazing movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The shot completley's with camcorders It's about 2 kids. Just your average kids Andrea and Calvin. They started a campaign against high schools, titled "Army 2". <br /> <br /> The entire story is called on the video's diary form, from 2 kids. It shows relationships with parents there, among other people, shows that this is just like normal kids, as we know or those who are Bengali. We know that the last mission of 2 people will be Zero Day. They plan to shoot high school there. <br /> <br /> How can you get access to guns, how they plan, everything. They insist that the media did not harm them, and there is no reason to do this. As I said, the video diary form is called it and then they save the tape in a safety deposit box that is seen after Zero Day. <br /> <br /> The actual shooting is shown through surveillance cameras across the school. Really cheering The movie is very cool. Some things they say, how they plan it, you just have to see it for yourself. I think that a quote is the only time Calvin himself. She said, "Andrey thinks he will leave some gait cars, going to many schools all over the country, I do not know what he is thinking, but the only way to go to school is the black plastic bag." <br /> <br /> <br / > I said, I do not even try to give the correct idea of ​​this picture. You really need to see it yourself It's almost running the festival now. <br /> <br /> A +.
