A true situation comedy in every sense of human words about the house. The comedy is concerned about a character known as Robin Tripp (who played by the great Richard and Sullivan) who has found herself after the wild party, and Joe and Christie are in two female homes. Wickedly the party is held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These two characters will actually begin to be litchuchins of people in the house with Milldaler (late and many misi Utiya jaises), especially getting some of the best lines in the series. Larry (Doug Fischer), a semi-regular character, was a vain person who was always in the Scrooge and only when he wanted to hold something round. (<br /> <br /> <br /> One version called three companies but it did not stand a chance compared to the funnier origin. Thames risked creating a condom that a man shares flat with 2 women with very conservative time But they should think that at that time ratings wanted to see an old fashion bit comedy with 20 million people. Inspiring Casting and a sharp screen Pt. No sad modern comedy can reach that high quality. <br /> <br /> This program is available on network DVD
