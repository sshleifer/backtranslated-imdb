Claire Dennis' debut is both a brave and confident one. At the end of the French colonial-era Cameron, he discovered the relationship between man and woman, black and white relations, in this screenplay of life. <br /> <br /> As the original intention and persecution of the film with the black slave, the film enters the forbidden region from the beginning. Dennis's character creates a picture of life through a series of relationships that keeps the viewer's screen fixed. Photo mood is completely captured by camera-work and lack of (light). <br /> <br /> A great lecture.
