The word 'classic' is thrown very loosely nowadays, but this movie is suitable for propulsion. Neil Simon's combination, Walter Matthew (probably the world's best living comic actor), and eventually George Burns played a comedy. It is very interesting to consider how Jack Benike could not stop planning from planning a 'part' of pastor Bars, but how the film could have died. As the reconciliation scene in Maitu's apartment can not be crossed as side-effects. Definitely a movie on my desert island. <br /> <br /> "Enter !!!!!!!!!"
