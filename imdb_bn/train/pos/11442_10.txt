<br /> <br /> So, I'm not a poet, I have no way of expressing the beauty and simplicity of this documentary. The traditional pace of Goldsworthy, she is captivating as beauty natures molds in her own work. See the stick sticking to him on a web hanging from a tree for a few minutes while talking about his work, and then pay the camera if it races in wide shots. Surprised by the work he has done, and after a little wind pushing the whole web down, realize the atrocity. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Full of rounds, is full.
