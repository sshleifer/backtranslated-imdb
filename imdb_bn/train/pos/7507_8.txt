Again greetings from darkness. Mary Heron provides a glimpse into their particular era, which is collecting lists of most movies. When his previous "I Shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho" was the best of his time, he commented on society's curiosity over time. Although the "infamous BAT pages" are obviously about miss pages, it's a great deal in the 50's behind the screen behind the curious photo shoots. <br /> <br /> From the point of view of both the funniest stories to watch the film and how it was portrayed and put together in its technological stand. Danny B & W films and photos have been introduced for a while and Boney Jaeger's photo introduces the color of Miami Beach. Very well David Stratharen (his Edward and Fresh), Chris Bauer (as Erring Clo) and Lily Taylor The photo star is a wonderful talented and intrinsically and underworked Gretchen Mol. Miss Mole always brings an edge and spirit to her role. In 2000, Jason Alexander was "gentle linking" and he was very mild. Here he is notorious Betty Page Her smile is impressive and her body is flawless. She really feels that this role is enjoyable and helps us to understand that the next girl from Tennessee could be an underworld pin-up queen. <br /> <br /> As anyone would expect, the soundtrack of the era is horrific. Patisserie Clayne and Peggy Lee featured only two. Although this film refers to the history of this art, the final third type of pure film flashes to prevent magic. But the magic of Gretchen Mole and Betty Page creates a fun movie, and it is such that in the near future HBO will provide an endless rally. Will anybody miss Mrs Mole now, his star?
