This is my second time for a Perfect Spy. I saw it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it. I still like it. It is natural that it is compared to Beeb's other big Le Carre series, Tinker Tailor soldier spy. Tinker Tailor "game" focus on spy game; Perfect Spy gives us another axis - what is the type of spy person? <br /> <br /> stagnation - moral, sexual, interpersonal - which creates a versatile versus true, within these inner intrinsic sections. Love versus duty In this case, these characters are most happy when they are treated with the most love of them and treat them with respect - in various trends of "backstabed" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. One of the most fascinating characters of Perfect Spy is Rick, the main character Magnus' Probably the father of ersatz. Through the story he betrays and betrays. A barbarian who always leads to climb up the stairs while walking on the stairs, which seems irrelevant to others, when he meets Magnus, every time he meets, "Do you love your old man?" And never, "Do you love me?" Maybe it's called elsewhere, but a Perfect Spy is a love story <br /> <br /> Another theme is fatality. Turn the nature of business into something else - turn them against their government, their friends, and partners, turn them against their values ​​and beliefs. I have seen in all of Lee Carr's films, The Spy kissing in from the cold, Glass wiring, Tinker teller solar spy, Smiley People's, and a Perfect Spy, Turning and Turning The basis of the tragedy. Finally, there is not such a theme as artistic touch - in each of these movies, usually a single song shot, or perhaps two shots of the story bookings. Violence, torture, cruelty is always at the bottom of the surface We do not see their results as Blood stream or Dunk Prison Cell, but keep Lee Carrar's characters in such a way that they have rushed unreasonably in the season. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the above picture, and you enjoy a perfect spy, you are in for a treat. I would recommend Sandbagara Series (Yorkshire TV), the second and third seasons that started to reach the level of such complexity. The Berlin IPCRESS file and the Burial are beautiful, although the light weight. A very British coup for the political conspiracy, the House of the Card and yes, the Minister / Yes, the Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If only a British handpicked three Kingdoms - there would be a film about plot and complexity.
