Love is the first film is a difficult issue firmly convinced: all the emotions are usually a pale imitation or worse, as a little ridiculous ends. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The deepest of human existence Themes sparsakatarabhabe love to touch things, the story is an ongoing disaster and the possible release Provides sexy, thoroughly exposed stories. /> <br /> The story of 18-year-old mathiu <br, who is the son of intermediate sidrika, bryasara, more outgoing, but as lonely, meets with his family holiday. As summer is in abortion, they fall in love and when the holidays end, they decide to live together. One year later, the relationship ended in disaster: Matthew's cedric fraud, who is disturbed, tried to take his own life. He survived and returned to the sea shore in order to get his life back, where he first met, this time it looked cold in winter. <br /> <br /> If this story was to be said this way, its effect never happens: Most of it is indicated, it happens all non-sequentially. <br /> <br /> The complex description is essential for achieving a deep feeling of experience by using fraud. Temporal view Thankfully, the period used (in the summer of love, suicide, mental hospitals and rebuild the winter) color-coded: orange for the summer and warm Yale, and the warmth of the scene to the hospital for badamidera almost horribly blue, blue, and for the winter beach blues. /> <br /> performance is excellent in both the main actors <br However, Steven Rideau (Cedric) is a joy to use its full powers (that is, I used to see him instead of morala lascivious plays Gale in the stretch), Jeremy elakima (Matthew) For specifications, you have to go out alone: ​​You can feel his loneliness, then his extraordinary passion, his character falls behind Afsia wall. . Beautiful gestures can sometimes get more than just conversations. <br /> <br /> The themes touched in French movies are often classic: one of our feelings is really difficult to understand; Completely communicating our problems; Money transfer sandands ?? চলচ্চিত্রের শিরোনাম "প্রিসক রেইয়ান" (অ্যালমোস্ট নেশিং) এই সব ছবিতে এবং প্রকৃতপক্ষে, চলচ্চিত্রের একটি কী দৃশ্যের দিকে নির্দেশ করে: বুঝতে পেরেছিলেন কেন মথিউ নিজেকে হত্যা করার চেষ্টা করেছিলেন, একজন মনোরোগ বিশেষজ্ঞ সেড্রিককে জিজ্ঞেস করেছিলেন যে সে যদি কখনও প্রতারিত হয় তার উপর?? "No ?? enfin, oui ?? une fois, mais ce n'était rien" (not ?? well, yes ??, but it was nothing). Cedric still loves Mathieu ?? During her suicide attempt, she brought her to the hospital (in which we do not see anything), and she tries hard to contact her once she leaves ?? But he does not realize that he has lost her forever, because something that she could not remember anything (meaningless) is everything in Matthew. <br /> <br /> The picture is rather dark than the unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster. It is not without hope: We see Sidr's slow, painful efforts to communicate with the cat of life first, through a cat, for the first time, then working in the local bar and ultimately contacting Pierre, that may be his next love. . But here the story ends: A teenage passion, in the year, is probably another start. So what was it? Almost nothing? Definitely when you are living ??
