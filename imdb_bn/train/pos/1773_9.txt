Obstacles seems to be one of the mechanisms that match the time. After it's transmission and one iterative in the early 80's, it is shrunk without trace. It's a cry of shame. <br /> <br /> I was sent to Southern TV region on Sunday afternoon and saw it mainly during watching the classic tea-time. Although I do not think of a big deal about the program, I feel trapped in my mind. The most notable was the unforgettable title. Along with the protection of the carrot musical across an Eastern European border and on the next car crash (and that scene has permanently thrown me on 'Finchille' Mercedes models as they used Merc 200). Though it was not at the beginning, it was in this title that the series's mystery was solved. <br /> <br /> <br /> A young music student tried to discover the story of the plot when he discovered how he was accepted. A lot of twists and turn but the barracks were a wonderful 'adult' kids drama. Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame that he did not do much. <br /> <br /> This is a quality drama, completely delayed for DVD releases and I hope I can get the chance to contact me again in the future. <br /> <br /> A tender memory from my childhood
