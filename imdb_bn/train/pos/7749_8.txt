This movie is off to your feet. Tom Barman (known from the Belgian rock band Dus), this first film introduces you with 8 interesting people, creating a compelling movie Mosaic block. They live in Antwerp's metropolis for one day and one night. Barman has grabbed his characters with a lot of poses and skillfully combined their personal stories, a tour that reminds Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson of the best work. Stylish surprises, moves, amuses patchwork; Dialogue is so normal, they seem to be improvised. Two very interesting producers of Matthias Schovannert, Natalie Bruds and Grant, Jonas Boole and Titas De Vogdt. Sam Louwyck's memorable "Windman", a wicked folk dance across the movie. Sam is also responsible for extremely stunning dance forms, and of course Tom Barman has taken care of his extremely cool soundtrack. We were seriously influenced by: Any Way the Wind Blues is a movie that strikes you on your feet.
