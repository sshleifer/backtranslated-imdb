This Oscars-winning film, which was released two years ago, was in the theater - costumes, costly cinematography, superb wall-to-wall Gershwin music, high dancerography, a light-to-air screenplay and great performance kelly, levent, folk , Gatori, and Cause. Hollywood is no longer like this. Surely, this is always my favorite movie, a quality through which I judge all other movies. Rejoice, have fun, enjoy!
