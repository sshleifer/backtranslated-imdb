These pictures were pretty amazed. I did not expect much, to be honest. Gray Garbo's first Hollywood picture? So what? Probably some rough and normal exaggerated arm-weaving and miscarriage which is often seen in low-grade silent films. <br /> <br /> Well, I was wrong. Greater than the people in the Grey Garbo studio, because this picture has made her a star, and so deserve. He naturally understands the burden of still standing power, or simply holds a meaningful expression for a long, lasting moment so that its effects can be felt and not seen only. I started thinking of myself, how did this modern actress enter a sticky silent film? She was years and years before her time. <br /> <br /> The story is not interesting, it gets the usual story of love and is lost. It is Garbo's only acting as a lynner, daughter of poor village who makes well in the big city and then brings back the person who has gone, which gives life. Co-star Ricardo Cortez is beneficial, but his character has never been developed and he is courted by the script. At one point, he had to wear garbo clothes, leave a huff, then he came back to despair and returned them. And I do not even talk about Garo and his wife about his terrible final scene. In general, after that there was not much of the career and I understand why. But he is as good a few mysterious objects as Leonorar's emotion. <br /> <br /> This picture has a completely extraordinary line, which is just what it says. "Leonora, you are becoming clear." Yes, really clear. <br /> <br /> If you really want to know what it does not see the whole picture, but look like the last 30 seconds - look at Garbo's eyes as he is sitting alone in his luxurious car. Everything "She can be so happy, she has everything she wants" - Yes, Garbo's face tells about it. I will see this again, Garbo is just amazing.
