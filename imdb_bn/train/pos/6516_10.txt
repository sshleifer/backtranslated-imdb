Hello I saw this movie in 14 days for 14 days today. I am a history teacher who has a lot of time in my hand. I need a life I found the movie containing an interesting similar to broken mountains back. I can see a lot of gene jump if she is white. Also, my favorite line in the movie was Mr. Petty - "This baby can shoot the chipmun from 300 yards !!" Oh, my favorite scene in this movie was when the British came, and a drummer who was so devoted to his work and until he died drum, that the drum war would be completely eliminated .... it would not be. Well, I want to tell about this movie. Oh, another thing .. Bony Brown Beatouch Swinging is an insane fizco bi-graduate mood. All that
