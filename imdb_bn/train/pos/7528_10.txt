If this movie reduces you (like us and, apparently, the theater leaves), it is also thin, frustrating, because it is extremely frustrating. The film has faithfully presented us the Beti page as it was possibly: a rural rural playful almost innocent, whose career was as "Pinch Queen of the universe", it's just fools, natural fun His last moral eligibility, religious conversion and sudden exit from modeling of nude and slavery are still accurate, and it is still difficult to understand how uncertain his life was. <br /> <br /> There are so many reasons to see this image, of which at least Waste Matt Hapfel III (Winner with Old Fashioned Wipes and dissolves), Wonderful B & W Noir Cinematography, Cast Trust's Faithful Action, 1st of May 1950, Some of us Chris Bauer, Lily Taylor, Sarah Paulson, Austin Pendleton, Dallas Roberts and Most Believing Supporter Actor, Grecheren Mole's Oscar Eligible and Technically Harder Lead Not to mention referrals. <br /> <br />. Mol maintains the unstudied pleasure of the underwear underwear and "specialty" costume (garnished by jewelery costume designer John A. Right), most of the scenes are completely nude and still others, her wonderfully unstudied pleasure of her crap body Betty Page. To see Mrs. Page like Mrs. Page, an aspiring actress, growing "low" audition and progressing through student degree sequences, is a real actress in her full control of her imagination. <br /> <br /> The script effectively brings us to the United States of America in 1950, where childhood sexual abuse, abduction and rape, and legal suppression of pornography brands that seem ridiculous today is a fact. 50's New York Symplesley-Inter-Kat News Reel is distorted with footage. Miami's Super-Satisfied, living in 16mm-style colors. The original Bettie page seems to scamper, smile and pose before us, and still the effect is weirdly light weight, rarely lewd and not all dangerous. <br /> <br /> How strange that slavery's greatest icon should have such a lack of poison, and this technically excellent biopic should have a little sting.
