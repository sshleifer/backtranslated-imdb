Based on her true story about Australian woman Linde Chamberlain (Merrill Strip), an interesting movie, accused of murdering her baby girl. He stressed that a dingo took his child, but the story is very suspicious. The film is actually about media surveys, which happened about the incident, explains what was presented in the media, and the launch mob mentality that ultimately led to the woman's determination on the basis of strong evidence. I like movies which question the media, and keep a strict vigil over how the films are run by the judicial system. I've always thought duties should be shown to 12 Angry men before the jurors go with their duties. As it is often said, it is a liberal film, but how we explain the incident based on the desire of revenge and revenge on our ancestors as a human, its a clinical form. Darkening is a kind of action clinical. Schepisi is careful not to make film at all melodramatic. Someone might find the image boring or dry, but I found it fascinating.
