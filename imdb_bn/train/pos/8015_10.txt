I first saw this movie in the theater at the age of 8 and it still cracks me. Muppets are so cool and they show business contacts in a refreshingly naive way. My favorite scene when the rat started a cheerful campaign from Kimmitt on an innovative restaurant. This is a smart and fun movie for kids and parents alike. Long Live Kimmit, Miss Piggy, and the rest of the gang.
