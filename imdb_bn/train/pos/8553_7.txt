I just saw the movie, I was scared, it would disappoint me. I was rather surprised at the end. American Pie franchise is still my favorite franchise movie all the time. Yes, if I say that I enjoyed it as a mush, it would not be true because I enjoyed the original. The beta room was clearly lost with the previous two pieces, which were the first two pi. It will not become classic to become the first class. But it's a wonderful thing - I still have fun with a lot of good moments and I think it's fun if you like to work and relax after a hard day or at school, but it should be the first movie. Beta House is suitable for 6/10 but I gave it 7/10 to be another part of PIE.
