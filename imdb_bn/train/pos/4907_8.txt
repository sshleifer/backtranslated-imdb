A disciplined and fantastic product, refreshingly free from the clich√©, this little Piccassek story is a friendly story that describes a child less than a model and a development between the boy: a person who is a fledged criminal who kidnapped a young man for him as a hostage . Directed by a fine-sense for balanced narrative movement directed by Alan Gibson, the film provides almost all the scenes as Martin Stenchart (Richard Harris), believing that his refusal to parole was particularly inadequate, a cunning but ultimately successful escape plan, his spontaneous Nature flees at her childhood leakyide residence Isabe comes to its spontaneous nature. Often the song or step-by-step step by step gradually gets its prisoners' trust and affection and when the police are closed for the inevitable procession, the pair is almost the same as the response to their forms. Rejected, such as psychologist (Lindsay Wagner) was appointed to assist a strong police lieutenant (James Coburn), who was in charge of Stankart and his "captive" manhunt. A speeding up to profit from Harris's capital performance and the courage of the novel, this is a wonderful story, which becomes valuable to Justin Henry with Justin Henry with an instant score. Contributed by Wilfred Joseph, and Frank Watts's top film painter, shot all footage in a beautiful autumn of Ontario province.
