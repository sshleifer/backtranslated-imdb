These enjoyable minor silent casts a top, and boasts many memorable scenes. Full neglect for authentic signs of big distraction. The Spanish characters of the film are played by a French (Belgian), Belgian (Francis), a Greek (Packenino) and Hungarian (Lore). And keep it at the top of all Bacall is supposed to be an English aristocrat! Despite these absurdities, performance is all very well - especially those of Paxinou and Lorre. But the scene that meets the boy, the Paxino and the Lor, and speaks different languages, that's really real! And I guess how they were alone, they are actually speaking Spanish! Spanish-speaking actor Actor Brothers Warner was not found in Los Angeles. Of course, Hollywood often had the "no older pronunciation" policy - my other favorite Greta Garbo (Swedish) mother known as Hari (Dutch), who fell in love with the Russian soldier run by the Mexican (Ramon Novaro). Maybe they'll get Novro for "secret agent" - he was a great player, or at least Frances (who could live up to the dark make-up budget).
