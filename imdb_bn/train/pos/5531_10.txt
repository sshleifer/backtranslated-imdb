Viewing "Fox and the Child" was a drunken experience. The impressive visual, point of view, and the complete beauty of the setting and the characters left me happy. <br /> <br /> This plot is impossible. Deceptively easy In the simplicity holder a world unfolds that you draw and leave you breathing. <br /> <br /> I smile. I started crying. I learned <br /> <br /> <br /> You can trust this movie yourself - leave yourself alone. Courage I say it is a work of love intended for innocent heart purpose. It can reach the heart of the audience - any age - and reveals the world with new eyes, as seen from the heart. The peer-to-view communion once said that the view of the true art exceeds the viewpoint between the ecstatic participation in reality. I think I've got the privilege to visit - no, to participate - this film is a work of the true art.
