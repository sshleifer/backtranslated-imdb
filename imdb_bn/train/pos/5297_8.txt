I went to see this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. The place was quite packed and we all laughed so much that it was easy to miss the line. I knew it looked like it would have been better but it was much fun than it would have been. I liked both Edward Farlong and Christina Ricchi, they thought it was really weird like normal people, if they are understandable. I get sick of movies that look like dogs to dogs, like "joke" or "gaik" or "cheerleader" ... and so on. Both characters were unique but still very human and were related to normal enough. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and are very eagerly waiting to come out of the DVD, go see this movie with your friends who can laugh at the most interesting parts of life! I plan to see it again in the theater and I do not see many things at once.
