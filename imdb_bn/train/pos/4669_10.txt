In comparison to Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith, two more impressive performers came together in one more concise film in 1968, I do not know who they are. At the age of 25, I saw this delightful little cat ray, and in any year I saw that it failed to sit again to see a humiliated person. It's cute, quirky, handsome, sharp, sweet, quiet, and fully enchanting. Both of these two social errors are romantically running and terrifying - Maggie Smith's deck is not much more than a failure to bring the right card, which is the perfect thumbnail portrait of both fun and funny loneliness. And as Ustinov's final, frozen frozen frame of concern, anxious, he asked, "Are you okay?" - Has anyone ever made the words and words of the character of the character so cruel and honest? I do not want to know anyone who does not love this movie.
