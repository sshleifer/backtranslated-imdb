Che: Part One was an impressive test, which could not just tell a very funny story, but it tried to do something different from the "biodiversity" genre. That is: The second part of this section is a wonderful test. <br /> <br /> This film shows the same characteristics from the beginning, except for forgetting the great performance of Steven SÃ¶nderberg (especially from Bensio del Toro), his desire to break the conventional rules from biophysics. What I like from sodger test ... They always try to do something different and unusual, and they are mostly successful. <br /> <br /> The final message on this photo is perfect, and in this we have been told about the life of Che Guevara. I just failed in the chaiti: part two is felt in some parts irrelevant. At the summers, I can say: Part two is an extremely encouraging recommendation because, as the first one, it is a brave and interesting experience that challenges the viewer and thinks of us.
