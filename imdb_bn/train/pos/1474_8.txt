I saw this photo at the Toronto International Film Festival. As soon as it can not be heard, it is a three-part documentary (50 minutes in each episode) that coordinates the Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychologist Slavaz Jijek. Jijek invented the themes of our classicality, imagination, morality and mortality, traveling through many classic movies. It is directed by Sophie Phoenix of many genius Phineas dynasties (she's actor Ralph and her sister of Joseph). <br /> <br /> I enjoyed it quite, though I think it will be more enjoyable in the DVD. , Because the idea of ​​digestion is such a stew. The Freudian and Lacanian analyzes can be quite heavy and if the whole series is seen then the Creator may end up about one and a half hours. It does not help me in the last hour or some discomfort for me to occupy the possession of a sick counselor and a bladder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He spent quite a bit of time in the films of Hitakoos and David Lynch, not just the skill makers. I used to like him trying to support his theory using a lot of big films, although it is really telling me that I want to see four and five and six parts. <br /> <br /> Zizak is very funny, and the part of the humor saw that he gave some lectures when he was inserting himself into the actual scenes of some of his films. For example, we saw him at the motorbike sitting at the foundation of Badega Bay (from the birds of Hitkoch) or Bates Motore (from Bezo). Which is not provoking his theory. Even when I disagreed with it, it certainly forced me to think a little deeper into films. That's exactly what he's trying to achieve.
