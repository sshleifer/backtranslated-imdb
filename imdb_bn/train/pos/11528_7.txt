When I saw the red lady, I did not feel in mind. True, despite its foundation in a true story, its screen play is stupid and unbelievable. The picture is throwing real talent. A sum of 30 and 40's best supporting players is always a wonderful, spectacular performance of the intimate Mary Hopkins' fine, intelligent work, and the Cloud Renaissance, which is naturally the best thing to do. What actors! She never won an Oscar, but she is in the company of Chaplin, Garbo and Hitchcock. Perhaps red hair lady has her best work in the film. See it and enjoy it. <br /> <br />
