I acknowledge that I have seen one of Shakespeare's plays (Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and of course Hamlet), the other I found (Macbeth), and Hamlet I just got a wonderful work. I'm glad to tell you that this adaptation is intense and dramatic as well as every bit of the game. How can you overcome the power of acting extremely strong (with a cast of Kenneth Branagh, Robin Williams and Billy Crystal?) And play a nice way to change the characters (seems anywhere between 17 and 1800) between the periods and tell their infamous lines directly from the script that You will get cold from any fan of Shakespeare's play. If you are in this popular drama, then I would request you to see this strong 1996 adaptation of Shakespearean supporter Kenneth Brangh.
