This was the first regular episode of the Colombo movie episode, but it was promoted as the second after Steven Spielberg's "Columbo: Book Marred" book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is no surprise that they later asked him to manage more than three Colombo movies. The film has some real creative and innovative shot sequences, and the film is completely designed for style, passion and eye. Each shot connects and why this movie is even better and better than any other movie made for TV movie This is certainly one of the better instructions for the Colombo film. <br /> <br /> This is the real exit of Colombo for some reasons. The murder was less or accident and it was an emotional work. Therefore, the killer does not have time to plan 'perfect kill' during this time and later he has to remove any trace and settle the body. The killer of this movie is not only executed as a criminal, but he is also being assisted by Lieutenant Colombo as a helper to solve the assassination. It makes the character more attractive and layered and helps Colombo to enjoy the way it feels more attractive to crime. Of course, Colombo starts to suspect him very quickly and always resolves to weaken himself, and in fact he is more foolish than him and earns the assassination of the murderer. This is probably no spoiler because this is the way to setup the Columbo movie. I like the story of the movie and how it progressed. <br /> <br /> This movie also helps for such a great cast. During this film, Peter Folk made his own role in the Columbo character, and the character was fully developed. Robert Culp is really great as a short tempered brimmer. The interesting thing is that he will again play again in three different Colombo movies and only the "Mrs. Colombo" episode will play a completely different role. He again starred Khunie in those few movies. On the other hand, it was not the only actor in the Colombo film. Ray Ray Milland also showed a picture in the film, as he is a victim's husband. <br /> <br /> Finally, the first real movies and movies of the Colombo film are better than the long running series <br /> <br /> 9/10
