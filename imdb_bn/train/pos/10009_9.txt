When I first read the story of Arismid Muppin, then I was accepted by Gabriel in a human drama and which was worried and loved by him. It is said that now we have got a very good movie version of the story and expected to see the Hollywood glasses past ... <br /> <br /> Writer Armsed Mupin and director Patrick Stetsner have really been successful! <br /> <br /> Only correct amount of restraint Robin Williams captures Gabriel's harmful element and sees his career life (Jess) and his world around him struggling with the issues of faith. <br /> <br /> We introduced to the playwright that we think that such a thing does not seem to be so and the smallest event can change our life in a rational way. Requesting a book written by a young man changes a life that helps Gabrielle find strength in himself and move forward. <br /> <br /> It is bad that most people avoid this movie. I simply say that the average American probably thinks Robin Williams a serious role? " It did not work before! Please give this movie an opportunity! Robin Williams can touch us to find us all and go among ourselves to be good people. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I wonder what Bobby Kanebhal believes in, stealing every scene of Jesse. The leading people of 1940 shows and the appearance of the screen. Now he can take his own movie! <br /> <br />
