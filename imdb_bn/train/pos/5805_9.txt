(There is not a lot in the way of Spoilers, because there is no plot to publish, but still, I guess there is something happening that explains ...) That's it. This is the most nunny film I have ever seen. There is no sound to describe this movie, though "wicked" "ridiculous" and "ego travel" are quite nearby. In the opening half hour or so, in reality, weird music videos, with absolutely no conspiracy or continuity, except for the MJ, read something from the east. This is a highlight of this section of "Film" of this section where MJ flies a meritorious-round-round flight, which is considered semi-intelligent bond probofel and sections are cut from yellow submarine (Dear Lord you can not make this up) <br /> <br /> <br /> With an hour left, "film" starts, many soils (some of it really vague) mark our "hero" and find him Chane an autograph. Obviously, it gets us somewhat worried about the silent (without songs) and they temporarily manage to lose them. Fortunately for him, because of the means that he witnessed a falling star and again, I did not make it up, turned into a claymation rabbit. He used to try and trick their past using this amazing camouflage, but, for reasons I can not remember now, they see it (oh no!) And unclear chase is starting again. Another song (big shock there). <br /> <br /> Shortly after retreat, MJ brings the rabbit into life, until he is a policeman (in the middle of the desert) because it is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another good moment is MJ, seeing Mr. Big (Joe "what happened in his career at this time?" Pacey) he kidnapped a child with friends, sorcerers created Tommy's guns, and at the other moment of violence that pepper randomly appeared in this film, The fire that opened on fire. A final moment I'll mention when MJ, Mr. Big and surrounded by his personal army. Seriously, this guy is working for him a few dozen people, and they decked out more like the commando unit than the mobsters, which I guess they have. How did he find it? Why, he turned into a robot, complete with arms and shield. This is the third of the four transitions, often when it is in a corner and / or driven. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite intriguing, a little bit on the plot path, and virtually no continuity.
