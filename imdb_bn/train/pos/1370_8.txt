When I saw this year ago it came out first and I was floored by Parker Posey's performance. And the movie was quite good. Anyone who spends a little more time in the Nightclubs / Later hours, this film will be a special attraction for you. Not too deadly, most funny, and Parker Pozzy definitely illuminated his gifted way through this indie wax. <br /> <br /> I especially liked Diaz's character (I reminded me of DJ in any struggle). And this movie can take a cue on how other films can take care of bothersome and stupid responsibilities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Baboon!
