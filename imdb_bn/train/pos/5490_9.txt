This is really an incredible film. It not only records the rights of an independent and authoritarian document, but it also shows the United States its barbaric report for its disrespect, damage, and human rights and self-determination. Chavez is shown as a very brave and powerful leader who can be identified as cruel aristocracy without any feeling of justice or justice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is heartening to see that the demise of democracy we are seeing is a tool used for long time by the ordinary American government and their seemingly burning citizens. This footage makes it clear that it is not a TV or generic footage manipulation, but an active documentation and fighting for its future. With a conscience a really moving experience for. These Irish filmmakers deserve our gratitude. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the first stage of this process is the reality of the situation Need to know and this documentary only works a great way to do this.
