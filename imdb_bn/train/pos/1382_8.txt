This excellent first feature is not called everything from Selain Sayamama. Friendship, "fit", first sexual feeling ... all these and many more are superior to the sea water's scenery swimming scenes. <br /> <br /> Trying to find three women in the movie, expressing their personality in a very different way. It is a less aggressive approach to understanding teenage years than "thirteen", but a very good journey immediately. <br /> <br /> One should definitely see, and leave all the American cinematographers aside from the ideas that he is in the door. Soundtrack via A +. <br /> <br /> Forest Cinamo!
