Common comedy of 90, our modern day "My Family" is similar to the situational comedy. Thatcher's highest political trick height, Bill (Belinda Lanna) blames Thatcher for doing anything. "Bloody Thatcher" probably shared with most of us. David is usually a teenager, cutting the brain with a bread knife, Jenny, Moody's elderly teenage children, only boys and more boys. Bill and Ben, as soon as they can work their families financially in the climate struggle at the beginning of the 90's. The first two series was not as successful as the next, after series 3 it kicks off with all that more laughs that I care to multiply. Overall this show does not get the best viewing time and they should hold it a bit longer. After the death of Gary Olson, they could not bear clearly, but I think they will be released from "Catherine Tate" "Office" "Little Britain" and bring classic back!
