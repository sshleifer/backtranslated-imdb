This movie is not about entertainment, not a movie that you do not want to see the time. This movie is truly real display of love which can only come from God. No one can help, but you can touch this movie deeply. There are different levels of love that contribute to the quality of this film. God has divine love that is beautifully portrayed. God's love extends to heart and mind and is eternal and eternal. There is love in marriage. Though the main character is involved in the disease of his wife, he realizes through God's love that he loves his wife more than he can imagine. He knows that he and his wife can not be separated and never separated. Finally, there are your child and parents' love. Family kids come together and realize that love is something other than love. Dear friends, Love is not love unless it comes from God, because God is love and love comes from God. Talk to someone and tell them you love them. If love is not given to any other, good if not. I can inspire this movie and change the life of everyone who see it. Amen !!
