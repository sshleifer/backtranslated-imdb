There are four stories written by Robert Bloc who live in beautiful houses, old palaces and what happens to them. The first one sees Daniel Eliot as a novelist who sees the killer who came to life. Finally some wonderful moments and twists were good. The second is becoming obsessed with a wax figure similar to Peter Cushing to his dead wife. The third is Christopher Lee, who has a child (Clo Francs) and scared of him. It all leads to a fantastic scary end (even though the end of the story was much worse). The last is John Petui and the Ingrid Pitt (both of the visible chin) and a cape that transforms the people into Vampire, an out and out comedy! There is also a clever line about Christopher Lee's Dracula game. <br /> <br /> This is a good horror instrument - nothing terrible, the first one and the third after the end has given me some cool little cool. Also the fourth one is actually very funny and makes Pitt a very sexy vampire! Also the house itself is beautiful ... and very surprised. It is well guided with some beautiful atmospheric touches. Score a very good and unusual movie too. All good looking values ​​are a good little awful math. Try to watch it DVD - The Lion Gate looks superb with strong colors and great words.
