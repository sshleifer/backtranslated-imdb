I'm overwhelmed! The story is amazing and the show is very addictive, but I love it. I'm in Season 2, Disk 5, and I tell you that I'm very attached to characters now. Impact my vote for the show seriously because of some bad events for them. And, Michael is on my list now. Having fun ... I'm very happy to see season 3, because I was very scared to go to Disc 6 because I was thinking it would end. I can not wait to see the rest now. Thanks to the director / producer / and the lost actors ... I again enjoy watching TV. Before going missing, I am going to sleep through sadness due to my frustration on TV, but I should say that my entertainment is lost!
