If you do not meet this unclear little trick, you will seek it. This is an explosion, the story of the Warring Saad Sack (Fred McMurray), which is listed every 4 when he tries to join a branch of the military. He got a witch lamp that contained a gene (Gene Sheldon), but the jin is more flashy than the Macmoor, sending it repeatedly to serve it at times more difficult than he wants. It's tricky, delightful, and pure fluff, and you can not but like it. Plots are similar to a Disney movie, especially two stars (McMurver and Sheldon) have made numerous Disney films in the 50's and 60's, although not all together. Not saying, it ends up well for everyone, and the viewers are feeling very well.
