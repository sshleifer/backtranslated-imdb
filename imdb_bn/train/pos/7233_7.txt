I have not read all the comments, but at least one poster mentions that the 30-minute version may possibly be narrower. I am passionate about myself because I did not have much knowledge about the next part of the film when I gave them back. 30 minutes in 1917 seems too small for the film. "Puri Little Rich Girl", which was 65 minutes long after the Turunur film and "The Pride of the Clan", which was 84 minutes long before her. So I can see that I'm not crazy, this part of the film will be absent and therefore the resolution has not gained much knowledge. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to review or comment on movies that you can only see in half ... but I would really recommend this movie because it is a really interesting perspective that it provides insight into our eastern coast film studio. This is the first film I personally saw based on the film industry. The original character is a film star directed by Robert Warwick, who was subsequently Hollywood character actor and was present in almost all Preston Sturg√©s films. He is probably the model of Western actor William S. Hart, which is somewhat similar to Warwick. After a really interesting series player in the studio, we saw one of their position shoots, where he invented the daughter of a country (Doris Kenyon) and New Jersey for a screen test that seems to be very weak. After this point the movie seems to be missing the big pieces in our form now. <br /> <br /> Again, I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in film history for documentary quality, but as a form we do not keep it as much of a movie and Mauris is a special example of Tourneur's work.
