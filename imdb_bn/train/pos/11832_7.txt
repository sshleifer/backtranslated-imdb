Time for a rant, eh: I thought there was a great movie to see the soul. However, there were some things that prevented me from rating of more than 6 or 7 (I was a bit lenient with 7) <br /> # Points # 1: Matt Damon excited me. I was thinking, 'Did they get the diskie voice for the main character,' when I first heard him listen - and then I realized it was Matt Damon. The guy made me very bad - his performance in "The Department" was terrible and spoiled the movie for me (the film had the opportunity to destroy itself, but it was another story for another time), it is almost "soul". <br /> <br /> Point # 2: Brian Adams sucked ... The whole score was terrible ... the song was unoriginal, generic, and poor executioner; I never found the music; And the song was terrible, every time I heard a song from a wax song, I almost stopped thinking that I was leaking some patriotic campaigns in super American style of freedom (I can not help but after 9/11, that terrible patriotism on the radio continuously In the light of the Native American aspects of the film, they could have the right instrument Using fitting music, I will go with a little radio-hit, tin-boop, 14-year-old girl shit, I thought I was back to junior high school. I can not believe that no work was done - I Deny It was not for this, I would give Disney more medals, which know one or two things about the originality (okay, do not bother what I know). Very bad, it's embarrassing that they could not hire good musicians. <br /> <br /> I've liked the art and animation except for some things here ... Sometimes the corners are looking very sharp and the lines are very thick or dark on the body (around the thick / dark lines mainly around). Many times I felt that they tried very hard to express emotions and facial expressions and failed to draw any real emotions. But there was also time when the emotion became thick. However, many scenes were lazy and layers were clear. <br /> <br /> I'm going to sleep here, so I'll add it before starting in less sense ... <br /> <br /> Try a great on an epic film ... though it's middle class Turned out Matt Dunn, you suck!
