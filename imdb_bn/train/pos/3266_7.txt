Another dinai must see! If you're a fan like me, you've seen this movie! He plays Alex Fink, a 22-year-old Yale Grade, who understands that the life he took was the life he lived 26 years ago. Alex Louis Jefferies is not a married lawyer, happily married to Corin (Cycle Shepard). Louie is killed on their one year anniversary when a car hit by. She returned, this time only Alex Fink's body. Enter Robert Doni Jr., a lot of confusion, and a lot of humorous. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is 15 years old, it still makes it wonder if something happens like a resurrection. And if so, how often do you meet the same soul life after life met. I do not know the answers. But I know that you will see this movie. This is a riot, and Downey looks so good in a tuxedo. This image trusts you in love and true love never dies. It just gets recycled.
