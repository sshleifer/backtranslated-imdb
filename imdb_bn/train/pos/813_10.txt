After 'Empire Strike Backs', "Return of the Jaddy" is my second favorite movie from the Star Wars series. <br /> <br /> Luke went to Tattoos to save Han Solo from Zakoba. At the same time, the Galactic Empire is working secretly, building a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station is fully built, then it will end the rebel alliance. Both gentlemen and emperors are concerned because of the new death star delay, and they must kill most of their captains for scheduling. <br /> <br /> The R2 and C3po send a message from Luke to Zabo, inside Zabar Palace, where Lucas pretends to discuss Han's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabber as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept this discussion because he is using Han Solo as part of his palace decoration. (Han is still credited with carbonate) Lando is hiding as a jabbar guard and also gave Chebbaka a chance to reward the prize hunter. When the same Hunter Han tried to save the loneliness and tried to stay in the human form again, we see that this is actually a proxy princess Lia. The problem is that, Jabda looks for the plan of Liar and adopts him as his slave, although Han is thrown into a whistle cell. <br /> <br /> Luke comes as a stubborn knight to rescue his friends. During his first attempt to kill Jabbar, he fell into Jabba's giant cell (Bentha), but easily killed it. Jabba became angry and decided to cast a big creature in the desert, Sadhak, Han, Chebbakha and Luke, who dived for his food for 1,000 years. Luke, Han and Chevy have also achieved success in the scope, even Bob explodes when Hana accidentally throws him from the face of Sarkalak. Leah kills Jeba and goes after Han, Luke and Chevy as well as c3po and R2. <br /> <br /> Everybody is safe again, bin Laden decides to persevere and to go to Dagowa to fulfill his promise to God. The problem is that Yoda is very old and sick, because he is already 900 years old and before his death, Jude told Luke that he does not need further training, but to be really stubborn, he must fight again with the voter. He confirmed to Luke that there are other Skywalkers besides Luk's father and Luke. In the last moment, Joda asked Luke to remember his advices about dark enticing and sent Luke to Zucch's knowledge to other people. When Eid dies, Obni Van's soul sees Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed Aakin as his best friend, and since he is more than human than being honest, more machines than humans. Luke is concerned about the murder of his father, and says that he thinks his father still has mercy. Obey Waien Luk said that his eldest sister, Lia, and Luke and Lia said the reasons for the separation of children. He gave his last advice to Luke that if he refused to kill Bhadra, then the emperor would win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Emperor told Bhadra that he must give him to Luke. Because the look is stronger than ever, and to bring them both to the hidden dark side. <br /> <br /> Now we'll go to one of the best battles in the Star Wars series. When the rebel alliance plans to attack the new Space Station, 'Death Star 2', Luca Bhadra will face the Emperor, and Lia, Han and Chewaki will have to stop the 'Field Star 2' power field. EWOKS help (Little creatures who look a little beer) <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the most exciting star wars!
