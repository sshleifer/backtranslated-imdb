This picture is one of Tom Cruise's best films. He captures the imagination of the audience with his role in David Aames His character may be somewhat related to us. The story line is very clever and puts the audience across the whole film. I've seen the cruise movie really long ago but after watching it it shows me its true talent. The last part of my movie is in the end where it comes to a great conclusion and he finds the truth. If you have not seen it yet, try it for sure. It's a movie that you've finally seen it, or it'll keep you thinking about it and you'll be sorry about it. My opinion would you just buy it and take a risk of what I did and it became one of my favorite movies all the time. This is a * 10/10 promise to promise, it will be with you and you like it forever.
