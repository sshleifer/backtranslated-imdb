This image is a delightful, light-hearted look on both sides, where "Club kids" Rave mixes New York art, music and performance art worlds (with a camo by universal Miss Bunny). This is the "torch song trilogy" for perky-post-teen girls. "The girl" for our unsafe, influenced millenia times. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is fast and fun, and the valuable ability of Parker Pozzy - if the academy does not get the award, at least - Kudo's stadium "wave". <br /> <br /> Of course, this picture is in the very stylish platform heels of Miss Pose and he's throwing it completely. Like many acting acting like her, it can not be too deep, it is often self-referential and good, posey ... but it does all work. He is a talented comedian, incredible entertainer, and entertains the movie, he carries a wrong leopard wrapping on his shoulder, and never lets him enter the floor. <br /> <br /> Mary is not an outfit with a public party fashionistist or any other person's boyfriend stolen designer clothing from any friend mortgage. On a deeper level, it is the story of a girl and her friends, which is careless in every sense of words with the words of all other people. And the process of learning that care is necessary for life. <br /> <br /> This script is nicely created, malicious, and the only performance of disappointment Annie, it was a role that had a lot of quantitative and heavy handover; More cozy performance from him, the relationship between the two deepens ... but ... hey ... it's a comedy. An amazing deep introduction, that gives this film some material and vision of the world, is the boyfriend selling fallafel. We all should be lucky ... is he the one for Mary? Or gets that away? I rated it as 8 because it is not a great moment in film history, it is not a classic and it is not a great art (which is deep and rich for all to see again). Like "clearly looking Susan", it presents some truth about its duration but may be irrelevant over time. Still, it has everything needed in an entertaining film, and price worth visiting for a couple of times!
