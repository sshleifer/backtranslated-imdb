The only reason I see this movie as 8 reasons out of 10, there are some movies, in my opinion, it's perfect. This little B picture is a sharp story, well told. I was always curious by Alexander Knox, but he saw very few movies. Here he is a villainous Wilhelm Grim, a sad man who turns into a demon. He betrays everything and everyone without an ounce of forgiveness The performance is one of the coolest performances I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who acted in Nazi or other bad genre, have been nominated for Oscars at times. I imagine that it was created during the war, the academy felt like honoring such a performance, which was to honor the temple. But Knox puts such kind of performance - a person is so bitter and hungry that he does not mind hurting others. I still can not get it. <br /> <br /> Marsh Hunt, who usually plays Filtrae Gibbs or Social Butterfly, is still typed against him in the best performance of what I saw. Perhaps Oscar is not worthy, but the best of his career. There is nothing against him; I often enjoyed those "little" roles who played it. But here he proves the work of heavy drama. <br /> <br /> If you like the story of the dramatic drama in the drama or the trouble of Nazir, I recommend this little little movie.
