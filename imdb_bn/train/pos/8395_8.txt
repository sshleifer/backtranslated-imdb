*** SPEAKER *** *** SPEAKERS *** It has never produced the best movie renaissance Warner Fasibindera without any doubt, and even with the amazing script, the movie has been improved by Hana Schuigaa with a great performance. The film begins with Maria (Schuuga) and Harman Brown (Claus Loewitch) when the bomb falls and Harman is sent on the horrible day of war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrap to survive. Maria decided to work as a dancer / prostitution of a club supplying GI to America, and she met a black soldier called Bill (Greg Eagle) and they began to see each other steadily. Maria has heard that her husband Herman died in war, so she became very serious about the bill. But once they got closer to the bill, they saw Harman at the door. He did not die, and when he entered the room a quarrel arose and broke a bottle on Maria Beal's head and he died. Herman filed a complaint and was sent to the long-term prison, so Maria tells him that he will be successful and find out. The war is over and Germany will be rebuilt and one day the train will show Maria Marie Carl Oswald (Ivan Desnie) who is a successful textile businessman and uses his skin to get a job. Maria climbed firm and corporate stairs to work well and became Karl's mistress. He told him that he would never marry but he loved her. Herman went out of jail but went to Canada to stop the work he did to go to Canada. <br /> <br /> ***** Spylar Alert ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and Mary leaves everything in his wishes and Maria buys his house. Then Harman finally came to his wife's house and they were ready to start the marriage, though they have now been married for some time. But Maria stoves off the gas and blasts the house. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting topics in this movie that it is a film that can be read and talk great length. Color use like all the fasibinders is very interesting. Before the film began, the tones were gray and gray, which represented war against Germany, but Mar√≠a began to succeed, they changed to rich and rich rich in red and white. Germany's rebuilding of all construction words is used only as a backdrop, and the film focuses on Maria's exploitation. The term reconstruction of the fasciindor was reminded of what was happening in Germany at the time. Hanna Schuiga was never good and her performance was the key to success of this picture. It was just another interesting movie with a little actress, but Shuigula was so strong that her performance elevated the film to an elite position. Shiigala shows Mario very strong and smart, but at the same time uses whatever he wants for his beauty and femininity. She does not feel embarrassed and she does not feel guilty about this, and the fasciinder tried to show Maria as a woman who actually sold her soul to survive. Suegula was not nominated for the Academy Award, but he gave a great performance which will stand in the examination. Fasimbindor himself appeared in the movie as a puddler and played his own mother Lilo Pempit Frau Im. I have heard a lot about the end of the film and Maria will have to do it with intentionally left the gas. After the bathroom he is running water on his wrist and he seems sad. It's just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think he was excited over Herman's house and accidentally released it (remember that he kept him in a dress?). Then when the will came to him that he would know that Harman and Carl have become friendly without their knowledge and I think that everything he did was nothing. Thats because of the bathroom scene. So when the house explodes it by accident. But I think the reason for the end of the phasebinder is to show that there is no business for anyone who sells souls. The fascinator was fascinated by the living, but he was incredibly enthusiastic. According to him, Maria can not have both ways. A fascinating film.
