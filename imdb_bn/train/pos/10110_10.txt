No story consists of a compound, character and conflict. Characters win their own game plan, and a militant character easily lends it to self. Poetry of the same name written by half-Satya's premise is written by Dilip Chitre. The line goes away - "A bird is my nunghththa, my voice is in my mouth, and I can say it is half truth?" A fair translation - "The imbalance of the right and the wrong (generally seen at the risk of the court's blind trial) is the lack of power on one plate and the other on the other, why the center of the center is half truth?" <Br /> <br /> This poem is sent from Smith Pally to Om Puri in the middle of a restorer. It has a profound impact on the drama and the foundation of most of the events followed. At the end of the film, Om Puri has described the same way in the same poem. <br /> <br /> The film tries to work hard on poetry together. However, the picture is very strong, and the best, the film matches every aspect of the poem. <br /> <br />
