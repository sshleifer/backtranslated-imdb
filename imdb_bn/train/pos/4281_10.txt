One of my favorite "domestic" movies is one. I do not know there is a person who does not see this movie! It's funny, and sad for a moment ... I do not know how people around the world (who had the opportunity to watch it) took this film, because we have to know a few moments of our Lionel history and the character of Serb. I realized the first half of the 20th century! But I see here some of Canada saw it ... and he liked it. <br /> <br /> I think I will try to give all the best quotes from the movie on this site, but how to do it first ... <br /> <br /> Cheers.
