A super-comedy series of 1990s (totaled up to two series), which is suffering from poor time scheduling in UK ratings. When you get up against established comedians like 'Mindar', the best new comedy will still struggle to keep an eye on. Thankfully, I grabbed a series of episodes and followed it very quickly. I mentioned it to friends and family at the time, but everyone seems to have seen something else. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, both series released 'His own' <br /> <br /> Well, both series are now available in DVDs. <br /> <br /> http://www.replaydvd.co.uk/joking_apart_S1.
