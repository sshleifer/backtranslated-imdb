Others have commented that this video is an edited version of the two shows: "Fire in Space" and "Living Legend", if you look at the original shows, you can see that the video version dialogue has been edited. I saw this video version better because the views and lines were added to it. I would like to see if you want to see the shot in its original version of VHS video versions. They have more fan offers than DVDs offer the original episodes. Another good video is the victory for the world, which was more than the 1980s Galactica, which was more than actual broadcast itself. Overall, I rate it as 10 because it gives you more enjoyment than what the networks offer at the time slots given to the manufacturers.
