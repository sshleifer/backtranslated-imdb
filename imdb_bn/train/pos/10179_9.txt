De Girt is a very good film. Tom Krababe comes from a great plot from the novel, who adapted the story for the curtain. Van Hewlett not only not only plays the top-class, but especially Marcel Hennesse Ema, who has done most of the TV-work before editing the Excel Van De Graff. The film seems to be a sticker as a thriller, and a nice mood set. Then we started to learn about the Agen Wager and the Excel Van De Graph, and the story reveals a bit of bit in the very flamboyant flash-back structure, which adds more romantic aspect and character-driven drama of the film. Ultimately all this culminates in a psychological end, that will grab the audience by their throats. When you are going to see this movie, make sure you know about the plot as much as possible. One must definitely see, especially if you prefer 'sporolos' (the main screen orientation of the vanishing).
