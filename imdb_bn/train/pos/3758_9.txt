This movie is awesome. If you take it very seriously, you must hate it; However, this amount of "dudes" and "right ons" brings smiles and vague memories about 15 years ago. I want to see his predecessor in clear joke and silliness, and the luxury of luxury "(1989), I just liked the ability to easily shine me. If you are looking for a film full of multifaceted joke, and complete mature humor, do not see it; If you want a movie that is funny and stupid, but intelligent and compelling, you will enjoy it. I'm more of this type of photo today's Theatra Ray is willing to appear. And Hey, Kaneu is acting on the way to congratulating him as acting Reeves ... ok ... nothing better than that!
