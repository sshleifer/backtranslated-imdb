On the day of the big studio system back, the darndest casting decision is made. All American Zuckervers Stuart as Hungarian, at The Store of the Corner If I used to throw the film, then Karlick's part was suitable for Charles Boy. His pronunciation was mixed with other European accents, there was nothing to pronounce. There was some problem with Martur Strouber on Martel Sturm with Martyr Sulvan. <br /> <br /> Margaret Sullivan was her most frequent leader on screen, she made four films with him. But this is the only one where one of them dies. Sulván and her husband, Leland Hayward, were a struggling striker in New York who knew Stewart that day. In fact, Sultan's husband was Stewart's good friend, Henry Fonda. <br /> <br /> I think Clerk Gabell could be expelled as an American American, who was America in the rebellion in Bouti. Stuttgart of Mortal Storm was German, but all the other players were American, so nothing was standing. <br /> <br /> But if you can take Stewart, you will see a fine film of Ernest Lübitz. The plot is quite simple, not a male and female person working in a department store in Budapest. But it seems they are carrying a letter with some anonymous testimonials that make each other. Also employer Frank Morgan suspected Stuart of kanoodling with his wife wrongly. <br /> <br /> Although Leeds is fine and Frank Morgan has gone from his usual intelligent self, the two best players include Félix Bresst and Joseph Schildkratt. My favorite moment is to Brasert when he closes the picture after starting to know the morgan public opinion. He makes himself very weak. <br /> <br /> And Joseph Shieldcroft, who is always good, is constantly frank Frank Morgan as the official little insect kissing. You really hate such people, I know many people like Skilcraft in real life, who live in office politics for 24 hours a day. Sorry it closes a good deal.
