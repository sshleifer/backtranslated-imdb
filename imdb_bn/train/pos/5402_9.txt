Hittocki (which translates as "murder", a / k / a "tinchu" which translates as "divine punishment") shows Hedi Gosha at the top of her form. Do not miss this, another classic of Gosh, Gookin! Hitokiri is not one of the best movies in the world, it is one of the best "Samurai / Sponga" films ever and sometimes one of the best Japanese films. <br /> <br /> Be careful, the description of Hitokiri's plot may be a little harder for strangers with all the complex 19th century Japanese history. Even the underlying human drama is clear and open to all observers. According to Go≈õa's ideals, Hitokiri provides a diversity of her traditional theme "Loyalty to the Lord" versus "The Right Thing". However, Gosh has developed his favorite theme with such sophistication that it actually looks like _the_ movie (with course Goyokin). <br /> <br /> I think it breaks like this: If you want more easy, more action-oriented stories, you might want to see Goyokin. However, if you want more thoughtful, multilayered (though serious) drama, see this one. (Okay, well, historical backdrop is covering a large capacity among many different community groups, (1) working for reform, still maintaining Tokugawa Shogunate, and (2) who are the highest in the world of Emperor Meiji Trying to establish it as a ruler. Of course, the tribes working for Emperor Mizis were often less interested in their "new world" In spite of "reforming" Japan, the whole feudal system was officially dissolved between the first reform of the Major Government, as it is about the great ridicule of the soldier-Gosha - which makes the whole plot more bitsweet.) <br /> < Brushing "Hitokiri" from other films of Goshha, and the mature feeling of the Goshha painting. Each shot is composed sensibly, and every frame of the film (like Barry Lyndon of Quebec) still retains its idea as a compilation. Of course, these are usually bunch. Hitokiri has many wonderful sesscaps with really wonderful backdrops (such as with Gyookin). Just watch the open sequence, and you're hooked! Do not make any mistake, this is not a piece of English time: Hitoki is extremely violent (tell you not to be cautious). <br /> <br /> What does cooler camera do out without work, makes Hitokiri stand out? Performance seems (my) this one bit more subtle Katsu Santoro (Zaiti / Hanzo Razer's fame) Controversial hero / Antihiro, Waqqa Ijo is staring towards star performances. Kastu is able to lead humanity in such a character, which is considered to be more wild than villains. Throughout the film, if you are sure that you are rebellious or rebellious by their character. At the same time, Oktar's hunger hunger for showing respect to Kastoor, and after that, the ultimate endeavor of the Liberation War, so many people think that you can not help but feel sympathy / sympathy. Of course, after seeing the persecuted hero of Nakkai Tasuya "Geokin", it was very nice to see the "Hitokiri" playing the ruthless arch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shinbei Tanaka, a right-wing supernatural novelist who "kidnapped" Japanese army officers in September 1970, and was a film of life and work of Paul Scherder), who actually did excellent work of filming (for an assassin).
