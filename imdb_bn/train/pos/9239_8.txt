I said in my comment about the first part: these two films are better than the science fiction fans. <br /> <br /> The second movie scene is not running as it is because we are not seeing the destruction of human civilization, but thousands of refugees later flee into small space cans, protected by only one powerful spaceship. <br /> <br /> But when the Batlester Pagsasas is displayed, the story becomes warm, the war is taken to the silon planets. . Okay, this is a little bit of Mad Mac because they have fuel for their spaceships to find the remote world that they fight for war, but it works for me. It is characterized by excellent actors and decent special effects (although those who tend to repeat themselves, at least-)) science fiction entertainment that is saying. <br /> <br /> I liked a continuation of Starbucks and Apollo. Board. Instead, we have received second signals with a name character who proved that this story had worked earlier, especially because these features are so well-selected ... <br /> So for the 1980's production, since 1978, for two films Thump Up
