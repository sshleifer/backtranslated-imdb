I doubt this film is based on many true stories. At the beginning it is based on a true story, sort of said. I only believe that this was a former model monster hunter probably called Domino. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is being interrogated about what he knows about a 10 million dollar robbery for Dominion. Through Flashbacks we see Domino as a child, then as a model and how she became interested in a monster hunter. He basically called 2 other monster hunters off, Ed and Choco. They let him join the team. She can use any weapon, hard, and if necessary it will be used to look good. <br /> <br /> They are involved in a bribe clamant, which is going on going to a bailman. On the way, the group started a reality TV show and Ian Jarring and Brian Austin were involved in green. They'll be really desperate to be sort of host and present in this. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was entertaining and there were some laughs. The edit did not disturb me. Many guns, mainly using guns and blood. It can be a little smaller. <br /> <br />: Last message: enough to see.
