What is a name If the name Jerry Br√ºhheimer hopes to fill it with the verb. <br /> <br /> The latest movie of producer Bruckheimer, song in 60 seconds, all its namesake. Ideas like Diane, Suu, and Elusive Aloror are ideal for characters, such as kip, swine, and spin-off characters and characters, but this is the only non-stop action that does not want you to play the name game. There are no deep scripts in any way, but it's a great way to act as Nicholas Cage, like stealing a 50-year listing with Memphis Reyns, Angelina Jolie and Robert Duval, to protect his brother's life, Theft ends. Exotic cars one night. An artificial screenplay of the 1974 culture, this film can not be determined for the same religion, but it is entertaining. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, this is not a step that shows you acting. Although not loaded with stars, none of them hold standout performances with very poor performance of my favorite up and compere Geovani Ribis. Even Jolie is locking up her recent Oscar win, it's just a touch of love with a token with a screen time <br /> <br /> A beautiful series of cars and cars can make them a great movie? I think so. The film is a pleasure to watch and even though a special scene takes you to the state of mistrust, but the action is non-stop and suspension mandatory. Just be careful when you leave the theater to fight for other drive locations. <br /> <br /> 3/1
