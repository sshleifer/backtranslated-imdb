Many people do not think that the film of Branhang Hamlet is all good, but I must admit that it is great. Almost every production of Shakespeare has a problem, it has problems and it has to create tough choices, which does not work at all. For example, the thing about "secret door everywhere" simply does not work. This material never achieves the ill-feeling of metaphor or parallelism that it attempts, which makes the game very proud and reduces the trace of thousands of mysteries. This is the biggest problem with this production. And when it's a biggie, I'd say that it's the only problem. Almost everything works perfectly neatly. OK, so the title of the title of Branagh is a very old mite. And the relationship with Ophelia seems a little forced. And he gets very hysterical at times. But that's it. No other complaints. Even with these errors, I think this version is a fundamental issue and if it is not as strong as a play, then it is a literary work that should be equally. We have found the longest version of the game, innovative and elaborately brought to the screen, most of the perfect and modern and highly understandable voices are free - even if they sometimes speak very quickly to get huge text. But in the staging of Shakespeare, it is not possible for the audience to speak very slowly in order to deeply compliment the language deeply. For this, one must actually enter the print versions of the play. <br /> <br /> All the actors of this version are messaging only and immediately and immediately the classic (Jack Lemon). Just like Christie Gertrude is the greatest of all times and even the American actor is wonderful, esp. Charlton Haysten as Player King - Who would think it? (One story is going on that Haysten once played Hamlet on stage, and when a critics in front row could not stand up for his acting performance, he began to loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly said: "Well, I do not write this word! "Of course this may not be true, but it's a funny story - and if it is true, here's a brave and ironic choice for Brangha. Da Hesson to include.) Robin Williams "Young ojrika as" probably the part that is not enough for the young, but he has made it a ridiculous one, which is important. <br /> <br /> Overall it's a very well-produced version, most of my original scenes are my mind, the most memorable. Of course, I saw this movie with the same enthusiasm of Shakespeare's (and almost at the same time, like the great Romeo + Juliet), and it has made a great impression on me, which is something I need for some love for me. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br>> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Perhaps Branag's Shakespeare's works are more than the maximum, he is an expert translator and popularity, he has an interesting attitude towards words and a lesson Including deep and proper and uncomfortably encouraged gratitude. In Shakespeare's acting world there are two bright lights, Olivier and Brangha, and Olivier's best actor, Brangha, brought Shakespeare under the skull and carving behind and conforms to it, it is easily available, transformed into people's fidelity. None of his dignity. Brangha, I believe, has shocked a true Shakespeare than the world. <br /> <br /> And so, 10 out of 10 are for Hamlet 10.
