Man, I like this movie! This really takes me back when a baby is me. In these days teachers still showed classical classical movies and if you were good, they would gradually erase the movie so you can retreat. I still remember one of the open lines ... "Tutzama was his name, and he was an orphan, he did the same to his sister in the village." This is a red movie and the lasting movie as the red balloon for kids. Finally, other Indian boys in the village attach feathers to Totajam and they themselves become eagles. He always gets the way he wanted to live. He gets the sky bright.
