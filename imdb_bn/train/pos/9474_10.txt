I got to see this film at a preview and it was dazzled by it. This is not usually a romantic comedy. I do not remember to laugh so hard at a film and it is still being removed by it. Smile is not here sunrise - they are the observation, the smile of acknowledgment, "Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one feeling that feeling!" I will not leave this plot, which only "Guy loves his brother's girlfriend." The whole family plays here a part of the relationship. Perhaps the best mix of smiles and warmth since you were asleep. <br /> <br /> Steve Carroll has gone deeper than before, and for the first time I really like him. Cast is a list of amazing, scary theater actors, whom I liked in other roles, but they are mixed for a strong family. Diane Weiss is as beautiful as a mother, Juliet is brilliant and laughable (who knew he was funny?), Even the barbarian Dan Cook would give the dog a warm, calm, sensitive performance. Sondre Lerche Soundtrack is a wonderful addition, and I'll make the CD available to the second. It's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not miss it.
