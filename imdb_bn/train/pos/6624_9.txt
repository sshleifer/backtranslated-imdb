I highly recommend this film. 2054 Paris is set in the future of Bladernaar-Esquiera, it is a classic film honoring the script of Nire: The gentle lady, the sister is trying to find him, fighting the honest opponent. Thankfully, it avoids being stereotypical, and combines a beautifully good storyline with striking, innovative visuals. The film can remind you of the nudity of Sin City, but it is a more sharp, even more graphic novel that I think is really engaging. Each frame, each order seems to be dragged from the skilled graphic designer's desk. In terms of stories and artwork, you can go back to the movies in the nineteenth century (or with the classic views of Eiffel Tower and Saker Quair) and Casablanca, as well as our misfortunes where looking at a serious future. Administered by corporation. Make any excuse you need to see this film.
