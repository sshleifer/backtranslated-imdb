This movie is finally out of Italy's DVD (complete restoration). I have seen this movie many times and I have found it today (2003) when I actually suffered from a pain in the dictatorship (or in the United States) of the brain. I can sing to this delight that I am happy that this film has been played by Mastrawani. Maybe they can fight against how Sofia Lorraine in this world can be strong and recognized as a human. <br /> <br /> Return to the movies: Most people here already have played the role but the audio background is astonishing. I think that unfortunately if you do not understand the Italian language then something is missing, but I can assure you that the demonstration of the instrument, the reality of the current radio-chronicle of Hitler's Rome is really true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
