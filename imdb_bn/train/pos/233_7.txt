I actually did not find this movie 'attractive'; Finally my clock and rent are worth my time. It is true ... some scenes were on top of mentality, screaming, etc., but does a movie not pressurize its agenda, section or 'bun to grind'? not anyone! I'm not surprised that I read a review somewhere else on another review site by the Esfran Review, but its negative reviews provide a more accurate description of the film's "own" review; Not at all in the movie. Anyone who sees this movie should understand that it is great to recommend family and friends. No car charging, yes !! Being "in" in the Italian family, I could be fully related to the environment illustrated on the screen. There are jerking parts of her tear as well as the movie. It can be a real life in such an environment. Beautiful movies
