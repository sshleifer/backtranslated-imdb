Breaking Glass is a film that everyone should be interested in the music industry should be seen multiple times. This is a very dark story that a recording company guides a singer to earn more money than he can and work as much as possible. I have always reminded me of this movie in some of the 'Star of Search a Star' style on both TV shows in the UK and abroad. Although there are no experts in this regard, the winners of these shows are a very big initial hit and then there are encouraged from there. Although the effects are the same, this movie predicts these shows. After being released from his manager, Phil played with Daniels brilliantly, slowly but surely the record company provoked his songs and eventually burned them completely. You are likely to be big tomorrow ... and watch this !!!
