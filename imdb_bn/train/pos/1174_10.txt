Some people say that, like the 11th season, the tendency to go back to their political satirical rebellion for shallow rebellion in the South Park; But this can not be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> This episode snatches the Living Dead series, there is more to it. How people behave with the homeless, this is a mockery. Characters say things like "they pose to be like us" or "they want to be human." This episode attacks people who ignore the lower classes, who often fall on their fates. So yes, it's still ironic, and a wonderful fool. What could you do more?
