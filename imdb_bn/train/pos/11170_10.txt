There is something about pet committers that I did not feel elsewhere. When I first saw I was a kid probably this experience made so memorable. But I keep watching over again, it gets old, and I do not bother. From the open-ended song to the very opening to the very opening of the opening song, at the same time some insane, sad and scary, and keeps it rolling on your head: Sometimes the dead are better! <br /> <br /> I do not think it will be useful to rejoin the whole story. You need to know that it starts from point A (the most perfect situation for a happy American family) and step-by-step step-by-step steps in step-by-step. The music is perfect, the story is understandable, the special effect is calm, and the pet commemorative end of the world. I said, sometimes like the dead!
