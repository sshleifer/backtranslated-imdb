The TV movie made for this is a bright one. This is probably the best and favorite role by the buffant winner John Tha (Kaewangh Qiisi and Inspector Morshe). Tom Oklie (the) widow lived in the village shortly after his wife and son died, and now he has been campaigning for Wilmie Beck (Nick Robinson). She gets to know this child as she begins to develop a friendship. Annabelle Apsion wants him back. After being worried about William, after contacting Tom, he went to London to find him. Finally William gets her home with a loving family (or father). This is a wonderful film set during World War II. It was nominated for BAFTA Leigh Grade Award and won the National Television Award for the most popular plays. John Thao was at number three in TV's 50 Best Star. very good!
