You know the story - a group of lucky non-hoppers enter into a competition that seems unlikely to win any of them - this is a story that happened at the death of Hollywood (bring it, children in Karate, flee from victory, etc.). Now, Korea is fighting for glory with a Tikawondo team ?? And guess what ?? The results are expected but ultimately satisfied. <br /> <br /> This image does not flatten on her face, talented young cast who really cared about you characters, and it turns out you're finally watching. <br /> <br /> Could your fans of the ideal martial arts movie be frustrated? Most Kung Fu films do not give Tequoondo the usual quarrel of movement and acrobatics; The action is limited (though impressive) kicks and occasionally punching. Although it is not a matter, since it is an interaction with characters and their reason for doing something that makes this movie successful.
