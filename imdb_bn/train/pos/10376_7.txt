I just saw the roll and what has become a joy it has to be. The performance of Toby Malone has really stood, I actually cared about what was happening to Matt across the whole film, which is also very fun with a nice mix of good round letters, its small running time. There are plenty of good twists across well, it will ultimately keep you guessing. Watch out for other characters are completely insane miniature and sticky attractive Jesse. This may not be a huge budget for a Hollywood blockbuster, but it does not let you go, you can do a lot worse than checking it, you will not be so sorry. Good fun 7/10
