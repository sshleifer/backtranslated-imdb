I'm not sure how I missed it when it first came out, but finally I was happy to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie took place in 19th-century Oklahoma's Red Light district and nearby, Japan. It tells stories of powerful women in the society based on prostitution, race system and Japan's samurai power. <br /> <br /> It is unique Akira Kurosawa! Although he died before managing this film, his playplay shows the adaptation to hear. His attitude to the Japanese world and the caste system is famous and he explains how these systems communicate with each other. Characters can surround each other, but the nation system remains intact when every letter returns to the world. The Samurai warrior who goes to the world of heartwarming and loving prostitution returns to his life, when he is the other road with a man, which is part of his caste system .. the lowest Many people reward Samurai on the rest of the world, but still lower caste residents can support each other and who love without restraint. The samurai of this movie has become weak, when classless lovers are proven to be respected. <br /> <br /> The image is highly rated. This is the story of survival of women in feudal Japan. During this time frame, men were believed to have survived. Strong people are thought to be just stupid and weak property when women are just. This film focuses on the power of Japanese women and how they show what they have done to survive and how their strength continues to be in Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> I recommend "watching the sea" that's the fan of Akira Kuorsawa and even if they are not a fan. It is a lovely, quiet and vibrant series, and the fame for the collection of any other film.
