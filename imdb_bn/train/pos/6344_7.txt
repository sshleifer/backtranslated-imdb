I am overwhelmed by Jim Kerry's work. I keep this movie stuck in my head. Greenech Martha likes me, Cindy Lou (who is very annoying; her sweet innocence) who tries to get the Christmas spirit, Greench's childhood (very funny!), And also the poor-clear end-christmas' all about gifts. I would say, I started walking with the theater's stupid walk with children and kids, and many more, but this movie is about. The complete adaptation of Sierras' small films and the IS for all ages.
