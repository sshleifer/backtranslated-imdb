Does anyone know what drives to pick up John T? I look like a middle late late 70's. This movie is my favorite as well as my wife's. It was the first memorable movie we saw as a married couple. Pickup is an interest because it is like the first truck and recently like a truck like it. I'd like to recover the pickup I have duplicate throughout the movie. Also the music was awesome, and the acting was great. Where and what lady is portrayed by Yahoo aunt? John Stant doubled when he read almost for the scene in the tower? Also debutored by Debra Wah in this year's Mustang show. It looked like a 60's model. Thanks,
