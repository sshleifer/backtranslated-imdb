Low budget Britain Pop Melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star, becomes one and then it finds a lot more. Good cast and time and space are a sense that we can not hide here all before. Several scenes are a bit hysterical and many words like O'Connor's voice mini-mouse! After making this film, he disappeared from the scene - so can imitate the art of life! Although you will see a star is born to see a punk version.
