A very good war film that shows the impact of a civilian war, which hides his views in Guadalcanal and is returning home and reconnecting with the help of family and friends. A nice cast of the actor helps make this movie very entertaining. The role of Alan Parker as a girlfriend was deserving of the Oscar nomination. He has such an indignity in this movie. The role of Ann Ann Doran as well as his younger supporter role was equally satisfying. I especially like the suburbs of pre-field Fieldlandia. Hunting scene is very good. Of course, during this epic war, the battlefield in Guadelouen showed the horror of facing our soldiers. A well deserved film and one that should not be forgotten
