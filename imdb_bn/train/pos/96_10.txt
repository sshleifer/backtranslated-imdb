I reviewed my old VHS tapes and the TV show John Denver and Christmas in the Muppets together gathered together. It took me to my computer and was watching it to see if I could buy a DVD version of this show. I was still frustrated to be able to find the DVD. The show was aired in 1979 and was a delightful show. I have the record and the CD but I would like to buy a DVD version of this show. The tape is old and the quality of the photo is quite good but fade is not as good as the sound cd. There are some other songs in the CD. As a fan of John Denver and Muppets, a DVD of this show can really be a good seller. If you do not have a CD, then it's a great collection of songs from the show. If you find this album, it is also good and it still has a record player to play it on.
