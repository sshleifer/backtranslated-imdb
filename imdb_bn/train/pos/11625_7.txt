- A very beautiful red head meets a charming young man he connects with the woman waiting for his plane. The two got up on their flight and sitting next to each other, the young Jack became dead because he threatened Lisa to be a politician and his wife, or else his father would die. Now see, what happens when you fly a coach, stuff that is never in the first class. <br /> <br /> - Apart from clashes with the flight, this movie shares with others "Flightplan" incredible incredibility * if it is a word in the story *. The overall theme is to change the main character to a politician's house, so that he can be killed, which is a beautiful planned plan, but will not it be easy for Jack to find the computer's intelligent person and hack them into the hotel system? Teenagers can not do anything with computers today, so I'm sure that by using the computer instead of falling into Lysar espionage and its accidents, one could easily make it easier to change. He got on film. <br /> <br /> One thing that struck me strangely was that nobody talked about the plan that they had spoken. It is a very small plane is talking about here and their voices are raised occasionally it seems like I heard some of the other passengers. But I'm 100% sure that I'm reading this much more. This movie is meant to be realistic as a part of "24" so that no one is confused by such complexities. Although for all my complaints, it is still a very interesting movie that completes the work. It just does not have to stop that kind of brain, but at the same time it is not necessary to fully enjoy the full intelligence. <br /> <br /> I love to sit in my comfortable chair and bother about brilliant acting but I can not really do it. I love Rachel McAdam, I love Sylain Murphy, and like Brian Cox, but they do not extend their acting muscles here. This is not really a problem because the studios are not expecting to win multiple awards, and the performance is not just great, but it's not just great. Wes Craven does not think of a movie that seems the first time, but he did a very good job considering the film's lack of depth of film and script. It's definitely a huge improvement over the frustrating "curse" and I liked to do something different with this movie, even though I love to go back to what I wanted to do in the past, which is a horror movie. After talking about the liberation war for decades. <br /> <br /> - A wonderful thing about the movie that I really appreciated was how small the movie was. It feels good to sit and watch very well for three hours or more of a movie, but the movie that comes out of the present day seems like a long time, where this film seems like the right length. Not too long, and too small. They do not waste time trying to develop too much characters because they know that this is not the film and by doing this, they have made beautiful small films. Due to being a huge film music singer, I would say that the best part of the film is a superb score of Marco Beltrami. It's really nice to write the prophetic things to Beltrami that is doing a great song now. I'm really cool techno / orchestra stuff for the main title. It is very bad that I can not find the soundtrack anywhere, when I want to hear it, instead of popping the DVD, I want to hear the title at any time. <br /> <br /> It is great for it and it is far more than a great movie, yet some small entertainment should be given one and a half hours
