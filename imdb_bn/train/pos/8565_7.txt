If you like animal movies, please this movie. My wife liked animals and animal movies, she particularly loved this photo parrot. It is interested in kids, but I laughed most of the comedians. The French fashion character smiles me, and adds the script balance. It's a Disney movie, with its delightful, happy, family waiting, but I like to leave the theater with positive feiling.
