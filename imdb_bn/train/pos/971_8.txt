This movie is a reminder of German film, The Nevarnding Starry because of being a child hero to a strange land. However, due to many superior modern technologies, dolls and CGIs are used to create an amazingly realistic looking world - this is one that will stop your socks due to your reality and opportunity. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie, but the boy was a joke at first! Unfortunately, for most Westerners, this movie is you can release very soon or it can be canceled because everything in the movie seems impossible. However, give it a chance. Do not think or try to understand what you are watching - let the story only be published and you will probably be able to enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> In many ways, I would like this kind of advice to see the Miajaki's Spirited Away, which gives adults to it because it is very similar and tonic features of Yokai (Japanese mythical spirits). The big difference between the two is that Great Equity War Live-Action and Spirited Away are more child-friendly. Although I think the Great Yakai Warti was called the film of most children in the United States, most parents do not want to show these little kids because it is so violent, scary, and some adult behavioral features. Then who is the Western audience? Well, older kids and adults who appreciate foreign films non-western themes and writings. This is a rather narrow audience, indeed! <br /> <br /> When you are looking, look for all the weird little touches. In fact, you can look at the image several times and notice the different things every time. I like some interesting references to gamma, this scene uses "Kids: The Tree at It at Home" as well as Kirin Beer, which is actually a person called Yokai ("Hmmm ... maybe that scene might have this warning too!)! /> <br /> However, director Takshi Mike has worked hard to pin Stylistically, any other story I have seen does not seem to be "normal." Some of her movies are rather Hateful and annoying and I hated them (especially AUDIITION and ICHI the Killer) but some of them were magicians and I have ever seen the best movies (Kakakiris' benefit). Certainly one thing, it is difficult to show a movie and there is no other way or other powerful response. .
