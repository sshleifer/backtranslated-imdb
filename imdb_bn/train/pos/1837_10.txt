There is no doubt about it only great movie. Fantastic stories and superb acting, Amitabh, Akshay, Shefali, Priyanka, Bomman or Rampal. Ashamed with the Hindi film industry Mallika and co-this film is completely absurd, and so is the failure of our Indian society to misconduct. But the message and concept of the concept of this movie is absolutely fantastic. Anu Malik (the annoying copy cats) can be avoided and Ismail Darbar or Himesh Rashmiyya can be used as a musician. I think Vipul Shah should have given Gujarat touch especially in music. Anu Malik is the worst musician and he thinks himself a popster, but this movie is not where he was present - he only looks good with Govinda style songs. With good ghazals or sad songs, I felt some pretty serious music that made this movie more memorable.
