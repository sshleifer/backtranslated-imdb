I say this series as the best of 'spy' style that everyone agrees with. When I first preached in the United States, and after seeing each of my episodes, I and my husband got out. I tried to buy that series (I have tapped it all) but WBGH said it was not available. I was also thinking of writing to Ian Holle, whether she has a copy! Like others, I've bought and read the Dieton series (to understand complex plots.) If the original version is available on DVD, I'll be in the first to snap a copy. Ian Holm's weak but brave Bernard Samson's screenplay was amazing. (He's always amazing.)
