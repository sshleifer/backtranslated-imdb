I could not wait to get my hands on this issue when I was about to p. Yes. In a film with a script, I get mixed up with George Burns and Gracie Allen. Oddhaus and music by Gordhurins. It is certainly valuable, but Fred and Gada are lacking in the collective quality of films. <br /> <br /> It might be better to read the story in the good-hearted chest, where the humor gets better. It is painful to see some of the acting (especially young boys and girls). <br /> <br /> But ...! Funhouse dance is worth more than most movies. Grassie Allen could not dance, but I did not know, but the boy is in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain one of those thorn disks in a fun room? Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She puts up surprisingly with Astaire and adds extensive quality of pictures. <br /> <br /> There are many beautiful songs, especially fun fun if you can get it and high leap is tough. <br /> <br /> Recommended for Astaire, Barnes and Allen fans. I had to go back and watch the funhouse dance again as the credit rolled.
