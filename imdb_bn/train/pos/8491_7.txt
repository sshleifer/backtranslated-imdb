I saw this movie when it was new. After that I hired it here in Japan for three years, I was scared that when I saw the strict light of my expanded international experience, I would cringe. How amazed how the film depicts the conflict of culture between Japan and Pennsylvania (where I am from). All the elements are not really spots, but the tone is perfect. <br /> <br /> I'm still in Japan many years later, and I can enjoy this picture in both stories and even interacting stories. Interestingly, Japanese-American actors spoke mainly Japanese in Japan, but the dialogue was restarted to consolidate the problem of second language delivery in contact with Japanese version. <br /> <br /> I found that a reviewer used it in Japanese class. I think you can learn more about what this movie can expect from a face-to-face with Japan rather than reading "deadly" books with Japan (mostly written in the 80's and financed by promoting Japanese companies). <<br /> <br /> One of the other things, Japan wants to build cars in the US, it seems impossible without a star critics to make an idiot by dragging in an average rating. (Of course, the Japanese work in many factories and avoid customers to be close and trade friction.) This is a very warm and fun movie that I will not be at a higher rate, it is not for a 80-like clinic, such as dance sugar electronic disco music. Michael Keaton has never been funnier.
