This is a wonderful movie. It is about many things: the search for a serial killer, the Soviet Russian nobility, a person's carriage, and the relationship between the person (lead detective) and his superior. <br /> <br /> The relationship between that stick with Durokov (Rea) and Fetisov (Sutherland) (excuse the bad spell, please!). For some reason, it is turning their evolution into hostility and crime and respecting cameras and working together. A line in the movie highlights its meaning for me: "She would say a little bit malicious, but she got emotionally defeated. <br /> <br /> All customs, even small portions are done with credibility. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast action thriller; Actually, it's time to move like a slow play, but it's worth it. It is very satisfied and is not exploitative about crime. <br /> <br />
