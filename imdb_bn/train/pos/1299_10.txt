I caught a bit of public concerts in this concert and knew I had it. The boys give Royal Albert a wonderful, often exciting adventure in every way. Pure, too much - no compression, no smoke-breathing laser and strobe, a rural entrance (and an unknown, serious, and respectful listener, each of which leaves their bottle rockets). <br /> <br /> If you are a cream fan (or if you just heard about them); If you are a fan of blues; If you're a rock 'n' roll fan; You will not be disappointed when you see this DVD and hear it. You will never lose this DVD because you do not lend it to anyone. (This DVD supports selfishness! Tell them to get their own!) It's very good and very replayable; You want to keep it in easy reach.
