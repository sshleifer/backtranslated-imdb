Human Tornado (1976) is a much better film than its predecessor. He played the director on Rudi Ray Moore's limitation and acted as an actor. This is a fun movie which is more technically sound and acting. Actors do not take themselves very seriously and think that everyone is joking and goes with the flow. Rudi Ray seems to be more comfortable in front of Moore's camera and is not as strong as Dommeet. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed this picture and I highly recommend it. Like his first movie, it is focused on a particular audience (I am very doubtful that Mr. Moore is trying to expand his audience at this time in his career). Check it out! <br /> <br /> Hygiene recommendation.
