It was my number one number until 1991, but it defeats the splendid JFK. This is such a wonderful movie! I love it I love stories where different characters' lives intersect with others and how to deal with their life. Kevin Kline is good here, but Danny Glover and especially Steve Martin have outscanned. I never liked Martin or his style, but here he is great. I like the whole lecture given to Kline near the end of the Grand Canyon. The writing was nice. Larry Kashdan, IMO, Kevin Smith and Quantin Tarantino, a great dialogue writer. Here, he has formed several three-dimensional letters and thinks stories well, and has given us a positive feeling of life. A really nice film. 4 stars out 4
