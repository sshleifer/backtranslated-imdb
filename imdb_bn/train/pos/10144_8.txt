But the fun ride. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is very enjoyable, not only the eyes are both very easy, comedy from the supporting cast and the joke has really made me laugh quite several times. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's an exciting romantic comedy. But the point is it's a sweet story, the message about finding one true love in your true ring in many ways. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is dead and all parts of the acting are doing well, and on the top for the comic effect. How big is the weight of the Bulgarian scene, the honorable honorable actress! For those who made it to be predictable - if you want a movie that has twists and turns which you guess ... then you want a thriller. This is a romantic comedy ... it touched my heart and I realized that I was lucky enough to really love my life, and it was the best effort on the way. <br /> <br /> Great movie for a great movie, a happy tears ...
