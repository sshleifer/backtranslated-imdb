BigS does not play with tabos or strengthening the agenda, tell Mensia or Chappell (though I like them both). He is subtle, clear nervous commentary in the obvious states. His show will not change the world, or it is meant to be. But, Mr. With the show's famous Brian Pousen and the former boyfriend of Jean-Pierre Brewster J Johnston, this is an average demonstration of the hunger's desperation! My side was destroyed thoroughly by the first episode. Look, I love this woman and she just provides lines like Jimmy Kimmel and lets her go with the audience. The best kind of comedy around. Some like the second episode "Mary Poppins" and make others obscure when they comment on the existence of society and college in singing to fake birds. This one is highly recommended, but only those who have a funny bone (and their most recent lippo-suction treatment or boob work does not lose it) only.
