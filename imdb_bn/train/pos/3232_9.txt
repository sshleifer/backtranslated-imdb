I went to see this phishing film and I said it was one of the best movies of this year. Conspiracy consists of 5-6 different stories, all being held the same day in the same little Finnish town. The stories come together nicely, reminds me, remembering how Tarantino's movies have been made. Most actors have performed very well, which is essential for these realistic plays. I especially enjoyed Sana Hittala, main actress and Juhu Kouenen. I have found that the information about the IMDB Sana has got the wrong information. His name, you may have noticed my review;), Heikkil√§ not, but Hitala
