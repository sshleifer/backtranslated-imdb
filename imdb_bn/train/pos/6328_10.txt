It is very pleasant to get a huge piece of art converted into another form without distortion or enthusiasm. I did not assume that such a great part of literature can be resurrected as a movie to watch. If you like Bagakvabh's book, you are really afraid to see more confusing explanations for the art-film project rather than taking the deeper meaning of the story onto the screen. There are a few examples of this with Master and Margarita. As complex as the story and carrying, the movie leaves nothing. It seems as if the filmmaker Bulkakov's work likewise reads an orchestral conductor score - does not miss a note. Why can not we find such talent in the United States? So now my favorite books and movies have the same title.
