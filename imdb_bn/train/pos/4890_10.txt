Pretty Cast, more please! <br /> <br /> If you can catch anything else written by Plater (or acting this wonderful actor) Jazz has real feelings for anyone who does not know the plate, I recommend that whenever you see 'Bidarbeck' trilogy. <br /> <br /> "There are three types of jazz - hot, cool and what time does the melody start? '"
