This movie probably did not create a blip on the radar screen, but its quality is very low. It's pretty animated, yet you think "it's just a movie." Duvall and off-portrayed ordinary people, and you can not even understand they even big names actors. It seems that to avoid Eugene's girlfriend, the quarrel in this story is very old, but I think it is possible. It seems that the child will travel from Montana to Nevada, but I think it is possible. You might think that the family problems of this movie will never happen in your own family, but I think it is possible. I think Glenn Off is saying something like "You feel that your work is the hardest part of your life, but it's not."
