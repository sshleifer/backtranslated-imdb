In one movie, many wonderful actresses act as a real invitation to a local movie house, so I responded appropriately. Here are some comments ... <br /> <br /> Venacea Redgrave is superb while in bed. He feels very old and I do not think that it is a good thing for the movie which is achieved with many make-up, but sad things for movie-gear. I think his aging is getting a bit rigid in recent years. Claire Dance continues her return to the film and exudes a certain warmth. In both the physical appearance and acting style, Mamie Gammer's similarity to her Marie Streep is so frustrating that I've lost my concentration in the film for a few minutes of her entry. He is wonderful; But there is a similarity to the danger of working against his favor. I agree with the previous comment: Natasha Richard had definitely some plastic work on her face. He certainly does not think of how he thinks of his earlier films ("Nell", for example). He and Tony Colette do not suffer very unhappy because they are not believers as sisters. Their interplay weakens Tony Collette is also very old ways for his character. Glen Off and Merrill Strip have more screen time. Strip's performance is actually a little more than a camio. On the other hand, his scenes have a great emotional resonance compared to the rest of the film. Aileen Atkins gives some welcomed dry wit, especially his second role as the legendary night companion of the character of Redgrave. As for men; Hugh Dancy made this movie enlightening a lot, though he gave a broader performance than required. As soon as the story comes out of the story, the drag begins. For his achievements, he guided the audience to create the proper necessity for logistical attraction. On the other hand, Patrick Wilson is a totally inactive at the center of the film. His misfortune is that this script is so deadly by three people (a man among them) so many people? This backstage should be improved. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is as nice as expected. But the main summer house set failed to convince me. It is not natural on that rocky hill, especially with the grass patches in front. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Deadline and consequently it failed to affect me on what I expected from a tierjarker. However, it is still about passing time, about managed to be thoughtful about the expectation of life and about the amount of what this amount is not met. If you are not in the movie try at least DVD ...
