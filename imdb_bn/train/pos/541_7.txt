As a signal, this is not a bad movie. Actually I liked it better than the first choice. I got more entertainment in it. It seems that this documentary style was shot. First of all, it bothered me, I thought it was too low to budget. But it grew on me, and it seemed to be more pure than the movie. A dry fish has dried up to the original movie, which is my opinion. It's pretty good. I think they've gone up most of the time. Some of the scenes and characters. It almost becomes a parody of itself, which can be the point. There is at least some mysteries in this film, which was not the first, in my view it is from the same great original music, which is wonderful He played quite again in most cases, although I said, some of it was at the top. I also felt that the movie has lost much speed in the end and there are a few minutes that really feel slower and do not seem to flow just like the rest of the movie. However, I thought it was a nice seagull. Y rating for "return to cabin by lake" 7/10 *
