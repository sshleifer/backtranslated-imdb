Yes ... I'm going 1-0 and here's why. Over the past few years, I've seen a number of comedies and paid a few hours of laughing fee for a few laughs and some videos because the movies were easy to forget. Then I stumble on "nothing". Looked interesting, although there was not much hope. I was roasted. This was probably one of the most fun movies I had a chance to watch. Dave and Andrew made a great comedic pair and humor was memorable enough, but the curiosity was not complicated for the absence of absence. I do not want to comment on any real scenes, because I think it's a movie that is valuable to watch once. The film has more meaningful ideas coming out (you know that the killer military jets and "fresh" remakes that are destroying old classics), this movie will be happy to tell you it is okay to say "nothing".
