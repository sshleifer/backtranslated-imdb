<br /> <br /> I really liked this picture. Hollywood is one of the rare films that are not really created anymore. William H. Messi is as great as a man with a soul, and Neve Campbell has just flattened like a woman who gave her life on the way to salvation. <br /> <br /> If you have a chance, see this picture. It earns praise on it
