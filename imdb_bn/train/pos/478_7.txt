I am rather surprised that any critic has commented on the initial chess mistakes as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the immediate final of Lucien's game. Despite the use of Jonathan Spellman as a chess consultant, Luigin showed the game with an illegal move. After adjusting the lazin to the fast-running and returning to the board, after finishing the queen one sacrifice in sacrifice, it is not difficult to make it clear that her 1st rouge still pins with a black-colored ants on her road at C1. In this way, he is unable to run the illegal maternity rudder Rd1-D8 which could be illegal - but he showed it to the congratulatory congratulations from the audience.
