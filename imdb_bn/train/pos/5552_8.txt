I wait till July 4 for this writing. . . Well . . Because it feels right to do this right on this day. <br /> <br /> in 1924. Griffith needed a hit, he was not older than Storm's Orphans (1921). Still, he was working hard but his films were distant and failed to hit the right word with the audience. He is planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by the girls of American American Revolution, who asked whether he could extend his ideas to further expand the American revolution. This movie results. In the end, he had received 14 reel history lessons and Patrick Henry had no trace of his own. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of revolutionary warfare, but Griffiths ran into a love story. Patriot farmer Nathan (Blue Hamilton) fell in love with Tory's noble Nancy Montgeg (a leading female carol dempster for grillefish). Nancy's father hates Nathan, who is complaining about the complicated issue. . . Not good Nathan, he hates all the rebels. During the clashes in Lexington's road, someone destroys Nathan's arm and injures Nancy's father. <br /> <br /> Reflecting on the love story (Most of the facts, but partly a story of Captain Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) describes the story of the British officer, who thinks he has not given any loyalty, and thousands of Indians form six nations beside him. Expected to overthrow the colonists and become the prince of his kingdom. <br /> <br /> Compared with the birth of a nation (1915), Aniba Ringtones may be like Cameron from the previous picture of the family, Nathan Stonman may be a part of the family, the same scene is played with the continuous attack of a nation with the aggressive army of the Banker Hill, in which, a number of red coats packed with Patriots blazed. The only absence Henry Walthell no man's Land Jude  ে একটি কামানের ঠোঁটে একটি পতাকা রাখার জন্য চার্জ করছেন। বিস্ময়করভাবে আমেরিকাতে যুদ্ধক্ষেত্রের দৃশ্যগুলি জন্মের দৃশ্যের শক্তির অভাব বলে মনে হয় এবং দর্শকদের আকর্ষণ করতে ব্যর্থ হয়। কিছুটা স্পষ্টভাবে অনুপস্থিত। এটা সুযোগ নয়, জি। "বিলি" বিজারের ক্যামেরা কাজ বেশ ভাল। What is probably missing is . . Courage I say it. . . Sincerely? <br /> <br /> While Captain Butler and his men are well underscores, it is mostly in long shots or offscreen. We do not expect the intimacy that lopped off in any close-closeup of the head (1916). At one point, Captain Harley (Louis Olive) opened the eyes of a prisoner colonist at Butler's second command. We only see the beginning of the deed, for the rest of the part the camera focuses on Hare's face because he must have done a good time to do this. Lionel was working with Griffith since 1912 and with shutdown. One story tells that he works with Griffith and D. D. To know the fame of his famous family, he said, "I am not employing a stage actor." Which Lienel replied "And I'm not kind of like, sir!" She makes a very good and quite credible villain. Louis Ullah presented Lionel's elder brother John three times; In Shark Holmes and DR Jakeel and M.R. Head (both 1920) and later Tempest (1927). Like his Captain Heer, her wild sleeping eyes and vivid hair do not recognize her just as a villain, but you think she is very crazy. <br /> <br /> Blue Hamilton later commented that America was the first time in Horsbach and "I was afraid of death." He has hid his dissatisfaction very well and we can believe that he was quite cavalier at the end of the shooting. Mr. Griffith loved Carroll Dempster, and at one point he asked him to marry him. He refused and soon left his stock company, after which his star status gradually fell violently. <br /> <br /> There was an accidental moment when telling the horse, which came during the filming of Paul Revoire. He rides his horse directly into the front porch in front of a family "Arms! The rules are coming!" But he is trying to leave the horse, behind him can not spread his rider in step-by-step! I'm surprised Griffith did not accept another one. <br /> <br /> So America is classic? Yes! Do not wait to see it on July 4th, it is enjoyable anytime.
