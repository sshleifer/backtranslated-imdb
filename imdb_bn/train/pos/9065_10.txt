Looking at the advertisements for this movie, I was pretty sure I was going to hate it. One by one, it was one of the "neutral" films based on the novel, which generally denies the book's author scripts, hates, and refuses to engage with the film. Worse, the trailer proved to be the most hypnotic skeptic imaginable (eg the child encounters the hose of the garden ... and falls). So when my younger brother began to think that this season must be "definitely seen" (of course, he is "cursed", "over the hedge", "The anne bouleley", "monster house", etc., etc.) I was very less than thrilling. <br /> <br /> But once in the theater, the film won me a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the authors are better than 'child dialog' than any child's movie. A primary example of this is that it consumes a worm trapped mainly by eggs of eggs in the boys' eggs. The boys are tall, giving the main exaggerated impression of the main lecture, which makes it absolutely realistic because all the little kids (inaccurately) think that they make the expressions of their adult pains great Then one of the boys asked, "Why did he say, 'olympic'?" Hey! John boy replies, "Maybe he is crazy!" And the whole group is a happy smile, not an overly malicious rejoinder, but just one thing will come with the child spot and will properly be happy with his age children. When the screen is called on-screen, my baby laughs smile; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is estimated that the child in school, and colleague pressure / without making any of them They were concubines for some school specialties. For example, the bandit (joe) is not stereotypical; He is clearly bad but not pure evil, and the person that has expressed enough life of his house feels sympathy for him and understands the origin of his bullying. Billy ('Worm Boy') is able to understand a supplementary tool for his younger brother Udai and at the end of the film some small adaptations have been made, at the moment it is not "centered around dramatic music". Characters solve the situation and they have some reality here related to each other, and it is rarely arbitrary. <br /> <br /> The only error in the film is the makers of the notable McDonalds dancing group "Mac and Me", even an extraordinary humorous dance scene. Oh why is it kept in the movie ?? Austin Rogers (Adam) pulls a Maclaw Coolkin and does not refuse to accept the role until he has a car given to show his impressive dance skills? The whole sequence must not be there compared to any event given in "The History Channel" and there were fewer comical values. <br /> <br /> Overall, this film was nice and length hours and twenty minutes) was almost perfect. If you are often close to a child or are just a child, remember that one of the best, most realistic live action kidd films.
