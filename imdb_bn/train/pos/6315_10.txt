Welcome to Collinwood, but it does not have any of the following: <br /> <br /> George Clooney star car Unfunny Un-Original <br /> And yes I know, the movie based on its other movies. But as far as Hollywood goes, they can rank with the most authentic outputs in this decade - and for me, it does. <br /> <br /> The movie starts from the beginning, an absolute gas. Here's why <br /> <br /> No bad performance in the movie. Funny part is fun The elegant part is edgy. There is not a dull moment in script dialogue, cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. And it's not compatible with Hollywood's ideology (you'll see what you'll understand when you watch a movie) <br /> <br /> When I was a kid, I thought I was watching ads for the film. Without making too much of the box office, the film went under the radar, even though it was not a classical classic. Because Transformer 2 is seen as acceptable by the average movie viewer, because it is used to see Transformer 2. If the film is original and fun, it is often pumped as a million pieces **. The cinematic experience will be a lot more new - <br /> <br /> When they say that they do not, they're welcome to 'Collinwood'. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy is a funny, mini-masterpiece, which refuses to compromise. One of my favorites.
