Yaitate !! Japan is really fun show and I really like it! It was recently shown in our country at 5:30 pm on Hero TV and ABS-CBN. It is about Azumu Kazuma, who is trying to fulfill the dreams of making Japan's bread which will represent her country. He is working in the Southern Too branch of Pantasia and he is helping his friend (Sukino Azusagawa) with other friends (such as Kaawaki Kuesuk and Kanumuri Sheungur) to keep control of Saint Pierre beat and Pantasia. They fight with other skilled unemployed from many other countries and can not learn how to cook different foods, but they can learn to cook other foods. This is a fun and unique animation because it imitates the characters of other animi (like Naruto, Detective Conan and One Piece) and famous people in real life. It is one of the best works of Tashi Hashigguc and people of different ages must watch it.
