This is not quite a simple but very charming movie. There was a time when I could see why Chair won the Academy Award for Best Actress, but why did Glenn Close not win for a fierce attraction, at other times there was also. However, Oscar and the Golden Globe winner, and BAFTA nominated Cher Lorraine Castrini played, a general woman with a low salary, whom Mrs. Jamie Camerrey (Danny ILO) requested to marry her. She promised her that she will come back within a month, as her mother is sick, so that means when her family will be present for as much as possible for the wedding. The only problem is, when he found Jonny's unconscious brother Ronnie (nominated Nicholas Cage for the Golden Globe), they started to start a relationship and the love for the moon scene was going on (where the title came). Oscar also nominated Ross Casserini and John Mahine as Perry as Cosmo Castricini, Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winner Olympia Dukakis. It ends with a wedding for Johnny and Lorete, but he and Ronnie were happy together. It won Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay was written directly for the screen, and it was nominated for Best Picture of Hitman (Hit of Night) and it was nominated for Best Picture for Dick Hymn and Best for Best Score BAFTAs. Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Golden Globes - Comedy / Musical and Best Playplay Play for Best Motion Picture. It was 100 years 100 years, 100 coats ("snap!"), It was 100 years, 17 numbers in 100 steps and 100 numbers for 100 years, 100 smiles. very good!
