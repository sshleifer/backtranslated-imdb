I like this movie. When a bank's gold dies in gold worth $ 40 million, its cell mate is used as a "byte" for conducting "hyback crazy killer partner"). This is a verb, the Spy Type film will keep it light in a considerable comical scene. This reminds me of the enemy of the state. Good acting and good enough plot is good.
