I saw many years after the television series and, initially, I did not take care of it. Then, my memories of the series diminished over time, I saw it again, and it is absolutely sunny. Based on the blue Simon's platform, it has not been 'open' for the big screen, and it's one of its strengths. Walter Matthews and Jack Lemon are brighter like Ashker and Felix, and supporter cast wonderful, especially John Fields 'Vinnie'. Even now, a few moments can reduce me to laughs - Felix dubs an Oscar in the mid-ball with the request of the dinner, followed by Oscar's crack and Felix around Apple, the stories of physics 'Kabutar' are reduced by Felix's story, and of course, legendary cafeteria The scene (later, Nora burst through Ephrons 'when Harry Met Sally'). Razor-sharp dialogue too When the boys think Felix has taken too much, Oscar says: "They can be Vitamin! They can be healthy in the room!". Fantastic!
