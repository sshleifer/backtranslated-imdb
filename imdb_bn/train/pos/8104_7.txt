This is an amazing movie since 1936. Although the first hour is not very interesting (for modern viewers), the stylish outlook of the year 2036 comes later. However, the dialogue will not be able to understand all - sound quality and pronunciation (it's American - but "1930's" American) makes it difficult. <br /> <br /> Originally, the story is known as "Evertai" in an imaginary 100-year-old American city. When it was a war since 1936, when the technology progressed in 2036 and created its own problem, it expanded since 1936. <br /> <br /> The first one hour is a little slower - even though the viewers say it's hard to say back then. Events, mysteries and visuals today are very few in origin. However, when it gets in the future, it's just normal fun to see it. Large set and retrograde science-it is difficult to draw attention to everything. <br /> <br /> As long as you have hearing power, this movie is hard to hear. I think only 80% of the dialogue is understood. It can use closed-captioning. <br /> <br /> If you're a science-fan fan, it's one of the classics and it must be seen (well, at least for the first hour). For the average viewer, wait for the closed version of the closed capacitor, and then see if you are comfortable with the movies of this time.
