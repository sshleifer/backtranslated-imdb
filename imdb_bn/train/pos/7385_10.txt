All of those who think it's 1. This was a boring broadcast 2. Hell Barry and Dingle Washington did not deserve their Oscars <br /> <br /> <br /> Mother-mother ** ** UP !! This is one of the reasons for the best program of the Single Academy Award. 1. It was a moment for being a black actor "Black Actress" won the Academy Award for Best Actress, so many of our black sisters have ignored Academy for many years. Being honest, I stopped showing academy prizes because of lack of variety among the winners or nominees. To me it was a group of white people, each other scrambled. There were many opportunities to vote for black actors at the Academy alone, such as Alfred Wiederd, Hypie Goldberg, Diana Ross, Mary Jean Batis, but it was not 2. Hell Barry was competent that the Academy of Oscars was not under the pressure of voting for her. Actress has been ignored. Most of the academy is comprised of white voters. Yes Yes Nicole Kidman sings very nicely to anger! But there was a time when black people were in these awards show. Mr. For the Academy, the academy gave him big time after the absence of this wrong. For Malcomax. The people you think of as a nation are not "probably white people" in the film industry, it is often reducing the most talented black actresses to stereo made by white people. It seems a black woman does not exist or "Angela Basset". I hope many people in white do not understand anything because they have never had to face anybody. It must be thought that they are suppressing it
