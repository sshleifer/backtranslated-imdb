This film is Sophmoric. However, it's fun as all fun. It shows "boys locker room mentality" being played by "other aspects". Like tides turned and they are good to see how stupid they are. But most probably it is not news to most women because (only ask one), "they've heard all before". <br /> <br /> See it with a small group or mixed gender group and 97.3% of the room will laugh for 2 hours straight. And another 2.7% ... can you really make them really?
