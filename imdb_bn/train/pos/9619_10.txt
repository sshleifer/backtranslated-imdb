Okay, then ask 10 for 10 2/2 star movie ... ... look better and it will be more sensible. Never hit together the visible scenes of Hitcoi .... The film is shamelessly visible from the beginning and even then You do not get the feeling of spreading it sometimes by trying to try it for a variety of developments. You feel that the letters will show you something unusual about yourself and they will not disappoint you when they do it. With the extraordinary story of screenwriter / producer Phil Hey's life, with the fantastic soundtrack you feel more about the 6th degree separation than the same title movie ... I'm looking for more good things from this producer.
