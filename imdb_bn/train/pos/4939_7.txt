This movie is not great, but it's a good and enjoyable one. It seems like an indie film made from a game script. Director Morde Freeman originally played himself, though the director did not write the script for him. And for the research of such a film, the actress has a little bit of superfine going on a supercart, which she is still not committed to. I mean, he really made the film till the end and we are seeing it :) <br /> <br /> I get a very positive dialogue for my taste, but it's refreshing. This is a film that inspires viewers to focus on their own living and choose the order. <br /> <br /> The following line: A nice little movie made in two weeks, basically two actors and a few extra, dialogue performances, makes Morgan Freeman look. Good :)
