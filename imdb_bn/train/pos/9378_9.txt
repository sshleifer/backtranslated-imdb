Dahl Weatherers seem to be under the influence of 'American Friend'. Innocent Nick Cage gets recruited for a hit. Dennis Hopper played a real hit man. Lara Flin Bail is dangerous. He tries to overthrow himself, trying to impose himself more on heroes. And the small town America does not seem to be safer than the Big City. Like the predecessor mentioned above, this movie has many plots twists and turns that seem unlikely, but all cathartic leads to self discovery.
