I got the privilege of showing this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A traditional Chinese village has a traditional bath room, Comes to come Dad has a son's son: A 'defended' boy who lives with him and a boy who lives in a big modern town and comes to visit him. This boy seems to be strange and annoying to the traditional village, bath room and his 'bored brother', but this change happened with this film. <br /> <br /> Although the story may be chic or cliche, it may not be. Really great acting, especially the father and the 'defended' son (sorry, I do not know their name) and at the same time had a movie touch and funny story together. You got a chance to see it in this movie. It's a great alternative to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br />
