If you do not ever watch this movie and are not like old actors of old times, then this movie is for you. Frank Sinatra is very young and very abusive, and a nice voice that sings some nice old songs. Michel Morgan, (Mili Pico), has performed outstanding with many dances and music numbers. Leone Errol, (Cyrus Drake) played a great supporter with Victor Bourge (Victor of Sir Victor Fitzroy), who performed classical piano and a slap stick comedy in his career. This is not a great musical, but Frank Sinatra was very happy to see his career starting in the 1940s.
