I was so happy throughout this insightful documentary, and I waited for it through pipes (my local video chains), and it was worth the wait. I like a good documentary / special interest piece, but it's definitely your heartfelt, honest, and nostalgic, if you want, then look back at the teenage age. Imagine a child's imagination, and where a great story begins. If you like a good, funny and all-entertaining documentary, rent it or buy it. Mr. Stein and the company must have seen many ways around the context of bank holo-ups in the video hamcoder premises and crafting gay-rings from a glance. They all seem to be more successful than the respected field, and it is good to know that they are still good friends. The DVD has several additional trailers for other good documentaries and it combines the most notable productions of Darren with Crazy News.
