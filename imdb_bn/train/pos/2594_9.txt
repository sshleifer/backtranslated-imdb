This film has taken Jack Spring's view of super-human power. "Weddings Napolam" I'm the theme-based movie genre that I love, the ideas of American generation are defined by their gifts or their hiding efforts. At the same time, the film indicates that every progress is only human, and no other person can be afraid or worshiped. It was a great comedy, fun and a little ironic edge of the human.
