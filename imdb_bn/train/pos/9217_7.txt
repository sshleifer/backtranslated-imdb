This truly funny movie is a Johnny Cast of Characters, a thick middle-aged woman in Hollywood and a touching, funny love story. Copomazza and Malacassi rival caterers in Italian neighborhoods in New York. They are the opposite - extreme - the taste scale ends. Their son Romeo and Juliet played a major role in the production of a church. Naturally, they fall in love. On the stage! The reason for Maoism and confusion is that parents are playing against each other and their children, the glorious house of Capomajas, and the marriage of their superb tasting marriage. <br /> <br /> As well as among four top parents and charming young lovers, one of the characters is a strange prince, a common granny grandma, a woman who passes waves with a fold and spiritual advice, from a medium called The Booking Rosko. Become received. Like a seat behind a car, and a total of shapes with two hoses. There is no sight or punch line that does not click on this fast movie. <br /> <br /> Even the name of the family of two families is a fun part. "Komomazza" can be interpreted as "low-brows," and "malaki" means "snatching snob." <br /> <br /> If you are sensitive about Italian stereotype, you can not like this movie. If Bate Miller is embarrassed to you, you can not like it because all the women actors in this movie watched Bate Middle like Stewart. The rest of us should love it!
