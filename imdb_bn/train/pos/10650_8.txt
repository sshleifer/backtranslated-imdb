I rented this movie this past weekend, cranked the sound system around, and got some great sound from the special effects. This movie is a great movie rental, specially affecting my fiance, but I have seen some amazingly made computers. I did not go to the movies and see it, but it does not look like finding a scary late night movie. I would recommend it!
