The unexpected appearance of the first cousin of Edith Bauer's Bear (Big Eddie) and his daughter (Little Eddie) aunt and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. They reside in the streets, living in the Randown Palace, which is considered as a health risk by the city. It quickly becomes very clear that these two are wonderful surprises. Little Eddie thinks he has worked with a ten-year-old mentality even though he is 53 years old. The content consists mostly of two things. The first conversation was the Little Eddie Lomsts Big Ed, which is running its potential suitors and wasting his aspiring career as a writer, actress and dancer. These discussions are usually very decorated, unconscious, and often entertained. The second part is composed by both sides of the lengthy part of the song. Each certainly feels perfect to sing their songs and it seems only to those who are bad. In a marvelous scene, Big Eddy actually physically attacks Little Eddie with his dog so that he can stop his fight. Too much attention is still a feeling that they have some serious exploitation here and things have gone too far. The filmmakers seem to behave like a fuq show in the circus, which is coming to record annihilation (and chocolate) records every day. Finally it is a sad picture that shows how both of them have gone past in this world. Their expectations and dreams are in the palaces, which are damages. Despite their anxiety, these two need more than ever before. There is no shelter from loneliness for others. The most amazing line comes from the Big Eid, many of which cure itself around its bedroom. Complaining about the smell its reaction is easily incredible.
