This is a good movie, though people with modesy blues comics and books find it a little slow and lacking in work. For the Modesi fan, the film will be very enjoyable, especially because it is very trustworthy in the presentation of "History" of Modesi Blaise. Peter O'Donnell has been credited as a "Creative Consultant" by creditors and filmmakers have actually paid attention to him because the details presented in comic books follow closely in Plot Years (though the events have been recast for modern day). The only thing that can be a real fad is the Wiley Gervain in the story. This loss of Willie has again become faithful to Moddie Blaise's chronology, as the film happens at the very early days of the career of Moddae. Alexandra Staden creates a very believable young model, who actually sees a lot like Modaccio wanted to see. Monica VT is a welcome change from the film's humor to the brain's screenplay.
