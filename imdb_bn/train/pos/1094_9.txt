This is one of the few comedy I can see repeatedly and still loud out loud. In other places, I have complained about racism and sexuality, politically correct prez. There is no such thing here, unless you appoint racism as a woman, as a woman, as a woman of racism and racism as a slave. <br /> <br /> The lines are lovely, and all the leads have never been good. Melvin Douglas is especially bright. <br /> <br /> If you ever try to try or create a new house, you will know how the process is boring, yet how important a lamb is. Feel like a lamb, you're not alone!
