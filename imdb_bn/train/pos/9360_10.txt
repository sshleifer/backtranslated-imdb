At the age of 34 I started speaking, I suddenly became a widow. I was devastated because he was not sick --- he died unexpectedly in a coronary --- his carotid swelling - he died behind our house. Many were imagined from the police, because he was a bit violent and poured his head. Until the devil came back I was suspected of murder. <br /> <br /> My kids were frustrating like me, so they love it with a good father. I had three small children, no education, no financial assistance. I took it very difficult, to take it. <br /> <br /> In my two years, my mother-in-law demands me verbal, physical, emotionally and spiritually, that I do not show sorrow in front of children and wear masks and see what they wanted to see, not showing them my pain during the holidays ... no one was standing for me and was busy pretending to be on a holiday, certainly like the pain therapist who advised me to follow my heart and soul. Was. My mother-in-law does not get it! It has changed with them for my relationship, and I have never returned for the holidays. This is just an example of how insulting my sorrow was! When my own (new) husband shares me with my soul, then I fall after talking about this injury. I break down, can not breathe, hypervontill, and usually try to reveal hidden pain, but it is usually disabled for a few days. <br /> <br /> About this movie now <br /> <br /> Today my soul has become excited, my heart is broken. This fear and pain of my film is presented by the real ghosts; How saddened how others expect us to be in the demons too. Adam Sandler has shown quite horrible torment that you face, overcome and work with your own time most! The film has been trying to cope with the pain I have faced over the years. You see, when your soul is so deeply affected, the words that come from your mouth at such a point of thinking are so deep, if you do not want to die and you will not be able to deal with it without living. <br /> <br /> There is a Bible book, Romans 8:26 which I do not want to know about my face and soul, what should we pray, that the Holy Spirit of God carries the pain on God's foot - I have to talk to No Sandler illustrates that perfection! <br /> <br /> there is a scene where he has been transferred to the court hearing for the promise of mental health, and he has to face his father-in-law --- (known to me) --- and he told them that he Every stunning truth is said that he takes every second, that he can not get over. It's a deep, strong, and powerful performance. I started flooding and after walking from theater, the wards looked very weak in my legs. My son was with me and it was the first hand, while trying to hold my right pace together; One lesson for him, the youngest of me, who rarely thinks of his father. It has been 13 years for me but this movie has returned to me when I lost my father-in-law, when they surrendered to my wishes instead of my emotional mask and my own will. <br /> <br /> I write this so that if you are a boy, then you are ready for this movie, but recommend it to 1000-star actress Sandler. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are not yet a summer, then send a lesson from her movie and hear and accept the public preferences of them, let them find peace in their own time! Sometimes, the soul can not utter the word to express our pain. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie with tissue and do not take it to your soul!
