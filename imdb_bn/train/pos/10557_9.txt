This was seen at the 2003 Vancouver International Film Festival and it was a hell and a little over-exaggerated. Takes place in Toronto, where these two victims live in this run-down house in the middle of a freeway system. David Hewlett (Pin, Cu, Cipher) and Andrew Miller (CUBE) are just as frustrating as two disappointments, who want to leave the world. Acting, dialogue and writing is very good, and the whole film looks great for such a low budget flick. Director / writer Vinceenzo Natalie was present at this screening and he considered it so intelligent and down-to-earth. This guy is so inventive with these great stories that it works so well in the small budget, so it is a big budget Hollywood shirt for shame!
