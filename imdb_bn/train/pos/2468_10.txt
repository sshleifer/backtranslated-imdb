I went to see Hamlet because I was in the job. I figured it would be great for 4 hours, I have been a fan of Branagh; Dead again, Henry V. I was totally surprised by the direction, acting, and cinematography that I took on this film. Other reviews like to pass for 4 hours fast. Brunge does not play Hamlet, he is Hamlet, he was born for this. When I see this movie, I am constantly trying to find the error, I have not looked at the fools. A mystery to me was how she was able to remove the camera with all the mirrors and beyond. This movie was shot in 70 million. It is a shame that Colombia has not released a widescreen version of its VHS version. I own a DVD player, and I'd like to take this on the Titanic any day. So if you're listening to Colombia then how should this picture be viewed? And I do not know what happened in Oscars. This should be the best picture, best actor, best direction, best cinematography touches. What are they watching movies? When I pay tribute to Shakespeare on the screen, I'm sorry for Branhaus in the Oscars. They could have respected Brangh to bring one of our greatest films of all time.
