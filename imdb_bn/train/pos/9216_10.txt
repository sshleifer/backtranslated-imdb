Stupid, stupid, stupid I think today Angelina Jolie is perhaps one of the most gifted actresses, but a movie like her is not worth her time. He deserves well, and so everyone else in this movie. The talent is just wasted. Sorry, but I do not think to write a review for this. <br /> <br /> I'm not big in it *****.
