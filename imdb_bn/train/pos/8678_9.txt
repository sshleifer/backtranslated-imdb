Peace committee boss? Clearly. After violent start with Spike, Tom and Jerry leaned towards each other, Boych stalled and asked why. This is a good question. <br /> <br /> "Cats can go next to dogs, is not it?" He asked Tom, who bowed down in the contract. "Can the mouse get along the cat, right?" Jerry nods "no," and then see that the correct answer is not. <br /> <br /> They go in and draw up a "peace treaty" (complete with professional artwork!). Most of the rest and cartoons are three of them very nice to each other, which is a spontaneous change-speed. I found it fun to see I'm one million people of these cartoons that can face each other over each head. <br /> <br /> However, you know the peace will not end. A large part of Steak touched the "peace treaty" death, but it was a nice change and still the usual Tom and Jerry were some of the trick.
