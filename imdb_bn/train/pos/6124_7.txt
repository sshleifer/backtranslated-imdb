This movie is silly as hell! I think it was written as a serious movie, but then when it comes to filming, Michael Koni said, "Hey, throw in some ridiculous and spice!" Characters are actually slightly enhanced. Oh, and the best of the order of death. One thing that I hated was hair arms. What was that about all?
