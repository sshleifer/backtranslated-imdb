breathtaking, this is the best animated cartoon ever made of doubt. I saw the fort in the sky as a child in the late 80's and it left a lasting impression. I went through the years and I forgot the title of the movie, and I found this masterpiece again with the opportunity to browse the internet. After reading reviews and analyzes of other people, I am amazed that such praise is so impressive and it reaches a lot because it gives an impression. A true fantasy adventure, one must look for all children and adults. It's not the best to keep the story away, so I'll tell you that this movie is a clear and open mind. If your kids treat them, then I promise you they will like it. There is not much to say about this piece of art, but if you do not see it and enjoy it.
