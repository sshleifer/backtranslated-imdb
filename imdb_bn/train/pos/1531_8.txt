Most of the BBC1's Diagnosis Murders were shown at noon in the weekend because I was sick 10 years ago from the school while I was ill - I know I can not really enjoy it, in the same way I can not enjoy what Murray wrote. But I totally I'm addicted and even have DVD box sets ... OK I know it's tragic! <br /> <br /> Dick Van Dyke has conducted this event, such as Dr. Marc Slaan, a doctor at the Community General Hospital of LA, a police consultant from LAPD - his son Steve (Barry Van Dyke - Son of the real life of Dick) is a police officer who needs his father's help in many suspicious deaths. <br /> <br /> as well as this journey. Amanda Bentley (Victoria Bentley) General of the Community Resident Disease Specialist and Dr. For the first few episodes of Scott Bawr with Jack Stuart, who left the series and left. In 1995, there was the hope of going to be bigger and better things ... He should stay where he was, yet he did not take notes ... and for many years his only theatrical appearance was Baby Genius 2: Superbabies Oh dear! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />> The series is extremely unlikely but what is the series of the hodunit? (He writes - wherever Jessica goes, someone is dead, or the father's dowling mysteries, with the murder of Priest with Noon Sidekick). <br /> <br /> This series was very light until 1997, because it was cast in 1997 by Delaware Hall, a supporter of the Nurse and Mark Secretary Dollars as well as a left-wing hospital manager, Norman Briges, who run Michael Tucci. Was not there and the series became a great thing with a big budget, something much more than a few episodes Activities were included, the whole episode of a full-fledged hospital was blown away. <br /> <br /> It was a family event with Van Dyke, son of Dick, Barry, you also created Dick's daughter and all her grandfathers made a look of different episodes. <br /> <br /> As the series went away, that's a little stupid, one episode reminds me that Dick van Dyke has played his whole family, which was not a common thing, but the whole 'Diagnosis Murdere' was a really good TV show. Which was a great guest star. <br /> <br /> After this event was over in 2001, Dick and Barry appeared again, the Hall of Fame series series of 'Millar 101', followed by a very similar path, and still enjoyable. The 80-year-old Dick does not seem to make any big changes, and it looks like he'll work to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> Show TV **** *** **
