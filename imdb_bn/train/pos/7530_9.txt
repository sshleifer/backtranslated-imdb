It sounds like a signal for animated Batman and so it's great for it and for that reason it has lots of steps in it, its story is very good on the actors, such as Kevin Batman as Conway, Mark Hamilton Joker etc. Villars are really good joker, two face, catwoman, cliffs etc. So I'm sure you will not be disappointed with Batman's new events because it's really good. So make sure you watch it on TV or rent or buy the collector version because it's really good. <br /> <br /> Overall Score: ********* ****** Outside **** <br /> <br /> **** *****
