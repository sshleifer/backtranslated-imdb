Cliffhanger made me nostalgic for the first 90's to see, during a time when almost every new action movie can be described as "Die Hard In / On A". Cliffhanger is "Die Hard on a Mountain," and quite good, for what it is. <br /> <br /> But passengers 57 and injuries, which disperse with their cluttered hard clones suitable for their own post, contrary to the feeling of the feeling of many filmmakers and the exciting landscapes that embrace the sensational landscapes, their inexperience, creating violence and fighting among the Sikhs. The person who died is despondent of the contradiction and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ron, Clifhunger's director, Ronnie Harleen, recognizes the visual impact of cruel violence and deadly struggle to survive the cold and indifferent natural environment. <br /> <br /> The early sequence has already received acclaim, all of which it claims: its intensity allows us to forget the art of our cameras and actors and only believe that what we are seeing is really happening. Harleen is not the enemy of Falling Stuffed Animals, which is powerful but still threatens (and which he repeats in the deep blue sea), or Ralph Woite's threat to become a ridiculous expression, which can reduce the power of the sequence. <br /> <br /> The next impressive set piece relies on gunfight and jets. Stalin and Michael are directed by France and Harleen is not involved in an agent involved in the theft of the thief: The bloody dual cross is completely unexpected. According to Roger Ebert, the flight transmitter stuntman in the middle of the aircraft is eligible for some special recognition. <br /> <br /> Later, one of the terrorists / thieves in the morning's expedition seems to actually fall. The ice wall carries him down the hill. As far as I know, no one has died in the making of this film (a small miracle, considering the extreme nature of some stunts), so a dummy was used for the shot. But the shot itself was impressive because we were frustrated because of Harleen (or one of the second unit's directors, probably to know where the camera was located). <br /> <br /> I'll make Sally Stallone like me like the hero of action any day of the week, because he has sometimes seen that one of the few movie stars who can tolerate physical and mental pain and also feel completely painful Who The role of Gabe Walker completed the role of Stalin's acting power: He played the hero of an old, more vulnerable type of worker, who has given himself a fascinatingly less original performance as a mountain rescuer, who must be freed himself. <br /> <br /> Most of today's post-matrix, comic book-inspired action heroes, Stallone Walker is a common man who becomes the protagonist without any unusual or computer-enhanced skills. In Cliffhanger, the hero often dies and his clothes begin to show tears because they move away from dangerous situations after another. When he hit when he was hit and bleed, he especially took the rocky-style pummeling of a crazy-dog villains when ordering, especially in the cave. <br /> <br /> It must be remembered that cruel despicable villains really contribute to the effectiveness of movie: When I first saw this movie as a teenager, I was pushing good boys step by step step by step step by step step by step. At one stage I actually lost one of the coldest blooded characters in the movie, violently a violent death. <br /> <br /> Model model or model among Litgo's British accent film is helpless like helicopter, but she is fundamentally a good actor, and some who can read stupid conversations completely: In one scene, Stallone and Rooker try to show their employees, He is trying to determine which tasks he will give them, he actually says, "you, stay!" Even like Anthony Hopkins If the line you may experience problems with good actor. <br /> <br /> Even if Clifford is dragging credibility sometimes, it is only for more entertainment programs. <Br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, for example, Lith√≥g openly tells a person "When he comes down [Stallone] retires." Even though a real criminal mastermind makes this mistake even strangely: his helplessness shakes the rooker with caution in order to be careful on rock face, and he tries to push a push between Stalin and the bad guys who try to pull him down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A already action-packed account seems to be unnecessary that the wolf. Finally, some pictures of slow death scenes, Harrill's decision seems meaningless, because this technique does not contribute anything to the scenes. It's embarrassing that Stallone is now old for action films because her character looks so credible in this movie that I am inevitably thinking about how it will be after that year. But perhaps it's best that Clifford is always standing in his favor, without a signal: There are already tired and inexpensive movie franchises. It was an unofficial sigellel that thought itself to be limited vertical: with Cliffer on the top 250 list of IMDB. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 8 (Very well, most of Stallon's other movies are considered.)
