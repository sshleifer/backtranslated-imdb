Channel 4 is a channel that allows more nasty stuff than any other channel, this show was definitely a naughty one. Sometimes the total adult chat shows, four times BAFTA winners and British Comedy Award winners (also nominated twice) were presenting Graham Norton just perfect gay host for a better show like this. There was one or more famous celebrities in the middle of it. They were originally an adult idea that would be poor, humiliated, or guest guests, but not for some disappointments. Men are playing recorders with their parts, men use their kids to play the jackfruit, upward women in the bath, with pants under their belt or men without money, and many more but laughing ideas. This is only for adults, but enjoy it! It won BAFTA twice for Best Entertainment (program or series), it won the Best Comedy Entertainment Program (also nominated), British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Talk Show, won it for episode # 18 (?) And won it Most Popular National television prize doubles at talk shows. It was 52 of the 100 great fun moments. very good!
