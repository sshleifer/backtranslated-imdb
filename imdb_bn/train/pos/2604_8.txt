"Amazing Grace" as it is a relentless feeling as it tells a contemporary story of different life in an apartment building. The spoken language is Hebrew, but the drama can take place in any modern city. It monitors family values, romantic relationships, and age group characteristics with equal mortification. It does not judge characters, just present them directly, because they try to solve their personal problems in this modern world. The quality of acting is very good, and monitoring observations on the characters are astute and sharp. I appreciate this flowing film too.
