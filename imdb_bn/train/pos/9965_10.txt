Suitable for small children with families who are looking for light-hitting films, which do not contain any violence and encourage children to be fun and funny, even whimsical, adult. Not a bad film for a low budget job. The children will be surprised to see Santa's workshop and "Magic", which enables him to enter a small house, or a house with no chimneys in the house! <br /> <br /> thawarting the pitch called the pitch (complete with the horn and the tail is full of classic red deed!). They will sympathize with the poor little girl, whose biggest wish is to have a little puppet for love. And the poor little rich boy who is willing to spend time with her only forever parents. And do not you know any child who does not know anyone at school, like the nasty boys listed by the pitch to keep affection and destroy Christmas? In the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, get what they deserve for Christmas! <br /> <br /> This picture loves both children and Santa's message of love. /> <br />
