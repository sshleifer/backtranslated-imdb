When I came out, I saw the ice age for the first time in Sabieko's cinema, '00. I was only 13, even though I like it. It was some warmth. <br /> <br /> We kept it in the video for several years and it does not matter how often you see it, it is not annoying. This is an element that makes it different from all the other 3D animations created in it - there is no special 'home' character that they leave. They are flexible, and it is really refreshed and raised for viewing. <br /> <br /> Also, each character on each page seems to be correcting each other, but they are really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even bad guys). The rock slogan is charming in its annoying, too tender and naive way. Moni is very adorable in her dull, exclusive character, and so much more. <br /> <br /> Another great point of this movie is the beauty of animation. All the environments and characters were originally modeled by soil, the film provides an artistic edge. <br /> <br /> Another aspect that adds to the feeling of film is that the gender is very small. Very rarely does any female character, but you do not really understand that it does not affect it until you see it several times and even to see the movie. For this reason, there is no mention of the nuclear family which will be kind in the settings of the ice age. <br /> <br /> All the ice age is a great movie and proof of how much effort was put in 3D before the Shake 2 and Incredibles came out.
