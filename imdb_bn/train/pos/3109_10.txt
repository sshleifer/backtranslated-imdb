The third and final film of this triangle is finally clear crystal. This is a general movie than a normal movie. Jason Bourne finally asked who he was and he would discover the tortures that he had presented to kill the old identity and remember: he really took his dead body away. But the film finally concludes that all of these CIAs were organized and planned in a Blackfrom program, which has been clearly shown in this film that, to eliminate all American citizens, who tried to stop the control of the entire society, and limited groups of people, Until the 1980s, who was an indispensable CIA officer, he became vice president? That goes along with the internet being said. Then Jason will really thank Bourne himself, but the main person who will be able to bring the truth to the public and the only authority to make CIA-related decisions is a woman and the woman is involved in the Senate investigation by the investigation. A woman and a senate; Read my lips In the United States, politics is prevalent, and two media are essential for a presidential campaign: music and movies. At the moment, outside of Hollywood and intellectuals, academics and intellectuals are generally using movies and in particular the film is about the idea that people will get rid of a woman and the Senate. So go and see the film. It's lovely and it's a sweet ending of the end and hopes for some great hope and others are waiting, but no one can show that it will not come: The only point is to know how deep and serious it will be. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques Collardou, University of Paris Dufin, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sovereign and University Varsils St. Quentin en Yewelins
