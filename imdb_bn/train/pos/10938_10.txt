Sometime I've ever encountered a film that is completely complementary that I will talk about it immediately. This movie is certainly some of the best entertainment and it is very authentic. I saw the dubbed version but now I'm on my way to catch the DVD remaster with the original Chinese dialogue. Nevertheless, Dubbing sometimes offers some funny funny humor without going to the street: "Poetry makes the world crush !!!" <br /> <br /> The story is about repeat, mystery, and inter-personal relationships in the spirit of conspiracy theories. You can expect twists and turns as well as activating 5 poison detection and an expert motion. <br /> <br /> The martial arts choreography itself is a class and must be believed to be believed. It's like real animals watching war with each other, but arising from the form of their own arcane martial arts. This type of expertise in Cast is unclear in modern day movies. <br /> <br /> This combination provides a serious level of old Chinese culture and I recommend it only to tell Marshall on the basis of the film's actual purpose, artistic story and its execution skills. ... Of course, if you just want to see each other with the unexpected nature of Chinese Chinese torture, be my guest!
