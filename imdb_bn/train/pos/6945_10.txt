The style of my favorite film is Western, it's really the only movie genre that is American origin. And despite Sergio Leon, no one is like Americans like them. <br /> <br /> Westster 73 Winchester at the top of my ten favorites list. It was the first pair and the only black and white movie of the partnership. Director Anthony Mann and actor James Stewart. It was a landmark film, where Stewart was elected for a percentage of profits rather than directly getting paid from Universal. Many such players follow the players, who enrich their work like the Mughals. <br /> <br /> At the moment, Anthony Mani worked mostly with B photo, Noor type stuff, no real budget. Before Winchester, 73 man of the West Western Robert Taylor, Devil's Doorway, which was not well received. I'm sure that James Stewart saw it and decided that Manna decided to become a partner with that person. <br /> <br /> This film also created a legendary mini-stock company for John Ford. Michael Mitchell, Steve Brady, Dan Durrya, John McIntyre, J.C. Flippan and Rock Hodson, as well as others in Stuart will be present in the future. <br /> <br /> This is a simple plot, James Stewart finds a man named Vanished Dutch Henry Brown and kills him. I will not say why, but till now we have never seen the screen on the screen of James Stewart. Anthony Mani reached the soul of Jimmy Stewart and pulled us out of some spectacular. <br /> <br /> Hate is correctly displayed at a great moment at the beginning of the movie. After Stewart and Sidekick Miller, Wil Will starred Will Will, who was submerged by WillEper, because the guns were not carried on the Arpe dose City. There is a shooting competition for Winchester Rifle in Dodge City, and Steven McNally, the favorite Dutch Henry Brown playing in the worst danger. Stuart, Mitchell and Zia went to the salon and Stuart and McCalli spotted each other at the same time and ran for arms that were not there. Check out Stuart and McCann's closeups, they talk about more than 10 pages of dialogue. <br /> <br /> Another character, Stuart, entered the film, played by Dan Durriya, Waiko Johnny Dean. This screen may be the best moment of Duuriya. He is a psychopathic expelled killer who is dead as a left-handed draw but he plays two six guns. <br /> <br /> Another person from Stewart called Shelley Winters, who killed Murphy with Durry and killed him. His best view was with Duuriya, who congratulated him. He play for the time until he can safely get away from her. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> John McIntire, J. as a splendid Indian businessman. C. His first real notice as Flipen Graduate Army Sergeant and Rock Hudson has been found as the young Indian chief. John Alexander, also known as Thelodor Roosevelt, of Alesic and Old Leas also played a brief, but effective role, where both MacNally and Stewart stopped at different times. <br /> <br /> Standard and Stuart made eight films together, five of them west, and they were ready to do six western, night passes when they quarreled and departed from the standard set. The end of a beautiful partnership produced some beautiful movies.
