It is a perfect series for viewing the family. We gathered around TV to watch it in BBC America. This is an up-to-date version of Robin Hood and it likewise appeals to children and adults. Our teenager and tween-ager both sit with mom and dad and enjoy watching Robin's next absorption. We can not wait for the next episode in the air every week and are happy to see free "on demand". <br /> <br /> The clothing is the place of the current fashion. Each story has a moral. It's entertaining. Violence is not over-top or odd. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic with John William's feeling. This is an old world story that again brings new flashes around the world. <br /> <br /> There is so much rubbish on the television for brainwashing "reality" TV for stupid violence on television. You should take this for yourself and this is an updated "Robin Hood" which can not be compared to the exploitation of Ir√®le Flynn. It is a gem to enjoy all. Parents are worried about too much violence that maternal grandmother will rejoice that Robin has lost the taste of war and bloodshed. He is a Robin Hood who will try to make his way out of disagreements over war. Maiden Marian is also an attractive role model for young girls. Rather than stand and do anything, he plays his role to help the poor by becoming a "night watchman". Nottingham's Sheriff is deliciously on the top wicked, just like Sheriff and Billy Joel and Tim Curry feel like a cross. Guy has played a very handsome actor in Gisborne, which most women want him to portray the role of the bad "Guy". <br /> <br /> The only question is, "Where is Firara bald?"
