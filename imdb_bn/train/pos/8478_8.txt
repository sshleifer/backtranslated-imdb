I have seen this movie as a child and my heart is broken! There was no such end to any other story ... I grew up in a great anime film and it was my favorite, because it was very unusual - a story about injustice, cruelty, and loneliness and life and preferences can not be undone, and others Need for Chiron became lonely when Wolf killed his mother, but Wolf was alone, when he chased him on the hill. Wolf does not kill the sheep, even every night he said, "Perhaps tomorrow I'll eat you." I have dropped it tape and dropped from age and use. I'll repair it and watch the movie once again and as hard as I did as a child, I will work hard. With such depth and feeling, such a complexity of stories and money is very rare. This is a sad story, but I do not face any catharsis made more nicely. I'm happy to see this movie, and I'm glad I saw it as a child.
