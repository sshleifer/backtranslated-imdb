Orlando Bloom wanted to see it. Simply, the movie had a spectacular average. It's not bad, but it's not really very good. Editing is good; The film is well read. The direction is enabled and assured. The story is plodding. The film is played by average lasers, blooms, and generally Great Watts and Rush. If you are from America, the pronunciation is unreasonable, so come back and enjoy the scenery (or I'd like to call it, Orlando Bloom). At the end of the film, I was not bored to move. Some people have asked what happened to Ned Kelly at the end of the movie. I said, I do not care about it. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can recommend is the Orlando bloom type, which gives the slightest range of sorting (although it's the current "I'm beautiful and confused" appearance), so fangirls could find it worth the Matinee price . That's another, just do not see it. It's not good enough enough not enough bad enough for entertainment.
