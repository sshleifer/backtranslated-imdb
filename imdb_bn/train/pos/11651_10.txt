When killing friendships, in my opinion, very sensitive and kind hearty drama about the consequences of either a dynamic or a bullick. Anytime Lexy (Katie Wright) or Jennifer (Marley Shelton) ran away, I wanted to vomit myself. It is difficult to explain why. If you ask me, they should have more cooperation about things. However, I enjoyed seeing them work together as well as seeing their parents get lectures. Before I upload it, I would like to say, "If you ask me, friendship kicks actually show you how an unknown or bully can affect a person's body." Now, in conclusion, I recommend this movie to everyone, it can not be seen. If you have some tears and a good time, then the next time it's on TV, jump back with a friend and see it.
