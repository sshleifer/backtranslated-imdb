The Titanic is a long but well-made tragic adventure story of love that occurs during the famine of the incomplete ship. Writer / director James Cameron did a great job of making this film an imaginative love story between two different people, as well as bringing together the real event of the Titanic, which claimed thousands of lives after a glacier hit on April 15, 1912. North Atlantic ice free wasted in the water. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet have two great roles in the film. They made for a good screen couple. Together with Dicaprio and Winslet, there was also genuine chemistry, which made romance which eventually became more credible among them. When they came, they both showed genuine talent and both of them showed it in their latest movies. Other supporters cast with a small role, including Billy Jane, Cathy Betts, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hayd, and Bill Paxton, are equally impressive as a character that helps them live their life in this movie. Love stories, actions, mysteries, and special effects are especially great for that time. The situation was awful because the letters were so realistic because it really happened that most of you would like to survive this life and death situation. Pence was slightly slower and it was a bit longer, but the rest of the movie was made for some errors. Titanic produces a big date movie, which some women can almost cry while watching it. This truly happened has definitely added to the making of the movie that you lost all life on the fellowship when the Titan collapsed in the Atlantic after a glacier hit. Overall, Titanic is a sad heartwarming story, which can fall in love, unfortunately lives through ships, especially Dikaprio and Winslet's extraordinary performance, who definitely make time to watch this movie.
