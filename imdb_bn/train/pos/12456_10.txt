This movie is definitely one of my favorite movies. Interaction between the respected and morally strong characters and thumb of honor among the members of the police and the honorary code. It deals with themes like beliefs like duty, crime, sound, manipulation, and a few movies, and unfortunately, I can not remember since the death of 'policeman' in the late seventeenth century. The sequence is delicious, indispensable, there is nothing to do and thus leads to visual and spectacular scenery, to lead visitors to the wrong and accurate spectacular plot for the needs of fewer samples. No such scene is present or required. Logic viewers are honest in sand; A series of resources that often hides viewers by cheating. No, it does not miss the marbles ... a note for congratulations for the song, to see a movie and not to sleep every minute, not just for viewing.
