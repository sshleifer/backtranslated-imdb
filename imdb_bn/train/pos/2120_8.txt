James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan Budapest play with the gift shop colleagues, who do not like each other, they are not really familiar with sweet heartfelt friends, but they do not know. <br /> <br /> A very romantic romantic comedy, very compactly played by two preferred stars and a very eager-to-please supporting cast. The story is well written and the film is romantic innocence (I do not know exactly how to interpret it) which is not in today's movies. This is probably the most recent comparison that got your mail and won the original in every way. <br /> <br /> It seems obligatory to each Christmas, I feel from this little gem to jump a Christmas.
