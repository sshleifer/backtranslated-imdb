This is a very interesting movie, easy to see, it gives you almost all the time entertainment. The director is recognized in the work and humor is his trademark. The film is a common police-based history of lethal weapons, but the kind of jokes and comedy Argentines. The back side is a psychiatrist driven by a colleague and he must go with her during her co-operation with Detective Diaz (played by Luke) (Diaz bothered by his wife for cheating him). Dialogues are some glamorous globes: understandable and ridiculous somewhere. Overall overall, it will qualify for an 8th, but I got 7 ratings because it is a little less than the end. Considering considering a little coming on a personal comment, Argentina must add a "bravo" for filmmakers.
