You have not seen anything like it. Once the coup starts, this is the most wonderful, end-of-seat thriller that you can see - even though you know the result. And it's all real, because it's a documentary - amazing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everyone knows I saw this movie as a 4-star rating. Even if you are not concerned about politics or Venezuela's politics, you can find yourself nervously and - believe it at the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> This is a roller-coaster ride.
