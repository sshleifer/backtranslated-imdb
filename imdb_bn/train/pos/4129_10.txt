This is a cooking contest show, Americanized. It's not going to be the Japanese version. <br /> <br /> Show is cool. I could have been less careful about cooking but this program is just for watching, recreational ... by the Chef, by the chef, by adding rice to the intensity of food. A good way to really spend some time watching TV. <br /> <br /> You can criticize the show for guests as a guest of Mark Echo ... but ... but ... It is quite entertaining to watch and usually deserves the winner prize. <br /> <br /> Oh yes and I'm bitter, John Bosh is not a new Iron chef <br /> <br /> <br /> Cooking Ala!
