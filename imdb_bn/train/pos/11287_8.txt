It is one of the best Tarzan movies mentioned by other critics as mentioned. But unlike the other, I like the beginning of this movie because it should have been like a trading post. Plus analysis is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back to the jungle. At the beginning of this movie there is a series of continuous continuation of the most exciting and awesome cheeses. Harry's Safari tribe took place during a group of cannabals. Pre-censorship production values ​​add many realities, in fact, produce horrendous dangers that Europeans are waiting to get into the jungle. Although the film was probably bestowed by ancestors, how badly they behaved terribly with African Africans, a correct account was provided by their white employers. As well as the sexy Jane, thousands of elephants, some great sets and two Cheta! Do not miss a adventure classic.
