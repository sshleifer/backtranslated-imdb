I saw this movie on the film festival and I find myself very attractive as a teenager. These kids are out of the ordinary and very unexpected to be a movie of this firm, but with the right dialogue and junk they made a complete success of the movie. I enjoyed this movie after the others but I highly recommend watching and watching this movie. It is a mixture of wonderful comments and delightful reality. High school, high school record has been topped by my favorite list and hopefully there is a chance to get rid of the theater. I really thank all the kids who work hard to make this movie, in which my eyes help our laughing cry.
