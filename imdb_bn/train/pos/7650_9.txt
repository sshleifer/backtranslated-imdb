Wow, I like this picture. This may not be the funds and advertisements available to the Hollywood blockbuster, but it mentally packs twice. The story revolves around this one family from Utah and is a connection between the family of the people who provide the movie with their fist. The lead lead (Giovanni Ribici) plays very well, at times he lets you believe that he is working on all his feelings. This is his brother (Ilias Cotas) who steals a show for me. When the two were visible together, they closed each other on their lines, played fantastic. Great cast, great movie
