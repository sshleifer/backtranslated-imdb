BASEketball is a very funny movie that usually plays a lot of fun with the comedy element, which is more fun than torches in your pants and it's a pretty good plot, versus the rich man versus his classic slackers. And the only thing that I do not like as a baseball, it really did not really need in the movie, however, if the film did not have a baby, there would not have been some interesting scenes. If you reviewed a review about this movie, exclude everyone because all the critics did not like this picture. Bisbutbal is a great comedy that everybody wants whatever they want.
