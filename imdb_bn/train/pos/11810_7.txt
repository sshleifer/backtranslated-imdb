I still like it though. Warren Beatty is justified as a comic book hero. This movie sets the set, incredible cast and it offshoots a mid script. I really expected something more significant in the condition, or the plot but I got very little. The main reason to watch this movie is that one of the biggest stars of Hollywood during this unusual movie. <br /> <br /> A man who did terrible things and was not even in the film was Madonna. She was not involved in this movie and her acting job was quite bad. The movie still stands at some point. Hope you have some more and you got nothing. Al Pacino is playing a really bad dude and he is not quite good. She and Beatty do not make a nice good guy and bad guy. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Warren Batty are interesting to see in a film other than Esta. I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things. The thing about this movie is good, but it can be even better. I liked it as a child because I thought it looked great, and apparently the movie is amazing, the set is incredible, the text is just fair, and I expect something good with a cast of that film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I thought the end would not be big. It was interesting, but for such a grand scale film I think it might end up with a little more frogs. The reason why this movie is watching is the atmosphere. The film makes it even more beautiful by using only 7 comic book colors. <br /> <br /> Clothing and makeup were also faulty. Facial makeup for villains was great. Betty is not just bigger than the life character. Yet, this is a good movie which can be a lot more. It is better than me, and almost other comic book adaptations at the same time. Of course the movie was a lot bigger.
