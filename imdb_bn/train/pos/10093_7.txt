In a beautiful London shop, one million tea gardens fell on the owner's feet and soon married her and lived with her in British Billy's Villa. Although based on Robert Stantish's book, this initial set reminds Hitak's "Rebecca", in collision with the main staff of the main woman Elizabeth Taylor Palace and her own husband (almost immediately) under the pillars of her dead-but-influential father. Taylor, the last minute option for the ill-timed Vivienne Leiree, appears to be smoother in her high fashion attire, and her performance is quite strong; However, once husband Peter Fink begins to drink too much and breaks the order on him, nobody may remember his dedication to him, but he is a mesokistic (ending this feeling). Still, the film offers a boxer for soap buff: Romantic drama, a bit of travel, explanatory dance, an elephant stamped, and full-time outbreaks of the cola! *** *** to ***
