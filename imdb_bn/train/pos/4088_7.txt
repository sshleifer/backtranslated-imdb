There is one out of this. There is nothing to say about it that talks about very sensitive issues among the victims of violence. I can see why this film was banned for a long time, movies directed in the film are still banned in most of the world, film lovers fit well and fit with the film's mood. This is a good movie that has played well and has a purpose ... to overcome the audience and the continuous boundaries that we do not often see in movies. I came across this image on the net which I thought I could check out. I enjoyed the movie because it was provocative at the same time and some sexually related. Today you rarely watch movies.
