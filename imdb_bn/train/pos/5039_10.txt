Stunning Absolutely stunning This is a movie about two kids which has an aspect of the father suddenly. She asked an angel to visit him, and told him that they would kill "demons". He later received instructions, and they started rolling the demons, which are naked eyes, ordinary people. They kill these so-called evils with the ax of their heads and crush them and bury them in the rose-garden. Their father claims that he can see their sin when he touches them. The movie is finally running with a twist. <br /> <br /> The thing I like about this movie is that it has a completely unique form of human thought. Are their parents crazy? Or is he telling the truth? The viewer is left to decide. Go see the judgment for yourself, and watch the movie. now.
