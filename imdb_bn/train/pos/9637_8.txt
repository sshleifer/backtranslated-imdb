This movie has a special way to tell the story, at first I found it strange as the opinion of the time and I had no idea what was going on. <br /> <br /> However, the line of the story was simple though, but still very real and touch. You met someone for the first time, you were completely in love, but eventually broke up and preached a fatal pain. Who does not go through this? But we will never forget this type of pain in our lives. <br /> <br /> I would say, I have shown great acting to show love in two sensitive characters. I just wish that the story might end up happy.
