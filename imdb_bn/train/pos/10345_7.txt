The only other review of this movie on this date really trashes itself and the movie itself. I'd like to read user comments to give me ideas about what I usually expect from a movie. This is unfortunate when it does not make much comment for a specific tile, because you only have a review, and it tries to unexpectedly trash the movie and cast, then you have no idea what to expect. Before reading this title, I have read this review and I do not know where all the poison of this film and star is coming from. Both Douglas and Blondel were very talented and attractive people, who usually distributed, even when the material was not the maximum. I found movies and performances fun and enjoyable. This is not one of the coolest of all the classic periods, but it's a pleasant and fun dilemma that you can expect for most new movies. If you are a fan of these stars then you will not be disappointed.
