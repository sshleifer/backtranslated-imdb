EDDIE MURPHY DeliRIOUS Easily concert film up the most fun stand I've ever seen. Most stand-up activities usually lulls at some time, but this one is one. There is not a moment that is not partially divided for 90 minutes. At the moment Eddie laughed with Mr. T-shorts are sunny. Smile laugh <br /> <br /> Sadly, this was done in 1983 and Eddie did something funny. It is unbelievable that the person who wrote this remarkably brilliant show wrote a movie called Harlem Nights, which was not very funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you're outside, please go back and make a concert film in DeliRIOUS vein. Trust your fans love you for it. And I think you know that.
