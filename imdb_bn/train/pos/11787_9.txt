It's just a short film by David Lynch in just 8 minutes, but it's got all the "Linchian stuff"! It is mysterious, dark, unintended, eerie, and weird; And before that the girl started talking, even a little scary! Soundtrack is exceptional for creating this weird atmosphere because it is also terrible and mysterious ?? <br /> <br /> About this setting, it is not the "traditional" red screen, but it has squeezed violet walls, which give it equal effect to solitude. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a girl locked in a dark room and she is crying for help; Then comes another girl that speaks to me in a mysterious way, she says she's just because of her fault ?? We do not know what will happen next or what? It must be finished in an incomplete and puzzling, a good lint movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite some amateur acting, it is very small. Girls are professional actresses, but I think their acting may be short of this, well.
