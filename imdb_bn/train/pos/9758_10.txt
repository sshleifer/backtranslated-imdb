Personally, this is my favorite one time! No, I'm not 10. I'm 30! I own an old, original VHS that I bought from a rented shop. I saw it countless times .. <br /> <br /> Although it's a fun movie for kids, it's a great movie for adults. I saw this movie whiile once .. not silent. There was something opened in my eyes that I had never noticed before. I'm strongly encouraged in morality, both overtly and somewhat supernatural .. I wish that I could remember all things especially in the goal, but since then it has been a long time. Rest assured, there are tons of things that are directed throughout the movie. If you get a chance to see it .. do not calm down .. So, do not be disappointed. As a matter of fact, you will probably feel rather happy and warm. <br /> <br /> Unique and nice!
