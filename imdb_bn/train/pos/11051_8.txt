"Malefic", for example, how a horror movie can be effective, nothing can be effective without plots and many hearts. Its slope does not have recognized names, it does not have a big budget and it certainly lacks the visions of visual effects; But it compensates everything with the help of an intelligent and well-written script, an effective cast and managerial view focuses on giving more attention to the story rather than providing cheap thrills. E. Rick Valette still can not be a well-known name, but with the debut of his feature length "Malefic", he proved he is contemporary level like Jeunet, Gans or today. <br /> <br /> Story of four prisoners in a room, four different men from different backgrounds but with the sole aim: to get out. Career (Gerald Laroche) gets imprisonment after being convicted of multi-ownership fraud; His classmates, violent Marcus (Clovis Cornilak), Intellectuals Lasale (Philipp Ludenbach) and mentally challenged trafficking (Dmitry Rautaud), have been convicted of killing and giving a cold reception to Carr√©. Career has discovered an ancient book, such as a former prisoner explores the details of how he escapes using black magic. <br /> <br /> Alexander Charlotte and Frank Magnia have written, "Maleficent" is a great mix of black color fantasy and horror. Clive Barker's story is a very memorable way. The most powerful point of the film is the way to create letters, all of them are very complex and different personalities and most of them come from continual clash of tension and mystery personality. The legendary story of the story is very well-conducted and overall this film gives the feeling of reading the Gothic novel. Despite having a film locked in four of the four, the movie is never annoying or tiring, and in fact, the group's distinction unrest, increases the feeling of clustrophobia and especially the paranoia. <br /> <br /> Director Eric Waleat uses great atmosphere, mood and his cast to give life to the plot. Despite the obvious lack of budget, he wrote a brilliant film that looks original, fresh and very interesting. Its fine and functional camera-work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location, and the film gradually extends slowly and it disbelievates the film's foundation. Some of the special effects are performed very well and some of the wallets trade in quantity in Gore's awesome view. <br /> <br /> How characters make this image, and Cast is certainly some worthwhile credit. Gerald Laroche is as nice as a carrier, a man is innocent in the first sight, but who hid the dark past. Philip Lundenbach and Dmitry Ratawood are very effective, especially Rathud played a very important role. However, Clovis Cornilac stole shows like his performance in Marx, who is a violent and distraught man, who wants to be deep in himself. Character enhances nicely and makes most of them cast. <br /> <br /> The movie is superb, but it is not shared without its flaws. Of course, one of the most notorious is its low budget. The effects of CGI are somewhat poorer than the effective make-up and used in other scenes, but it's never too bad for it. Perhaps the worst thing about "Maleficent" is that it eventually seems to lose some steam when it illuminates characters instead of the characters of the supernatural black magic, it is not very bad, but it may seem weak from the end. See. <br /> <br /> However, "Malefic" is one of the great horror films coming from France and more recognizable. The complex of the miracle (although complex) is quite a proof of its ability as Valette must follow a genius. Personally, this image is a new favorite. 8/10
