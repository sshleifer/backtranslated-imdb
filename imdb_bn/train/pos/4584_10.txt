I did not see every channel movie, but it sure is as far as I saw it. <br /> <br /> This story is not really something special, so I won. Go deep into that. Is it particularly a stunt, war, good acting, warm sense of humor. The film is on the road through the raging tempo and you are just surprised to see it. All cool stunts (of course jackie made by yourself) want you to jump around the couch and scream. It's just awesome! She was fascinated by this movie even in my mother's cool movie. <br /> <br /> I know that this police story may be a little harder, at least it's here in Sweden. But I can assure you, it is worth a try.
