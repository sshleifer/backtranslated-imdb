"Danza Macbra" / "Castle of Blood" by Antoine Margarita is an inferior, atmospheric rock that succeeds in all the fronts. It looks beautiful in black and white and it is nicely fuzzy. Allan Foster, an English journalist who follows an interview, Fau Bates Foster, in an interview with American author Edgar Allan Poyer, said he would not spend one day at the abandoned palace of Thomas Blackwood, the friend of the night. Foster was locked in the palace by accepting digestion and the horrors began! The atmosphere is frightened and it is afraid of hell from me. The order of the crypt is really low and tension is almost intolerable. Barbara Steel looks incredibly beautiful as scary visitors Elizabeth Blackwood. "Castle of Blood" is one of the best Italian horror films made easy. 60's early! A great composition!
