I have seen this movie twice with my lovers. This one ought to be a civilized fave! The best line, "Your Dress Deeply Shall!" Cinderella is called prince. Kathleen Turner shines as stepmother. I liked the 1950s cars and motorcycles. The rare princess usually has a great exit from the swashbuckler. He tries to stay cold, but the fairy-tale is unable to conceal his love from the princess. His leopard is not glass (true in the original story), but he lost Cinderella, but he returned to the throne from heir. My only complaint is that it is not shown further and seems almost impossible to get. I hope blockbuster or Amazon will soon start stocking this one.
