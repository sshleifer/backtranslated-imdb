Actually a special person / character is not "OK", but my summary line refers to the power of the movie. And it's all achieved without any innovative camera patch and / or big production set, but a great story and very good (credible) and good actors provide messages with stories (stress). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Great acting, real gems that nuances in performance If you are interested in enjoying a sensitive story and want to see a movie that you touch emotionally, this is the one.
