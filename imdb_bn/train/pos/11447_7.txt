This movie is probably for you. It was composed from the music, from the beautiful photography to the overall meditation, and often how Andy Goldwarthy did or used to say in shots, often hear some of her life. If you are familiar with Buddhism - I like the senses coming out of this movie. The instability of life, the beauty of nature, the interconnection of all things etc. However, what I did not understand, I was confused, and finally forced me to leave without end (I saw it an hour), it was a complete thing. Find out why you are just getting the commission and its bits and pieces and how they can survive this kind of work. Art is alive, but with all its decisions, all his words lead to death.
