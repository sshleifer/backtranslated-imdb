It is interesting to know how it can change in one second of your life ... For the first time it was an unforgettable experience to 'immediately' participate in Waterden's, the way to use it in new ways in your life may seem awkward and another person is going through the same situation. Can help you to target <br /> <br /> Ary Stolt's performance and mainly Helen Hunt (Oh Man !, Helen is the world's greatest and beautiful woman ...) Wonderful, Wesley Snippets is also wonderful among your last serious roles. A movie is simple and at the same time deep that does not allow us to become indifferent to the message sent to us: Enjoy every moment of your life ... <br /> <br /> Hours do not really appear for any movie !!! (Sorry, this is a brazilian expression ...).
