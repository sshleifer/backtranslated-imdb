Yes, the plot is very rare and very thin. Yes, the laughable range from acting averages. Yes, it has been done many times before. However, what we are discussing is a movie that does not move away from this incident and claims to be nothing more than this. In fact, there are some original death scenes and tensions increase throughout the film. In addition you are never a few minutes away from killing a gory. I request everyone to see this picture with an obsolete eyes and see what it says. Any other piece with a scary, funny slasher tune a theme.
