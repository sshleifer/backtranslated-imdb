This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. All the people who inform you of this movie completely sh * t are not smart enough to understand the subtle humor of this film. It shows us that real life and "fixtures" can create a winning combination of actions. Also, as a romantic comedy, it is one of the most tricky ways for two people to find each other. Give me another movie number where you can sing a song like Donald Sutherland, "They're on a Mars quest for a mountain."
