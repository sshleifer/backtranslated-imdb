This movie is perfect for all romantic in the world. John Ritter is never the best and the best line in the movie! "Sam" is nice to walk around the house and is very fun to have fun with. Ben Gazara was easy to fall in with a nice cast and love. I'm sure I've met Arthur in my travels somewhere. All around, no nice choice to take an evening. :-)
