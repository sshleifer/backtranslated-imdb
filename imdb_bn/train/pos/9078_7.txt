Generally speaking, the plot was much better than my expectations. Smile tracks were somewhat boring and did not tend to get in the way; However, for this episode it was enough real chocolate to make it. My biggest surprise was that some of the best lines and situations were not shown in trailers. Spade, in particular, did not appear in the best of previous promotion, but its character has been well-connected in the pilot. Almost anyone has enough eye candy and all regular characters think till their front task. Now, the writers can only survive for what they started.
