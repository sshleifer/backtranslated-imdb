Romantic comedy is not the right way to describe how to lose a friend and people can be isolated. The underlying romance of the plot is mostly arranged by a lot more interesting "riches-rich" story. Although the central line of the story has diminished somewhat but there are several screen shots, it has a sense; The "Net Rititi" is coming out of the way, those who create "office politics" and who use almost incompatible scenes focus mainly on the main relationships used for comic impact. Still, it works very well, especially with a front seat peg. The film is ultimately very clever, with its co-stars in trans-Atlantic relations, Peg Shares is well and isolating the cross between high and low-life societies, and in the story most of the refreshing is going well that prediction is something unique. Various characters of the film are well presented and Casting is definitely the plus point of the film. The "trading space" relationship between Peg and Houston, and "love, hatred" relations between Peg and Donst both work so well in a story interesting than a good story. Even Fox, whose main asset is appealed, that shock with very dark characters and "Bimbo" role works well. This is a small work in this little film, which is a great part of the work to pay tribute. From an amazing soundtrack to transsexual strippers it can be described as the only tricky trick comedy of all the clever ingenious.
