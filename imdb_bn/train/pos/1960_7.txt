It comes up after a year of "Basic Institutes" programs. Catherine Trumel (Sharon Stone) is now in London Despite having sex with football players, he stopped the road at 110 miles / hour (no question), and ended up to Thems. He survived - he did not. Police show psychologist Michael Glas (David Morrissey) who is mentally capable of trial for trial. Naturally, he starts playing with his mind and follows murder and sex. <br /> <br /> This movie was destroyed before it even opened. It took a throw and took forever to get the director, the script was constant in the problem and was not happy to throw (Morrisie often complains about the movie). It's not too bad yet. It's much like the first one - there's a lovely music score, beautiful position, lots of sexuality and nudity (it should be edited for an R), a pretty strong plot and good acting - but it has no effect. It seems like a retread first. People have been convicted here (I believe) ... For the first time, people were killed by ice. At one intelligent moment the stone highlights a snow pickup and shows it for a long time. He is playing a game of mind with a man and may be involved in the murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />) And some bloody murders. Better acting across the board. The stone here is just superb; Morris looks sad but okay; Charlotte Rampling and David Thuylis are good at supporting the role. <br /> <br /> - It's not bad at all, but it's like rebuilding the first one. Still I recommend it People just attacked it because Stone did not like it well and thought that it was stupid to sign a signal to "Basic ..." after 14 years of its creation.
