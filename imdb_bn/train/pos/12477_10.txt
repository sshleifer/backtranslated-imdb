My family and I have seen this movie over the years. It's clean, healthy, heart-shaped and heartfelt. Showing compassion between the two families of our two countries and the most strange relationship between prosperity, it is almost as if to interfere with God's hand. <br /> <br /> 5 Yo Jodal Micah Ferrand who plays the heart harmful little girl, did an excellent job to play in her part, and for me she had preferred Priam for the main role. <br /> <br /> All 10, 10 in 10 The story of this sweet man downsides. Children of all ages will become tears, then will happily see it and watch it bring together the family with a smile and a good feeling.
