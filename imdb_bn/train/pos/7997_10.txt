This is one of the best made movies and it does not disappoint me. The sound track along with the hands-on camera hand held in modest shot was fine. Always have a chances of a movie will not be kept as well as one of the other, but I think that the rhythm of this photo and time was excellent. Dakota Fanning is quickly becoming the chief of the movie for which an old soul needs a child with personality and she never disappointed me with her talent. Like Mr. Washington and certainly Christopher Walken, they both exceeded the challenge of showing the darkest aspects of humanity in trying to go in the light.
