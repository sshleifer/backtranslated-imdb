I watched a birthday girl, I liked it that I could see Nicole Kidman's film, only to find them all frustrated. I theory that when a certain star presence usually guarantees a certain quality due to their artistic control, the impact of its effectiveness with Nicole Kidman is harmful for the film enjoyment - IMHO. For example, Dougvil, deprives the viewer of any viewer who he hates instinctive insights, which he is not raising, suitable for any other gay lesbian and lesbians as appropriate for others' attention or other kidneys pets. <br /> <br /> Here she is a natural woman and she really does a wonderful job. I do not know how or who can prevent him, but apparently it works. Despite its resistance, the film has expressed its generosity on how to create a woman for women. And as a result, what makes a man's most frustrating hope a little achievable. <br /> <br /> Of course, a man's man, like the fantasy of a man's pride, transforms the character of a man from a man's character, but his transformation is quite credible. It can not be played in a movie directed to strengthen male pride. Instead, it properly records the necessary increase in the unique circumstances of the films. <br /> <br /> The criminals are also portrayed as human beings along with their criminal campaign. Her gang is a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to American culture. And when they are his opponents, they are not really his enemies. As a result, they teach him to compete. <br /> <br /> I was surprised to see Kidman's ability to physically contain Russian form. I was surprised that it was my indigenous Russian, but I showed no indication of any of its pictures to be examined. Maybe it's just a makeup but it was amazing. <br /> <br /> I hope they will soon head back, so she can start another great movie. In spite of my unrealistic excavation to Mrs. Kidman, the message is one of the best films in this way, and perhaps the whole life role.
