My wife is a teacher and she is very familiar with the story of her many classes. Although it was not all that interesting to me, and I bought the DVD it would be a movie that would not really up my lane. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is set up and I myself think I was right. It started a bit slowly and I must admit that I was a little nervous - but there was a lot of interest in staying with it. Boy, I'm glad because I ended up being a very satisfying and rewarding movie. I must see this again! <br /> <br /> Welding was very good. Since I did not read the book, I can not show the accuracy, but I must say that John Voight was really fun. You like the characters you like to like, hate those who hate them, and smile because they're supposed to be fun. <br /> <br /> I see some people may not like this movie. . It's especially tiresome at times, especially at the beginning. All flashbacks can be confusing (though they are essential for the story). Once the story starts to gather together, but it seems that you have been trapped for your patience. When all is said and done, I think it's a very good movie - 8/10. <br /> <br />
