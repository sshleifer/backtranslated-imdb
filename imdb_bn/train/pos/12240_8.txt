If you are a person who is looking for real movies or a strong and trustworthy plot, this movie is not for you. No - you'll hate it. But for those who like sweet, little sculble comedy, you will love watching this little movie. <br /> <br /> Tony Randall works for IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who has never realized that he should file an income tax return. Although he tries hard work, with the importance of his visit, everyone in the family is thrilling to the company. They targeted him and acted like a family ... and planned to kill his daughter, Debbie Reynolds. That's really all about the plot. But the movie gets a great script for a fun script and decent acting. A very nice little queue from the late 1950s.
