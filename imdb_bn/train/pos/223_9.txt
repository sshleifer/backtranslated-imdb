One of Neil Simon's best plays. For the sake of a TV comedy featuring Kraky, the Winky X-Widwell star Walter Mathew and George Burns. Problems they did not show each other for a decade. Zippy is one of the liners and full of showy jokes inside, this story flies along a series of fun. Along with Richard Benjamin as well as the impressive nephew, Rossetta has served as Lenoan's nurse and also as Director of Howard Hasman TV. Steve Allen and Phyllis Diller appear as themselves. Trivia Note: The Montage footage, starting from the Hollywood Revue of 1929, shows Mary Dresler, Besie Love, Polly Mornon, Clif Edwards, Charles King, Gass Edwards and the singer Brocus Bones.
