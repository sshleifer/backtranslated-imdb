It might be considered interesting (or not) that I tested this movie in the first place because I wanted to see Hamfrey Bougert in his CASABLANCA performance of the defeated person (for this, the role of 9.99 was the best actor Oscar. (I still ood Oscar , But Paul Lucas has done a great job and is deserving of least nomination.) Well, I'm happy that I did this movie I tried it because I enjoyed it very much, but I do not think I enjoyed the lecture and never got bored with them. <br /> <br /> There was an outstanding performance in this movie. I especially enjoyed Paul Lucas, Lucel Watson (nominated for the Oscars in the right way), Bate Davis (wrongly nominated), George Kuluris and oddly, Eric Roberts, who is the middle I really enjoyed his character: a strange boy who speaks a bit like the Philosopher, he just cracks me, even the character name is Bodo. <br /> <br /> The last one, where Lucas's character is something Was forced to do what he thought was wrong although he did it for the right reason, worked for me as well. I agreed with him why he thought he had done his job, and I understood why he could not explain it. The message that created this movie is a good and great, visible (meaning house), and the acting is nice. If you ever watch this movie get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9/10
