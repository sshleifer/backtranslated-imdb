This is the best Emma in my opinion existence. Another version (1996) that was good, and after reading the book, I think I can confidently say with confidence that it is a real explanation and the most trustworthy of Jane Austen's best work. Yes. The 1996 film with Paltrow is also very good, it's almost like a completely different story. It's very light and sculptor, you can not see dark corners of characters and if you just want a pleasant movie it would be great but some complications of plot points such as the Churchill / Fairfax conflict so much glossed over on virtually existence. But if you want the character to be a bit more, more real and multidimensional, then the TV version of 1996 is higher. Emma is an extraordinary person, but she is defective. Kate Beacinsel is skilled in showing a little trick of character. In Harry Potter's other handy conversation you have seen his appearance unexpectedly, yet he does not show any remorse for destroying the Harriet's proposal until it has the effect of destroying his own marital happiness at the end of this process. You have seen his atrocities and mirrored Frank Churchill's verse that they could harm others to achieve their goals. For Emma, ​​it was having a new friend while playing time after the wedding and enjoying the loss of her abortion at the wedding time. For Frank Churchill, he treats her and others with harsh treatment to keep her secret safe by keeping her promise of love to women. In the book, he realized all this in the wakefulness awakening made by him. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gineth Palto believe in their repentance, but Paltrow is more childish and more stable when Buckingell's awakening is real and serious and you see child-friendly, self-conscious behavior, kind and thoughtful adult transformation. Both versions are very good but I like this one.
