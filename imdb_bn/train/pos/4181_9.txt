Despite the conditions of the Convention in Geneva, it still holds me for a long time with a vivid figure of horrific consequences that could face the prisoners of war. Following a successful mission to build mines in Japan, a unit of Australian underground pirate experts is caught in an island near Japan. <br /> <br /> Once in prison these men have to learn from POWS for any other POWS but for their frustration soon from a friendly Japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spy after leaving the uniform after getting caught. The execution of such infraction by the Japanese Marshal Code, is executed by title. <br /> <br /> Despite their application, the application for the protection of the sympathetic prison, bitter time bombs accounting day. The tension is so much, you will actually hear the ticking, though it may be intensified with an attack on your chest with a marketing execution squad. <br /> <br /> Finally it is very difficult to re-treat my head. Type here. But I promise you - you will not forget it. Good luck finding a video in the US
