I love this from his first ventilation and I am always looking forward to watching each episode every week. The plot, character, writing, special effects were outstanding! Then the scientists again screwed the channel and canceled a very entertaining, well-written show. I said, bring it back, I know all the actors will come back. I would suggest buying DVDs, I I hope science-channel channel executives will get the word of this comment and realize that they need to be more involved with their audience. I now see a show on that channel (Ghost Hunter), but I'm sure that soon they will cancel it too.
