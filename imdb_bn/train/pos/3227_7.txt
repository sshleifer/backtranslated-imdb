This future action-thriller from Port Anderson (Event Harry, Resident Evil.) Is a strong Russell firm and mostly silent. The soldier is playing a cross in Rubber and Shane, Russell rarely says the title character, an "obsolete" genetic soldier left for the dead. Kony Nelsen, Shan Parvate, and amazingly helicopter helicopter Michael Chalice, who is capable of supporting Caste colonists. They spend most of the movie in fear of Russell and others are running for their lives. Here Russell's performance is the best one he has ever given. With almost no sound to say, he conveys emotions, feelings and meanings with appearance and glances. It's almost a mime performance. When action sequences enter the gear, they kicked the ass - and it is a strong, silent, materially. There are errors. Jason Scott Lee is brutish as a "superior" genetic soldier. Jason Isaac is a great sign of Frank Barnes, as a fake commanding officer from M * A * S * H, and a heart (and almost his shirt) as Gary Busce Todd's mentor. It is recommended for an underserved and excellent science-Flickr flick and anyone who wants a second run in the universe of the blad runner - David Web People wrote both screenplaces.
