It's really a weird movie - and it's not a bad thing. It is homeless and the combination of a neutral movie about a fairy tale. I'm sure anyone can think of this movie as weird, but I like it. Again, these directors bring together everyday people (not actors) a wonderful cast and get a great ensemble-type performance. Although not nearly as sad as Umberto D., a very similar point is made of both films - it only does this in a very irrational way. Ignore Chess Special Effects - Finally, it was created in the early 1950's and special effects are not very important anyway (or at least they should not be in movies). Instead, just boss back and enjoy very weird and stupid ride. As long as you're almost a kiss, you have a ball. <br /> <br /> After the first review of this movie, I saw another film directed by Disney, which is to be fully viewed and that the children are watching us. Although a fiction or a soul like Mille in Milan, yet a great movie.
