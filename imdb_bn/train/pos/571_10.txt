Seeing how two brothers have contacted each other through the whole film and closed it completely, I am personally fascinated to live in rural areas. I have seen this movie countless times and there is a book beside my Bible. After watching the movie, I agree that it is a book of some films that publishes justice. I strongly recommend that anyone who has a chance to fly or go to Montana. It's awesome. I can not think of anyone else who can play better than Brad Pitt. Judge yourself and see one of the better films of the modern film era. Do not try to learn to fish in film scenes, as a guide for fishing trips firmly in Montana and Wyiming, because it looks great in the film, but you have no idea that practice and skill actually takes a fishing. Thank you for listening to this movie Watch this movie if you like a long sad movie.
