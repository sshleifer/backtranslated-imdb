This is my boyhood friend, a chess boy and I look at YouTube again (thank you for the tube! Then I love this little, and this is one of my favorite cosper shorts. <br /> <br /> How do I start with the description of Frank Gallup's Hunting I loved it, we will see Kaspar sitting in his grave in the graveyard, read, every horse from the grave and "wife" Kasperse decided to go in search of a friend, but trying to make a friend, anyone who goes away looking at the casper, the poor Kasperse are sitting on a log and crying, until a little fox comes to him a nuzzles. The little fox fast tie, and he quickly named Barbie, and he thinks he is a very good friend. <br /> <br /> Assassins of Caspar and Firdi There is a scary danger, but when they are hid, Kaspersky is not keeping close eye on Fardi. Fardi is hiding a hunter and two of his victims come to the dog and start breathing little and start Ferdi as soon as possible to breathe and try panting as soon as possible Is. Hunter Fardi Kasperse is shooting firing gunmen in front of the notice, though they are trying to kill him and fly by the predator's direction and say that the hunter leaves alone on the ferries. And the hunters and dogs are afraid of Casper. Kaspersky cried out that the predators and dogs were gone and everything was fine. But Caspar sees Freddy's body not running and asks if she is right. When Caspar Fardi dies, he begins to mourn in pain because he has lost "the only friend of his own life." Caspar brought back to the graveyard where he buried the ferry and made a spacecraft for him near the Caspar space station. The pain of Caspar pain continues, until he resurrects the ferry as a ghost. Ferries start licking the cache on his cheek. Caspar cried out for joy, because he had met again with Ferdi. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's really good. Although surprisingly annoying, show the death of a family-based cartoon.
