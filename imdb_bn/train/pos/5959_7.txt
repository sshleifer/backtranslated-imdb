The film will not fall into the history of the film, but it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half hour with the family. This image is finally released on the video where it should start from the first place. <br /> <br /> This photo is about an eclectic group of friends who collect their names for the Prayer, "The Hungry Bachelors Club". Jorge Fox plays a woman who acts as a shortgate so that she can get a down payment for the restaurant she wants to open. Bill Nun is a Cadillac-loving mystery man who became his girlfriend. Fox gives an understated and touching performance and the salt is always reliably talented. Micheal des Barres is a hoot on top attorney. Face-to-face - Groups work together nicely to bring this painful group back into life. It's a good rental and you can see a few with the family.
