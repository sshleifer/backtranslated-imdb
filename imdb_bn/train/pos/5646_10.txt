Recently when I was shopping, I saw American American Gothic box set, and I thought, 'remember!' I used to set my alarm to get back up and in 1996 at CH 4 at 1.30am (when I was 14 years old). I mostly remember it because it was really scary and strange, no person could be terrible as Lucas (with a B !!) no one was ever there. <br /> <br /> I was bored, though on TV when they did the same thing with the box set. Funny episode, I was wondering when Dr. Matt left ??? They made it confusing. <br /> <br /> There is no error in the author, producer or manager (its TV backgrounds are still doing the same thing - showing Carnival and Farscape shows they do not like the originality in the studio !!!!!) <br / > <br /> To finish - if you do not see it and you call yourself a science-fan fantasy, horror, supernatural drama ... fan = you must While reviewing the box set, they said the same at SFX.
