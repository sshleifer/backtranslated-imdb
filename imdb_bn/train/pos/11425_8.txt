The story is about a little girl who is growing up in colonial Africa, but it is much more than that. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is growing up in the south will enjoy the same thing. One trend for others, a different race, which can not be consummated. Even an eyeing is prohibited. No sound is needed. Their facial expressions say everything. <br /> <br /> This is a black maid, the story of Protea (Ischach de Banco) and a white woman, Giulia Boschi. Their desire for each other is so strong that they can torture each other because they can not stay with each other. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The little girl Frances (Seychel Duchess) spend her time alone and with love. She really can not see this dance <br /> <br /> A colonial laziness in the more boring aspects of the movie. They do not even get undressed for bed by themselves. The world is ending; They just do not know it yet. Their racist attitude will be removed from their presence. <br /> <br /> I think I want to visit this Africa. It looks so cool; Especially when you hear animals only at night.
