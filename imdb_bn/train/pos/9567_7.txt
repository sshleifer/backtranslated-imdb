I have seen the DVD of this movie which brings a nice commentary track (in English). It seems that in Cambodia (the subtitle in English that speaks Thai language but the movie is called Cambodia), a very violent evil man shows boys as hungry using the hungry and training to fight and kill. He killed Peng in killing some people in China and killing a policeman while killing. Police Super Y is a shuttle Canon who worried about his father, who also shot a policeman and was in coma. Y's head worried about his father's friend and Y's uncertain behavior. He does not know that Y is who treats his father with drug vendors and shoots him in a quack. Pang escapes and tears off his skull and hides, where he meets a woman who comes here to find his soil and is repeating his father, he will not be released (Pang does not speak Chinese and does not understand, but he does not understand Perhaps the third reason for this is that the father seems to have sex with her). Y Paung got more obscene, but Pang is almost unstable. Pang steals a boat and takes his wife to where he is married, and she becomes pregnant and follows Y and joins the wicked person (who trains the boys) in the fight and training for training so that he can get a pang. In the case of Y and Pang, the woman who suffered severe torture and tortured and died, and Y left and died in Pang to save her child from death and left as a possible next child raised as the next killer. This photo is beautifully photographed with a nice soundtrack. There are many very cruel violent scenes. The woman dragged her legs with a long nail. Neck and treasure knife The gun fired directly from the head. And various very intense beatings. It's probably intense intense and downbeat but it's definitely worth seeing.
