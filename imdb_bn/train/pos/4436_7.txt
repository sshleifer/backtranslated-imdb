Tetuoid Stranger was one of the rare B-movies that appeared on BBC2 Christmas / New Year 2005-2006. They also watch live with Knight and Brighton Stangler. <br /> <br /> In this case, a man walking in the Central Park comes across a abandoned car and finds a dead woman inside. He was shot dead and then police tried to identify him with a tattoo as the main pillar. After the detection, the murderer was discovered and eventually shot. <br /> <br /> This image is mostly located in and around New York, so we can see some parts of the city we can not see, especially on the back street. <br /> <br /> Most of the unknown cast, John Miles has received top billing. <br /> <br /> Tattooing stranger is worth finding. Excellent but rather unclear. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 3 stars out of 5.
