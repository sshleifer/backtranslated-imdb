This movie was incredible. I'm much better than anyone I said earlier. It was definitely a heart-wrenching spectacular movie. This is a wonderful story, with amazing actors and creators. Definitely another great movie with Denzel Washington. (Nobody should be surprised) Derek Luke as well as a good job.
