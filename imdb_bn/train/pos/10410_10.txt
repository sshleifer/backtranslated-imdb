Baghdad's thieves are my ten favorite films. It's breathtaking without gorge, it's nicely painted and flawless in the industrial direction. Welding could not have been better. Rex Ing believes in me Genius. And as the Jafar, the temple epitome by Conrad Veight is certainly caught. He set the bar too high. <br /> <br /> I see this movie at least twice a year ... and it never gets tired. This movie is an adventure for all ages. There is no one too old to enjoy it. The thieves of Bahagadar gave me memories of the silent times ... I was ten years old and America was going to enter WWII. Conrad Weigt was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying "evil" in "Casablanca" a few years later. And the Corda stood up together, I believe, Justin and Dupree again in "The Four Feathers" .... creating a great movie!
