Ah, silent My favorite section The automotive premiere forum "Laura", a movie posted in New York, is silent, where corruption and violence are in full swing. It's like a Sergeant Mark Dickson, like Anna Andrews, a detective group whose cruel tactics put him in hot water with his superiors. <br /> <br /> When Dickson accidentally killed the murder suspect, Dixon tried to convict the culprit Tommy Scolis. When Dixon is involved with his death wife, beautiful Morgan Taylor, his goal is to get closer. Of course, usually in silent fashion, things go down to the hills quickly. <br /> <br /> Although the film does not have anything attractive or attractive in the film, it has a constant tone of fear and depression. Like the biggest silent, it is also surprisingly visible, sucking the viewer from start to right. <br /> <br /> Still, like movies like most of the premying, it's not something I'd like to see again. This is the verbal intelligence of Willard, the visual flick of Hitakoos or the lack of regional regional testing in Wales. Like the next action of Lang, "Sidewell" is really a real "genuine" rather than an artist. <br /> <br /> The theatrical film is nothing special. This is about a police who thinks of himself as a slow criminal. One scene Dixon explains that her father was a short time copper, the film was flirted with the idea of ​​predetermining, but this scene is going to go auto, or dares to take its ideas. <br /> <br /> The camera work is equally frustrating. There is no intelligence in the camera. No effort is made to camera allocation. It does not play with space or architecture or with step-by-step policing empahsise. It's sometimes trialed with daisy and out-set. Meaningless, though most people are not concerned about these issues. However, there is a good shot in which our hero gangster (Nir cage) is trapped in full car, which itself carries a lift (another cage) and takes it to the main gangster. Dera Like Lynch's "Blue Velvet", the auto film has again mirrored, constantly comparing "upper side" to hell. It works well, but the set design fails to make it strong. 7/10 - Auto thinks that no matter how silent it is, with the possibilities, following the whiskeyan mold instead of toys. "Notorious", "Night in the City", "Scarlet Street", "A Lonely Place", "Act of Heels", "Bombardment" and "Johnny Eager", "Where Sidewalk Ends" . It is capable and engaging, but lacks additional magic.
