A person who is involved in business management chemistry and MS in BS. Tried to seek existence as a 'professional' person with the coming income, my closet was obviously always durable in the extortion of more artistic things. My post-postgraduate classes were always supported emotionally and spiritually by interest, including silk screening that always photography, stained glass, ceramic, metal foil / welding, and industrial drawing. <br /> <br /> I keep jogging, walking and hiking to the remote destinations of nearby states such as California and Utah, Arizona and Nevada. Jogging, it takes time to walk as you walk and watch and listen and photographs or records can be heard. <br /> <br /> I was obsessed with reverse and teddy in that background. I was equally influenced by the artworks Andy Goldworthy's documentary material as well as the skills and polishing of director / cinematographer Thomas Raidelheimer. I could not really separate Goldsworthy's art from Riedelheimer's camera. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.
