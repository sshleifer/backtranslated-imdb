Steve Carroll once again likes, a light romantic movie star about family and pressure. I was expecting a flat-out comedy, much cheerful and unrealistic elements by film plot and cover art, but I think I was wrong. Of course the movie was a comedy, but it felt more of a light play than me and Steve Carroll again gave a great performance. The film itself confronts true observation and it is a powerful element that I find. However, the end felt a little bit and expected. Through out, cinematography was great, the acting was great and it was clear message still distributed but still still very important. Although, it came out of old, flat and expected end. After the end of the movie, many choices have been made (probably also for the worst), the film will be better promoted. Still a funny movie.
