The rich, alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with Secretary Lauren Bacall. She married him and was so happy that he stopped drinking. However, Bakal stack's best friend Rock Hodon is secretly in love. And stacks' Nymphomania's sister, Dorothy Malone, wanting after the rock. Drop into some complexity and the film goes out of control (well). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody looks beautiful, form-fitting clothes perfect and dresses. Basically this grade is a soap opera with a production value. The story is very fun and at the top of some of the dialogues. Hodgson's acting, stack and blemish are not good, but they are so young and attractive looking great ... Especially the stack ... When he smiled my knees, he became weak! On the other hand, Dorothy Malone is fantastic - she won the best supporting actress for her role. He is sexy, violent, wicked and sympathetic ... all believers. <br /> <br /> Fun, shiny trash. Do not miss it!
