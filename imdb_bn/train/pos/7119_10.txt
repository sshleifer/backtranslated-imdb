My father, Dr. Gordon Warner (retired Major, US Marine Corps) was in Guadalcanal and lost his legs to Japan and also received the Navy. My father was a technical advisor to this movie and I was hopeful that his influence on this film had really affected the way it was coming back, as I read in the various comments written by the audience that this film looks like real life.
