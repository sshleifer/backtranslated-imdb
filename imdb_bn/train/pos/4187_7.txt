This is a nice decent example of film Noua. The American government is trying to steal the secret from the arms of the Communists establishing this setting at the beginning of the 50's. <br /> <br /> Sieve Pickpocket Without Richard Wymark Scoper. She gives a nice decent performance but there is nothing in her list. The interesting thing is that he was not just a hero, but with the majority of films, unlike anti-heroes. That's not too normal. Jean Peters has given a so-called performance as the Hooker with the heart of gold. That great character actress Thalma Ritter is like a stool-kabutara. <br /> <br /> This plot was a fair piece of yarn and turn, advertising and hard talk. There is a battle scene at the end of the movie (at the subway station) which was quite diverse and exciting. <br /> <br /> I think silent fans (like I) will enjoy this movie. For non-silent viewers, this may seem a little overdone and a tad overdone the entire committee thing.
