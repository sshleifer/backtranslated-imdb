I like this episode but I think the secretary should have mentioned some quick to punish for being a partner after this fact. When I like that there is such an unexpected turn of an episode of Colombo, its resolution should be part of the conclusion of the episode as well as the appearance of the killer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon is invaluable. At one point, Gordon, playing a famous writer, famous Leigh Columbo has made some comments about being rich, which calls the tongue-in-the-neck hugging as a crime-salve as the real-life fiction of detective. This is one of the many great Columbo installments.
