Fresh pitcher is a funny enough movie. It has a lot of fun moments (including a ridiculously furious shower scene). Like most romantic comedies, it will happen in the middle of a "dead zone" where all the heavy, "he is breaking with me", but the other continues to be fun. <br /> <br /> Although the cycle revolves around the fear of Red Sox, it is not overloaded with sports. You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this image. <br /> <br /> It's easy for me to say: I was a boy too, so I became Red Sox fan. <Br /> <br /> 10 to 7 <br /> <br /> Barky
