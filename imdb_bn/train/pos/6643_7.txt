I was very excited after Halloween came out in the night before. When I found out that it was a book, written in 1978, before reading the movie, I had to read it. If I could not read the book, it would have been sure that the film was much different than me. The authors actually did a good job of staying true to the original plot of the book, the small differences are naturally I think the most disappointing thing about the movie was playing the role of the Boyle Colonel. I am not very fond of Boyle, and it seems that the mood of the movie does not matter, he is always trying to use it. - Lip lips, and dark makeup-Eddie eyes make yourself feel super sexy. Actually, I think that this movie was truly true of the cyclone's house. My favorite sub-plot was the Sheehan family (which was the strange B / C) in which the boy died in Iraq) and in current events KC Shehan, whose mother went to the Iraq war in an anti-Iraq war). The book is likely war, not Iraq, but Vietnam, and when the house launches the video of the helicopter, I was really leaving. Overall, I was fascinated with the movie, in which it followed the book very well.
