Actor Packeston debuted with a devastating, dark, and skillful thriller about a widow mechanic (Paxton himself), who used to rope his two boys to take part in the brutal murder, claiming that the victims were not "humans" but rather "monsters" The destruction of "demons" has been chosen by God. FLASHBA has been told by these boys, is now growing up (Matthew McConaughey) suspicious FBI agent (Power booth). <br /> <br /> This photo is hard to forget automatically; Better than most serial killer features, it's called a twisty and unsettling story easily with minimal minimizing movie gimmicks. Paxton, commendably, barely sees any blood until the end. Well played, especially the two children's actors (latest "Peter Pan"'s Jeremy Assortment and "Spy Kids 2" and "Matty O'Leary" of Domestic Disbarbance). For any reason, I cut any point because I understand that some people might get these tough stomachs. At any event, it is an athletic thriller with an appropriate script. <br /> <br /> 8/10
