Dominion Tank Police is one of the most amazing shows ever produced, without a suspicious shell, but is not the case of animation. Although the first part (law 1 and 2) is mostly composed of action and fun, the second part is more serious and the other part should not be considered the same as the first part. Subtleties are really beyond this world and the characterization is beyond brighter. You must have extra intelligence to appreciate the complexity of the second part (Acts 2 and 4). I have some complaints though. In the first part, Tank Bonaparte literally jumps on the tank shell and does not understand in any sense. Even if it is cold, jump to Bonaparte in a helicopter gun wing. Buaku rules
