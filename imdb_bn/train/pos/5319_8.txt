Forget that this is a "B" movie. It's that old forgotten in many ways. Instead, writer-director Ida Lupino was given enough credit for addressing such a subject (1950) was banned in Hollywood. For my knowledge, this was the first movie to address the emotional and psychological impact of rape on the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the age of 30 years, a teenaged girl, Anne, who tried to flee from her "shame", did a nice role. Based on his work in this film, I was surprised that he did not have a more successful acting career. Todd Andrews has also got a great moment, the minister can reach for his help. <br /> <br /> Ms. Lupino clearly works in a limited budget, was able to create some memorable scenes such as streets and alleys leading to rape, and following police lineups. And, she created a bittersweet end which left me wondering if Annie could really have a normal life again.
