It's an interesting little flick made in 1967, a cool Jazz Tongie soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh ... all right, it's not really fool, but it's Chesie fun. I have found so many matches in this and 'Animals with Blue Hand' (AKA bloody dead) and they have the same director! Scotland Yard is investigating the murder of young women in the best college. It seems that the perpetrators are being prevented from being confronted by some evil people from the local jail and they are back after the completion of their work. There is a nifty device hidden inside a bible that suits the acetic acid and another device that is not nifty or secret, it seems like a big square gun and it should be very close to the victim before it expires. Joachim Fuchsberger plays an inspector and he shows off mostly in gum chews and distance. There is a "monk", and anyone who marks this item as this "monk" is outside me, it carries a whip and dresses in a red cloth with a red hood, a clean member of a different color than a monk. All types of Nifty devices that are similar to a fireplace hit that accept the monk and go down and it goes on the right side of the fire without loosening its garment, it is a nifty strategy. It's a strange combo of crime dramas with Gupta's Optons, and it's rather fun to see it during silence. 10 out of 7, not bad ....
