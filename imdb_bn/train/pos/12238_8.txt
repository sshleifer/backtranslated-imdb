I always liked this comedy as one of the few tries to deal with the annual tax demand in the United States. Ever read a tax code: It is the majority of trials to follow our multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push to help their financial supporters and groups of interest. Despite the fair demands, the tax code always keeps the lion's share on the medium and the workplace rather than the rich and influential person. Most special clauses are meant for their use - go through the average 1040 or 1040A form and keep an eye on different investment and business initiatives, each of which has a different rule. Most people will not have any use for them. The story here is a wealthy zamindar (Philipp Ober) used his influence to close his IRS influence that his neighbor (Paul Douglas and Una Merkel) paid taxes within 20 years. IRS's Baltimore office is under Fred Clark, and he's focusing on his influence with OB. He sent Tony Randall to test the situation. <br /> <br /> Randall discovered that Douglas, Marcell and their three daughters and two boys are very nice people, who rarely need cash (they are beside their farm) and produce barter with their neighbors. But Randall, trained in the clear (IRS) lines of tax code, tries to pin the family to the basic things. But gradually Douglas thinks Reynolds is in love with Randall, and he keeps Randall apart from his joke, eventually drunking him. He made it difficult for him to leave Randle to repair his two motorcycle cars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, They actually make a cute couple. Finally, after Obe's complaint, Randol was sent to the insulted state and Clark (a hard cookie) became a piece of brass. And brings a big tax bill, which probably will destroy Douglas's family. The movie does not end - it ends happily, but it reminds us that the power of the tax is the destruction of power, and the government, all too often, go for the destruction. One million reverse is the chance to save the family, but it is very rare that we know it is a dramatic strategy. The more realistic is how the Clark Boss (Charles Lane), Oberoi's "help", will spend the whole day understanding how his taxes will be shown more carefully in the next year. Then instead of green is green.
