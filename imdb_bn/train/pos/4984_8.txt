"Lens Secret" is probably a lovely camp of my favorite all time. The best and fun from Kajawari Yoshiaki, is known for those splatter anime and sleazy hentai-ecchi anime. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the Cyclical SG sequence, where Lord Helmos extends his failing Henchien, party rioting which bills the bill (in a fun scene), and whenever my favorite character, Warsel appears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Be careful: it's not complicated for the fans!
