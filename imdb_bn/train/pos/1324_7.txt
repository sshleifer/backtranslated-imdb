You are sitting there for half an hour and see a story, believe it all, then stabilize the same story for half an hour ... and then get back together. Brilliant <br /> <br /> A documentary about the most exciting feature films on the San Francisco International Film Festival. I do not know - if there is anything else like Andrew Jarakis "Capture Friedman's Capture" - never brought Anna Bronioli's "forbidden Lie $" there. It publishes, publishes, publishes, releases, and asks about the "Honor Lost" author Narmada Khauri, who writes about the honorary killing of Jordan's respected and tall 2001 sellers. <br /> <br /> What is incredible and how this image is so exceptional that this "exposure" of Khouri is made with the full participation of Khauri. <br /> <br /> In the early part of the film, Khauri presents her story about the honor of her daughter in a respectful honor. Amman, book story <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another part of the devastating exposure comes here - it will not be mentioned here because it will reduce the shock value ... and then the return comes back and the charges face (not all, but the essential items of the book). <Br> <br /> And the law of Hawdini continues, this heavy weight, direct reward, becomes surprised after the surprise and there is no "happy ending" in the sense of round.
