It's about learning about us, recognizing what we are looking for and getting the courage to search it.

She is fascinated by her and eventually signs for dance lessons. She is ashamed to fear her dance and fear of laughter. He hides this from his colleagues and family members who are joining the dance class. <br /> <br /> There is a sunny view of the office presses, when Suzyam and Watnabe, a colleague who dances, is doing some dancing steps. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People are a little better.
