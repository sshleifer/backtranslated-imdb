I will ask you to start it: Why, why, what will the small film directors do, what can not the WB do? Sandy is probably an amazing director, and deserves some credit from WB and DC. But I think they could create a Super Hero Fan Dual in a $ 12,000 budget when they were blazing on the edge. <br /> <br /> I think choosing a bodybuilder (Mike O'Hare) to play Superman was a gifted choice. Let's face it, Superman is not a super model. She might be handsome, but she does not have a GQ study. And I do not know what that guy had some comments on me, but Superman was actually pretty dirty (have you ever read any superman comics?). I guess that only this phenomenon just flips me ... It seems like this is a clear choice that one can play with a real muscle and play a superhero rather than a beautiful hero. The same thing for Batman, the incredible shape of the message, and a wonderful batman ... I do not know the guys ... if big budget is given and his own movie ... Belle and Bartram will be neck and good. The following is just one of only a few pictures of these super heroes in the line with these actors. <br /> <br /> The actress is quite beautiful. I do not know what everyone is talking about, ohren is not bad. He is strong as Superman and the boyfriend ... Well, he is Batman. I mean, come to the people, this movie had a budget of $ 12,000, what are you expecting? Both of them seem to be less crazy than normal, without any other kind of diameter, but hey, we got Tommy-Lee Jones only as a reference. Oh, the loops are very hot. <br /> <br /> SFX flipin 'sweet too. I mean, looking up the superman with the car ... man, how cool it is. Unlike Greson's "Tank" view, I have to put it on top, since Mike actually thinks he's flying, and easily. Flying Sequins preferred a bit, but again, with a big budget ... Oh, and he even used a batmobile! (This was probably a model, but it seemed trickier). <br /> <br /> Overall, the only downfall of this trailer was the lack of a serious budget. And WB acknowledges that Colorea is a credible director, and there is a need to separate a project ... but no, they (just like most of the Marvel project) will only hold these hackers who do not show respect to fans, and for what they are worried, And keep these gambling films drunk. Thanks to God Superman Returns was a hit, or that it ended up seriously. The world is beautiful, and in my book, superhero movie is counted as.
