None of these best music concerts ever will see and hear. When I grew up, All My Lavin was new and the original artist heard again today that a measure of the capabilities of Sir Mac Mac to make any crowd of today's age. This Doco is not only for the band, but also behind the scene showing our lives on the road by road. I lived this man in Australia in 1975 and you can confirm his performance that this DVD is not less than 30 years ago. I have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that makes this decision and especially a Beatles fan advises. This is the earliest closest to a Beatles concert today. Singer, songwriter, lead / rhythm / lightning guitar, piano, ukulele, just pure genius. Some entertainers who can stand alone with one device and can catch up with them. If you want to note the perfect music, buy a studio record CD. If you want to listen to raw music, all the excitement and passion for the crowd and spontaneously crowd-this DVD is for you.
