The flower house is a great show. I'm still growing on it. When I started seeing it at the age of eight, and now I am 12 years old and still watching it. I fall in love with all the characters, especially Stefanie. She's my favorite He had a sense of humor. If there are people who are rarely seen in this scene, you should be careful about it. In 2002, the first event took place, which I saw when I first saw I jumped on it. This is a really good show. I really think this show family will go down to many generations of families. And it's great because it's an appropriate show for all ages. And for all parents, teach children lessons about how to live with their life. Nothing horrible will happen, such as violence or oath. It's just a really great sit-com. I give it 5 stars out 5. What do you think? Oh and it's the best time to visit when you are sick at school or even old office. It will make you feel much better. Believe me that I've been very sick, but I still know that it will make you better. And anyone who thinks Shock is a fool, well, that is very bad for you because you will not get as far into life, but if you are happy with your life. You really will see it and you will get hooked on it. I'm just telling you what happened to me and everyone else to show this awesome show. Well I needed to go to have some lunch there. Remember that you will start seeing the whole house and soon!
