What we got here is a condition. A man is found distressed and people want to help him - the opposite way. At the end they are forced to go to it. You can not fix people And even though in many ways my reign is the Hollywood, but that is not the message. <br /> <br /> This story is not about Charlie Feynman (Adam Sandler), who is a wife who lost his wife and three daughters 9/1, because the PTS has almost gone psychologically. Charlie Allan Johnson (Don Chadle), a dentist in New York who was his roommate at Dental School and knew about his tragedy, surrounded him on the street and reconnected. Charlie wanders around a small motorized scooter - a fantastic fantastic contraction for a discussion of Manhattan's traffic - with big headphones on vague hairstyles. Sandler's main prop is to show his fear of the hair. And use a shifting music to hit every iPod-Wide Subway Ryder home. <br /> <br /> Charlie is a disaster, but maliciously stuck with Allan, the regulatory wife (Jada Pinckett Smith), starts jealous of him soon. Charlie lives like a nurturing adolescent boy with a huge trust fund (tragedy), and starts to see Allan "hung out," "eat sugar," or buy Brooks Marathon in a rap house. . In a wonderful big apartment protected by a beautiful landlord, Charlie collects old vinyls, springstins, hoo etc., and plays a video game known as a giant screen shadow on a giant screen. Living Room <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Allan is offering him a new patient. Charlie's frustration makes us see Alan. Charlie partially tried to help Allan escape from his own stealing fact, but partly he made him more aware. <br /> <br /> Chadle and Sandler have created a strange couple, but it does not matter because they believe they both may need each other. Charlie was frustrated with being a friend of a friend who did not know his family, because to protect him from harm, he said that he was never one. And so if a roommate Charlie was sleeping naked and sleeping and had a terrible musical taste (no Motown)? Allan wants his turn to be a turn from life-ruthless. He is not only his wife, but also under his organs, who exercises power over him, although he practices it. They're white, on the street, and they're black. <br /> <br /> There are also sympathetic patients from hell, who are seriously prevented in dental offices, but when Charlie comes and gives notice it looks different. Babe. His work seems to be hiding at any moment to be revived. He knew Lively Tyler's breasts as the same building psychologist, who began to try Charlie's treatment when he admitted that he might need help. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Many of the plot devices (actually this movie seems like a game at multiple points), but there are a few of his psychosomasia where he deeply touches his sorrow. <br /> <br /> Charlie is just confusing and sad, but not dangerous and fierce, and all these attempts to help him start backfire. The film is publicly appreciated in a sense that people can not be created properly. This is a funny movie - sometimes sensitive - and this is the first time 9/11 has been faced with the conditions of living suffering. However, comedy is a stuff that seems to be sometimes vain, many people are drawn very extensively, and there are horrific decorations of large Hollywood internals; The only real face on the streets of Manhattan A court scene which is overwhelming, and Donald Sutherland is a judge who is very good to be true. Allan's family problem is easily resolved with a phone call. And it's still valuable to play - Chadle's control and disarmament, and Sandler is almost as a serious role. Anderson's 2002 punk-drunk love, though it's obviously a good film, is actually a better one.
