Take a pinch of Goodfellus, join it with God, add some roman myths and comedy comics, and your answer is about a populace directed from New Jersey. Almost entertaining as it is almost wrestling. I'm not the biggest fan of this show, but James Gundluffin's very complex Tony Soprono, who sometimes admits the fascinating psychology of conscience. I came to appreciate the people like Beck-Voiced Dame Chianis, such as the violent but murderer Uncle Jr., the silver-haired Tony Siriko, like forever annoying silly and imitating the very beautiful Eddie Falco, the hard-nails caramel. Violence suddenly and graphically, the number of body constantly climbs on each season, but it is often the most important small moment here. See Pauli and Tony's nephew Christopher (late Michael Ayprioli of Law and Judge) when they are lost in the pine barracks and sit on a bitter cold night in a abandoned trakra, both believe that they found it.
