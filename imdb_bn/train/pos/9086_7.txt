If you are under 13 years of age or older than 13 years of age, you will enjoy D-Day. If you are a serious dedicated fan of stupid filmmakers, you will enjoy DeWar. Otherwise, do not bother! I saw the movie with my nephew and 3 friends today. They really liked it and that made me feel better. After the movie's end, all the kids (my nieces and their friends) could not stop thanking for the theatrical take. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting and Direction Awesome. The story line is very simple. But, the audience had half children, screaming shouting while shouting at the screen. It makes the viewing experience even more exciting. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie to take your children, but without the sequence of final war, D-Day disappointments. I love this image 7 out of 10 mainly because kids love it much.
