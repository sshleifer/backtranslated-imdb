Most comments have been positive, but I want to add that audience sets should also be focused. Set designers used a lot of beautiful art deco treatments with beautiful buildings, stairs, doors, furniture and so forth. It's worth paying attention. The film is characterized by characterization and symbolism which is very rich. All Gangster actors are cast - it was like to see old friends and it was a treat. The dialogue was repeatedly entertaining but occasionally stilted and I think it is meant to be that way. This is a film of film buff. It has been created by humans, who are moderate love. Do not miss this one.
