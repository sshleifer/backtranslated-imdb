A thief in the night will be the best out of all the thriller thriller. People do not have a source of information about whether people are complaining about what people do when they say that these films are afraid to accept God. They just need to find an excuse and responsible for a thief in the night. Day of the week! These movies are not just one of the many chances of sadness, but they also make fun of their simplicity. They are actually low budget and it is a little obvious, but on the first viewing all is not very obvious. I had no idea because I really guess that many such movies were included in the low budget in the 70's. <br /> <br /> At night, a young man and dreaded paty tells the story of Mayar. To live close to her husband, her husband and almost all his friends disappeared from the prophetic miracle. First of all, the film is not based on it until it is disgusting around it. Is it going on toward it shows that everyone around him is becoming a Christian and believes in Christ, which usually happens with many people. Everyone around them once knew and love will go away forever, and everyone behind whom they blame themselves. Nobody can ever blame himself because they are always right. <br /> <br /> Similar to those who complain about this movie. These people will be full adult adults. I'm thirteen years old, and you do not see me screaming, especially since I was just like Patio, before that I reclaimed Christ in my heart. For those who did not see it, if you want to have a handful of a few creators in a Christian film instead of Stereo-style, wrong film, you will enjoy a thief in the night. Do not attack it before you try it. Some new ones are always good. Believe in your own innate
