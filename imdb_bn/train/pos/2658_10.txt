Kubrick again shows her stunning ability to open a perfect ambiance for a movie. Mainly through cinematography, but using an impressive score, he created a completely cool and unpleasant tone which is on the whole film and my spine becomes tired from the beginning. It really makes this masterpiece the best masterpiece in my eyes that in this drab ambiance. Of course, Jack Nicholson did not hit the best performance I've ever seen. A horribly authentic illustration of a mind has gone crazy. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial, beautiful, but the remaining two films seem to be seen when the rest of the picture is so bright. Plus it's the greatest name of the actor's greatest names ever (Scatman Crothers).
