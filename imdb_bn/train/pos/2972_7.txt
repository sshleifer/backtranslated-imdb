I must admit that I wanted to be a big fan of South Park and to have fun on the basketball but it was almost as close to becoming! I think it happens immediately after mixing together David Zucker, Math Stone and Trey Parker. This movie has so much replay value and at any stage bother to take yourself seriously. Snap stick style mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly. Humor like basketball was not popular when it was released and it would be a hit today. Do not try to be critical, just leave your brain in the door and hope to have fun. Humor suggests anyone with a good sense of it.
