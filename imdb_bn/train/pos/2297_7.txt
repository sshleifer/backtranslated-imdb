There is something about every "Hammer" movie I can see that it leads me to a new fantasy world. Some of the things in the movie "Hammer" can happen. One of the "Guardian of the Abyss" films. It brings a different kind of terrible fantasy to deep adventures in occult and hypnosis. All in all, an unforgettable movie. 7.5 / 10
