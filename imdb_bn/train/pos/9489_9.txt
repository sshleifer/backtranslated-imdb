I'm not tired to say one of the best political thrillers ever made. The story takes place in a mythical situation, but it is probably related to Kennedy's murder. The truthful and honest district attorney (operated by Yevs Montand) does not believe that this murder was planned and executed by a single person, Dasleau (= Oswald), and although all the other officials wanted to continue investigating with his team. <br/> <br /> The script is tight and fast written and finally got tense. Only part of the Millgram test about the authorities (though not selfish) is somewhat far from the place. In the last sequence - Icarus really explains - partially slow shots and intensified by a Mricon soundtrack; The most powerful sequence I've ever seen in a movie.
