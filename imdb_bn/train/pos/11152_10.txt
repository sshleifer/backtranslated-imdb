A masterclose is taken to watch midnight cowboy / acting / cinematography / editing / writing. It was basically small when I was released, and I saw it for the first time only a few years ago, but it has completely set the test of time, and I have seen it many times. Everything about Bright, Voight and Hoffman's impressive performance (though I know this movie well, I still found myself when Voight flashes in one of her cruel painful looks, or Hoffman is sick and unexpectedly coughing ) Stunning cinematography and nicely edited dream sequence. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that our contemporary filmmakers are not ready to take risks of making these films, which are as visible and comfortable as they are attractive Midnight Cowboy will need to see all the film in the school. <br /> <br /> 10/10
