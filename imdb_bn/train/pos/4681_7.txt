Overall, I've enjoyed this movie and will recommend it to Indie film lovers. <br /> <br /> However, I really want to remember the combination of this photo and the nicolas closure. One scene, particularly where Adrian Grannier's character, is related to Rosario Dosaban's sexual relationship, he has met with Closer's scene where Clive Owen's character asks Julia Roberts, though it works with less hardness and intensity in "Love". Both the notes and the character of Roberts are also named "Anna". Can not be coincidentally Now based on the clozer Patrick Marbar's play, and the idea is that this film is based on Arthur Sachitler's "Rezen", so I'm not sure how this connection was formed. <br /> <br /> Anyone has the idea?
