I have seen in the past some movies of some movies in this movie. I thought that the quality of the manufacturing standard was like clothing and settings. It was interesting to see how the thoughts of spirits and giants were directed. <br /> <br /> I agree with some other comments about the fight scenes. They were difficult to follow during the time. <br /> <br /> Finally, an ethical story. Some Japanese viewers will be interesting to know what they think about the movie. Want to see this image again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Intense
