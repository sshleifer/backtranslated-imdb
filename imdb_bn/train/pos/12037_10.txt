The Woman in Black was a British made for British film, which was first released in Eve's BBC in '89 and again in '92. I believe it's a round on an A & E American TV. It was released in British VHS in the early 90s but went out of print. After a US company released it DVD, but that version sold out. According to the book's author's website, this movie is owned by someone else, and it will not be released again and there are unauthorized radio sales in Ibb. <br /> <br /> I recently heard about this movie on a message board and had to check it out. I found a copy of eBay for about 28 taka. The DVD says that "Made in Canada", Ha Ha Haor is sure to be a fake from a previous vendor. But this is a good copy, and you can not blame bullet labels for revealing rare things, lost out of print and in legal disputes. <br /> <br /> I like the movie. It was set in a 1920s decade, during which time there were all pure and pure British settings. Black woman women are very atmospheric and dark. In most cases, the film is very low, but functioning and scary. There is not much between any influential pregnancy, violence or special effects, but Women in Black is still able to create a very cool moment. This is a cool classic styled Ghost movie. In the 1930s it seems to be made apart from the color, except for the color. Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies, I am afraid this film will always be a lost gem. For me, it puts myself as a favorite one of my time.
