* I have spoilers due to some film techniques, so at your own risk! * <br /> <br /> I like this picture. Using tinting in some scenes it seems to come to life in an old photograph. I enjoyed the human projection on a back screen. For example, in one scene, Leopold calls his wife and is usually projected behind her instead of a split screen. His face is huge behind and Leo is on the front. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />, with the mouth close up. It reminds me of the battleship potemkin, that the intense constant styling combines with a red spray and pulls it over many beats. Catherinea's father died in the bathroom with the same scene ... you can only see red water next to the side. What I like about Van Trier is that, due to its lack of fear, it will become even more blurred. <br /> <br /> The use of photo text was unique, such as when the character of Layro was pushed by the word, "Werewolf." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was good to use black comedy in this movie. Ernst-Hugo is great as Ziergardd Leo's uncle. It highlights the seniors from the role of Riget. This humorous WW2's terrible backdrop makes it easy to accept all the disorders and makes the train operator's unrealistic sensual sensitivity platinum. While everything goes crazy, the hospital administrator tries to maintain normalcy at the end of the part so it reminds me of Rigget. It shows that the horrific things happening around some people around them are really true. Yet some people, like Leo, are involved, but can not do anything positive about it. <br /> <br /> It is very fun to work well with Max Fon Saidor. It attracts you in the story and you enter Leo's head, which is sometimes a terrific place. <br /> <br /> The movie highlights a point that if they do not like one, then the side. I saw the same concept of the Dakar dancer, where the character of the wizard does not speak for itself and ends up to the end of its destruction. In fact, at one time, Van Triyad broke me with a wave and a dancer and bored men and women, but now I know his male characters are not good enough! At the end of the dancer, I found myself in the same place, when you seriously want the main character to reconsider their actions, they must never!
