An enthusiastic, intelligent 'four elephants' (strong cake, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, John Pertwey, Ingrid Pitt, etc.) all stylish performance, less than a gifted gift from Amicus, producer Milton Sabetsky and director Peter Duffel ('The Far Pavilions' etc.) Despite the budget results of some 'un-special effects' results. But the most outstanding contribution, the 7-year-old Cloofrans, who has become an impressive effective account of his part, makes blood blood cooler. The movie has lost its title to the Lorid title only, the underlying release, a cut over the run of the match 'Blood' n 'Gates' Shankar movie, who praised a bit of anxiety with their horror. .
