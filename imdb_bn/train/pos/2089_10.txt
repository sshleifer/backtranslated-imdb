"The Good Earth" is a great movie that you can not hear any more. There are many big disasters and incidents, but it's a non-passionate love story. This will happen a little bit within two hours, which is summarized by today's standard. Special effects and clothing are very good for the time. <br /> <br /> I am surprised that Luis Ranger has received an Oscar for this limited role. She basically has only three emotions: modest, hungry, and heart broken. <br /> <br /> Performances by Asian and Asian American actors are awesome. <br /> <br /> <br />
