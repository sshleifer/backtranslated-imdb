Gundam Wing is an amazing show starting from the beginning, watching every single episode is a pleasure. The story is usually hooded, increasing the population of the world's population in the future, where we can create space colonies. Although the story is completely different than any other bully show. It is the colony 195 years later and the Earth is corrupt Earth Government, which is known as the World Sphere Alliance, violently adopting free colonies. To deal with the alliance's control and more threats (an evil military organization hidden in the alliance known as the LZ, which then takes control of the world and colonies), select the members of the colonies, send 5 super powerful mails on earth to try and save colonies from the threat that will soon come. For These mechs, known as Gundams, take the stage in front of the OZ as OZ fight and try to get back to peace in colonies, remove the entire coalition and take control of the Earth and its colonies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Previously said, most probably the most enjoyable Gundam series in my opinion. A large part of these factors is the difference between this series and any other gundam series before, but the stories are more deep and complex than most of the other gangster series. There is more depth and passion with thunder wing which I have seen so far ever since. This special series seemed to focus more on the relationship between character and those characters than epic aerospace warfare. Now do not mistake me, this show still has many epics, and the show still maintains the epic atmosphere of the other gundam series, but it achieves it by following the story of a fake 6 or 7 character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fire General. The show sports some amazing animations and gorgeous action, but story depth and insight keeps you coming back for more. The characters are so beautifully finished that you will love them. This show is certainly one that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> a perfect 10/10!
