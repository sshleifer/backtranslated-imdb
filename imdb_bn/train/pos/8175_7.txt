Before we start, I have a fear of a tooth. This movie gives me creeps and even makes me cringe. I love this picture. The movies are kind of annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soon, he started hallucinations and his Started torturing patients, killed a colleague, and even murdered his wife and murdered the person with whom he had a relationship with him. <br /> <br /> * Last Spiller * <br /> <br /> The movie is very bloody and poor. <br /> <br /> I am giving 7 of these stars out of 10 stars. Dr. Allen Feinstein is not your usual daily dentist!
