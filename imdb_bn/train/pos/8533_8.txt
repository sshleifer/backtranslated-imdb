The movie is coming from the most loopin, especially the animations. Otherwise bad dub, it's not bad. <br /> <br /> The first hour is very much like comic (which is based on the third thing in the loopin). Lupin tried to get a huge treasure. Fujiko tried to find something from women using the weakness of the loopin. The last bit is not bad, she is with other women, but of course Fujiko is also one of her number. <br /> <br /> Many more photos of lupine, more families with lupine. I think that any good loopine fan will suddenly be surprised (I know I was after hearing so bad things about this movie). It can be a bit better without cracking little animations during the credits (they make it a little mascot), but overall it is not a bad movie. Sufficiently enough to look after the third movie of the lupine.
