Father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi ignored his own family and son in search of India's freedom struggle, this film about his son, Hiralal, who felt neglected for the services of Mahatma Gandhi for society. Mahatma Gandhi acted as a barrister, and filming began in South Africa in the fight for India's cause for independence against the British. In South Africa, Hiralala came to help a barrister to help her father, because Gandhi was involved in the liberation struggle, he wants his wife and children to join the service of the society, and therefore Hiralal will not be given the opportunity to complete his education and fail in his examination. , She married her love (Phoolia Chawla) against her father's will. Hiralal has a desire to travel to England and become a father-like barrister, but his father refused to give him a scholarship given by a businessman to his family, and instead it tells another person that the scholarship is not limited to the family and the most eligible students living in the colony. Should be The conflict between the fingers of this finger and the father and son increases, Hiralal hates to hate his father and blames him for being illiterate and unemployed. The struggle to meet Hiralal has ended and he has lost his wife and children in a failed business endeavor and huge loan on the streets. Akshay Khanna has done a fine job like Hiralal Gandhi. All the Quds, Directions and Scripts are fantastic to him, the picture is excellent, the picture is excellent. Overall a nice movie and a must see. I pay it a 10/10
