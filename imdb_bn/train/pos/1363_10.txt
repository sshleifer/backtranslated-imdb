A great 90's flick! In this story about Manhattan's Nightlife, Parker Ponsi is fantastic, which is so much cash needed. Posey gives an amazing performance as a librarian and a night crawler. Before leaving it on Saturday night it is a good, light film. Soundtrack Stones, outfits outside this world, scripts are funny and actors do a great job. Release price: If you try, you can make it in this world, just find your niche. I believe that Parker Posy is an appropriate actress for this character: young, fabulous and broken. (You must see the movie "Clutter"). If you watch party girl you are bound to a good time. Enjoy!
