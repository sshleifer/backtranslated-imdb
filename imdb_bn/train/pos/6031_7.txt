About 200 members of CuiWelland, Ohio, American film society, called Sinamathak, were arrested on August 19, 2000 to see the Princene Cinemascope print of Mickle Angelo Antonio's 1970 film "Jabersky Point". Sinamathak director John Eving, who did the best work for the best print of the series, shared with viewers that this print was specifically shown from Italy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> Seeing this fantastic print, Antonioni's intention was to make one aware that it was a modern art work. The series has been kept in the Cleveland Institute of Art of the University Circle, more appropriate. <br /> <br /> Ant√≥nio's works have been made for the cinematic landscape. His beautiful balance of images, interesting use of color, swimming in galactic movement, all the generals work, which uses his canvas screen. <br /> <br /> Finally the audience could understand "Jabersky Point." As it has been described, this work is not a story, but rather a painter's rendering of artistic illustrations. More than sixties, some obscure activity settings provide only a dramatic motor for the artist's sleeping collage. <br /> <br /> <br /> Antony is not bound by the conventional narrative standard, and creatively can break the start of an event with the grandiose decoration in any way. The audience went voluntarily with his extraordinary imagination, because his huge images suddenly attracted attention at the huge canvas. The audience may only be involved in characteristic relationships, but it has been understood that the theme is about humanity, the repetitive theme of the director. It was also realized that in a cinemask, a print of a lesser or lesser value than this original can not judge this particular rendering. The audience expressed the most gratitude to see "Jabersky Point" in its original, exciting format, and finally broke into radioactive mockery.
