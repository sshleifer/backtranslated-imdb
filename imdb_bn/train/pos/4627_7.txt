If you're going to play a game in the prison walls, why do not go for the top playwright William Shakespeare? And if you are going to choose your cast from many culprits for long term contracts for the most serious offense, but you can be sure that there will be plenty of time for rehearsals. Such a bold project in a Kentucky corrective prison is taken with amazing results. This picture shows how it was done? Casting ?? Rehearsals? Sets and constimes ?? And the final representation of Shakespeare's game "The Tempest". It has not happened to me before, but there is a similarity between the game's setting and the corrective prison. Shuffled letters in the game are limited with no contact with an island outside the island. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Every man had little cayos behind the character. A prisoner saw this game as the remover of others' sins as an excuse for wrongdoing. As they talked about murder, shooting and satirical talk, the men were quite running to see a tears removed. One sentiment was that they would bring back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. However (as someone had said) had gone past, and the present was a new future at the beginning. At least this game has given temporary relief from the depression of past events. <br /> <br /> Prison officials should be appreciated for allowing play. Kentucky on such an event map and hope other prisoners could follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone is alive? Not only in Kentucky prison, the prisoners should find their own new confidence and self-esteem, and they should be ready for that day when they leave.
