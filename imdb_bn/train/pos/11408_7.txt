Etienne Guerrut is just a character actor - people never know by name almost by name. However, he again acted as an actor - the only actors of the film Filo Vance who played his role more than once. I saw him two more times and love him every time because he is very interesting and fresh air streams. In addition to Gerrardt, this film has many other great performers - Grant Mitchell, Jean Lockheart, Henry Walthall, Kenneth Smith, H.B. Warner and Nath Pendleton It's a pretty impressive cast, and they definitely make it easy for men and women Edmundloble and Virginia Bruce. <br /> <br /> This great character actor is one of the major reasons I love this old B-movie. . Because the mystery itself is very rare that horror writing and acting, the film is really satisfied. For this movie, Vince has performed wonderfully through greed, as I said, the mystery itself is only after thinking - the silly plot involved in hypnotism and suicide. Unfortunately, you can not be mesmerized for doing something like this - I got trained in clinical hypnosis and if I could do something like bad people, I could have done it in film, I would have done it! Used car vendors and some of my old boss had a clear goal !! <br /> <br /> Overall, if not the best Filio Vance film, it was great and it was a great shame that only once people played this role. In fact, apart from William Powell (who played Van Vaughan), the series has long played the role of Bell, Rothbone, Wilfred Hide-White and Warren William (and many others) playing Van. This is a similar problem that has beaten Bulldog Drummer series - just a few different actors to play leading people. <br /> <br /> Good looking and exciting - though it is impossible.
