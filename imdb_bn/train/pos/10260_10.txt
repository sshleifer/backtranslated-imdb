The first installment of this infamous horror series has finally been abducted by a gang wearing black clothes and tortured him for a long time before killing him. He is incredibly beaten, incredibly screaming in the chair, dragging his fingernail, dies on it, warm warm water is poured over him, and finally his eyes are rolled with a needle (really sick and nasty scene). This unforgettable torture makers are the closest thing to a snap film you can get without making it as much as possible and killing one tap on me. Of course some special effects are rather poor but the idea of ​​making a snap quite pretty. I saw "flush and blood flower" which is more serious and sadistic, but less annoying. However, this one must be seen for the terrible fans!
