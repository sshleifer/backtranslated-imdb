This is an excellent film about a traditional working family of North England. Standing in Bolton, it makes James Mason as the father of an influential power like his father. Or so it seems. Incredibly, based on the game, illustrates the complexity of the film, family life. Support cast as well as awesome, much-known face support loans.
