This film is definitely an odd love story Though the film may not shout, but Nikol Kidman himself has taken his own picture, but the rest can be easily forgotten, although Ben Chaplin did a great job of Hatfordshire Life with a shot from St. Albans and Hemel Hemstead. The city center depicts the true essence of the area. As a regular episode of the popular British TV series "Heartbeat" began to appear visually, soon became a great Gangster Gateway Action Flickey. These little movies really do not make any memorable events and thus the fairly finished weekends are worthwhile. It's a good to see, and if you think of hero John alone as thirty, you can identify something with his character.
