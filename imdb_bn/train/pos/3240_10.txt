I found this image by mistake several years ago and was surprised (still there) why it should not be appreciated. Well written, beautiful acting, a shocking twist after the other, and what the backend characters are trying to have a plurality. I would not recommend this film for people with small attention spans; At this stage enough intelligence is needed to understand a kernel of truth.
