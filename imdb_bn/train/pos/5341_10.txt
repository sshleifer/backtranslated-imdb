Carroll's journey is a pleasure to watch for many reasons. Clara's acting is amazingly amazing for a young person, and he is one of the special actors who can say a lot with facial expressions. Director Urumul Urbbi presented a firm and controlled film continuously without any breaks, which leads to this plot at a steady pace and enough ammunition to surprise the surrounding scenes. The story of Angel Garcia Rollan's story telling at its best, which seems to be, if the film's main motto is always the same. The plot is almost logical, yet logical as the incident is completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film influenced the public to tell the Spanish Civil War story. This was a major event in the 20th century, but no American knew about it. In fact, in 40 years of university education I saw almost one student building a semester, who even heard about it, few could say a lot about it - and a remarkable number of students were meritorious scholars, all of which speak a lot of American education censorship. So, in one way, this film is a good way to start a study of that event, remember that when a thread is dragged, a large part of history is exposed. Therefore, the perception of this film, directly related to the amount of knowledge. This movie completely misses the movie to see the upcoming movie of another movie. Considering the seven aspects of the left elbow index film - acting, production set, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity, and artistry - scale 10 for very good, 5 average and 1 scale for help. Carroll's journey is average as an average, except for conversations, above average on all calculations. The LEI average for this movie is 9.3, up to 10 if the IMDB is the same on the scale. I highly recommend this film for all ages.
