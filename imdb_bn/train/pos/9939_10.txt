This is a cartoon series where most of the action occurs in the human body where actors Vitamins, Viruses, Blood Cells etc. I will not try to explain it in more detail, you only have to see it for yourself: you will not be frustrated. <br /> <br /> I remember the child in the 80's (with Swedish Voices). I talked to a few people who had children in the 80's and they liked it! I have to admit that the episode education section has not reached me consciously, but the whole idea of ​​children's education in fun is surprising. I recently saw a few episodes; It's a humorous and hearty thing that is difficult to find in other children's programs nowadays. <br /> <br /> 5/5
