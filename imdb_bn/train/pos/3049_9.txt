When I was in a Hollywood video, I saw their clearance-out cinema and Demonicus had five bourues and fifty percent off! I have seen it once and could not pass this great deal! The second viewing was much better than the first. The box is so cool and the music is very good. If you still do not see demotic, I recommend you or if you rent and hate, Demonicus gives it another chance because another view of it can change your mind. If you've seen a copy of the price for a Hollywood video, then this could not be passed as a big deal! <br /> <br /> Demo is very different but entertainment movies. Believe it or it's like playing an interactive video game with the game! It is very low budget and the actor is sure that nobody is known. We started the video game, I mean a movie with a guy and a woman in Italy where there is a cave and there is a cave that looks like a railroad / train train tunnel and he says he does not go there and how he does the normal stuff! He will not listen! He went there and found a lot of gladiator artifacts and armor and a legendary gladiator named Toranus is almost completely preserved body! Where was his chair sitting and his body was so good and where was the collar pot? Come from? So is each cave completed with a Caultron pot? Tyrannous has his arms, wearing a helmet, and has a weapon or two. By doing the most dirty thing he can make a person, he keeps the helmet and is taken by the spirit Tireans! From there, killing all the campers there and bringing back the original tirens. <br /> <br /> Now I have already said like a video game. It's hard to explain but it looks just like it. Music sounds like video games Acting is really terrible. Actor says why he is doing this, he was already and brown because I'm going to his sleeping house! There is also a big flaw in the movie, and a guy is trying to find his girlfriend at night and is still searching for the day to go out with him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Classic like the Gaufff, but if you really love the movie with low budget flaws, it's entertaining but you'll see Demoncus to look good!
