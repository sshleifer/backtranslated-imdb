Basically, I like the Vereovan film because in his film, I've enjoyed an intelligent pscychomey story that I saw at the "Basic Institute". This is really an awesome thriller. I have enjoyed a lot. So it's another Verhoeven movie for me. <br /> <br /> It is its previous instruction before it hit the "Basic Institute" of blocking its block, and for that I was very interested to see that movie and yes, the film fills my hopes and expectations. <br /> <br /> This movie "Fourth Man" is a brighter pscichosexual drama which is a light bite complex for some viewers. The story of this movie is known as a gay writer "Reve" (crow), an alcoholic who lives by his own moral values ​​and sees many spectacular views that can warn him from a future accident. At the end of his lecture, introduce a tempting woman called "Christine", a mysterious past that does not want to reveal. His son should have sex with him as his son. In the morning, she saw her sexy, butter lover's picture on her table, and the man went to the station. She is interested in seeing him and asked to invite Christine to his house. <br /> <br /> It's that. I do not want to publish the whole story because it's a Veroovan movie and the end of the film is really amazing! In particular, I like the character "Reve" which is wildly "crazy". I basically loves her acting because as a gay person I completely marked her character and yes I like her charming face . <br /> <br /> I'm about to create such a black comedy. I want to thank Varevovan. <<br /> <br /> I'm rating this movie: 10 out of 10
