I just saw this movie for the first time and I liked it. Her dance was very entertaining. I knew to dance somewhere because he got a part in the movie that read somewhere. The scenery was very great. Yvonne is such a gifted woman and beautiful. We laugh at the stupid kiss scenes, but that's great about old movies! I grew up with him with Munster and I enjoy watching him in his earlier films. Not all of them can be great there, but they are still valuable to see their work and to sing. I gradually purchased all his movies and I'm watching them as I take them. I have a great collection of his memories.
