A friend gave me this DVD, which he received from the director of the festival, I think. I warned that the technical aspects of the film were somewhat vague and the writing was good but was not good. So maybe that's my verdict color but I must admit that I liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Actor Standout Yusuf Karker was really good as Arnie, the main character, desperate in the desired way. Adam Jones (who was instructed) and Justin Lane was nice as roommates surrounded by Arnie Pagal. Bill Charit (Justin Lane), who spent many films like Pundar, was my darling; He was thinking at least one dimension, and reminded me of an old college roommate so that I would call the guy watching the DVD. Kindly loving, and very fun. Some of the other performances were good, something was so, but it was no worse. I really like the vigilante duo. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ? Good Adam Jones and crew done
