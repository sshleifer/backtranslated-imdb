While vacationing in Norway, I picked up the DVD release of this movie where it was released through English subtitles. <br /> <br /> The picture is neatly photographed and played strong. The young man who illustrates 'Fryts' painter is a surprisingly open face that mirrors painful accuracy with the tragic events surrounding it. <br /> <br /> We already know that Father's love is a mental health problem and when this brutal headmaster attacks the boy, he denies and considers it to be his own father. <br /> <br /> Climatic scene where Frott refuses to show respect to the headmaster; Perhaps a view that if you just stand on his ground and repeat his 'lair' as he is cruelly attacking in front of his classmates you will not forget. <br /> <br /> The movie is a weak point rather than 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' technique in the book. Other than that I'm sure it's a movie that you really enjoy.
