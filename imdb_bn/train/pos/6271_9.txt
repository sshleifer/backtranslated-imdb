I like this movie. It was quite calm. It has everything: cars, gun shooting, fighting, even a token girl. It does not excel any of these things, except for the exception of the car. A bit of shooting, a little bit of fighting, a kiss around, and a lot of cars, a great choice at the end. Jump, you can say, impossible, but IMDB is here because of our best friends, so the film is not as bad as people are filming it. It has some quality, and I like to see it. Actually, I liked the film. And I do not have to close my brain to see it. I did not always think "Is it possible?" Or trump like that. 10 in 9
