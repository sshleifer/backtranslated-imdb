All right, all right, probably not the best. I mean, Exacyist and Psycho and some others are difficult to pass, but The Shining is there. However, it became the best movie of Steven King's story. It's better than the stand, better than the pet committorio (if not terrible), better than wells, better than green miles, Dolores Klibern is good, stand by me (just though, though), and yes, it's good Shawshank Redemption Shut up, it's good), I'm not worried what the IMDB top 250 says. <br /> <br /> I read it a few decades ago, Stanley Kubrick was trying to sort through his novel in his house, which could make a good film and from another room, his wife could hear a pounding of frustration, half-a-half to throw the book against the wall Hour or his words Finally, for almost two hours, he could not hear any word, and when he went to see whether he died on his chair or something (of course, I must say with due respect), he paid attention to him and saw that the book was in his hands, and was in the book The Shining . And thank God, because he went to make the book one of the most horrible films. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Stephen King about the complexity of the story, and in his remote hotel, he works in his writing to watch the boy in very disconnected winter time. Jack Terrence (his number is Jack, where he played a character named Jack), as well as his ludicrous distribution of various popular lines ('Heyyyyy Johnny !!'). Thanks to the role of Shelley Duval, which lets the audience relate to Jack's wish to kill the audience. This wonderful story can be given thanks to Stanley Kubrick for his very recognizable touch and thanks to Scrooge's most couples for playing the part of the girls who killed the caster's director. <br /> <br /> One of the most notable aspects of this film is its essential importance for the story, isolation for its most important effect, and it is rendered improperly. During the time of Jack's follow-up, the film began with a long view when he took the winter supervisor to his old hotel for the job interview. Following Jack and his family, it soon follows the same thing when they run the hotel wind mountain road. During this time Jack, Wendy, and Danny shots were interacted with the scene, among which were able to sneak through the advice of the commercial TV's bad advice, because Wondy expressed his concerns about speaking of cancer in front of Danny, who said that it is OK because he Already have seen this on TV ('See? OK, he saw on television.') <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , And it is made more awesome by bloody past huge, echoed rooms and long hallways. These rooms, along with their horses, continually insist on hotel freezes, but this is a hallway that actually creates the majority of the film's abnormalities and the traditional traditional trends of the Cabirts give the holwells a blurry three-dimensional feel. At the beginning of the film, a famous tracking shot that follows Danny in a big circle, when he wanders around the halls in the big wheel (which is called them?), And its relative speed (as well as throwing the wheels made from it from the wood floor Travels) around the corner, gives a sense of knowing what to do. And being the story of a Stephen King, you expect something to jump on you. I think the best scenes in the hall (as well as one of the most awesome in the movie) when Danny is playing on the floor, a ball slowly moves towards it. He sees and sees long hollowway, and the ball is something like a toy toy, you expect it to be such a terrific surprise pair that is roaming around him. However, you get points. The shining movie is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You feel that there was something missing. Hack Jack was always there, as Mr. Grady told him in the men's room? Was he really in that statement in 1921, or is he the one who looks like him? If he was always a caretaker, like Mr. Greyhoe said, did he mean that he had gone crazy and killed his wife and two daughters, or was not a grandi? This is one of the things that can be left out of the loose for film making only a middle film for the film. For example, The Emirate's Horror, which apparently copied the subject of The Shining, as much as its subject did. But it is completely different, when a movie is presented which really thinks you (mostly the movies of Cubera films). One more thing to thank Stanley Kubrick, and we would like to thank for that, not to throw this book against the wall. One of the toss movies that has been tragedy.
