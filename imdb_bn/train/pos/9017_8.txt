This film is an excellent work to illustrate an ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) patient disaster. The subject is done with condolences as well as humor. Helena Bonham Carter is so sure of a person with ALS that I believe he's just acting. Kenyith Branagh, a wonderful actor, is a substitute for the quarque artist who lives up to the prospect of being misbehaves and is being offered an alternative to Helenna's character as part of his "community service". The relationship between these two starts from the beginning of development. This is a fairy tale that does not stop from the incredible performance. One comes to care deeply for the two of them.
