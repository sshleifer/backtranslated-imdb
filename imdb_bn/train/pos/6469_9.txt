This is a really great short break from Roach. These are two main reasons: little kids are sometimes the most attractive to stay in film and this plot has many fun and well-written pieces. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In spite of being a intensive and unattractive kid in the coming years, he was just valuable here. And, even a little boy of little children was not just funny to have kids, but once again the intelligent factor went upstairs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All kind of fun breaks loose breaks. Gags are quite effective and well done - a sudden crank call involving a killings and a final scene where the spani might end up being the most memorable of the little ones. I have not seen these shorts for decades and I'm glad I gave this a chance.
