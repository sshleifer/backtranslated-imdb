About 21 years ago, it saw Matinai's first film on ITV (before cable and satellite days). I was locked out of school with the Mumpas and I was completely wrapped in the film. I've bought the video for almost 10 years and I want to get a DVD copy of it. David Nivan was my greatest actor ever and I thought it was inappropriate that he was looking many times while coming closer to the Oscars. I think the queen gave her a drama because she did much more for movie cinema, if Sen was more than Connie or Anthony Hopkins. The film comes back from black and white and comes back again and is the star of the early form of Roger Liviesi, Marice Gerring and Richard Attenborough.
