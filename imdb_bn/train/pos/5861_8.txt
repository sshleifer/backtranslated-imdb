Overall, I fully agree with the review of the Eighth. In a sense, I think it should not be commented that it is a vet film and I'm not a vetam (I was a resident). The error is mistakenly mistaken and does not work consistently. My guess is that Stefan Metcalf spent a very short planning on a veto and his character himself.
