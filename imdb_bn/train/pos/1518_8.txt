Third in the series of seven Amicus horror myths, the third is reduced blood. As part of the series is included in the Monitor Club, this will be eight movies. However, the film is very different from the other. <br /> <br /> I keep an eye on Amicus myths because I loved them when I was in my age. Today, my feelings for them are so strong. <br /> <br /> I spent many years trying to track this movie. The stories summary was so objectionable that I finally paid enough money for it to find a copy. As great as the movie, I finally felt a feeling of disappointment when I finally saw it. It was not quite good as I was believed. Better than its two predecessors, it is almost as close to what I would look like as four heirs. <br /> <br /> The linking story shows John Bennett as a police inspector, who is looking for a missing person living in a mysterious growth home. His journey started at the local police station where he learned the stories of the residents of the past. After linking the story, he visits the estate agent who sells the house. This linking story seems to be provocative on paper, it is flat and useless in practice and easily the weakest of an American mathematics. I could not help but feel that John Bennet Donald Pleasance or Ian Hendy's poor man's version. I would rather meet one of the two aforementioned actors in his role. We may even have both here - as one of the police inspectors and other estate estates as one. They could, and I believe, made this poor element of film better. <br /> <br /> There are four stories in this film, which focus on the residents of each house. <br /> <br /> The first story is seen as the author of crime stories, as well as the author of the crime story. He is absorbed into an exciting story about a strangler, drawing a sketch to help an authors. Immediately after that he started to look at his creation. Some excellent aspects of Peter Duffel, especially camera angle choices, help to get rid of the integrated script. Elliott's performance is fantastic as a painful author and she helps improve the story. The story ends with a semi-twist, but I could not help getting the feel of a script which does not allow it to live with its potential. <br /> <br /> The second story can be seen by Peter Cushing. She is a lonely man who is still married to a beautiful young girl who once made her cry and kept a picture. Cushing's performance really brings life to this emotionally moving story. She chose to include continuous focus on the loneliness of the cushion who is helped by the director. It is also taken with a great misleading view that helps us to look into the mind of kushinga. However, Cushing looks like an image of a nearby wax museum that his daughter just seems like. Naturally his passion grew but there is a boring packing at the end of this seemingly romantic story. Joss Ackland starred in Kushing's rival, but his performance spread widely through late great Peter Cushing. <br /> <br /> The third story and the best one is the most popular Christopher Lee - always my favorite horror actress - her daughter enters home. Mr. Lee here is one of his perfect ice cold performances. She shows no love or attention for her daughter. She even brought her home to a school educated. One of his extraordinary performances, trying to find out what is a guarency hand operated by Nouri Don Portt. Without a long distance, I can reveal that witchcraft plays a role. The presence of Christopher Lee's genuinely realization is being made in his every scene. Chloe Franks is deserving of special recognition for his huge undercurrent performance, which is the simplest character in the whole film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not stay silent, John Pertwee is a horror movie Actors who came home came to play He is very dissatisfied with the way his producers go to movies, everything looked cheap and fake, especially as clothing. So he decided to buy an authentic cloak for his latest vampire roles. Jeffrey Beldon has a nice quoie as a delivery that Porterway has sold an antique cloth shop. When Pertwee keeps cloak, he is developing fangs and originally started transforming into a vampire. Pertwee's performance will be seen to be believed. It's really fun. Ingrid Pett has also been much bigger in this story but its talent is wasted in a role. <br /> <br /> Ending linking story with a minor connection with the final story. It is particularly suitable because the Inspector decides to move parallel and naturally visits the house. The rest you can work for yourself. As the linking story is as weak, somewhat curious curiosity ends if it's a decent one. <br /> <br /> I am convinced that what was a genuinely glorious movie was the fault for the shortcomings, with the director Peter Duffel, who did his best with what he really got. I think this script was very restricted and the lack of ambiguity in the four upcoming movies. <br /> <br /> Overall, home-made blood, which despite its flaws, must see blood fans for Amicus anthologies, other Amicus movie fans or portmanteau horror movie fans. If my summary provides the movie with enough appeal in your eyes, check it out. You will enjoy it!
