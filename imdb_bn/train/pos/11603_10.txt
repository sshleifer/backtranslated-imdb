The first time I saw it got half but I saw it and later I knew it was a Selim witch test. They focus on the whole good family. She is famous for cursing a pastor who is the truth. In the film it comes to the future of his daughter Dorkus and her husband Anne Putnam Sara's husband, in the future to paint her daughter's hunting for the release of the soul. Which will happen at the end of the movie. Dorcas is burned at the stains of those who are pictured as witch at the age of 5years. Anne Putnam does not happen which preserves him from the fire. She is safe, she can not see empty barely in Anne Putnam's grave, but in the first case she complains about her witchcraft, and burns her to death. Now that Ann Putnam is rescuing his soul, and he is not upset from the society for the trial of the Salem witch.
