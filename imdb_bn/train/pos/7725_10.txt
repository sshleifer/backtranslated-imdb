I first saw this movie while coming out. I was almost 9 years old. Old and the film is very entertaining and very scary and I have seen it against any other film till that time. <br /> <br /> Basic plot: A campaign has been sent from Earth to the fourth planet on the planet of Ultyre. There is no news of the great adaptation of the novel Akilia to know what happened in a colony of colonists living before the twentieth century. Theme: A dismal civilization (like us) comes with the communication that remains the remains of a highly developed alien civilization, Krell-200,000 years have been deleted. The "seeds" of destruction from one civilization are being adopted on the other side unknowingly. This movie theme is very good vs evil <br /> <br /> I first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. I was just a boy and tiger scenes feared me as a scene of war with unknown creatures. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Advanced Advanced technology and responsibilities seem to be in hand. We must work to acquire knowledge along with the knowledge of how advanced technology can be used. In my opinion, the film's great moral <br /> <br /> I learned in the graduate school that "knowledge power" is good, really not correct! Depending on how knowledge is applied, "possible" strength (... if it is applied.) [You do not know, but you know how to use it!] <br /> <br /> Overall The effects of this movie can be realized after a few days in Mankind's own future. That is not enough knowledge and itself, we must have the knowledge that knowledge can control our own destiny, or we will end up like a crab in the movie - just vicky out. <br /> <br> Those who respond to earlier versions of this article, including comments and corrections, thank them very much, they all appreciate it !! I hope you enjoy this story for the past 40+ years, and I'm also happy. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 10 10 stars
