] Did not see this picture? Did not even hear this picture? It will not surprise me. One of the few truly "independent" films produced in the last ten years, the film did not believe in a studio and it was never taken for great distribution. The independent company Kino Films, BoySman, and Lenya did very little to do without a promotion, and most of the major film critics were also not bothered to review it. I think a movie based on an actor, a set of racism and its influence on two people, today's market did not really have any chance - and it's the loss of the intelligent film lover. <br /> <br /> The ability to get Oscar nomination for both Angela Baset and Danny Glover (as a cinematographer), but the film received little benefit that I can not blame the academy. This is a movie that is challenging, thought-provoking and heartwarming, and it is necessary for the audience to fill it in its own stamps. Considering that it is certainly not a movie for stupid entertainment. Director John Berry does not intend to make Athl Fughard's sportswear dress up wisely. Sure, some of our franchised flashbacks and some exciting visual shots have been given, but Boisman and Lenaar's version of the movie are full story of two people living in inhuman conditions. <br /> <br /> Their basic human rights, Bosman (Glover) and Lena (Baseet) are not left to attack each other. A third character joins them for a short time (Wiley Jonah, surprisingly, in most silent roles), but the focus of the film does not stop them from the title characters and what they have been. Bassett and Glover give the brave performance as broken couples, performance that could only be developed on. Intellectual and mentally strong and ruthlessly provocative, Bosman and Lena Home videos are re-searched for. Hand Down, Film of the Year 2000
