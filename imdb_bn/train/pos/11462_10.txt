Spoiler alert! This movie, Zero Day, gives the inside of two students' lives, underwear and calvinates, who are studying in school and hate and hate in anything. Think of all the leading missions in the "mission" green mission. The content of the Zero Day movie is ultimately not specified until the middle. The viewer is full of its serious and hate, but ultimately it is definitely not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> Now we all know that if the film is based on the Colombian genocide, the end is very clear. And the end is not different from the other movie about this attack, they go and eventually kill many of their students. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies in this attack, and my favorite away through this movie, and the most respected It gives viewers and hates the life of these two children, who hate life, and it really understands the viewer, and is closing on horrible events. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> Well I all knew Twin towers to choose, but I wanted to be different, because of course the Twin Tower was tragic and very defined, but I did not think it was the right choice for me because there really was no way to relate to it, I was only in the third grade and I did not have any idea what it was. But shooting has left and the effect I remember the interview, the sky view of the school, and the hazard and terrorism among thousands of people. <br /> <br /> This movie is a compelling, down to earth, and awesome skills, and I want it reccomened to anyone.
