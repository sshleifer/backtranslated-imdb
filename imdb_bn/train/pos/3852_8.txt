Looking at the day-wired man (sky fourth person) is a little uncomfortable and rather interesting experience. This is a very difficult and intense psychological mystery / thriller from Paul Wehrhoven of the Netherlands. He directed this image before he grew up with his "Hollywood Free Ticket" -Movie Fools + Blood. Many users comment on this site mention I mentioned Alfred Hitchcock. Actually, this film might be HitachiCyan, but I also noticed the touch of the likes of Krinibenberg (The Visal), David Lynch's taste (too much story-added visuals) and even Roman Polanski (plot-set set-up). The strange thing is that when I saw the day-ward values ​​of those directors films, the fourth since 1983 was not until the year of the Liberation War. So take pictures. <br /> <br /> Gerard Rave's original novel story must be given a great deal of credit. Gerard Rev is also the fictional name of the original character (a painful writer, played by Jeren Krebbe, is extremely imbalanced on the dangerous line of serious psychology). Now, someone has stopped and the word "dream" means the word "reeve"? And this movie highlights the many features of a nightmare / night, which you do not always know to make sure that Jared awakens or dreams of yourself. Can it be contradictory? Maybe it's just me, but I do not think so. Renée Soutendijk's leading lady (as a rather demanding role) is amazingly fantastic as well. He sometimes seems to be guilty of extra acting (a delicate way). But this aspect was obviously deliberate to illustrate the character that he plays, since the film is progressing, be sure of what you think about this woman and her motives. She is giving an excellent actress again. I can add that this film has several scenes of full-length male and female nudity, and some explicit sex scenes (and you'll even notice that some scenes and aspects were clearly a bloopprint of squatted scenes for VeroVean.Basic Institute). Another aspect of this film is the symbol and biblical reference / image, which with permission allowed the film to be hated by certain conservative / Catholic movements during the European release. In both ways, it makes a second watchful movie. Now, someone recently told me that he misunderstood a serious misconception about Day-Wyed Man. One of them is of the opinion that the film itself transforms itself into a position where it needs the divine intervention of Virgo Mary to solve it. I have big problems like Catholicism, and sometimes, sometimes portrayed in many movies (so it is not only about horror movies with religious themes). But surprisingly, when the fourth person came, I was not mistaken. Although the Virgin Mary-view of the plot made me skull at one point, I also had fun with it. I think why this word does not bother me 'dual' Because, this movie works in two dimensions. Although 'divine interference' may solve the plot line from the point of view of the satellite ... On the other hand: The film implies that it can all be a mad crazy flamboyant rumbling. And it's fun part: You definitely do not know. And then there is the question: Could it be that Gerard Revees got a distorted view of things that came in any way ... just like the Almighty? At one point in the film, Gerard even tried to fool Christine that he was a traitor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, enjoy a tough European mental horror film). But you will see the original Dutch version (not doubled).
