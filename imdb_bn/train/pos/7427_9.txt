I watched the movie trailer when I was 70 years old when I only saw another 16-year-old film. Oh !!!! How excited me and my best friend We can not wait months or so until it will come. I have seen this movie 17 times in the theater. I love it love love. So perfect for Kris film. He is shy and uncertain with brush and trunky trashy but Babs and so respected for watching it again. When they sing songs in the studio forever and shiver with their radioactive fear, it is very different from the perfect notes from them, but I always thought it was one of the best scenes in the movie. The way he looks at him and he is proud I could see this movie every day. We tried to dress her like this, even then the long sweater and hat that I found were like her. This time came on TV and I got my daughter to see it as a teenager and they liked it. Maybe it is right that I did not understand when I was so extreme at that age. The end is always there in tears today.
