Losing holds something interesting for everyone. You can say a lot about this series, and have been told a lot, so I will not spell it for you again. Just read those people who love it, and you will know why you want to see it. The nice thing about this series is its whole new one. There are not many movies and even fewer series are based only on the theme of the mystery, but proudly the life is lost up to the theme. It's about undefined and if you combine an exotic location, nice plot twists, a nice cast and a good layout (combined with current and past solo episodes), but there will be an episode in which each episode has its own story but a bigger part of it. If you want to get all the insights of characters, you want to see the overall picture and the writer where you want to know is taking you. This is a series that lets you go. In another suspicious note, the series probably went into the second season, probably due to its own success. It is well-known that the Lost was originally written for a season, and when the widespread success was followed, the authors were also very disappointed. In my opinion, they can solve the seasons (or partially at least) solutions, after adding more mystery and making a mistake at higher speeds in the season. At the end of the season you can take a view on the mysteries of Big Blue, plot twists and vague events, but only one audience. The difference between season 2 and 3 was huge though. Season 3 transfers them with partial new questions, inspires a lot of insights. And that's exactly how they will write; If you want to move from one plot to another, the tsunami of terror does not spread over you, and then choose some to interpret the audience. They got 3 in the season and brought a future for a promising series for our season 4. It is good to see that this type of series can be so widely popular in such a different format.
