This is a good movie. Some fun to look at money should be reflected in the super-rate, especially from the children's perspective. Take this for yourself, a little funny movie about a child's dream, and what a kid could do with $ 1 million dollars. Do not like it, do not see it. They make movies for the audience, any person who can not do any good work in their life.
