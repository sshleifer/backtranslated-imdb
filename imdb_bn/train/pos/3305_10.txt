Without question, this movie should be the greatest ........ In the history of the film. I have seen it many times to remember, and this is the first time I see the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her performance makes each movement and nuance, pale in the significance of another Bollywood heroine. His main explanation of the story is that it is not like any scenes on Bollywood screen, with his grace, sad weakness and Urdu poetic essay. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> His knowledge about Naushad's music, his extraordinary, courtesy genre, is incredible, and the way he has described the story with dark atmosphere and with interesting romantic tunes is really amazing. <br /> <br /> My only suggestion is that anyone who takes advantage of the film's view seriously, this epic intervention should see life and art.
