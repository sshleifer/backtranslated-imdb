I am not usually compelled to write a review for a movie, but the only comment for this movie is not so far wrong, so I think to share my viewpoint. <br /> <br /> "Krishna" (or as the title of the theater, I saw it, "Fallen") followed only Latvian Latvian Archaeological Matches, because he tried to find a woman, whom he did not stop jumping from the bridge. , As well as its reason for doing so. This is a brief description, but this picture is not related to someone who represents a person's crime that fails to work. The investigator told him as an intelligence detective, that we would normally die until we would be annoyed with taking care of anonymous face every day. <br /> <br /> Comparisons of Michelgo Antonio and his "blowup" are most probably reviewed by any review of "Krisanna". Antonioi's philosophical and orthodox style and the story of "Blowup" is clear and clearly, in the scene, writer / director Fred Kelman created a clear reference to that movie in which Motis asked the woman who had stopped the bridge, or at least she thought. <br /> <br /> The only person to share his opinion on the film reduces the appearance of the "college film class" and the film's sound. He neglected to consider most of the face of the existential Latvian film budgetary constraints, but the atmospheric black and white paintings and surrounded words succeeded in an artistic level to show the picture of the unity of Motis. The sound of wind and street noise lends an evil owl and reminds a film of Filenina to have the intention of the chlamen. The filmmakers undoubtedly had a little money, but this limitation was used in the film's advantage. <br /> <br /> "Krisanna" has been successful enough to study the character with impressive, so that it may not be too self-serious. It easily fell into a mystery story, but it became an intelligent film about avoiding and loneliness and crime. If you are more concerned with the plot, then this movie and its end may disappoint you. Otherwise, take time to employ it. It's a good price to find out.
