All right, so this could not be the type of movie of the award "film of the year" (I think the bright soundtrack that won some awards), but it is 'The Kid' (Prince / O (take your liking) and events in Minneapolis Playing. The song is pretty fantastic, in my opinion you want to own this soundtrack, it's really a classic and meaning eighty words and it's wonderful to feel Fashion and the movie itself can play a nice plot, it is often worth seeing, obviously if you like Prince / O (which I do).
