"The Stret Story" is a truly beautiful movie about an elderly man named Alvin Strait, who agreed to visit his countryside to visit his unhappy, dead brother throughout the country. But it's just basic synapsis ... this movie is much more than that. Before the death, Richard Fernand's last role was, and it must be remembered for him. He is a shocking old man, and I know that many people are contrary to the opposite. <br /> <br /> "Stret Story" is a movie that everyone will see at least once in their life. It will reach you and touch some of your parts, at least if you have your heart.
