I think it's a nice movie; I think it is a very romanian movie through the scenery and atmoshpere; I think it was not intended to be sensual (sex is a purpose, not a purpose); I think it is very natural; I think it's human; I think it was interesting; I think the actors never thought of me ... they are acting in the LAN (they are Shan Connery and not the CO), the film is not Block Buster, they are like movies ... the normal PPL can work ...; I think the movie reached its intentions; I think it made me feel anything (or feel them again :)); I think I'm not the object; <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it ... which I know.
