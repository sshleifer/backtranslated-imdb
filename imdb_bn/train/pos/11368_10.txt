The "first" serial killer in the USSR is a surprisingly complex and well-researched study. In the days of the pasturov, this firm piece was brought to life with the performance of Stephen Reh and Donald Switterland. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not for the heart's weak, but it makes the content of the subject often annoying, but it is necessary for the original participants to fully develop this real-story story. <br /> <br /> HBO has provided us a fantastic movie. Congratulations to this great piece director and editor. It will see my top 10 list.
