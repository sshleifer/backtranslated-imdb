Road to Perdition, the second action of a film Oscars Sam Mendes (and my best work in my opinion), unwantedly watched in that film, a director who won Oscars three years ago for his extraordinary but controversial American beauty. This is an awesome movie, and simultaneously finally shameless and sad. <br /> <br /> It is a story of a relatively rich and happy family, when out of appearance at the difficult times of sadness, when the father Michael Sullivan Tom Hendes (I'm not his fan, but he should speak) played by Paul Newman, two children Hit Man for the local Mafia boss. His eldest son, 13-year-old son Michael Sullivan Jr., was completely delighted by youngster Tyler Whochlin, who was completely unaware of what his father's job was and his family relied on no money. He wanted to know his curiosity and the truth that he suddenly became a witness of murder, which was committed by his son, the son of his son John Rooney. This discovery hit a innocent soul and resulted in numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of time, all the backgrounds and decorations has been created perfectly, if the story is written well then editing and cinematography is almost flawless. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments in the film and the point and the success of the movie, the main character of success is difficult to father-son relationship. They are shown so deep, strong and trustworthy. Tom Hanks works excellent and has a tremendous role for him in his career's best performance and all the performances across the board are fantastic Finally Paul points out a very nice score of Newman and as a result, we can get the outstanding work of all the people involved in this beautiful (but once more sad) beautiful composition. I believe Road to Perdition is one of the greatest achievements of making this decade film and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year. <br /> <br /> I have 10 grades of 10 numbers
