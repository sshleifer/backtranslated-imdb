Gentlely, the soft-spoken play from Steven Spielberg was his first real venture in this genre. An exit from his usual adventure / fantasy rental, it tied his way to 1993's success, "Schindler's List". <br /> <br /> Based on the novel Winner of the Pulitzer Prize of Alice Walder, the story is a barbarian of a young girl's descending marriage anxiety, angry peasant trouble and her painful separation of her favorite sister Nettie. Although the plot - abuse and love power - all wounds to healing - often strong and moving, it loses its way through consistency and the scraping scrapspace of Meno Meges. "Purple of color" is sometimes difficult to follow and one or more events have become a little uncertain about the time frame. This separation of scripting has a deeper and detailed view of the audience in Miss Wakar's novel. A real shame that Spibberg has not been able to select and correct these problems in brain, because most of his programs are an excellent example of his skill as a director. <br /> <br /> Hoopie Goldberg is a salute - he never meets with the achievement - Heart breaks only Selly wants to choose just like that. Danny Glover provided strong support, though his "Moses" had a higher turn for "heart space" for him. Stough Out is showing Miss Sofia, a single psychoanalytic, overwhelming Oprah Winfrey, who is a black soul, whose soul is a supporter, crushed by a horrific event involving a high-class white woman. Good support from Margaret Everi, Adolf Caesar and Rai Don Chong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As always sounding from Michael Kane, director of photography Alan Daviau shows consummate skills in capturing some glorious southern scenery. <br /> <br /> The real thing in the heart is that you must bring a tear to your eyes, that's just unfortunately we have left many unanswered questions. <br /> <br /> Wednesday, January 15, 1997 - Video
