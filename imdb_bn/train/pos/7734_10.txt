I saw this picture a few years ago and I could say that I really like it. Jason Patrick was perfect for this weird role. Director? I do not do much about her ... and I'm taking care of it. Screenplay is good, it's sure. Within a few words, I would say this movie is weird, weird, even dark, but it is a good one. Since I saw it a few years ago and did not see it since. I want to see it again. I know I will not be sick to see it. Scenes, atmosphere, actors, stories ... everything is good. The film could have been long lasting, I thought it was 120 minutes to be perfect. I'm hoping part 2 for this movie. It was not bad. Jason Patrick: You guys! Very good movie The end :-)
