This is the longest time I've seen the most fun movie. Bad acting, bad scripts, bad scenery, bad dress, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you surround yourself with laughter. <br /> <br /> So it does not win the Oscars, but if you've got round beer and friends then you can not go wrong.
