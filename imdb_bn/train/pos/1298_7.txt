A real contradiction in French movies, this frustrating work is not equivalent to contemporary generations. In addition to Louis Garrell's "Le Few Fault" (1963) (the fire between it), along with Herl's efforts it is necessary to find something completely unlike. The gentle and the miraculous, lost all his illusions, the hero, the computer scientist, there is no other reason for his life. There is absolutely no one. Released from the human race, he feels his life alive as a little astronomer. His colleagues One of them drew his attention: Tiserand-Jose Garcia played the most abusive part of the decade. Then Tisnerand will be a bit scared: all his frustrations will spread to these poor people. The club revolves around the strange relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will always be incomplete until he ... ... now the film takes a more common form (Cholera's wrong idea) but for a while. <br /> <br /> The form is out of the strange comment OneOne-Over, for a narrator who has always referred to the main character as "our hero", for the next hero. The story, now in Paris, is now in the city of Rouen, Guy de Maapasant.

For very short sections of X-rated movies, but after watching it, you feel at dumps.
