I was not sure when I heard about this coming. I was thinking how stupid it was getting Disney. I was roasted. I found it very well. I mean it's not the lion king but calm to look at the other side from a certain point. It was so ridiculous. It also sucks the animation that was not one of the odd Disney sequences, it was like the Lion King animation. The movie theater of the movie theater was excluded from me. Do not give any way but you know what you're talking about. I was fun to come back from the original that was mostly custom. It was a very good movie all over.
