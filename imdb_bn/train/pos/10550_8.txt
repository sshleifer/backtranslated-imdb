I saw it as part of my course at the University of Etherstein and it disturbs me that there is no distributor in this type of UK. Actually, this is not because Hollywood is not a movie - real, creative, playful and funny. It seems like someone does not want to see such a movie today, on simple terms, it is not compatible with generic conventions that most young people are looking for in a movie. <br /> <br /> I am not writing a review for the age of IMDb but this movie was felt to give special mention, even if at the 30 minute break of my class! Essentially, nothing about it, because the two main characters are submerged in their own world through the world's hatred. Here the director is the director, how many runs time maintains interest with only two letters, and when only the Maine-N-view has half the house and a huge white, empty space. Because of the large stars, due to the star performances of both actors, both give a great smile and simultaneously add significant emotional depth to their roles. <br /> <br /> I want to write something more but limited to some time. But I encourage anyone and everyone to try this picture. A very unique concept is brought to a coherent and well-established fashion screen, good performance, a strong script, excellent sound design and (fairly) attractive videos make very entertaining movies. <br /> <br /> This is just a shame so few people know about nothing ....
