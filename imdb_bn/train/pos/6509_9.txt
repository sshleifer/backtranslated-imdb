I just can not believe some comments on this event! The show is just talent! It does not make sure and follow the truth, but consumers do not always do the same thing as we want to be pressed repeatedly over us. Do we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new in a while? Style as the previous "Scooby Doo" show is not realistic, but it is not supposed to be. The headline title is titled "What Does a Shaggy and Scouts Get a Couple" titled that the entire favorite cast of other presentations will join with continuous action. And they do not say that they will solve the mystery, and even if they can not stand still, why are they? I'm really glad they put some lasting plot points that work on a skuboo-doe show. They are still running jokes, weird hi-jeans, fast changing decorations in Chase scenes, standard hallway gogues and even skubo meals. Actually I'm happy that this show is there, because I love it. I am very glad that he was released from the rest of the team for a while and concentrated only on two main characters and a villain. <br /> <br /> It seems ridiculous, of course! Sure it is different, it is supposed to be It's a pleasure to laugh at you with villains and to get all the intrusive wins for the unconscious Robotics Butler, no matter what size. You are supposed to get the fun "Roobi-Roo" running. The whole thing is fixed together, the only thing I can remember is that it is wrong with Writing, acting, animation, all the top notch. Title music is great ("Boot!" To boot my computer!) "Play!" And the background music is just trembling.
