This is a really interesting movie. This is an action movie. Comedy mix in it. In this film, the comedian episode of the Fox Team, give it a comedic spin. It will keep you wondering what is going to happen next to Foxx. It was a good shot film, the director used the right color in the film (dark blue color) to give it a true feel. Kimberly Elise also played this movie and it is always a pleasure to see him on the big screen. She plays well in her role. There is also Jamie Kennedy in this movie. It's not good to see you. It is of course valuable if you are a Jamie Fox fan. It deserves more credits than it is actually given.
