They were surprised by what the viewers watched in 1936: a full, beautiful full-length technicolar film. I'm not sure, but it could be the first (3-strip). At any rate, it's still looking good in DVDs after more than 70 years. In fact, it looks amazing how amazing it is. <br /> <br /> For Kudos director Richard Boleslowski, Director of Photography Virgil Miller, International Photo and Selznick, for DVD - MGM Home Entertainment. Combine them all to showcase classic-age-old films. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was so: nice in the first half, stagnant in the second. It finally gave a nice message, though many people were not happy with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Heart-throob Charles Boyer was a male star and Dominica's fondness, but some small letters were most attractive to me. People like Joseph Shilkarakut "Bath ouch"; John Carabin as "The Bali Diviner"; My most memorable, at least, the dancer "Irina", starring Tilly Lashch. Wow, have a face and a dance you never forget! I have not seen anything like this in thousands of movies. Just watch her thing was worth the DVD price. Looking at his IMDB revival, he was only in four movies, but he was all well-known movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Aber Smith, one of the most famous British actors. Shieldcrat will be recognized by the classic film buff, the person who played the violent sales clerk with "Stella" and Margaret Sullivan "The Shop of the Corner" with Hitler. <br /> <br /> Beautiful aspects, photography and color, and Tilly's dance, what I remember about this movie is the best and the extraordinary thing that is rolling in one. If it's good for the last half hour, I end up praising - I could have given it more ratings. It's definitely a movie collector want to add to their collection.
