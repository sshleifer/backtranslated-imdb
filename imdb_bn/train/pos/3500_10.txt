This movie works because it is so real. The story is simple and realistic, full of anxiety and fantasy about adolescent love and sex that most of us / young people experience in our experience. <br /> <br /> Actors are as natural but convincing as a documentary size and as charismatic as performers. The dialogue is fresh and honest ... and thankfully cutesy pop culture is not filled with snow with references. In addition, cinematography is a genuinely beautiful and beautiful, Lower East Side with a very real life. At an artistic level, I love this movie because it reminds me of the great Italian Neo spirituality movie like Bicycle Thief and La Strad. Movies rarely think of "real" ... or as a bike thief. And the only other movie I have seen that during the pregnancy, Eliaz Czan's splendor treats teen sex with similar importance. Writer / director Peter Sollett is very extravagant. This film is quite a success. <br /> <br /> At a personal level, I'm always happy to see a movie that deals with love and respect for ethnic American members. As an Italian-American, I hate my own people from the way in movies (such as racist, feminist, criminal genocide in criminal epic episodes), and my anger towards this calculation makes me sensitively sensitive to other groups and their horror silver screen. Presentation. Especially in Hispanic and Asian countries curse villains in western and action movies. (Good thing Gong Lee did not try to become famous in America!) <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks to the rise of Indie photo and the effect of Miramax, we are seeing more pictures here and there ethnic characters ... but Viktor Vargas easily raises The best one. Although I really like my Big Fat Greek wading, it's a fresh change that is played directly to Victor Vargas (with less hugely and wide-ranging characters), though it's still very interesting to own. Finally! Note eligible Latin characters. I think this is a movie which will be remembered. <br /> <br /> Of course, he made this nice picture about a family from Dominican Republic, I hope Peter Sollet is about an Italian film soon! :) - Mark Dipola
