I really like this version of Emma good Kate Beckinsale was as impressive as Emma and was as strong as knightly strong. The only complaint I had in Mr. Loudhaus, I can not believe that a man can be so selfish or very selfish about the life of his daughter. Although she was finally a smart girl. As always, I love the place where this Zen Austin movie is shot. The settings are so spectacular. It made me look like 9.6 in Ireland and Ireland and Scotland) I think the selected actor was also a good choice for the movie and all the other story lines Emma interviewed the best! I'm glad I got to see this one.
