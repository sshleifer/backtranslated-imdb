There was some hesitation in my part about what this movie offered. To get started, the welding does not seem right. Kiefer Sutherland has already done very well in "24" and does not seem to offer him some challenge to the preview or the audience. Eva Langriya came out of the place, the rest did not feel very funny. <br /> <br /> When I finally finished the film, I was not completely dissatisfied because I saw a great thrill that could have been very good, the responsible parties took responsibility for the description of the office and took a little more care for character development. Gives. We've seen such threats before, and the main conflict writers have made many more challenging. As the audience, we do not want to sit through the same old story again. We want to see something different, exciting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> There is nothing wrong with Casting. From the tasty first lady of Kim Basing. She carries herself with enough grace and sexual appeal to make part memorable. Michael Douglas has done and worked that before. Unfortunately, the President even cared about his fate too much of a non-entity. Like New York, EVA reinforces her "24" tough person's view with enough energy to make it big enough on a big screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the established classics ("north-west" and "the fagitable" comes to mind). Leave your expectations outside and enjoy the ride for whatever it is. OK.
