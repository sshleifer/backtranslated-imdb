I do not know at all to explain the "dark room" because in a nutshell it will not really be judged. This is a strange, mysterious situation, in which a luncheon short film with two beautiful girls. I would say this in the opposition of "The Elephant Man" or "The Strait Story", at the edge of the "Mulholland Drive" of this linkinic spectrum, is certainly more. It's hidden on Lynch's website, and the search price is good.
