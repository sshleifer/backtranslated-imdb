I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman. 'Shawshank Redemption' is at the top of my all time favorite movie. But I must admit that I often amazed her choice of role. There was so much big budget clich√©s with no heart in his title. For me, the role of '10 items or less' Freeman identifies the true performance of the true performance. <br /> <br /> Freeman is an anonymous, former big time Hollywood actor who has not worked for many years. . She is taking part in an indefinite Indie film for which she is doing some research on a poor neighborhood grocery store in LA. After being stuck there by his flash driver, Freeman was allowed to roam home with the checkout girl Scarlet (Paz Wag), who made him half-girlfriend. Before taking him to his house, Scholar has a large job interview that he will get, and Freeman agrees to tag it with the exchange. <br /> <br /> This film follows Scarlett and Freeman in various places. , But the film is really part of a character about interaction between the two. Freeman is a diversified disconnected Hollywood, who has not heard of the target and does not know his own telephone number or any day of the week. By acquiring knowledge from the Dalai Lama, he has filtered the whole world through a brain and repeatedly called Scholar's job interview 'audition'. And yet he has a way with people, extend their reputation beyond a way to influence them. He is a fan of humanity. He studies them, asks uninterrupted questions about them and revels in their curiosity where others will easily get annoyed. At Scarlett, he suddenly saw the proud man that he was; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Vegga plays a relationship with Freeman who sketches the line between meritorious love and physical attraction, although she can play nicely and it is not weird to hear it. But while remembering his relationship with Freeman, Scarlett keeps a close watch on the reality of their world, and hits Freeman's Baul * with severe reactions that refuse to accept anything other than the truth. <br /> <br /> The movie is smart, funny and well written, with simple but effective dialogue. I read an IMDb review that said the lines were 'stilted', which I think is a misinterpretation of the real-life statement. There are no big soliloquies here, no deep soul moment explores And so, this technique, I think, can show how everyday life of ordinary people can connect with each other. And I think Freeman and Vega are nicely closed, shining a picture of a bond between two people, like the sun shining on the ocean, the miracles and fools After it has gone, it can live in your memories, which may tantalizing you about it All right, it was a bit lighter, but I really like performance and movies. I would definitely recommend it.
