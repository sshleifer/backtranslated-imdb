The first film ever made. Some streaming from a factory, some cycling, maximum walking, right or left movements. Along with Melies, Lummieres is the starting point and departure point for both movies - Melies narrative fiction, movie, fantasy, artifice, starts spectacular; Pure, unadorned, observational with lumieres. The truth. Many intellectuals who later apologize for the exhausting sources of tired movies. <br /> <br /> But consider this brief again. There is nothing 'objective' about it. The film is completely full - a static, inhuman scene breaks down the peace of life, activity and the gap, from left to right or left from behind (but, of course, not front, where there are cameras) from the retreat. And still the camera stock still stands, the strength, the potential distortion, the subordinates of his will. Cinematography can be a revolutionary discovery, but it will be used for conservative purposes - it is limited to editing, editing, restricting the world map. <br /> <br /> The film's historical reality is bad. The workers of the factory workers are Lumia The boss is keeping an eye on their staff, the invisible eyes about his obscure minions. This picture describes two types of imprisonment. Back behind the door, the workers are restricted to their workplace. The opening of the gate is an image of freedom, but they face another wall, the fourth wall, they seem more limited. The first image is the first example of CCTV surveillance, an invisible figure, all observer authorities to enter its servants. A horrible, all very prophetic movie.
