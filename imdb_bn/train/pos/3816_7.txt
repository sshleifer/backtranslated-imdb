"Secret Sunshine" reminds me of "The Rapture" (1991), with Mimi Rogers and David Dvojev, but this Korean production is a good film. It portrays super-religious Korean Christians in a provincial Korean city and after having a terrible personal tragedy, the main character experiences contact them. A widow single mother in Shin, who moved her younger son from Seoul to Mileong (Chinese 'Secret Sunshine') town. He chose Milanang because he was born at his late husband (himself killed in the accident), and he thinks he wants to start a new life in the new place. He does not respond well to local Christian initiatives, whose members try to convince him to come to church and prayer meetings. Shin-Ae is basically unreasonable and he brushes off politely as soon as these people. In fact, he pushed only with everyone at the start of Milan, but some of them are trying to attack his world and its results are often laughable. Not to say, the film must be farther away, but it should be noted that the female's performance in the main role (Zone Do-Yen) is remarkable. After winning the Best Actress Award in 2007, I hope she gives her a good job opportunity. But Mr. Joyan is impressive and it is impossible to close his eyes on the screen. The film is a kind of annoying act of Evelyn Wah-Esquiera, which shows that fate may seem insane as weirdly inevitable.
