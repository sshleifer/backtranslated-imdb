This last seen as a late TV movie last night by chance. The clasp for the movie says something about the effect of the soil, accompany the girl and goes on a romantic journey, as I see there that the work is hard work in a new maintenance - Daniel Craig has played less - so the plot was immediately apparent. <br /> <br /> It means that the love of the unnamed clay caring girl is also her lover, so problems arise and are not very surprising. But I was caught by Anne Reid's extraordinary performance and I was scared. The direction gives the space to rotate in its mirrors and adjust the scars, when it increases the depression. <br /> <br /> Sex scenes were interesting and forbidden. Should the body of older women not be covered? Not here and we are treating a delicious reawakening in mom's sexuality. Even the most amazing picture that she had created (Spoiler!) Once discovered that her daughter suspects something is happening here. <br /> <br /> Castin does not satisfy this girl as much as me, but that may be me. The pre-Rafa people were expected to see Julia Sohahla with its waves, the more intense face I could make my mind better. Bradshaw is a happy face of the round that does not bear the anger of film progress. <br /> <br /> End of the weak. If she gets disrespect for the mother, she is so indifferent, perhaps we could see some mortgages while going out and see their personal reasons. Whatever she has done, she has recently gone to mourn the widowed widow for 30 years with her husband, and I saw a lack of sympathy. For a movie that is full of emotions (and it can be warned as the opening of the Chevgen, you will never get lid) the last one is a cold conflict.
