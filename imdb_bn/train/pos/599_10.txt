Enjoy this movie thoroughly because I had a genuine sincerity in acting. The text was top notch. James Arness is a great actor and he showed up here. Brian Keith was very old to debate with Davey Crockett and could anyone really play Davy but Face Parker? <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the best actors of this move was Ra√∫l Julia, who gave Santa Ana depth, <br /> Someone may think that the film gradually slowly After a series of terrible terrorism, many tidymas were gradually carried out gradually. <br /> I have had the biggest impact on this film that it is willing to kill some people for a reason about it and how they believe it. In this day and age, when someone stands to do something, I could refresh it, it seems that people had died for independence, how can you feel about the politics of that time.
