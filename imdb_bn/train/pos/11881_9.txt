Every great gangster movie has a stream under the drama of the people. Do not expect a mental story of crime, revenge and frustration from "Scarface". This is a story of violent greed, corruption, and power. The dark side of "American Dream" <br /> <br /> Anyone complaining about the "glasses" of this movie is missing. Sponsor Characters, Chess Music, and Dates Fashions burn this criticism of a more live life. There is nothing in the life of this character, not at least on any human level. Indeed, this film actually marks the boundary of ridicule, considering all gangsta ropes that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. <br /> <br /> This is not Brian DePalam's strongest instructional effort, it is sometimes nice and well-managed (especially memorable ending), but often rotten and confused. Thankfully, this is supported by a very powerful script by Oliver Stone (perhaps better therapy for that, when considering the coke practice while dealing with them). Tony Montana is basically focused on the focus of life and the evolution of his character, because he is consumed by greed and power. Dialogue is also excellent, comfortable in comedies and drama- sawing. There are many stand-out lines, because they are popularly moving towards one form or another culture. <br /> <br /> How Cast Assistance helps to create this, but it really is the passinos film One of the few minor earlier performances (something far more common nowadays), it is completely different from Michael Corleone and Frank Sercico. Yet, as far as the observable, very entertaining (and deliberately top-top) forms here. Perhaps it is difficult to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, perhaps one of the most unexpected performances. Pfeiffer stood out as first sight dust and uncomfortable, but I realized how little part of the little wife lacked. Not an exceptional effort, but wrong misjudged. Supporters are also very good, especially as Paul Schneider's rich Alejandro Sosa. <br /> <br /> Strong, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes frustrating, and constantly controversial. One of the eight "scarf" movies (which you can have) is one of them. An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop culture landmark. 9/10
