This saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released. I left the theater just like a baby like a snifflin, and no one could see it. So, when I again saw '07, I knew what I could expect and were always ready and they were moving towards the required moments. At this time I was at home <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not remember my youth philosophy - or perhaps it did not notice because of it The film had technical glow. Use Flashbacks which tell stories so much without resorting to conversation. Camera work shown to the viewer together with the characters of the scene. Joe, while going to the street on the road side, is going to the opening of the road, the camera pants behind the women and the children sitting on a bench on the back, creating a street view. <br /> <br /> The story, and the characters - are sad, sad and cruel. People's views are so touching so closely that they can easily travel with most of us. Then again, Joe and Ratso could be any of us. I saw 70 'must be done. I think after leaving the theater I was inspired to find friends' friends. After all these years, I'm glad I'm not alone tonight. This is a great movie one hell.
