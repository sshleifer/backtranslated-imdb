This is what French and Belgianans do well. It's quirky, visually inventive, exhilarating and mentally challenging storytelling. Director Jacko van Doromal takes us into a world of Georges, who is looking for a patient in Downend Syndrome and looking for a meaningful relationship with someone. It is not done in a patronizing way but with a great feeling and honesty. Georges's interiors with corporate gurus, Harry is impressively guided - from comedy to tragedy again, with wonderful ease and then transferred to the comedy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Zemeckis's Forrest Gump is good and really shades. Occasionally, Miss Flores over the Kaku Nest throws the humor of Dinos Potter with a shadow for better measurements. <br /> <br /> As mentally suffering and lonely loneliness, Harry has turned into Daniel O'Toole yet another great performance. But it matched by the bright Pascal Duquenne as George. It's consistently strong performance and many memorable pieces of footwear - a shoe shop scene, car showroom scene, 'Jesus He Knows Me' of George's Genes, a conference scene, a film with fireworks scenes. If you have not seen it, there is only one thing. Just rent it or join a screening in a retro movie near you and see what you were missing. Well still, buy this movie. Shear genius .....
