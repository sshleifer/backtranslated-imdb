It can be great to call Guys and dolls Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando have received (and, against the original greetings, the casting works of Sinatra), in the 1950s it has really been quiet, even if it is mainly transferred from stage to screen only a little bit. And most of the songs are often much fun, and compelling, and that takes place with the wonder and in the form itself belongs to the wonderful escapism. If it is not something bigger than something else, then there should be no blame on the filmmaker Joseph El Manquiezz. Not all songs are completely clicked and some conversations seem to be taking place in the film's opposition stage (it is never difficult to say - Brando and Sinatra often drag the line so that it is said that they should be carefully cautious for a camera or "stage" , While Adele's acting actress is better for the stage than the screen) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not easy to gain seksa 1999 ayalata child (well, not quite, but close).

This is for the expected twists of the story, about the characters' character of the character of the road, the stupid people of the street people (gangster and dancer and "cytone" for the "Sheet" brando played by Gene Simmons). This, according to its fundamental idea, about the whole world of boys and dolls, and how to adjust one or the other - without compromising, without compromising too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever the camera can hold on to the subject, its stars are released properly. Hell, even the brand works nicely for musical instruments, because he only shows his chops for the method actor and the singer and the stars. The story and the characters will finally have to expect you to wind down, and that's fine. What we want - and what we've got - is wonderful, it is related to wit, dialogue and some songs and dance that bring down the house entertainment (my choices were the number of women in the club, Lucky Lady, and Havana, Cuba number two Down).
