This Bugs Life is a great movie that is not only for kids but also for adults. The story comes around the colonies of the ants and their struggles against the evil grasshoppers every year and their food is set around stolen (a mirror in Magnifiscent seven). There are some wonderful computer animations and voices are very great. You love it !! 10 out 8
