I've enjoyed this picture. But I was surprised to see people mentioning it as a joke. It was fun at the time, but really, it was not very fun. If I'm hoping it to be a comedy, I might have been frustrated with this movie, but, without any expectation, I think it's enjoyable and compelling. Perhaps it was because, as an engineer, I marked with the drama. I was more concerned about the fundamental story of a man in the capital or the war, and the basic story of a man fighting for his discovery. A man who is less interested in financial gain than his innovation can be seen and produced. He refused to accept big money and hot woman for suppressing her appearance when she is perfectly heroic. So I find it interesting that people here have compared the Jurassic Park; I think I compare it to Fountainhead.
