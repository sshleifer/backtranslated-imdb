Monarch Cove was one of the best plays in the late Friday night. I ask the author to write a long series and write it in the air in the Lifetime. Each person was very funny and did a great job with their lines. The plot comes true. However, the movie needs to be continued for a long time. I want to see Bianca and Jake's children grow up and play a big role in the film as well as the new grandparents designed for his educational future. Also, helping some daughters see their nephew and foster her life. Grandparents are very happy to solve their problems, but family business activities need to be restored and let us see how Jack and Bianca survive through marriage. Year
