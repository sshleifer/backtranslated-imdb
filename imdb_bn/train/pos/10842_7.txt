So I rented "Crazy still". When the logo of the video was described to the person in the shop, he said, still like crazy So I rent it. I was frustrated Well, yes, crazy still focuses on a classic rock band instead of a punk band, but it's OK. Crazy still is the story of the wonderful fruit, a rock band that breaks its popularity at the top of a big rock festival in the 70's. Twenty years later, all struggles were made to make the band members alive, and a concert opportunity was given to celebrate twenty years of this festival. They accepted this proposal and decided to reform on a permanent basis, traveled to Europe in this process. Some pretty hyphens ensue, and all the characters go through fine changes. Seeing this movie, you feel more as a visitor's documentary than a participant. And that's not bad at all.
