I want to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy I have ever seen. Although it was in depth and you were going to end up with those who knew from the beginning were still lasting and prospect. Perhaps they thought that they would not be together ... it's an indoor film after all. This movie is well written, guided and played. The street view next to the dance was fantastic.
