The poor Basil Rothbone, an uncontrollable musician, who has become upset. He is fixing it for some time, buying his songs and songs from different songs. The problem is that the two sources (Bing Crosby Music) and (Meri Martin's words) are seen and fell in love. And then they discover what they're doing. The complications have happened, but at the end all is well. <br /> <br /> Crossbie and Martin are singing horribly. Mary Crawberry's Craft Music has signed twice as a Paramount contract on the radio show. Because I do not understand, the filmmakers did not bring her, so she returned to Broadway and in 1944 did a touch of Venus and lived there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is very good at playing comedy. His ego is constantly being isolated by the surrounding Oscar Levant and again I am surprised that they do not have more movies together. <br /> <br /> Most of the cars in Crosby do not have large production numbers, but I agree with previous critic about the title tone of an incomplete jam session in the pony store. Good job to everyone. <br /> <br /> is a wonderful original plot and great entertainment.
