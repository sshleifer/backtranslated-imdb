This is a movie which I go and see because I am a huge fan of adult animation. I often find that when a film is not a story or a genre rather than a famous actor or actress, it allows art to be visible as a part of the industry rather than displaying its ability to separate the style. <br /> <br /> This picture is more about style than the story. Although I found the story interesting (a thriller that hated story and atmosphere from movies like Blade Runner and many anime movies), it was somewhat difficult to follow at the time and it did not seem that it could have been together together. It was definitely a mixed feeling mixed with French animations and Japanese anime. That's not the good thing or the audience. Apparently this picture is a treatment for the eyes, and in that sense, a work of art. <br /> <br /> If you like adult animation, or at the moment you want to see a movie different from most of the movies. I would recommend it. What I can say is that I have enjoyed the filming experience but it was a little disappointing because it could be better
