This movie is incredibly realistic and I think there is great justice for the crime that does not understand much due to the lack of experience. Many people who think that what they get through the heart of the victim is arrogant. As a victim, I think Dawson has done a fantastic job in his role of Maya. I agree that one is incredibly brave film. Unlike any movie I've seen in this regard, it's more realistic to view rapes. The last one began to stretch for a long time, but I know that many victims imagine this kind of trial, because about 1% of the chances of an attacker being sent to jail for their attack. It is good to see a film that is closer to reality than being the most brave.
