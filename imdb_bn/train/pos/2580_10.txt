I say the Domino policy is an exaggerated movie. Who took the time to investigate the contemporary history of our imagination; JFK, RFK, MLL, G. Wallace and actually many can conclude that the author of Damino's theory really knew what he was talking about. Roy could be a tucker or harp or sherhan or an Arthur bremer, maybe even John Hinckley or Timothy McKay. Some can be mentioned. Spying, big business, and political killings are not really a fiction, but an unexpected part of our narrow existential history.god helps us, but the principle of domino is more true than fantasy. If this could be the reason for slight sleep loss, probably do not accept my word for it. Investigate for yourself.
