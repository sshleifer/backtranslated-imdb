I saw this movie about a week ago and still kept thinking about it. I was very moved by this movie. I like letters very credible and almost like a fault. Even though people sometimes feel frustrated in real life, even in Leo, although I love her character, I would not be too frustrated if she was fully aware of her HIV status despite my willingness to achieve unsafe sex. I was disappointed with Leo to refuse the medicine he received, and gave Marcel a very dangerous way when he decided to return him to the train home. I think this movie is very practical because of why it's coming in among the young gay men of the HIV population. It's no way to sneak Ges (I'm homosexual) in any way, and the film can be made about a very good person, who likes bad and seems to be unaware of himself and others. The only part of the film I could not understand why (gay friendly) family allowed Marcell to go to the funeral in Leo's illness but it did not include it. <br /> <br /> I think the biggest message in this movie is not gay or straightforward SEX!
