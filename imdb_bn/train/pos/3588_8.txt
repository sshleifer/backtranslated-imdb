When I saw this movie, I was surprised that it was just a TV movie. I think this movie has to be in the theater. I have seen many movies about rape, but this one stands. This movie is a reality that is rarely available in today's movies, just leave TV movies. It tells a story that I am sure today that the small town is very realistic to the victims of small rape, and I think it is very believable (which is hard to find in other raped central film). I thought that Tiffany Thesan and Brian Austin were great in those parts where Green star played. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies, they have a tough reality. I enjoyed it very much.
