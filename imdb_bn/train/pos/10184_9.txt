The only problem with the Ismail durbar music, which failed to rise above the script. The only transformed compassion is the sexy item called Ishak Kamena, which is an anu Malik's composition. Another pat for the director comes because he has played some fantastic performances from his cast. Karishma Kapoor gave the film's life as a life and helpless mother. She is sure to win the awards for this hot photo. The second is the actor, who is junking with the photo, who returned to the film. His unrecognized methods blamed him and he again showed his diversity on this role. Sanjay Kapoor's unpredictable packet of film and heartfelt and effective painter who has stood against other actors. President Nawal is also the top and his pre-climax listening model is commendable. Shahrukh's camera lighter provided moments and of course it was dragged to get the desired star price. Although his role was not really needed, he did it well. Overall, strengths are far more slow than these days, and far-off films and pre-release hips make sure it's a good opening. Power critics and listeners are sure to get thumps up. To improve the effect, the film needs to be trimmed strictly by at least 2 reels. Energy still has the ability to go without a groin!
