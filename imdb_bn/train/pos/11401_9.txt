An American in Paris, the ultimate mix of many ways, art and Hollywood musicals. This movie, created at the height of MGM's power as a musical powerhouse, shows the characteristic of Garc Vivian's memorable music, who correctly described the 20th century as the equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart. <br /> <br /> Jean Kelly was at the height of her power in this film, although it can be reasonably well that this film had a warmth for her best work in Singen in the Rain (1952). . Two pictures are actually linked closely. Along with Arthur Fried Connection, the Broadway Melody segment in "Rain" is based on the incredible American in the Paris Ballet sequence. This movie can be the only dance number mentioned specifically in the opening credits. And it deserves to be, because it shows the skills of Gene Kelly as its final degree as a dinner and a Korean grapher. <br /> <br /> The film's throwing is absolutely nice. Leslie Caron shows a maturity in making her film debut well, which makes you think she's been making films for years. Her early dancing sequence, and later her work in the ballet, only works for Ms.G.M. musicals in Seid Cherry and Ryan in the band wagon, and some amazing moments by singing her work. Sunny Leopard Kelly's Stoke Palle, who received two of the best moments of the film: The last party sequence (which I did not see in the film, I will not give up for anyone), and one of the most memorable music numbers in the movie that couples are incredibly incredible Piano skill is achieved. <br /> <br /> George Getty, as a romantic rival of Kelly, is less memorable, though she gets several musical highlights and Leslie because Neena Folk as romantic rival. The relationship between Kelly's character and Nine, the May-December relationship reminds me of a similar "defenseless man" relationship, which falls in love with George Pepered and Patricia Neill in love with Tiffany. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is less satisfying for me than the lion in the rain. Ballet, though polite and well-produced, is not really fit with the rest of the movie. Without the plot, the ballet happens only with no real rhythm or reason. And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence, it does not really have anything to do with the plot - and among the best musical instruments, there are always pairs of songs. Although it should not be a surprise (it's an MGM musical, after all), I'm hoping a little bit more ... the movie ends on the ballet. Is over. The director Vincenty Minnie thinks he can not follow the ballot with anything else. The film has literally left me. <br /> <br /> The negative aspect, an American in Paris, is well-suited to Hollywood's best music. It does not reach the height of the singles in the rain, but it is close and it is considered as the greatest dancer of all time with the skills of Gene Kelly.
