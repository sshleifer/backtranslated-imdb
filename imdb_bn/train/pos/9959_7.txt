Well, if you're open enough to like the shop, you would love this Canadian movie. <br /> <br /> If your mind is closed as a Fort Knox, then you have the current score: 2.5. <br /> <br /> This is a film for them who are ready to watch movies from outside on their own ethnic basis. This is interesting, it's true for life, you lose the connection between scenes in two or three cases, but many times, especially at the end, you've got tears in your eyes or two and this is just because of the mirror that life can be. <br /> <br /> I like it and suggest that anyone outside the traditional American film is openly open.
