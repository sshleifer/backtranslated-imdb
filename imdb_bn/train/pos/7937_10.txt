I thought the movie "I Do It Do not" was fantastic. In the past, I saw "suddenly Susan" and "Melrose Place" and Jos√© Bisset "Robb Estes" in "Melrose Place" and like to see them together again in "I do not do it". They have a great chemistry together (I think marriage is in real life!) - They are both widowed with children and careers in this movie and they fall in love and try to mix their busy unwanted families together without the ball. Of course, they stumble, but they put it together, which makes a job and increases the family. So many people talking about this movie - all good! - And the rest of us want more of the movie. This will be a great series - appeals to many ages! - Seeing real life, under the earth, listening to the family will be so beautiful that today we portray the reality of many lives - instead of the so-called "reality TV" all the stations have forced us to leave. Someone will say to ABC family that they have started a new series here!
