I heard this movie is not as bad. It was enjoyable, fun and I love to travel around that holiday season. It has completely the mood of my Christmas shop and listen to the music of the holiday. When this movie comes out of the DVD it will take place in Christmas collection in my collection. After Thanksgiving, it will be a movie to get me the mood for the best time of year. I heard that Ben's character was a bit crazy but I think it only adds to the film and why it is so much time so serious. Do it, take it for a Christmas comedy with a love twist. I enjoyed it. No, it's not a titan, and it does not compare your heart with predictions but it will bring a smile or both. So smile and have a good time :)
