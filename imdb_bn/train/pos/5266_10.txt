Well, some people will say that this special movie stumbles ... but hey! OK, okay, not quite right ... The film has no special effect and may not even be the best actor (besides the brutality of brutal bros). Despite this small incident, I can honestly say that this is the most fun movie I've ever seen, and I have seen M.A.!
