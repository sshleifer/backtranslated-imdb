I'm going to give it 8, but since you got 6.5 out of a lot of good votes, so I had to contribute. The Styx River was a pure genius. Sure, Woody had his element forever, but at least his role was appropriate. The first half hour was really delightful, and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch. The dialog was quite clever, and along with the above crust response, Woody Card's tricks were fun in the parties. It seemed to be much better than the critics of the newspaper. And a plus, the novice of the little Sorcerer go along with it. And of course, have you noticed that Johansen got a little crack? Charles Dons was always as entertaining, Hugh Jackman.
