First off, I'm 80s movie, and Jennifer Conelly as well as a huge fan. So yesterday, I wandered into a local used book / movie store and found a VHS copy. I read it back and it sounded good and sounded for $ 3.99, it was a good deal. So I went to take it home and popped it into VCR. What a sweet movie My age is now, I'm more related to movies like Last Night or St. Elmo Fire, but still remember that it can be 15/16 and in love with the old people, etc. We are small And if it does not work, we are frustrated and we think that we will not get it. But of course we do. Many times This is the kind of sweet quality I really got from this movie. "Oops! When I feel like something happened to me ..." It all goes through. Characters are attractive and well-developed. I recommend that 80 films, especially teen movies, or anyone who wants to go back and want to remember a simple time in their lives.
