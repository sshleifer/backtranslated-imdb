I appreciate pictures trying something different. Many movies seem like reinstatement of old ideas, so for this reason I firmly firmly recommend passport to Pimlico. <br /> <br /> This film is set after WW2 and post-war deficit and ration seems to be the "Burmese" of London drivers. The film is located in Pimiko, a small neighborhood in London. They are too ill, they are not able to buy what they want but they can not find any way out. Until they secretly stumble upon a hidden treasure and a charter which is officially named as a government nation hundreds of years ago! With this document, they are reasonable, they can bypass all the raysings and coupons and like life, because it turns out that they are not really British! Where the movie goes away and how the crisis is finally resolved, you have to see something for yourself. Bring the bright mind of Yale Studio with this gem!
