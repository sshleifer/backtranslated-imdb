It is one of those rare movies, it is beautiful and compelling, respected and quirky, a true gift. This is not a prerequisite for travel in Italy, or it is considered a prerequisite for a holiday, because it reminds you to open yourself to a wide range of experiences (like, find magic). I especially like Josi Lawrence like Lacey Wilkins, but every lead and supporting actress in this movie is helpless. Also dresses, you are drawn to fashion and costume, is done extraordinary good. I just want to be released in the DVD, because I'm wearing my tape version! <br /> <br /> Do not forget to see this time without any interruption, because of your Creator.
