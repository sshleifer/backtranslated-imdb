Version: Universal / Hong Kong Legend R4 DVD Release Canteen / English subtitles <br /> <br /> Once five years ago, the world was covered with 'matrix', and I was probably one of the few who were fifteen years old who still believed that terminator was better than 'matrix' . I was an easy teenage boy, to find a good action movie, and then there was a shining light at the TV station, which I have never seen, small station known as SBS. One night I noticed in the TV Guide that a movie starring Jackie Chan - 'Police Story' will be followed. At the age of fifteen and saw only 'Rumble in the Bronx' and 'Rush Hour', I said, "The arm is wonderful" and sat down to watch it, and the word "fascinating" shouted as the movie progressed. Two weeks later, after showing SBS 'Police Story' trilogy, I knew I found my new favorite actor. <br /> <br /> Jackie played a Hong Kong Police Chan Ko Koi who is a big drug-lord, Chu (Yun Thiever). Chu's secretary, Selina Fong (Braggate Lynn), holds the police as a witness, and Chan has been given the responsibility of protecting her. Things get worse - Rayal is bad - when Chu's case is dismissed and he decides that he wants Fong and Chan to die. <br /> <br /> 'Police Story' is one of the greatest action films of all time and of course my favorite Jackie Chan Films. It starts off stronger, and sometimes one of the most incredible action sequences ever painted. Everything is great in But some interesting part may seem a little hungry than some people ... <br /> <br /> As a story, it's still one of the better efforts of Jackie. For an action film, the story is quite good, and a much better actor than Jackie's acting and plot 'New Police Story'. These are not 'miracles', but perhaps it's a good thing. <br /> <br /> One of Jackie's best works is 'Police Story'. It embraces me in Jackie Chan's film, and should be a great start for any potential Jackie fans. The bad news for anyone who sees this first is that Jackie Chan films do not get better - 10/10
