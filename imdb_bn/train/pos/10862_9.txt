The selection is a Chinese people movie, or triads in this case. A new election was held every two years for the decision of the new two leaders, and first it was Big D (Tony Ling Ka Fai, or I called him "The Und Tony Ling") and the guy (Simon Yame, who was the full contact judge!). Although people once won, the BigD refused to accept the preference and the amount of what he could do to protect recognition as a new leader goes away. Like any other Asian film I'm seeing gangsters, this is not an action movie. Its bloody moments, like GoodFellas, are essentially just an effective play. There are many characters, which is really hard to keep track of, but I think it's all about playing in the ruffle. A 100-year-old baton, which I mentioned earlier, is a symbol of power, things change several times before they get fixed. And even though it might appear that Mark's image was finished in 65 or 70-minute, still there are some big surprises waiting. Simon Yame was my favorite character and photo anchor sort. <br /> <br /> Last year Hong Kong Film Award Winner Best Actor (Tony Leng), Best Picture, Best Director (Johnny Tuh, Hirik Trio K !!), and Best Screenplay It was nominated for cinematography, editing, film scores (which I liked), and the other three performance performances (including twins).
