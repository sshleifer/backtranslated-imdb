If you are like me, then you will love this great upcoming movie. I think it's a concern / love book / high school USA / Shout / Calendar Girl / Cribbbie / 50% in the early 60's and it's a wonderful soundtrack. Not like many songs like some of these movies, but still cool It's very funny at all and it's a great love interest. All young cast is awesome. I wish there were more kinds of these wonderful movies. My favorite movie is always back in the future when Marty McFly returned well to these wonderful films in 1955. This is better than some such films in the early 50's (early 60's) but this is not much.
