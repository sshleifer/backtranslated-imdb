Some people compared this movie with the delivery. I believe in meat and men are more suitable. Our leading people, Heaton, Spike definitely loves. It's irrelevant and stupid to know whether it is a sexual love. Because Hiton Spike does not leave. He needed him They need each other. As a brother, as a family, as their only connection to humanity. Setting, scenario, short, custom add all a delicate film. Actually, I did not notice what happened in the characters. But, I care about what the filmmakers did with them. He did well with them. I spent some time wondering how the last mouse and men would be similar. Soundtrack and cinematography were compulsory and playful.
