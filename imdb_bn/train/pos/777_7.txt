I saw this photo at the Chicago Relilling Film Festival. To pick up comments from past critics, I feel very deliberate on the clustrophobic feeling of the film and the close colors, and most of Eastern and Central Europeans express a feeling of limited space, debris architecture, overall weaknesses that create the city environment. A bit Chebbi housing project style describes how I would describe it, and how many people live in the suburbs of big cities. I can not say that I was familiar with Bucharest, Romania, where this work was exposed, but I traveled and lived in eastern Europe for six months. <br /> <br /> When I visited Russia as a student in a semester, my entire group had to pull seven stories from the stairs of the incognito student dorm building, just as the heroine works while walking with women because the elevators were not working. However, I agree with critics that you can find beautiful historical buildings, parks, squares in Bucharest or in a historic city center in Eastern Europe, to ensure that it is all about Clostropophia and silent colors, and there is no footage found in this Bucharest film. I see this picture better with Claustrophobia that I would feel as I was half year old, stuck and limited. (It shows you why someone wants to be an immigrant and would like to find a better life, such as hoping to escape from the urban cities of America.) <br /> <br /> Also, the climate of Homophobia has been called, often in the 1980s, the US After falling in love with two young women in the United States, their love was forced to be very personal; Therefore, focus on their interaction in the apartment. <br /> <br /> This is my great and commendable story that my romantic theme made in Romania was made, and I received complaints about previous critics poor film quality is quite anonymous and patronage. Directors and producers were unlikely to reduce government funding and funding for their films, and they did everything possible with their potentially limited organizations. Actors were fairly good and trustworthy; The dialog was completed in full, and I can get acquainted with these women. <br /> <br /> This film gives a sum of money with two young kiki, an energetic, fun-loving free spirit with forbidden love. A dark, annoying secret (his love and love for the humiliating, cruel brother Sandu and his love) fell in love with Alexandra, a bright, old, idealistic young girl who went to Bucharest to start college studies. Opponents are attracted and their personality seems to be complementary to each other, although there is some tension between aspiring, studying, intellectual Alexandra and Kiki, who seem to be present in college to please his parents. Their love hidden from their parents seems to be manageable, even though we do not feel any significance of it and we can not see or meet any other student - it is hard to believe - and may have been dragged to hide their love. The main threat of their love is the difficulty of trying to make Cikki's brother serious and his relationship. But Kikie's love for Alexandra finally gave him the necessity to strengthen this bond, right? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, cruel love for his brother. So, giving a woman a loving brother with possible remedies for love sickness. <br /> <br /> While this feeling of this film is confined to interaction between Stiffing and Clostropovic, Kiki and Alexander, yet it is still engaging and watching, so I give it a 7th.
