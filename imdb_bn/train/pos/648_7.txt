I decided to visit this site because of recommendations from this site. I would say it was worth the effort. However, you should be aware that this image will go for 210 minutes. If you do not have the ability to stay, take it on tapes and see it in a few nights. <br /> <br /> Now, in the film, what I say will be "spoilers" and if you do not mind your mind goes here: <br /> <br /> Alexander is a diverse left, a woman and a Gigolo. She lives with an elderly woman named Mary. Mario is a retail store owner and he is available for Alex. Spend his days at Alex Caf√©s and restaurants. The story reveals that Alex had previously forced Gilbert, whom he lived. Gilbert dumped him for less interesting people because he did not love because Alex tortured him and beat him. At this time, Alex was willing to get a job, and Gilbert helped him raise his child before he was dropped and before planning to marry someone else. By <br /> <br />, Alexander Vernicaa, a nurse called Nursing, and they break a relationship. Veronica was in love with Alex for the first time, with whom there was a sexual relationship with the men of the past. Marie and Veronica struggled for Alex's affection and were a commander to boot. Finally, it has been revealed that Veronica was pregnant with Alex's child and Alex told him to marry her. We assume that (already with Gilbert's situation) Alexander will be able to get a job and be a supplier for his newly found love and family. There is hope! <br /> <br /> With the title "La Mann at la Patan" I was related to Gene Ester, the character of LeBron in Veronica's Francois. She was a whore and then she became a mother. So, the mother and the whore are the same person? Anyway, I know! Most of the French movies are not (not all) fairly politically, propaganda, dramatic, pierced, lamenting and citing altogether. Libroon and Leod have played well with their overwhelming character and hold the film together, because some sections of the script have been lost and controversial. <br /> <br /> Not a bad endeavor. 7/10
