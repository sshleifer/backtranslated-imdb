Terry Gilliam traveled in the future (he had already done it in "Brazil") to tell the story about a virus that is destroying human species. <br /> <br /> This script is completely crazy with some simple techniques. But it's pretty entertaining and gilium proves that she's imagined (the future scenes are just great). For Cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stove (whatever with him?) Is okay, but Brad Pitt is so annoying that whenever he plays that role outside his hand, he is so strong and he does not believe in all. He will just play a successful young man. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 7/10
