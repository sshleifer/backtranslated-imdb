Although it looks like an unusually high score for a 9th picture, but it is much better than the hundreds of hundreds of detective films in the 1930s and 40s, and the next "thin" man in Pavel, now does not mean that movie Thin Man Like the movies, the Kennell Murders case is not a comedy, but a mystery-detective film, now you might think that Nora Charles or A Sta or a traditional comic sidakic (something actually found in all series of detective films) is not fun, it can be a cause for frustration, but I missed it all because it was an exceptionally good writing written film - a really interesting event and simultaneous extraordinary performance <br /> <br /> The movie starts showing dogs and is called Kenil Murder Case, although at A Filo vance movies are actually a dog show and dogs are not a very important part of the film for a while. Instead, a completely disgusted person dies completely in the silent room and goes to the left - to repeat an idea of ​​several detective films (such as Crime Doctor's Strangest Case) Is done. However, all this is interpreted to be quite reliable and very well seems to fit together - keep my interest throughout I am sure that the other detective films of the day were as intelligently written plots and exceptional performances. This one is definitely a defender.
