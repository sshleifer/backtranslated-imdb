This is a fantastic series first and foremost. It works very well and is very interesting. As a huge WWII buff, I learned a lot before watching this series. One of the best things to do about it is to talk to the war with the past when it was relatively fresh in their mind, it is relatively speaking. It is nothing against males seen in interviews on today's events, it only happened that most people of this incident were not involved in the above part of what was actually happening. One of the best parts is the description of Sir Lawrence Oliver. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to know about WWII, but really think only the bodies (like I) want to buy it or want to see it once in a while. My only real complaint about this whole series is that we do not know anything. Especially the Soviet Union's information is exaggerated or just wrong in places. The information that we now know because of the fall of the USSR is different now. Above all else in WWII is an interesting look and which must be seen as a serious WWII historian or professional.
