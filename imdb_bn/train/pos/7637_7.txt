I really like this movie though I'm not too fond of James Balushi. In this movie, you can actually see several big names on the rise, named Linda Hamilton and Court Cox; Caine's course was already bigger. This movie is easy to plot; It's just like that the slide-out collar cinema. But it was said in a light-hearted way and I liked the comedy moments in it. It has tried to make me live at my own moment, for example, if I take a girl out for the film but not the other, etc. It tells us that people around us could take different roles in our lives but the minute details were changed. It reminds us for what we are aware of. We think that the other side of life is not always as good; Probably, what we have now is best for us, everything has been considered.
