There is a description, which is not very common for Jackie Chan films, but it is here. Funny elements also have some difficult and serious environmental problems. Jackie is psychological and psychological here He is not the hero, the attacker and only go back immediately (naturally backward pattern), but he is the person who can go and start a quarrel. His methods of wearing glasses that hit the evil guy. Each time it is "crack!" Goes. I especially enjoy Jackie Pub and the villains who beat her girlfriend in front of her. It's one of the best blitzkriegs to keep on screen. Alongside, the entire scene is shot with some action character pictured on the wall (it's like the poster of "Rabbeya" in our Soviet era, and on the left it looks like some lines of Russian) (I have seen quite a mistake). That looks awesome (and nostalgic for the Russian people). I also like when movies are broken in Windows. Here's a lot of these things. It's amazing to see characters moving / running / running / driving through all kinds of pans. <br /> <br /> All three movies are superb. I was preparing myself to see the slides under the quality standard, but I saw a perfect triangle with a sensible and incredible stunt (and the character of Jackie Chan is not shown in only three films - it also keeps on being nice and consistent). <Br /> <br /> I want to describe each movie in just a few words: No.1 - Great (from all directions - from the beginning to the very beginning of a mobile phone story) and funny (lots of scenes humorous); No. 2 - Raging (Jackie is really * BP * here) and painful (Jackie gets tortured); No. 3 - Incredible (Jackie as well as the woman who beates) incredible and bombardy (I mention a lot of guns and blasts?). <br /> <br /> All others have been mentioned <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a triangle which can be seen again (at least by me). Her position is Top 10 in action / comedy jewels. Eventually it was released in Russia on DVD (the second best option in the movie - Chinese / Russian soundtrack and English / Russian subtitles). <br /> <br /> Solid 10. Out of 10 Thank you for your attention.
