But how can you win the baseball team that can not win? It's not easy for George Knox. After opening the film, Roger Bammont (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) and his best friend J. P. (Milton Davis Jr.) walks around small stairs around the stadium of the angels. When he comes back to his mother's house, Roger recommends meeting with his father (Dermot Mullrony). Her mother is dead! And when he was going to be his family again to his father, he loudly loudly loudly shouted loudly, "I say that the angels have won the division championship". Later, Roger and J. P. The angels play Baseball in a room hidden in the house. When Manzur George Knox (Danny Glover) takes out his vessel, the pot becomes crazy and comes to fight with him, and soon the angel team goes into war, which will expel Nokkins from the game. That night the King made a prayer to win the championship. When his father Maggie Maggi Nelson (Brenda Ficar) and JP go to a baseball, the real corner of Roger comes in the field and the left fielder (Matthew McClondley) captures a manger and leaves the game. Play Man (J. Sanders) how he did that. From Roger's chief angel (Christopher Lloyd) he learned that only he can see the angle, because he only prayed for help. <br /> <br /> 10/10
