Behind the scenes: This is one of the most surprising, most intense movies seen at the longest time. The first movie of the year that left me absolutely staggered. I could only feel my way out of the theater, I was so frustrated. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at the screen for about 15 minutes to find out how to describe the power of this movie, and just fail. It has to be highlighted in one direction - documentary-style video diary format, out-of-date scripts of events, character strength - it makes everyone trivial. Someone may find it ridiculous that any killer can be identified as normal. But then all the killers are not foaming madly. Many regular, unassuming people. They're just wired separately. <br /> <br /> and probably think it's the most coolest of all.
