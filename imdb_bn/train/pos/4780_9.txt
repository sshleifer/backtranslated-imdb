Always fancied this film from video cover. Finally got a round in order to buy it for a fiver in a sale and boy what a film is about. The case is an easily stunning performance from all and it is filmed so nicely. Even from a distance even you can hear very little about the dialogue, like if you really like the story bits of that distance. It's really moving, frequently fun and very watchable. Not many conversations, but in such a way that you feel so tired. A 9/10 from me A must see.
