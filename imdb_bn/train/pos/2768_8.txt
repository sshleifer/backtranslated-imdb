Without Susan Hayward's wooden delivery throughout this film, it was as good as a Bible film. Henry King manages this film with the short episode epic epic, and always peaks, as perfect. Stirring Alfred Newman sound score, with the fastest song of thirty, even after these many years, even memorable. The view of Goliyath is a bit beside the hockey, but this film is not all that happened badly for the era created. In addition to the Bible epic of this day "Roth song" and "Esther and the King" went along as well. It's valuable, and Raymond Massie is as nice as Nathan Nathan. David married his first wife, always James Robertson, Justice Abhishey and I knew this movie as Mitchell like Midos.
