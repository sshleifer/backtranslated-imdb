I saw this movie 10 years ago. And the video is viewed once in a year. This is the type of movie that is shameless, because the theme is universal, but stories and conversations are so personal This is one of the few movies that captures you from the frame for a credit roll, even though it is actually only two (very involved) characters. It is a lot to play through Havk and Delpy, which we believe that they are actually Jayse and Celine. This is the first movie I saw that the reality TV has mentioned, and now, the phenomenon is huge! I hug the viewer just in her space, and you think that if you can do that, you can be one of those characters. It wants me to drive trains around Europe! I did not meet anyone who could not relate to this movie. Maybe me, my friends, or the mere gift of this movie.
