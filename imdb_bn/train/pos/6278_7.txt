I saw it on a flight in the US and at first it was a little suspicious because some people said that it had many letters that you did not know any of them. But I did not find all of this. The film is fast, but it is due to the nature and nature of the star. Chase scenery is excellent and yes it can be predictable but most movies are not true. A bit of the main villain disappointment, Christopher Eicleston is not as believable as possible, but it's still a good movie for him.
