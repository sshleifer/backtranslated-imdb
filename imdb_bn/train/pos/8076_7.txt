The family has two family members after each other's blood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She has a family in India. Once he accidentally killed Akshay Kumar (Akshay Kumar). Like Veeran Saha, he has a family (brother, wife and parents). Aryan (Aryan), learning brother is going to take revenge on his brother's death He kidnapped Viren's family for the same reason. <br /> <br /> This image got a bending point (Amitabh Bachchan). The second half of the movie is completely related to him, whereas the expression is more important than his conversation. Akshay's small role played him equally to Amitabh. I did not understand what I played in this movie. <br /> <br /> There were several loose points in the script; Like; Amitabh has been shown as the most wanted criminal of the city, yet he is still scot-free in the city. The abduction of his family also looked obscure. Such a big donation family has no security cover?
