This movie is good for what it is, and neutral; I do not want to see it twice, however: I ended up poking a peter and so I saw it. The best asset for this movie is: Unusual and Functionality. Compared to other similar movies, it will not drag its feet forever, because every part of the four (plus one) segment is less than 30 years old and is less than 10 years old. In the first section, from the 'writer's block' the horror of the horror writers moved to the lonely old house of inspiration. She even looks too much when she started to imagine one of her imagined crazy ones. Pull similar plots on the platform BURIAL. Good use of point-of-view twist: The authors are becoming mentally ill ... or (as the last show), his trophy wife wants to play with her crazy madman and protect her estate. <br /> <br /> Two long-lost friends in the second division get together in the same old house, but do not seem to be able to help a malicious awful travel. The museum has long been a wax statue of their youth, which once separated them. From the Gothic Museum, they said that the illustrated woman was a dead cell murdered ... or was she? <br /> <br /> The third volume was less interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Fourth is a horror film actor - who thinks he is the best - looking at the depth of low budget C movies. His imaginary vampire sought a costume for more credibility ideas, he got the real deal. This segment lacks the strength of the first two. <br /> <br /> The performance is fairly good, its first part contributes to the majority of it. Good movie, salt with a grain. Not the best cushion, but Lee ... but precious.
