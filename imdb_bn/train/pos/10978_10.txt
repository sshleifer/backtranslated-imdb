Several years ago when I first saw the "Gray Garden", it seemed and found the sunny camp. After a few years, when I saw it, I smiled loudly, but after a lot of philosophies I came to look at the strange, curved relationship between the diverse "Big" Edith Bauer's beer and his daughter "Little" Edith Bouvier's Bell. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> This zaki and osir rice and nesses filmmakers Albert and David Meshesse are allowed to live in their daily lives as roommates with amateurs, raccoon and oxosam roommates. The result is a ridiculous, beautiful, sad and ongoing account of genuine love and anarchy. <br /> <br /> Relationship between Big and Little Editions is a rule of love for unwanted bonds. And an example of their life's drive, determination and free will. I can make more recommendations than these words can be in the words. This is a rare experience which you will see for yourself. <br /> <br />
