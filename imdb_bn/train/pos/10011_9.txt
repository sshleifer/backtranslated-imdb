I enjoy the nightclub very much. It is one of the best movies of summer. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams is one of his best performances. In fact, the whole throw was very good. All playing just the right notes for their character - not too much and not very little. Sandra Oh adds a wonderful comic touch. Tony Colette is as great as a mother and never tops. Everyone is very trustworthy. <br /> <br /> It's a small movie, just under one and a half years down. I think the general version version is less than nine minutes less than the Sundance version. I wonder if the more annoying images were cut off from the image. <br /> <br /> The director told a story and made it simple, which today is a refreshing change from many directors. Instead of telling stories to the audience, to influence the audience and to say it well <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not worry about previews and advertisements. This is not a HitachiCyan thriller. Watch night listener because you want to see better stories called good. If you want to hit the hitco, then you will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie ended. The director could have a little more towards the audience's imagination, but it is a minor chin.
