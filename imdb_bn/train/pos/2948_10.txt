It should be against the law without seeing this very funny stand-up show with Eddie Morphy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The people who received it include: Elvis, Mr. Tech, Michael Jackson, Steve Wanderer, Mick Jagger, Luther Wandrous and James Brown. I seriously do not have so much laughter in my entire life. I mean, when a person does not know Mr. T, but Mr T has laugh so hard, there's something about him. At that time I saw the show, I could not remember who Mr. T But still laughs. Now I know who he is and makes it so funny. Because Eddie does that - they can make so many impressions so well that it does not matter what they are trying to do, it's still fun. And above all, we learn that Murphy is a very good singer. Please see it ..
