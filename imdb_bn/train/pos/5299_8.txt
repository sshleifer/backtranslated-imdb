Once you can cross the title of the film, "Packer" is a great movie, probably John Waters' best. A wonderful cast under the leadership of Edward Farlung and Christina Rixie, this story is very interesting, and made very real. Some flashy scenes that are not definitely suitable for a small child, but they are there for no purpose. Unfortunately this film is not widely produced and most people will be denied the opportunity to view it. If you do not miss the opportunity, then see this picture.
