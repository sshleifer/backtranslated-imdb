The production of the superb tecular is a woman of strong religious beliefs and breaks her oath, telling her unusual story of romance between a woman in her Trapistist beggar, breaking her oath. This photo was inaugurated at a convention in Europe, where a former student prays - black is a lonely beauty called Domini (Marilyn Diyearch). To go to the desert of Mother Supriyo and to "find out yourself" is suggested, and recently lost her sorrow over her father. In the train car on Sahara, he was very scary man (Charles Bower) - sitting in front of our former beggar. She is soon in a hotel near Pump-Travedes Osse where she has again seen our mysterious annoying man because she is pressed on what to do when she encounters a very seductive dance girl. Damini has become friends with her, although her past-romance does not know anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is emotional, composer, and different (in a way, almost stylish and even a small camp). Very fun and entertaining it was not found. Of these, photography is really interesting - it is close to the intimate face and the beautiful color shot of the carnage beside the desert, the silhouette image against the sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich performed a nicely, though breaks, looks at the performance and gorgeous here. Charles Boyer - Not usually one of my favorites - actually it's pretty good, I think it's part of its advantages and he also looks very young and handsome. Basil Rothbone is very good here, but very good. Max Steyner's another great orchestral score helps to keep the play rolling - above all, a very enjoyable movie.
