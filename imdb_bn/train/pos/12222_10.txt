I thought this movie was amazingly planned, it confused me and my cousin saw it with me. To tell the truth I think the little Kevin Dillon was hot. Hahaha ... but I thought that as well as a fool, before she died, she told him that "I was in you". I think he thinks what he gets to do what he has done to her and how will she tell him that she will never care for how old were other girls in her childhood? Now I do not think that I could ever believe such a police. But to tell the truth, it was clear that if he wanted to be a policeman, I would have no way to be suspicious. And he was funny when he threw him in the shop's eyes. Hahahahah He was once again stupid to enter his own warehouse and so the police killed Helo! It is called back-up. Sometimes this movie makes me crazy when people work stupid and stupid things. But that's what I think is a thought about movies.
