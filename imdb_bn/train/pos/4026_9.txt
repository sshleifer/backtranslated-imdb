Pinna is really a wonderful composition .... This is a thoughtful movie that makes you think and questions about our culture. Without any doubt, I saw the best Hindi film. This film should be shown in film festivals around the world, and I believe that Kansas was a serious rival. All the characters have been thrown completely and Urmila Mukhandar and Manoj Bhojpai are hunting for their role. <br /> <br /> The story sharing is a very important story and should never be forgotten. <Br /> <br /> has no biases or ancestors and gave humanitarian stories to the partition. Here, no one country is portrayed as good or bad. Bad Indian, evil Pakistani and good Indian and Pakistani have. Cinematography is excellent and music composer, meaningful and hunting. Everything about the movie is amazing ... and acting just took my breath. All are fully cast.
