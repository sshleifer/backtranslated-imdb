Richard Dick decided to retire and therefore Michael Dewen met Ted Nicholas in his place after meeting with a French French girl named Aldeus Dupres Barcli (Lenny Aubert). The couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by the justice judge and when they reached the judge's house, they rained down and found that he was not home and it will not return the next day. The couple looked at the inside of the house and picked up the car and took an automobile from the engine. Once you see this event once you realize that this couple is a wonderful phenomenon and people of the story reveal a very mysterious incident surrounding Alice Barclay and so bad that Ted Nicolas has a lot of problems and no one gets married. Good mystery, but I missed Richard Dix. Enjoy.
