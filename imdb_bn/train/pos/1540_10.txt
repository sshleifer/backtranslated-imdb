This is an incredible film. I can not remember the last time I saw a Swedish movie on this level. It's funny, it's tragic, it's mandatory, and it's mostly a part of Swedish small city life. It crushes the clich√©s, and dwells deep. It is not only associated with all characters but also in all characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The cat girl is coming back to her small town, to celebrate her 70th birthday. He did not meet many years people Although the story itself is not unique, it offers a new approach. The center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (at different stages of life), who are not very close. Or at least they do not understand how close they are. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that makes this movie so easy to connect with people. First of all, I am satisfied with the fact that this is not the so-called 'A-list' of Swedish actors in this movie. Usually there are some actresses who have the power to find their way to almost every major production in Sweden. At this time, the production company has managed to keep it practical by voting for actors who think that they really love their profession. Sophie Helen is probably Eva Ross's first Swedish actress who has proved that you do not need words to express any emotions. <br /> <br /> The text is very interesting. The dialogue is trustworthy ones, and compared with last year or two other Swedish films, it is forward by miles. Maria Blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you do not know, then never assume that it's her first time writing and filming a feature length film. I can not wait for her next. <br /> <br /> Once you start seeing it, you really want to see it.
