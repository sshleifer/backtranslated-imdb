I think the deal with this movie makes it really came about with 2 minutes, really fun moments and it came with a very good trailer and many people of the trailer and do not live up to the movie at this time trailer. It drops slightly a little bit worse and for such an exciting premise, and I think I'm in this movie. Remembering comments from people having comments on having love / hate relationships with <br /> <br />. But if you look at what this movie is about and not considering cast talent, I think it's still quite good. Julia Stiles Clearly she falls in love with the star she just flashes and the entire audience Lee, she is set in conformity with everyone else rolling and carefree. Cast out the rest, of course, Lee's testosterone-filled colleague, his elegant mother-in-law, his lady friend Jim and his bride all enter and stand in the first place to make an excellent job of fitting between annoying stereotypes. <br /> <br /> Lee does not live up to his costars, I do not think, but many more that you can see that, they're hard to live up to. Maybe a bit of slowness and a few jokes that such a writer intended, still quite funny as a source of disappointment does not come close to fun. The movie itself /> <br /> <br, and I rather found an intelligent film. Similarity and "taking the safe route" theme skillfully aligns different levels. For example, he had a whole motif of how he would imagine the scene, but he would never work until the last scene, or how everyone would behave on the highway, talking about everything or not everything is said to be the name of Selma Blair and Julia Stiles. Being risky is the choice. <br /> <br /> It was echoed by the theme. The other good thing about the movie was that it was a crazy comedy type, in which Jason Lei kept his way through the movie and through a mobile phone (for example: the pharmacy starts to be a good chef) And in some parts of it some cleverness goes with it mostly. <br /> <br /> I was not as funny as I was, and there was some lacking talent, but overall it is still a good film.
