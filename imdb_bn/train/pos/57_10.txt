I said that this is the best movie that I have ever seen! I'm tensed and T.V. Looked through. And found the "home cell" and it was already about 5 minutes, but I got hooked. It was so interesting and moving. It shows what can happen to anyone in his life. If I find it possible 10, more. The director / writer and actor did an amazing job. I will watch this movie as teenagers and learn from it. It's great, drama, mystery, and more. I cried for hours! I think the director / author has to write more movies like this. I love it I did not even know about this movie, because it was very good. I can see more people watch movies.
