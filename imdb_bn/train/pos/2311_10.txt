Reese Witherspoon's first movie. Love it The plot and the acting were top notch. You engage characters with erection. In my opinion, one must definitely see. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie you will see why the acting career of Reese Witherspoon has been so successful. <br /> <br /> Another cast member works very well. <br /> <br /> The movie flows very well. There is not a boring moment in the whole movie. Moon length is okay. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I think this movie was excellent. I have seen it many times, and enjoyed every philosophy.
