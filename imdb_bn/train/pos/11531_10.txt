I think when I first saw this movie I was a child, it was my first horror film (probably I can still remember some part of it). I do not remember a lot about acting, naked scenes or other things but remember that the head has grown up with a grenade in the hands of a man, a man is spread over a tree and a man is shot down by a truck and shot dead (Toad) Shaifar, Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland). When the killer stole the stomach to get the key of Jennifer MacAlster truck, I remember the last scene. This is a movie that gives you a cripple and it's worth a look. But where do I get it? How can I download it?
