This is an amazing movie about the dynamics of a fun, cute story and culture differences and the ongoing theme of life's important issues. This creates a very less grateful film. The world's cynics do not cease to see you this. Keaton has a wonderful moments and I'm not that wonderful comedy is appreciated, because the actress like Caitan is going from serious to extreme humorous looks to the extremely simple look. Great movie around!
