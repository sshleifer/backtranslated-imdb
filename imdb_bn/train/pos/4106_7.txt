This is certainly not an intellectual movie with a deep mission, so I do not really believe that if you do not check, you can not understand that there are so many things. <br /> <br /> This is just a comedy. Humor is simple, quite funny and sometimes, maybe a little morbid. Some actors and characters are similar to Samotri (2000) (Jiri Makasek, Ivan Trojan, Vladimir Dahlhei). But it does not matter, this genre is really different and these two films should not be compared in this way. Jedna Ruka Netlesk√° will not try to give you a lesson, it will try to make you laugh and it has some chance to be successful. <br /> <br /> Not bad movie, not impressive, but I enjoyed it. Some scenes really worth seeing.
