I read somewhere (in a fairly panning review) that it's a live-action me cha anonymous and I think they're in the right lines. When I was very young, I saw this movie first and I am dying to see it again, and finally when I finally remembered, all the memories came back to the flood. I do not want to take it seriously - it's just a little 80-year-old TV-movie funny (it is set against a fairly dark future background, although this point is not too severe). The conversation that I was most admired about this movie was not generic sound - no clich√©s, no expected lines - all just good fun! Maybe the time was not kind to this small film, but I still find it gratifying for me. This is not perfect, but it is entertaining and does not try to do anything else. Nerds and comic shop shops Think about technical - Care? Check it out for yourself and make your own decision. Someone else's opinion is important.
