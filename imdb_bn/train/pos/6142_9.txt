An interesting Disney film with Angela Lansbye, as a middle-aged sprinter, was turned into a museum in England on May 11, the first World War in England. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lansbury was 51 years old at the time of film and was an ideal part. She is again Jessica Flachter, but this time is for benefits or kids and in the dangerous time for Mother England. <br /> <br /> This film introduces as Miss Price (Lansbury) and Professor of David Tomlinson. Of witchcraft trying to obtain specific information on witchcraft. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm actually Ben Stella's picture- "Night at the Museum", when the liberation war continued at the end of the film with the Nazi attack in the small British coastal city.
