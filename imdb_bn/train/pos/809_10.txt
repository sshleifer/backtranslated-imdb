A very good movie A classic Sci-Fi movie about humor, action and everything. This movie offers a larger number of aliens. We see the leaders of the rebel coalition and most of the imperialist forces. Emperor's main character I liked the vowel savages and Vietnamese representation in any way. (Extraordinary references) I like the conflict between Bhadra and Luke which is the best of the best. On the return journey, the first quarter's title has ended and the empire finally falls. I appreciate the celebration of the winner where it meets the consequences of the release of Bhadra and comes back to Yadya and Ovi-Van with the spirit of Anakin Skywalker. It gives a sadness and a tear. The film stars the greatest scenes in Star Wars: when he turned a decent emperor. Oh-Wyanne, Yoda and ... look at the look and feel of his father (not the 1997 edition Hayden Christensen). The best view of the next time after pushing Darth Vader to strike for protecting Liya. Despite a good finish this film has a deep dark side. I felt that there was a lot more than meets the eyes. And as always John William Music Star Wars will bring classicism into the universe.
