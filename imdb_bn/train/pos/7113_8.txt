Philadelphia is very much interested in the suburbs and local history, this film shows excellent wine in Philadelphia in the 1940s. Suburban views, a train station that no longer exists, the 30th Street Station - which still exists, as well as the city's northeast scenes are also visible. Good shot of old row houses as they appeared. The film sometimes becomes a bit "sticky" - decreasing the viewer at a low rate ... but the overall story is strong and very running. Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see "Bright Victory", also with local footage of Valley Force Army Hospital in Phoenixville - and scenes of City of Phoenixville. The army has become a college campus from the hospital. These movies are not beyond any format and I can not imagine why. I have both VHS from their home recording as shown in recent years on TCM. I highly recommend them to any other history buffs from my area!
