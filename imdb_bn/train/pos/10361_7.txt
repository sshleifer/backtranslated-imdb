Once you realize that they have come out of the floor from you, they ... they can combine this thing so quickly that it ends in the same year, you will see that it is not half bad. The plot is compelling and attractive, and fast pacing, it is covered in most situations, and thus often it goes faster after the line or two conversations. This is where acting really stands. Performance is excellent Neill and Streep are both faulty. A Hollywood movie is very cool to hear the alleged Australian conversation and even those who try it even at least do not come to naturally. Cinematography and editing are excellent, but they do not exceed the actual stuff. The story of this movie is compulsory and it is auspicious that it just makes it even more cooler. Although I have read or heard novels about what happened to this photo, I understand that it is close to the truth. This includes some strong language and annoying content. It is, sometimes, a great great courtroom drama. I recommend this to a fellow fan as such. 7/10
