I agree with "Weinbraker" related to "Ahah" that you will find the end of this movie. I liked the locations I chose in movies, the songs were well-written and interesting, especially the Cydelic Sounding track that played Hans Matson. It's trippy. His role in Nighy was incredible, the nail "nail" it, Bano was usually a drummer, and Rea kept it together. Bruce Robinson was horrible. Helena was a lovely girlfriend. But I thought Juliet Barber's performance was fantastic. Aubrey and Robinson kill me in the scene! Actually played and the scene was behind the music spot! Not too bad, many more musicians have checked out this movie! They should! I told all my music friends. Great quote on Jimmy Nell's character: "It is supposed to be rock and roll, not the feeling of the G ***************!"
