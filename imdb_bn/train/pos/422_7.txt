"The Plansman" in his most incorrect and non-practical case, Cecil B Demil represents the skill indicated. It does not set up parallel plots of a low-ocean complex for contact with Wild Bill Hikk (Gary Cooper), Belfell Bill Cody (James Allison), Kallattie Jane (Jang Arthur), George Armstrong Castor and Abraham Lincoln, although in fact Lincoln was The time has already dead. Each time Demil travels dangerously against the truth, but it easily goes away from the invisible sight and the procession. The film is trying hard with the help of a hip of imagination in the last scene of the cast, which relies on human life, who are dependent on products and legends already made. Indeed, this world is Dimile, an astrologer in the history of entertainment, but today it is a beautiful camp left by the criteria. <br /> <br />: Considering the vintage film, it is a moderately attractive upload, often with clear white and extremely solid black. There are plenty of film grains and other absence of absence in some scenes. All in all, the quality of the image is somewhat inconsistent, but is it all bad or not good at all ?? The road is a little better than the middle. Artifacts related to age are kept to the lowest and digital exceptions are not confused. Audio audio is neatly balanced. <br /> <br /> Forget about it. It is universal! Bottom Line: As a pseudo-history painted in celluloid, this western is compulsory and fun. Just take his letters and stories with a grain of salt ?? In some cases ?? A complete box seems more suitable!
