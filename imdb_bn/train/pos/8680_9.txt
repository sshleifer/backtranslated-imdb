Metro-Goldwine-Mayor is a very lost player in the short cartoon market. This market is mainly influenced by Lonny Tune and Mary Mediade Shorts. Warner Bros, but MGM is able to release hidden gems, such as "to spring", a wonderful story about the most beautiful season of the year. <Br> <br /> In the environment described here, spring is not created by natural cycles, but it is formed. By whom? By the little men elves who live below the ground. Every spring, when the snow starts melting, they start to work. They begin to break the sunny rock pens, then erode them and use it to turn the stone into colored liquids, which will be moved to the ground and grass, with flowers ... in other words spring! The first half of the cartoon depicts spring fabrication, but the second part is a little different. The Old Man comes back to the winter and he tries to extend the winter by destroying elves' work. So from this point, we help elves and a man in the winter of Old Man. <br /> <br /> The music here is a wonderful surprise. The piece of paper is like a black spot on paper paper. The second part is thrilling melodies and they fit perfectly with the action. This is just fantastico, giorgio! Animation sequence is also a joy. The colors are well mixed and each little detail is shown in a massive, epic atmosphere. The idea itself is bright. Elves are attracted to characters, so the Old Man Winter, who effectively illustrate the cold and ruthless feeling of white season. <br /> <br /> contains a strong message here. The fight is lost to Elves till the end, until a delayed LFT jumps into action and it leads to the conquest of the rainy season in winter. So the point is: only individual people can distinguish. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, "Spring to Spring" is a remarkable missing classic of the short cartoon era. Even more wonderful is this cartoon director made his debut here. And who is the director of "spring"? It is a definite reference to William Hanna ...
