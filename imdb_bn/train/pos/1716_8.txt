Soha Ali Khan acting actress Deol and her "hello sister"! It sets the voice for the first film of Shivam Nayar. Soha, middle-class girl fled to Nainital, and she is coming to Delhi to marry her lover Shayan Munshi. But Satan is hearty and not alone in Soha's big world. . Abhay, the person in the lower class, became a weak Soha defender and helped him get employment and shelter in old age. Slowly romance Bloom and agreed to marry Soha! Then Shayan again enters Soha's life. <br /> <br /> Sensively generated movies, subtle Soha surrounded by a very unusual story shot in Delhi lovingly. Will these good imaginative films have the etched etching memories forever ?? Strange first kiss and fast forgiveness; Abaya describes Soha as "class Wali Ladki" and added soon, "She does not love him"; <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < A scene where Soha hold Rahul, and the soundtrack disappears. Stability relates to both painfulness and tenderness. <br /> <br /> The last of the harmful creates a bitter sweet film, whose memories remain fixed for a long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> One must definitely see I will rate 8.5 / 10
