This movie is very entertaining, and no criticism is based on personal preferences - not the quality of the film. Except for general exaggeration in some scenes of the morph, the film is a great car for its comedians. It has some pretty special effects, and exciting action scenes. <br /> <br /> As a seeker of lost children, Murphy's character begins to find the missing girl, which leads him to the path for which others believe that he was "selected" - for the protection of the Golden Child. The young boy was born as an enlightened person, who is determined to defend the world from the evil forces, but whose life is dangerous, not with the help of Murphy, and his beautiful, mysterious and mysterious helper / guide / guardian. /> <br /> Also, there are philosophical lessons for challenging audience members interested in deep thinking. A scene where the Golden Child, which is requested to protect the character of the morph, is examined by the monks of the hill temple. An elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces to choose from a child, and the child is tested according to his / her choice. <br /> <br /> It is a fantasy / comedy that both of the ideas are well and the forces of our world are the forces which most people are completely unaware. As we acknowledge this determination of the plot, we must let go of our touch with a real physical reality and prepare to wait for the destruction of the earth and the walls and a region of the temple to destroy us. <br /> <br> This is a nice plot, fine acting, and in many parts, beautiful balance of martial arts battles and a beautiful theme with Eddie Murphy humor featuring a serious issue.
