"Moonstrack" is a movie that I saw for the first time. I really liked it the second time. I liked it the third time. Now it's my favorite time. <br /> <br /> Humor is fine but really good. The film offers a lot of warmth humor. The story takes place in an Italian school Italian neighborhood around NYC. Watch Cher's search for love is enjoyable. As far as this picture, Nicholas Cage did the best picture. Old man character is pretty fantastic. She is not saying a word screen light. The shouting of the moon with his dog was fantastic. However, perhaps the best character is played by Olympia Dukakis. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the film is a scene where the main characters are outside family breakfast kitchens at Otamel's breakfast. Exceptional aspects and wrapping.
