It was a wonderful funny comedy with a great cast. John Ritter and Katie Sagal were completely cast as parents, and the kids were very great. Kelly Choquo likes to play Bridget, who had a kind of wedding wedding with Kelly Bundy's children. Writing and performance were the first rates. <br /> <br /> Sadly, John Rotten died during the series, and it blurts on stuff. They were disappointed to change the program and bring more cast members, and this was probably an uncomfortable situation, but they managed it. James Garner was a good addition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> That was great. <br /> *** *** *** *** ***
