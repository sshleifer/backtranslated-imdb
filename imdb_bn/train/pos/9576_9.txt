One of the most cruel and brutal film I've ever seen, but one of the most unfortunate and moving ones. This is a verb-melody that has never seen before the world. Sometimes the plot got around me tears, while at the next moment providing bocking-crunching blow-like shocking revelations, boom. Chilling performance by Edison Chen. The stories of an H-Kop and a Cambodian murderer hunt each other, although bit is losing their humanity, a strong one. Hunting imagery and radioactive camera- Very little dialogue for work, pure dogs with "dog bite dogs" Hirosham-bleed.
