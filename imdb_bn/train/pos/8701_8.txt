It may be an unpleasant surprise for everyone who hopes for a traditional superhero-movie. This is more than a play than the action movie. It mainly focuses on emotions and is somewhat like a Greek tragedy - whatever the main character goes wrong in any way. <br /> <br /> The reason is that as per each superhero, the cucumber takes the law in its own hands and society does not realize it. Sasha became a taboo. During the run, she will show a beautiful girl and fall in love so things become more complicated for her. <br /> <br /> You can see that the plot is really dramatic but the film lacks the speed. This reminds me of some of Ram Gopal Varma's narrations in recent movies. Everything happens very slowly. However, when there are no action scenes it becomes very dynamic that if you understand what you understand it is over. But the director does not want to affect us in shiny and usable action. What is more important here is the result of Tasha's Karma, which is mostly very harsh. The score is very low, which makes it more difficult to focus on the film. So basically you have to be very patient to see it. <br /> <br /> What is this valuable? The answer to that question is really difficult. I do not think that this experience has made me so rich, but the way I think about this movie and want to see it again. Most of the time in the atmosphere, which is frequent but not deceitful, because armed and cutting always hope for all time. After all they are young people who have all life in their life. So how difficult it is when they are together, it's always a little fun tune.
