The meaning of the Storm is probably the best film of all the movies of Mary Pickford. It was quite long for a silent movie for two hours in 1922, it was able to hold your interest even after about 80 years of being portrayed. Marie Meridienne plays a role like "The Best Hit" performance with features like Mary's little devil, Mary little mother, Mary Spitfire, Mary Romantic heroine. In the past it is used throughout a single film. The film made a surprise to the illegitimate children of a supporter for 1922, and at one point our Little Mariah was unaware of being questioned! If Academy Awards are held in 1922, there is no doubt that Oscar Miriam could be the best actress of the year.
