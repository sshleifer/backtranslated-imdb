This image tells the story of romance romance between Albert Einstein Rice and the gas station attendant. In order to combine the two, agree to help Insteen Ed (Hud Proker's Team Robbins) to learn more intelligent work. This affects the cathrine (Meg Ryan). Unfortunately Einstien goes very far and Ed is considered a genius. Hilarity ensues. Can not be missed. Princeton University's Mercer County New Jersey, Lawrenceville Prip School (twice for Princeton University) and a beautiful vintage gas station at Hopeville.
