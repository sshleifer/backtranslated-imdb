I want to vote 10 out of 10 in the rare opportunity to see this review, sorry for me, shine me with Hollywood and involve me in his strange / funny world. But in all seriousness, it was good. The first episode is definitely finding the foot, but it's the Silverman Curiosity that runs all the way through it. This is not a humorous comedy, but it is a good thing, it remains very cheerful and the laughing laughs will not be correct, the audience will have to laugh at their hearts Jassa laughing that it is all ignorance. I can easily see it as a strange character and incredibly strong central character as a beta draw caery show. Well worth a watch, look forward to the following episode. There is a very good chance from the usual comedy. <br /> <br /> Sir? Call me ....
