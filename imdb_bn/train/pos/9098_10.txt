Local import was a great movie. I smiled full time. It was funny in many levels of excessive sunny situations from crazy outfits. The acting was great. Ala Croot, Larry Dorf, Howard Hessman, and others did all the extraordinary work. This is an independent film written by the author for the first time, because it is not such a relief in the expectations of other comedies which had such relief. It was a unique and interesting and you fell in love with characters and heart-warming stories. I heard it was based on a true story? If so, then that is lovely (and amazing!). I highly recommend this movie.
