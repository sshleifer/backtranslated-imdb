This is the most facing documentary I have ever seen. It was a simple and exciting view of a beautiful concept. Depending on the art of hidden art industry hidden around the rise of China's modern art, Edward Bourtinsky was in trouble that we simply chose to ignore. <br /> <br /> This film is not a part of the fairly moving pictures of our western societies not educating us about the political leadership - the tribe of economic growth, the exotic foreigners of less developed communities, the source of our facilities and the waste of our consumer lives. <br /> <br /> Strange, heart-breaking, impossible to ignore This is a challenging journey but it is acceptable - please stop having an unconscious and at least see these photos of truth without feeling the pressure of these photos. 10/10 definitely!
