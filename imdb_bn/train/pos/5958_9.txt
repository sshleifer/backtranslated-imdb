Unlike some comments, mine is positive. This movie covers a group of friends around the dinner table, something you like, nothing. Something related - mother, girl, boy. Their story is smooth, not satisfied with everyone and everything, like the kind of life - in real life. Some story lines do not develop, they just happen. But like the real family and good friends, they stay together. The parents who bought the baby are - the hole! You are happy for the last The poor Delmar is stuck in a rock, trying to keep a rock and a stone, his mother, his sons, and all their lives together. It does not last a sunset or sunset living in the sunset or in the sun's world, but in the days of everyday living, a real life illustration for humans. Overall, it's a good story and a great movie !!
