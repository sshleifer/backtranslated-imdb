Back in 2004, I saw "the truth", contributing Tom's tie to Paris J.T.Ime. When I saw it I liked it and became thrilling. It has become my favorite little film and praised me a lot of formats. Of course, I wanted to see the whole movie, and I would also check who was connected <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw the end, courtesy of the Internet. <br /> <br /> First of all I would say that it seems fantastic. Each of the photography and diversions in shots, is not having anything special in the worst - but still bright and clear. After that I read quarterly here, and maybe 6D scanning how to do all the more DP work. My special choices are "Quotes de Sine" first scene (the sunlight!), Sina City-Esquiera (but good for me) "Quartier de la Madeleine" and "14th Arrangement" - but you know what I'll say. Like all of them: "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" still make me nervous with that bright color (my eyes, they tremble!) And turn "Quartier Latin" silver into a gold prison. Beautiful <br /> <br /> Yes, these are some pretty small films. <br /> <br /> Now let's come to the content. I like so much (and I mean a lot) that very successfully felt like eclecticism. Your two shorts do not have the same theme or treatment and I think the formula is formulable enough to look good and deep inside the skirt. I came from a simple love story as a social commentary on a terrorist comedy in a humorous comedy with the crazy-Chinese-music-in-Paris-barbet-scodder. I love the surprise! And these pictures have them! It's great that they got the chance to find out these direct meat is not natural in mainstream movies (which I've come to hate so much). This is not a conventional test, but I can breathe these breathing breaths. <br /> <br /> I like short time and like acting. I love simplicity and I love love. I like simple feeling and beauty and eclecticism and generally it's a movie that looks very alone or with someone very beautiful. To simply feel. It made me feel very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, well, there are two shorts for me that are not the best. - "Quais de Seine" (which may be good, sure, and even necessary, but feels like a commercial too much?) And "nail-lautage" Although I love acting, I think its themes were compulsory. But of course, I just "Tour Eiffel" I do not even love, but I think it's a very different sensitivity to Sylvester Chemette? I do not know that there is a special interest for this film, who already know the actors and managers, and so they may be happy with their interaction (find out Alexander Pine in the wonderful role) and basically "this director will do this with?" Great question. I've enjoyed it a lot this way. <br /> <br /> I repeat now: I like most shorts and they all make a nice and energetic mix together. I definitely recommend it Definitely !!! So, if you love eclectic beautiful love!
