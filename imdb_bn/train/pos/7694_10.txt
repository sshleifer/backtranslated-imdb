I want to know why John Amos left this event, and how did he die again? I could not be related to everything, but sometimes they got hit at home in the problems they faced. However, did they ever get out of veto? I think the episode with black Jesus was my favorite. We got to see some of their best times. Some were not they too often. I'm willing to bring back the show. People can have the time to actually see it during the day. I do not think a movie or a new show will work. Without the main casting especially. They really made Good Times GoodTimes This is my question and comment. Thanks !!
