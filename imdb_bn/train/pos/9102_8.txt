I saw this movie at the 18th Haifa Film Festival, and I saw this year's best. On a big screen to see it (and I mean, none of the most of the movie's TV screens) always enhances the experience of the movie with a nice sound system, such as the film with your eyes and ears and shows you the picture and sucks it in the picture. <br /> <br /> The movie introduces a set of characters, which is connected to each other. Their stories transcend to certain points, and the plurality of story lines reminds me of the great Robert Olman and his extraordinary films. But the real hero of the film is clearly the city of Madrid, which provides backdrop for the whole movie. It contains letters, has pivot and roads, which they set and set the background atmosphere for all events, in all beautifully illustrated scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie is back in some themes (shoes) again. , For example), and basically the Salazar film makes it more understandable to the metaphor of the movie. She combines city's opinion with character shots, and nicely matches the feeling of scenes in the background. A set of talented actors helps him extending a wide range of characters. A wonderful example is the scene where Juan Lynne takes Anita across the road for the first time. It may not work on a small screen, but it prevents me from blowing easily on a big screen. <br /> <br /> The movie message is very positive, and accordingly, the movie is light and fun. Music is usually pop with movies, pieces of some instruments (I want to keep the soundtrack one day, though I doubt everyone). <br /> <br /> I came out together with a sensational feeling, and I will not be easily impressed (you have to take my word for it). For this more I give this movie a hard 8/10.
