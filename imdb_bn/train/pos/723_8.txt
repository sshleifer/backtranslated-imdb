Riff Randall is a scary, obscure fan of rock group; Ramno and so most students of the school. But a major proponent Mrs. Toga thinks Rock 'n' Roll has a bad effect on students, especially Ramon's music. So, when Reef finds out that he is working in the city, he leaves the class for two days to get a ticket for himself and his friends. But when Mrs. Togo discovered it, why did she actually seize the ticket? Although this has happened, Tom Roberts has been completely hit on the reef, but Riff's friend Kate Rambay feels similar to Tom. But Reef has set her eyes only on the lead singer Joe Ramone and hopes to sing with the music of this song. <br /> <br /> Have fun! Fun! Fun! Yes, okay, is not it going to move away from the main focus of 'Rock N Roll High School' ?? A disorderly, daggy romp! It was not that I had hoped, that is sure. Each of the participants of this painstaking project has spent a great time and its frozen nature shows on screen with such a glowing soul-giving power, which gives it a tremendous experience. It does not seem to be the point as it might seem as my art and plot. But watching this passionate, crazy journey that escalates in some good harmful high jeans, I just could not waste green off my mouth. It's very sticky, very sticky, frequent chaos, but it's terrible! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < . Originally, in the 1950s, suddenly a glorious tribute sticks to the clinic, and as a result of the gap between the adults and the adults, teenage touches the rebel tag (which always knows best). These features may not be particularly fresh, but they dynamically upgrade some appeals due to Gastro's treatment. There is only one thing in the film, one to go out of the bang! And they manage that job. Courtesy of 'The Ramones', who play themselves Really, could you say it's a big trendy video clip, it's all about Ramones ?? Well, most of it, however, is mostly. I see many flack towards Ramones's acting ability. This is not the musician or actors, which means that they are not about acting here, it seems that the music we are excavated. They're here to perform! Which, they provide some kickbacks with some kick ass tracks that allow the film to create a completely brilliant video. In particular, their flamboyant concert performance. There are some killer tunes from Devo, The Velvet Underground, MC5, Fleetwood Mac, Eddie and Hot Rods and some other artists like Alice Cooper. But these jumping tracks were well-equipped with carelessness and even the score was also well-worked. Especially in Mrs. Toga's view that she keeps the right mood surrounding her mind. The playful mood of the film is much more like the roller coaster side, with this intense speed in the junkies from power-based tunes and disconnected snapstick routines, sometimes to cute, tongue-in-cheek conversations. Various kinds of light and heavy gags thrown for good measurement, which I think are very enjoyable and gave it a broad range to express itself. <br /> <br /> This film should have given links to something more divine PJ Souls (well known for its performance in Halloween), who gave such a bang-up performance as Peachy Reef Randell. Other examples, for example, were Day Young, very interesting Kate Ramboo, Vincent van Paten Gaucki, Tom Roberts and Man Eglebauer, who played Clint Howard wildly. Some of the top drawer chromiums have regularly played with the fantastic curriculum of Mori Bhanov, who has led Messi Togo as an extraordinary ruler, who has supported Paul Bertell as Mr. McGree, from Dick Miller and playing a small supporting role from Dick Miller. . The enthusiastic act is quite a campie, but it goes well with the material and has some specific choices from these characters, but we despise the appropriate creator Tiger and his monitor guards. <br /> <br /> When I say 'Rock' n 'Roll High School' is a drunk hoot during an angry!
