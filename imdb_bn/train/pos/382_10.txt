Sometimes one of the best movies made! That's why it got a rating of 7.6 a mystery. America Black Experience This image is a window in the world. All white people should be shown compulsory for all children over 10 years of age. I should recommend viewing it as a companion piece "The Long Walk Home". If you think Hypie Goldberg works again in "Homer Edi" or "Hollywood Square". Do not miss this movie, which will win Oscar. (And read the book too!)
