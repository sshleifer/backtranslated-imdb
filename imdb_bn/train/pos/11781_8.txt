The documentary presents a basic theory about "guns, germs and steel". This series graphically portrays different episodes in support of theory and protects theories against common criticism. <br /> <br /> I am deeply amazed by the complainant's comments about the lack of new information in this series. They present information which is taught in the documentary middle school. Actually, it does. In fact, I enjoyed the original view of the information that I got from the middle school and the unexpected analysis. So, if you want to know why things work, if you try on the telephone, to determine how it works, how do the farm work and how to feed the cow, you go to the farm. Enjoy the series. A specific recommendation.
