I did not read this book, but through the film I was unconscious with the sole thought of my head: this is Vongut I have never seen a writer, all the intelligence and life behind the novel's work, which has translated so well into the film. This movie has the same complexity as Vongut's novels: Jokes were often meaningful and symbolic, and dramatic events and symbols were often jokes. <br /> <br /> Campbell is also very vulnerable character, Nolte fully illustrated by Nick. All of Vongut's "heroes" had him: the lack of concern for political borders, uninterrupted dark humor in response to pressure, and the reluctance to reveal the reality of the people around him. <Br/> <br /> Overall, I was surprised to see this movie. Like the first Vongut novel, the "cat padle" was the same feeling of reading, as it was the most strange thing that could happen, he thought, and made it real and important. Yes, there is nothing in the army's surplus "White Christmas" album. So it goes!
