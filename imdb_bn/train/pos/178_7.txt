The "Protocol" hit-miss-miss, which features GolfOne as a bubble cocktail waitress, who saved an Arab traveler's life from one attempt to kill one night. Women immediately became a celebrity, and got a new job done for the US government. Will the power constraint of our country's capital ever be the same? Although "Protocol" is not as funny as its best movie "Private Benjamin", Haunan is as nice as normal But it's still a good movie, and I'm laughing too much. <br /> <br /> *** (find four)
