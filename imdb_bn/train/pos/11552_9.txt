Here is another movie which really does not require a recommendation. It's a classic comedy, very fun and entertaining and, of course, has finally inspired a successful television series, which many feel better (I personally enjoy both). <br /> <br /> For some people, it is difficult to warm Jack Lemon and Walter Motha as Flex UniGars and Oscars Madison when fed to milk on TV shows played by Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or possibly the opposite). But what we found in both cases was four good actors, who felt so much like their film opponent in real life that they were able to create these characters themselves. This is what Nicole Simon's ridiculous element is, and where the laughs are really raised. <br /> <br /> Those who never listen to Odid's cauliflower, it is a neurotic and deceitful dry-ficus (Lemon) whose long-lasting wife was cut out of 12 years of marriage and her drunken and completely illicit friend (manu) in Manhattan apartment. It took place at its residence. Placing these two unexpected roommates together in the same four walls makes some very interesting predictions.
