When I saw this movie I was with my father. He encouraged me to see this movie because it was his darling. Immediately after watching the movie became my darling. <br /> <br /> There are two brothers running across a river, who choose each other different ways of life. Norman McIlan (Craig Schaffer) is the oldest of two brothers and he set the way for education. Paul McLane (Brad Pitt) is a rebel younger brother who travels the full path to obstacles. The film follows this character as everyone follows their own path. <br /> <br /> There is no harm to this movie. You will be entertained through the whole way. Acting, instructions, and scripts are all perfect. Two exceptional issues are cinematography and scores. The world has created Robert Redford for you. <br /> <br /> It is set as a classic around a great movie around. It sure is my book. If you have not seen this movie, you can see it as soon as possible because it will be with you forever.
