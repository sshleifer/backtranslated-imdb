One of the best documentaries released in recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998, with support from Venezuela's majority of the majority of supporters in Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, a coup briefly dropped Chavez. At that time, Irish filmmaker Kim Bartley and Donna O'Brien were in Caracas, who painted a documentary about Chavez for British television. Their film supersedes the coup and subsequent events and electrically records the history published inside and outside the state palace. <br /> <br /> 3 Chavez aimed to liberate Venezuela from free-market policies employed in the United States. Although Venezuela was already owned state-owned, it used to run personal benefits by executives who wanted to replace the whip. <br /> <br /> 4. Despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier, Venezuela has fallen into poverty, its resources have literally gone away by foreign multinationals. <br /> <br /> 5. Before the disclaimer, the documentary started as Chavez's first year as president. It focuses on its popularity with the poor and its policies become popular in the working class locals (educational plans, oil revenue distribution, grass value democracy etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great supporter of education, and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, educating and understanding children and adults. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chavez came to power, he promised to reconsider the oil profit immediately. This, understood, made the oil company nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media-war broke down. Six private TV stations began to oppose the state television station. They question Chavez's purpose, sanity and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9 Without media support, the coup has not been successful. The film makes it clear that the coup relies heavily on media for disseminating information, and the news is easily made. <br /> <br /> 10. Under "Rebuilding Democracy", the opposition party had destroyed the state television station, the national election board, the Supreme Court, and the National Assembly broke down and took control of the army. <br /> <br /> 11. The interests of money supported by the military elites (encouraged by the US and CIA), organized citizens' procession in the presidential palace to influence the coup. Chavez fired the supporters on Saturday, but edited personal media station footage so that it seems that the firefighters were targeting the opposition party that it actually changed safely. <br /> <br /> 12. Chavez supporters firing police firing, street bleeding! <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, held hostage, rejected the resignation Of course, after the media / government said a lie, he resigned, but members of Chavez's cabinet gave the truth to the international community, which eventually sent a message to Venezuela via cable TV. <br /> <br /> 14. The people got up, they put the return of the President who was elected, who could only constitutionally replace a referendum. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - For more than an hour, this dock is very small. Despite this, it is a harmful part of the journalism and the size of the "media warfare" which rarely touches. "Algiers Wars" makes a great companion piece from. <br /> <br /> One view price.
