I had to give this image 10 because the black viewers were so scattered that they failed to do. This video was rejected by all the video whore-clerk, and it excluded gangster, rappers, and dirty language. It examines many relationships between doctors, African Americans, and African American male / female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshed level. I was quite impressed with the mix of light-humorous films with several difficult difficult and heavy issues. The movie will make you feel happy and sad all at the same time. I saw it at the Boston Film Festival. It premiered AMC LOUUS in Boston and I really hope this movie will make it to a great audience. Black people (and everyone else) would love such a movie - if only the industry had enough SMART for them! <br /> <br /> - If you are a doctor, a resident, a medical student, a former student, a doctor, a doctor's doctor, a family doctor, or a doctor at the time of a great doctor - they liked this movie too. Will do It is realistic and portrays the practice in real life, which is greatly appreciated by the doctors, residents and medical students of the film. Dennis Cooper is completely domiciled in internal medicine- so he definitely applies his knowledge / experience to the film and that is widely evident.
