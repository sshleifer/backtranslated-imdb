All right, this movie is stupid. Although I mean a good way It was stupid on purpose, and was one of the best "stupid" movies I saw. Junk and Gaga intentionally bad, but it delivered a way that has hit all the right notes with me. Supporting letters were quite shallow and medium. A beautiful weak plot, but it works just fine. <br /> <br /> Attention here is the character of Elvira. She is loving and comfortable. Camcorder Petersen has an acting talent in the world that this movie just glows. Above that acting talent was definitely stunning, which he had physical qualities. Some men might disagree with that. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Comedy fans, and recommendations for beautiful women fans. I wish they were able to make a dozen more LVA movies.
