This is an inferior Doku-drama that does not cover any new space, revisits all the clich√©s and gets drunk with the events. For example, Munich is a very flat city. Then why are the hills in the movie? For example, in 1918 the end of the great war was not a surrender but a war. Yet it was announced as a surrender. For example, European news vendors do not shout (and not) the title as they hawk their papers. Yet this harsh American custom film is engaged. For example, the German Eagle did not accept until the Nazis took power, but it was in Lekto when Hitler provided one of his stem winds. In fact, this despair is more than a Hitlerian commentator. In the movie Humphrey Hoffbrhaus, the Beer Holder's cellphone was matched with the legend that made the mythology last forever. It was not. Robert Carlin made a subtle screenplay of his subject. But its supporters throw at the best stage and often not enough. This commentary is based only on the first episode. One would expect the second only to be good but it does not fire.
