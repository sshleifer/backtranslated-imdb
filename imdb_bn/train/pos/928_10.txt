I've seen most of the series I did not manage to watch on television, but unfortunately, I started a job that worked in the evening. I could catch some of its recordings, at least ... and, of course, bought the recently released DVD of the entire series. Seeing the DVD, you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first, but after the pilot was completed, they released a rough number of errors. Voice letters are well suited, and nice to write. Regenerating adult themes, it refreshes the animation instead of bringing it back to its roots. Things are, with the coming of the society in the last century, to be recognized as your adult-based show, you have to be more ample by this today's standards. Characters have very realistic personality and we are often placed in parallel situations in what life is experiencing. This is your ideal seatcom, but the laughs you expect from night-to-night television shows such as talk show skits or Saturday Night Live ... when SNL was actually fun. Well done, dreamworks Perhaps you have to work with more liberal networks to continue this series ... and to improve the marketing of goods in order to help determine its higher prices for the series. Although it is a challenge to do this for cartoons of a mature nature. Hmmm ...
