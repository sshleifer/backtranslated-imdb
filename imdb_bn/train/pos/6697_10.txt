I think Sabrina is first seen when she came to TV on IVV on ITV1 13/14 I now 24 and still I love it as much when I saw it first. I still get a small stick from some of my friends to see "a kids show" but I do not care! My personal favorite character as Lil Caroline Rhea "Hilda" and later became one of my favorite characters in Morgan. At the TV station Nikiloden in the United States, I spend a lot of time watching Sabrina to attend special ceremonies. I love Melissa Joan-Heart, he "Clarissa explains all" but so good. When they decided to finish it, I was lost! I hope I will soon release DVD here in the UK - I will be the first in line! Lol x
