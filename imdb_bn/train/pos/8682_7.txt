I'm sorry to disagree with other people in this Columbus episode. Death lends me a hand of a boring Columbo type in my hand. After several times, I changed bored and changed the channel. I still love Robert Kullap and Patricia Crowley and Raymond in their roles, but the story of this episode was weaker than others. First, an investigator plays for Robert Kool R. Ray Milland. He appointed Patricia Crowley to investigate his young beautiful wife, as if she did not see anything. Then, the character of Kulpi blackmails the deceiving wife, who plans to reveal her plan to her husband by destroying her career. Outside the rage, the kulp hit his face and killed him by setting up the body somewhere else. I do not know. Maybe I just do not care about this one. Of course, Colombo finally gets him. That's exactly how the question is.
