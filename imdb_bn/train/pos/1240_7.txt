Eddie Murphy is a man named Chadler Jerele, who gave time to find lost children. When Charlotte Lewis enters her life, she tells him that she is a selected person and she must find out the Golden Child. Suspicised and driven entirely by passion and plot, Jerele is involved without realizing the start of a sensual journey, which is dangerous and the worst among all, the monster Sardo Numpa. <br /> <br /> What is the Golden Child her time? It meant that I was popular with Golden Child for Eddie Murphy and late 1980's. In this decade, I can remember how much entertainment this movie gives to people, it was box office at 79,817,937, it was the 8th largest earner of 1986, but in the 80's, it became a matter of denial of Eddie Murphy's photographs due to pale emotions. Comedy accolades that they once were once. Golden Child does not upload with more than 80 morphy images like trading space and Beverly Hills Copp, but after reviewing this movie recently, I personally found that it's the best of its advertising, kidding and charming !, seriously! <Br /> <br /> In 1981, the Golden Child hit all the required styles, being monetized by a legend recovered and idle through a fantasy action formula by Riders of the Lost Ark. Fantastic girl, a brave hero with a quip in his surgery, dancing villain {Charles Dance, so I can kiss him English}, a cute kid with wonderful color and mysterious powers, the film simply tells you to be involved in fun. Do not divide her price and digress as an enormous fantasy picture. Yes CGI giant now looks creaky, and yes 80, 90 and even after that there was a lot of good pictures, but if you agree with the disrespectful rating of 5 here on this site, you can take this style a bit, serious, serious. 7/10
