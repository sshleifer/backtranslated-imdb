Actually I was surprised to have had many comments about this movie. I saw it as part of a Savvy film festival in a large American university. But someone in USA heard it, which is really shy! The mobility in humans is what it's both fun and sad They have a long bus trip stuck together - most of us have been !! But I did not have such a thing !! <br /> <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is for funerals where they will stop. Then the men and women are sneaking for some love in the woods, but everyone can see them without following them! Just as she picked up her skirt and she has entered all the way - started hacking malicious and they realized that everyone is watching !! Surprise! But ... if you are really happy, you still have to feel for them! When you see the end, they ridicule that they enjoy themselves! Serve humor is the best!
