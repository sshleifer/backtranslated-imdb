Drunken Myanmar player as Arthur Bachch, Doodle Moore is perfect as an old man stuck in childhood. As it turned out, the role Moore fits so perfectly, it trapped him as an actor. Many disappointments follow soon (including the pale sigela of this film), but it does not diminish the shiny or appeal of this photo, which is written and directed glossy. Moore's drunk is forced into some scenes, parts of the film are stroller, but Cast is so happy that it's a tough movie to prevent. This is a very big heart and Oscar winner John Gilgood, as Arthur Vector, Hobson, plays a dry, dry role; His relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a miraculous relationship. Lisa Minerali (as an interest in a blue-collar love) Sassie and Moore are sharp in a low-key, but stupid and vivacious; He did not shake Arthur's shadow, but at least in our career, this document is in high-point. *** *** to ***
