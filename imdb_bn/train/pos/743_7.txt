This work has hit the right illustration of teenage life during his execution. Although it was a broad generalization, even then parents of that time were self-absorbed from their parents, and many were confused with the real problems of those at home, where their children were worried. <br /> <br /> This movie also teaches us how painful it is, and it is a sweet, sad, but known style that Foster feels his pain in his philosophical way. I liked that scene. It was actually my favorite scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> The funeral is meant to give life to the marriage, and we must also do it. Beyonce skateboarding and torture by Guano's pack meant to tell us that the annoying times will pass, and we want to get better time through them. <br /> <br /> The full metaphor "," and the procession of life, appears throughout the film, and ultimately helps us to give hope. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, though I do not see it often <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
