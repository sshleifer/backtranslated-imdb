I did not really see the majority of Colombo movies ... In fact, I think I only saw one or two, outside of this one. I always liked the Colombo, however, even since she does not show much to her. Peter Faul and his appearance, his voice and his charm have always been the perfect choice for letters due. Its perfect proof is that although this series was first introduced in 1968, the last (and perhaps not the last) of the films was created in 2003. It's 35 years. When Fakk returned to 40, he was 40. There are 68 photos in the series (if my countdown does not stop), which is made for all TVs. Everyone knows the character, though no one has ever seen his picture in the movie. If you ask me, that's quite an achievement. The plot is pretty good. The only problem with me is that the killer and murders were published very early in the beginning (though it can be similar to all Colombo films), without any mystery, but how Colombo solves it, it gets a bit lower (because there is more to look at the end of the film Nothing). Panning is good, there are rarely a scene where you're disturbed. The acting is very good, especially that of Folk and Ruth Gordon. There is some big exchange of dialogues in the film. Characters are well written and reliable. Dialogs and scripts are unusually good for a TV-movie. Above all, the film is yes, surprisingly good for a TV-movie, and certainly valuable for a fan of Colombo and / or crime / mystery fixes. 8/10
