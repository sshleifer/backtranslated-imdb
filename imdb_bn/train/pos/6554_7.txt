Okay, what I say is: <br /> <br /> The movie was nice. I have a great Nancy fan and I have all read 1-56 original books and I went to read more. I'm not 96 now. This film is a bad movie than the villains, beware of villains. All the sources point to an amazing movie! I like the whole thing. So what is the current time of Nancy He is still like the old fashion book! Those who did not read more than 5 books, complained about Nancy's views. I read them all and I think Emma was perfect and Nancy was perfect. I found the spooky part of the movie. I like exciting car charging and get the guide. I like the formula. I solved the mystery itself! It was really wonderful. I recommend that you have seen that the complainants do not know anything about it. This is a good movie and about nancy drew b. Go see it. It's Oscar worthy but its not really a good movie.
