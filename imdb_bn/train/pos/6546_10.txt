I'm probably one of the biggest Nansy Drew fans out there. I've read every book three times and I've played a lot of games. I love this movie. It keeps you entertained for the whole time you saw it. I took about 10 friends and everyone liked it. There were three women sitting behind us who had appeared in the 40's in the early 30's and I asked them how they liked it, they said they liked it! So you see it will be an entertainment of all ages. You just have to give a chance. And it also teaches a lesson, while you are all alike, take yourself up with yourself. So overall, this step was great. I'm going to see the second time now! So please stop bashing it. This is a really good movie!
