To be honest, I first saw this movie when I did not like it. But I think the problem I have not seen in the theater. Big mistake Because Cliffhanger # 1 view the settings and # 2 cinematography. Try to watch this movie as the biggest TV possible and a great sound system. Music is good and keeps the movie at a high level (and a commercial potential). The sooner I see, the more I like it. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of Ronnie Harleen's best films. This guy knows about the action. Hard moth 2, good kiss goodbye, etc. And this movie is particularly good at this. Special effects are great and spectacular. Stellen really needed the movie to get back to success. Good to see him!
