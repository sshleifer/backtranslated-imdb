In my opinion, this is a good example of this movie which could be better than that of less than 10 years ago. I suspect it will benefit from modern technology, but it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70 if it looked much better. <br /> <br /> The artists and animated did a great job. In my opinion, this film can be proud of one of the best background art and best character designs. Animation is very smooth and realistic. For the duration of the film, you believe the world that you've done a great job. This sexistist can make one of the female animated characters barbarous, if they are not the most, they usually easily make anime girls easily. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are two bad thin skins about this movie which will not make it so appeals at the moment. First, plot and execution are comparable to contemporary adventure movies, and it is old by modern standards. Secondly, due to the duration, it will benefit greatly from additional 20 minutes of dialogue. Finally, the setting is not so popular at this time. Conclusion: Connery is a great alternative to other short stories about Barbarian, but not novels.
