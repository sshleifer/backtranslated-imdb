I read that it is not good, the story is not hard, that Volckman feels he has failed in some way. <br /> <br /> I disagree. First, it is well executed. Volcmans are doing a good job only to try a new strategy, but to keep a focus that is considered valuable: will immortality reduce the value of life? Big question ... <br /> <br /> I can see that he is working hard to build a feeling, and he is not compromising. This is appreciated. I'm sure it's an interesting exercise to create letters of a form. I have seen artists reducing the minimum one form to build a moment's intensity. I marked this photo with this. Also, it is more interesting than Richard Lincoln's rot-scoping, and the story of Olcoman is more meaningful than the stories of the next drug addiction of Linklater. Old news Everyone knows it, but nobody does anything about it. Renaissance is also there, for some new ideas. And there are many more stories that work well with load loads among people. <br /> <br /> Well, Volcano. Really nice job
