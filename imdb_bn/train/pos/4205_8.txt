Samuel Fuller is rarely one of America's greatest directors. I'm not sure he's qualified as a great artisan of Hollywood. But he is sure to be with Hughlode's true professionals, who are interested in going to their own music. When he worked for the Hollywood studio, how he would accept an assignment, give him the shape of the small particle, and then quickly and efficiently turn it into something better than his parts ... in time and budget. A case of pickup points in the south street. Under the sponsorship, it is one of Hollywood's first 'Anti-comedy' films, appeals to patriotism, complete with a tough protagonist and a thin (and charmingly impressive) bad guy. This full-fledged Hollywood clinic makes this bag an exciting, exciting play with any number of off-the-counter twists on the go. The hero, Macau McCoy, lost a few times, with a soft finger, a little miser, which does not change his strip until the end. The copper girl, Candy has quality levels that you can take if you are so interested. One of the most striking characters, M. Williams, is a studio. And in the unusual way of Hollywood war against the committee, patriotism appeals to deaf ears; The hero is not so inspired by ennobling. She just wants a payback for a personal cause, and the wind is becoming up ... for at least now ... a good guy. <br /> <br /> Plus, most actors have mostly employed Fuller by studio. He'll have to. Richard Weidmarch now established his presence as an actor and star, but Gene Peters is a surprise. She gives a woman a stupendous portrait of sexy and fool, and her boy friend ... or not better than her clients ... want to be her. Richard Kelly is convinced and nasty after being twice the winner of Tony Award at Broadway. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A subway car looks ahead with a great economy, followed by the Feds and Commies, finds itself with a purse instead of cash and instead of cashing in with microfield secrets. The whole enterprise, with a classic silent look, only takes 80 minutes to say. In dialogue with Fuller as a screenwriter, that party is pure, partly sharp-to-high decoration fantasy style. "That muffin grifted to you ... He's OK," says a character who avoids candy. Fuller shifted us to the next scene and quickly moved to the scene with a very fast speed. Then Fuller Moy dropped the character of William Williams. Suddenly, the story seems to be part of a whole new level of interest, part comedy relief and part of the tragedy is inevitable. <br /> <br /> What I like about the movie is how the illustration of the fuller genius and the example of the power. Within 2 minutes and 15 seconds, starting at the right after the credit, Fuller to get the movie immediately, what to put in us about the story, and our kind of characters - Skip and Candy - we are able to show. Going to be involved with. And he did this with the interest of so much interest in this hot, packed subway car that we could only feel the hook's setting to catch us. <br /> <br /> Glenn Ericsson says, one of the best movie critics in my opinion, "There should be an inconsistent story, Sam Fuller defines his outstanding view of Americanism: Strong throat, when fully in aggressive interest It is disclosed that anyone acknowledges what is wrong and what is right and is not afraid to fight for it. Always in his work, who is the best for the country Fought hard, they are less likely to benefit from this effort. "He is right, and it is a movie after 55 years is still lively.
