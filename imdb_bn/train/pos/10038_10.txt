Titanic will be one of my favorite movies of all time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, why not? "I know many people who do not like this movie, and I'm not saying why I can not see." Love story is very cheesy "Well, yes but it's enjoyable and not moving? Well, the story of love between Jack and Rose is very unreal, Everyone knows that love does not really exist, but it's a movie, not everyone enjoys seeing beautiful stories that allow us to imagine a little bit? Next complaint , DickPrio and Winslet horror actors. + Well, in this film, I agree that they do not fulfill their full potential, but I think they do not seem to be terrible actors. + I personally think they are very talented actors, who unfortunately Very famous for a movie, they are not unusual, but their given roles are easy, and the characters are quite real It is said that you can take great care about them, but I agree with many people that they could not do anything they could not. <br /> <br /> Finally, if someone complains that they do not like this movie because they I hate romance, or because they hate history, or unfortunate movies, I'm sorry but why did they go to the world and found a movie that they all Riskara. This is a bad movie like those who are complaining of knight because they hate action movies. Just for a movie, because you do not like this genre, it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Suitable for her Oscars, especially the best cinematography, which I have always found as the best in the movie Lord of the Ring Trilogy. <br /> <br /> I know some writing has failed, such as screaming each other across movies. The flashback section of the story may be weak several times, but overall it's a remarkable achievement in the fact that the look of the Titanic looks so epic and sinking. <br /> <br /> I understand why many people dislike this film, but in most cases it dislikes the basic concept of them, as it is a love story, but it is not bad to think about them and make themselves in the movie. <br /> <br /> I told you that I have read five books of Titanic, this includes the day it happened with memory, and this film preserves very few historically accurate errors. The only main thing I find is that the piping should be copper, copper and thread, and the ice seems to be roughly unreasonable, where they hit it. <br /> <br /> I give this image 10/10, because I do not like romance movies, but only this is an extraordinary cinematic achievement, which feels frightened by the realistic adaptation of events.
