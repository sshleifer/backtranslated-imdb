Core blimey This picture really surprised me as it's a comedy masterpiece. Billy Zen is stunning as the main character, and the trick is natural and easy to be easy to manage it directly to everyone. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is really good, and a joy to see the set pieces. I recommend that you see this companion with a bunch of companions, some bottles of your favorite wine, and will be amazed and ready to be very entertaining. <br /> <br /> It carries so much from Kitch masterpieces like Plan 9. From the outer space it is true "B" film tradition. But more than that, the qualifications of people participating in this film. For example, Ron Perlin. I'm still apparently finding myself tied up, where Jane lowered down a set of steps for an apparent ballet style. All bits are crazy, and it's all good for it.
