Mardi Grass: Made in China, provides amazing, complex connections through gravity making and ticking in popular soils, nudity, and globalization. I have seen this movie at the International Film Festival of Boston and hoped for a dry globalization, but what I found is an impressive view of the threatening footage from both China and the United States. Eye-opening films are ridiculous, deeply, serious, non-patronized and leave you as much more as a credit role. It's more valuable than a shooter - it's just good. China's young women workers have different perspectives and have been surprised by the discipline of the owner. The rollers highlights during the carnival, but only this beautiful film describes without mentioning deep inside the factory in China. Filmmaker Bravo is acting for the trip! I never thought of connection between Gem, China, and New Orleans; Now I think about human connectivity in almost every object, but about globalization, discrimination, and fun roles. More importantly, I can create these links without feeling guilty after watching this movie, which I have seen in comparison to other movies worldwide.
