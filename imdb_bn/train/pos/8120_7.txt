Things to come is an elementary psi file that shows an imaginary world, or "everywhere," for 100 years. You can break it into about 4 different scenes or parts. The film was expanded from 1940 to 2036, and mainly because the ruler or "boss" wanted to gain the ability to fly in airplanes, after all the bomb blasts in the city and after the war broke out <br /> <br /> <br /> < There are about 3 errors: its audio is weird and there are some jokes on the video, the characters are not deep and the overall plot is not completely strong. The plot is something I can not put on my finger ... it seems to be a little "sculptor". But if you love science-fees and are interested in what happened next to HG Wells, then it must be seen later. It's only valuable to know what everyone was afraid: a long, intense war, because they were going to fight with Germany, and there was a threat to biological weapons and everything. <br /> <br /> Things are a beautiful picture that most people once have to watch.
