"Pecker" proves that Waters has no intention of changing its tacky way to its old age. Waters has changed since the 1960s when filming began, but after 40 years he did whatever he wanted to do. Over the years, there has been a significant increase in the film budget of the Water. This is one of his most recent productions, but I was surprised to wonder that Waters still has "trailer-park" touch. Edward Furlong plays the packer, which is covered with a picture. He lived a lot with Baltimore, MD, his friends and family. But the pecker draws attention to a New York Art Agent (always watching Lily Taylor), and her life changes for the worst. Again, Waters makes art, fame, and discriminatory behavior fun. This is not one of his best movies, but here are some big stomach laughs ("Memam" is the best line in the film!). It's consistently cute and funny, and its very "curly" sensitivity that I love in Withers' film.
