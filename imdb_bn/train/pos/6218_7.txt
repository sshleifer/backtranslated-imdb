79/100 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are nothing but a great movie together. Although this is not one of their best, it is an excellent musical instrument. Some awesome musical numbers from Randolph Scott, have good support. Two notable appearances, Betty Grable and Lucille Ball make memorable early screen performances. Especially good to the ball, and a blonde as well. The best number of song pairs of "let's face the music and dance" song. Harriet Hillerd, known as the Harriet Nelson of "Og and Harriet", the Raiser's sister The basic plot is quite familiar, but with this exceptional one cast, it works. Excellent industry direction and scores.
