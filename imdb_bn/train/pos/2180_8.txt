Louise Brooks gives this well-made French melodrama a wonderful performance. He played a typist named Lucien, who, despite the love of a person named Andr√©, dreamed about his position in life. She looks for a beautiful competition for Miss Europe, but when she enters, Andrey Prachanda becomes angry, then he withdraws. He was nominated for Miss France and then became known as the Chief Sponsor, for his discovery, he is only trying to get his entry back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film is strongly portrayed by director Augusto Genina and the movie theologian Rudolph Matt and Lewis Nieter. The film's style '30's' looks like modern movies than Hollywood's Flickr, and shows different styles employed by Europeans. Most are quick cut and travel shots, mostly done with efficiency and valves. The high power of the first third of the movie has diminished slightly in the middle but in the last 15 minutes it comes back again. <br /> <br /> The performance of all the principals was very good, but Luis Brooks is particularly memorable. Though Louise leans heavily on his silent screen skills, although it is a baggage, but his silent style was a wonderful contemporary, feeling understated, he makes talkies very good transition. Fair's long-standing scene was particularly stupid, because Luis used his extraordinary clear eyes to reveal his unhappy and bizarre feelings, which he did not want anymore. I doubt it has ever been better. <br /> <br /> The picture is a fantastic finish, luxurious shot, powerful and stylish build. This is actually the best thing in the early part of the film. And the tragic story, the final acting role for Luis Brooks, is only to identify greater tragedy. She was not only a great beauty who looked gorgeous in a swimsuit, she really threw away all those who really played a major acting genius. We are all poor for him. <br /> <br /> This image is g. Wow It is less familiar with his German films. Pabst, but I think it's a good one. I think this is better than the story by Cruz Pasteur, and Prabts films in Prix de Wind can have a profound moral complexity, but it is much easier to follow and overall more organized and focused work. And it does not hurt the parts of Lewis's song, not by Edith Pfeif. At the bottom, it is a classic Louis Brooks movie which is looking good.
