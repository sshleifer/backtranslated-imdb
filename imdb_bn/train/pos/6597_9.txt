We always look at American films, with their special pronunciation of each region (south, west, etc.). We have the same here. Americans and Europeans often keep the cinematographic industry as well as other foreign people must watch this film and keep an open mind for acceptance of another culture. <br /> <br /> This movie is telling us about parallel world which it is not even figured for those who live in a big city like Sao Paulo. All actors are improvising and they are very realistic. The camera invites us to share the concept of their confusing world, the loneliness of each character, and the sharing of their world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie and the worst rental is even at home.
