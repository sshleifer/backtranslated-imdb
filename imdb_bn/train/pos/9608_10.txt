If you have not seen this movie then I highly recommend you. This is a wonderful truth story. I love Alison Lohmann She is a very gifted side note: I also love her in 7th heaven. The story of the whole story is amazing and the way they liked the characters waz is terrific. Acting in this film <br /> <br /> Very awesome.
