Boris and Bela work well together in this movie, whether they are against each other, or padding the same boat. I saw it in 1972 and bought it from this year's borders. This time I saw it with my kids, I noticed two things: it has 3, 4 and 5 years old attention; And when I grabbed a few things I saw it first. Very fast story with an unforgettable end. Must be for a movie buffs !!!
