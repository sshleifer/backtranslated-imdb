I have been deeply moved by this movie in many cases. First of all, I just want to say that Clara was the most valuable little thing! Such a beautiful little girl. His performance was fantastic as well. The truth of life and the very people. Although I do not like the part that he was smoking; I hope it is only a fake phenomenon. In both ways, he was absolutely wonderful and the story was so moving. I found myself submerged in the story and its character. <br /> <br /> I really came to discover this movie. I was walking on the blockbuster and I trembled to walk and noticed his beautiful smile. Thankfully, I looked down at the bottom and saw this movie! I thought to myself, 'Fear, look at him!' So I picked it up and saw that this movie was described as an excellent thing such as "Bit James". I read the plot behind and then thought, well, maybe I'll look at it at the earliest of IMDB and then I'll come back and rent it later. I'm not happy, because I was certainly missing. After searching for a movie with my friend, I knew that I would apologize for not hiring this movie, so I went back to the place where I basically found it and snapped it. <br /> <br /> It was my dress for the week, since the school started for me this week and I have no time to look at it, but there was a perfect chance tonight. I popped it up and beautiful cinematography, delightful scores and intrigues to move from start to finish were glued. I was so silent and would say, some part of me often took me to tears. <br /> <br /> I would like to make special mention for Juan Jos√© Balestra's young boy in this movie. She was extraordinary. Carroll's father's acting actor is unfortunately not listed on this site. His voice was just so loving and gentle that I really could understand his love for Carol. Though not his face, I really felt the presence of his character. <br /> <br /> This is really a wonderful movie. If you are a person who is light, but removed by emotional movies, it's definitely the one for you.
