Another test review by Stardust (originally written on June 15, 2007) <br /> <br /> The marketing machine has just started for such a thing (any site? Still?), So I suspect that many of you have heard about it. Verily, I was not (sort of). When I got the post, I thought it was another code name and it was really worried that it was a transformer, one of the movies I do not want to see, so I enjoy it 100% as a free movie-gear . It was launched, it was not a transformer and I was aware of it coming back as 'Neil Guyman movie'. What about this Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. More than that and I will provide the plot information that (a) contracts the breach, and (b) your fun losses. If you really want to know about it, go buy books. There are rumors, Gaimean can be a writer. <br /> <br /> It is a strange thing to know about what movie is expected to be if it is great. And for this one, it was certainly. The screening was 'special', not only to movie critics, but to the viewers (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local science-fan / fantasy people were included. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, I knew what I wanted to expect with this crowd and Stardust title. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was a sweet mistake <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a fairy tale, a famous writer in the comic bookstore. But it was not the Lord of the Rings. It was not even another Lord of the ring Wannabe (Ahhem, Eragon). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is certainly a romantic story, but with the generous splashes of humor. And that sort of comic Shrekism is not that sort of. It's more along the dramatic line than comedy. Before I go, review this movie is not the thing. <br /> <br /> Acting, very little, good. It seems to be more difficult than fantasy films, but I believe that there was a remarkable acting role. Michelle Pfieffer, sad, one of those. She plays a villain, and she works. Nothing special Rupert Everett, though, was a real quarrel. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole, well, Peter Frein O'Toole - which is incredible. Ricky shows how to throw Girviss thoroughly and why. Robert De Niro was having a lot of fun in most cases. Although he wanted to supply the product, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) Was amazing from a man like the main character, I've never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes. Claire Dance Claire Dance I have always mixed opinion with him. She might be great, and then she might miss the mark. This, he's a former And he, quite literally, this photo star. Of course, his pronunciation stumbles here and there. And, yes, he does not have Cox's view as well as he might be. But ... well, look for yourself. <br /> <br /> Special effects have become silly, and only important where they should be. Still the best flying ship - sorry Potter. The direction is light-hearted and pretty flowing. Cinematography may be better but not every movie in New Zealand. All other top brackets <br /> <br /> And now that's done ... <br /> ... writing. Oh, writing! Blue, you are the devil It's hard to do some basic work in today's climate and at first, you start to wonder. A state, a dead king, a boy has his own worth, witches, ghosts, a search (or three) out of evidence - what's new? But the story of Gaeman captures only with its surface contact to divide you into a sweet original story of his son's heart and heart. And, though you suspect how you are going to remove it, but you are surprised by the third thing and - if you find me - find yourself and wait for the best. Ultimately, you will find this story, this movie, which should be all the fairy tales, but not all are often. <br/> <br /> (I hope I can talk about Septimus vs. Tristan, but I will not destroy it for you. Make sure to rest for those who can read the book, it is done correctly.) <Br /> < br>> Those who later said I had the same impression. A great movie to enjoy for all generations and new {WITHHELD} for this generation. After the film is widely released, it becomes just empty because, well, you expect it. When you walk, you know, anyway. I sincerely hope the Stardust will not be lost in TrentPole. Even if that is so, I would be glad to push the hands of everyone I know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm late for a few years, but ... "a great movie to enjoy for all generations and this generation New Prince Bride. " <br /> <br /> Probably a little high evaluation but I am still confident that the years will be the same, "Oh, I love this movie".
