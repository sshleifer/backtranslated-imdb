I think this movie is absolutely beautiful. And I'm not just mentioning breathtaking scenery. It is two unhappy English housewives who decide to hire Italian castles to break from their so happy home life. Finally, four women rent the space at all, each person has different personalities and there are several reasons for staying there. More than that, they are all praying for peace for the widespread place and the peace that comes from inner reflection and resolution. I find it surprising because it is a relationship that is kind and understanding is enhanced. A pleasure to see itself acting. I especially love the characters of Josie Lawrence and Lady Caroline (Polly Walker).
