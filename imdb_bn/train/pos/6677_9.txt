A film about Wannabee, made it against the ever-less and less-heroes all weird. We've heard that before. But unfortunate when the sobliver, Blue King and Mr. Forsius you know that this is not the traditional rage of your rich story. <br /> <br /> Eddie Ezard is a classic performance among DD boys. The leaders as Arch Zillen and Jeffrey Rush look into the original thinking cast. <br/> <br /> Even on the first glance of Greg Kieyner, a strange favorite happened for the role of Captain Amazing. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're a comic-astonished-film stereotypes. Why anger can not be a super power?
