"The '70s Show" is currently the fun show on TV. I started to see it almost a year ago, and as soon as I saw it I can say it was a great show. I like all the characters, but my personal favorites are Fez and Kelso. Leo was an extraordinary character when he was there, because I was really delighted because he really came back. When Fez "You are a bitch's son!" When it goes classics, and when Kelso yells "irritation!", That always makes me smile. They both have great characters and always have something interesting to say. Jackie is another reason to watch the show; She is looking really well but started out great, somewhere near the season 5-6 she really got really hot. I have seen most of the time in most of the episode, some 10 times, and still enjoyable. This is one of the few shows I can keep an eye on and still see that the first time I saw as much as I saw. Cast is classic; Almost all of the fun, where there are only few fun characters with many shows. I'll be sad after the ceremony next year, but sometimes it will be reduced to the best shows.
