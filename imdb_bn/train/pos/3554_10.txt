Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra hatten each other by hitting each other and followed this year. Brando had asked Sinatra for some music lessons, but Sinaatra (who was already puzzled about the fact that he acted as Nathan Detroit, when he wanted to participate in Sky Masters) wanted to be the star singer of this movie and he wanted anyone It will not be better. He told Brendo to get lost, so he broke the scene of Marlon Dyner to return to him. Sinatra was eating cheesecake so that he could eat, eat, and eat. In the next few years, Cinetra called Brando "Mumbles" or "Mimbumbles" because he talked.
