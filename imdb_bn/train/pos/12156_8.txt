The details of some backgrounds of this story are very, very neutral based, based on the real events of this era. This story links some of the famous Leopold and Loeb cases to Emmel McPherson. <br /> <br /> The story begins with two moms (Shell Winters and Debbie Reynolds) when they leave the court. The crowd seems to have the most intention to harm their physical cause because their boys were simply convicted of a serious thrilling crime. A crowd in the crowd obviously pushed the hands of Winters when they boarded the car waiting for them. <br /> <br /> They are threatening phone calls after reaching home, so Reynolds suggests that they both go west to the coast and open a dance school. The dance school is a success and they take care of incredibly hateful parents who think that their next Sirili temple A group of parents of these damaged children who mock with Reynolds and they start dating. Life is very well displayed. However, when threatened phone calls resume, the winters respond with shine - it behaves like going near a psychological break and he recovers more and more in religion - often listening to 'sister alma' on the radio. Again and again, you see Winter on the edge and ultimately culminates in the very worst thing !! I will not say too much because it can ruin this mysterious and interesting movie. In many cases, this movie was like many "Baby Jane?", "Straight-Jacket" and "The Nani", as in the 1960's Bett Davis and Joan Crowford's horror movies. None of these are real intellectuals, they are very entertaining and fun at a tasty level. The writing is very good and at the end some nice twists that makes it all very exciting. Wonderful and brittle lady is wonderful and Reynolds played one of the 39 year old prostitutes - plus she really can really dance. <br /> <br /> My only concern about all this is that someone might find the film's hypermarkets-firmness firmly - such as cheap attacks on Christianity At first I felt like that, but when you meet sister Alam, she feels sincere and does not mock, so I took Winters religious initiative as a sign of madness - which I guess, its purpose was. <BR> <br /> However, this movie is "Anyone Steve Auntie?" Packaged with - another Shell Winters horror movie since 1971. Both are fun ... and mostly above!
