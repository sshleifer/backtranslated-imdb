Overall this film was excellent for its time and it would be interesting for many more generations. Although the plot is not 100% accurate, but most are accurate. The movie escapes far ahead and misses some important part. I prepared and prepared the book and prepared it immediately that they made a movie (because I could not find this movie yet) but later I found the movie in a contract box at Wal-Mart and decided to buy it and see what I expected Was there. Overall, I give these movies 7 out of 10 for its good parts (relative accuracy and overall motivation sense) and its bad parts (10 big time off and small but targetable mistakes).
