First thing first, I sometimes had a child ("Little Mary" on the other side ... not fear) as this intrinsic gem. My title says that this was one of my favorite childhood films that I still love as a teenager. It is a beautiful, diverse film from Charlie, a MissFit German Shepherd who was voiced by Booney Reynolds and his boss / partner was killed in crime (name, O O Care). Charlie has been sent directly to heaven by default because "all dogs go to heaven because dogs like humans are naturally good and trustworthy and kind". Chalie has been sent back to the world because she wanders the clock in her life, where she becomes more naughty with her best friend, Ichchi and younger orphan girl Annie-Marie. I used to see all this time as a kid and I still see it sometimes. However, it is a beautiful bittersweet film that I said earlier that just could leave a tear in your eyes ...
