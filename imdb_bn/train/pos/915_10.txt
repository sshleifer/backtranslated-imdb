All the talent Mr. Suraj Barshatia showed in his first 3 films, I thought it was all a accident because his Prime Minister, the Prime Minister, was so bad. But I was not accustomed to it. This guy is talented and how he did, Vivah is just brilliant. It affects you from the first scene. The sequence between Shahid and Amrita is awesome. These two actors give glimpses between chemistry srk and kajol. As well as loving and loving father, naturally nicely spin nicely, so unmatched khair. But it is a martyr-Amrita movie. While martyrs see young people to get married, Amitabh looks good in most of the scenes, but he is a shy but still a morally good bride. This movie will be especially loved by those who have gone through such beautiful moments in their lives. All in all a bright film. Mr. Suraj Barzatania closed hat ...
