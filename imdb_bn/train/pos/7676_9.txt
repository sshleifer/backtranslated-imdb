Bright! My wife and I joined the broad line to see Holly at the Edinburgh Film Festival. After seeing the picture, I realized why there was such a long line. Holly is a touchy story about an impossible connection between two people. She is a young girl, she worn out west. The film grasped every bone of our body. It's not hard to see any graphic scenery or anything - it's the most sophisticated of the generality that actually stays in your heart. The film is shot nicely. Among others, we like the scene where Patrick Holly teaches to drive a small motorcycle. Thu Ngoyen's raw material (Cantt believes this works his first acting) and Ron Livingstone's performance stay with me for a few days. Highly recommended.
