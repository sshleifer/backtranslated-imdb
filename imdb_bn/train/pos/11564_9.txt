I have seen this picture many times and I like all bad teachers to give ten out of ten but it seems unfair for other good movies. However, I think it's one of those rare gems: a perfect comedy. It will I venture one of the greatest comic films of all time. Matthau and Lemon are perfectly combined and combined. The script is so sharp that you have to stop bleeding. The story is well known and has already been described in other comments. Two leads give extraordinary performance, girls are fantastic and split as well as the situation split. Not a word of an oath (mark Hollywood, you do not have to take an oath to be fun, you have to be different) and the space from stage to film is solitary. They do not like this anymore. Timeless
