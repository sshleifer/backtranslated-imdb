Most of the nuclear-era giant movies I've seen as a child on television - and some of them were included, Blob, the dials from me were scared. Movies like Mars from INVADERS made clear to us about "small fries" that the kids were not just as good as homework invasive; Blow is just that true iteration. I remember, surprisingly, late graduates of the body and Martian Invaders and Blobs were looking into a vague society in the underworld. During the summer time in the early 1980's, when a local science museum (Virginia on Richmond) ran a nuclear age classic every weekend. It was a 16 mm film, and mostly black and white (and there was a projector thrill) and Blob's "colorful" printing became a gradual pink - but people were fun. I dragged my mother along, and she enjoyed what I enjoyed. There, in the science museum, I really love Blob. The filmmaker's purpose was to make money - but it was the sincerity of the filmmakers to "talent" (players), which I loved in this film. Grainy? You bet Cheesy? They do not have any cheesier But, people, what a movie!
