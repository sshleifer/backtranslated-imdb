Batman: The latest animated Batman of Batwoman's Mystery Live video / DVD movie to get rid of. (The small spellers in front of) the plot revolves around a new criminal, batman, for any reason, for any reason, had to undergo surgery for surgery. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is not so good enough, 'Fantasam mask', 'sub-zero' or 'joker's return' is not as good. The main reason is that it does not stop the mental appeal of other movies. At the end of this movie, we are especially sorry for others, as we are sub-Zero. There is no real tragedy that made us specially for other animated films. Even the Batman is not really a 'tragic' character (like Mr. Fries or Fantasum). Not only that, the changed ego of Batman is so incredibly 'stern' and disrespectful that the viewer does not take care of what is happening to him, who masks him or what will happen at the end and we will not get this special mental appeal. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong, I found the movie enjoyable. It has its moments, such as when viewers actually find Batwoman and see the return of an old villain that is basically seen in 'Batman: The Animated Series'. <br /> <br /> If Batman's background was more attractive, this movie was better than the 'Return of the Joker' in my book, but for now, it's 4th (out of 4). <br /> <br /> This is similar to the New Batman Adventures from the mid-1990s for animation. The score is not as memorable as the previous 3 animated Batman films, but it is still good. <br /> <br /> I recommend buying this DVD because, despite its flaws, it is enjoyable. But remember, this is not as good as other Batman animated movies. <br /> <br /> 7/10
