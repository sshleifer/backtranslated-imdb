I really like Tom Berman's AWTWB. You just have to let it come on you and enjoy it while it continues, and do not expect anything. It sits in a cafe with a beer, in the summer sun, and people go by. It's definitely not going to keep pondering after you, it's true, but it's not a prerequisite for a good film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> and I like the movie's style, or flyer. It's chic, but fresh, and a beauty of soundtrack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />)
