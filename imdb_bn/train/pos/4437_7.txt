This police system is worse than many others in its era and is better than several. It is obviously being followed in the footsteps of "dragnet" and "nude city" but it appears as an enjoyable programmer. The best thing about it is that it's a weird look that has gone on for a long time ... The lower square is in 40/50 in New York. Here it is all its poisonous glory, from old school tattoo parlor to smooth spots in cheaper hotels. These old police movies are like a pre-era itinerary and are very upset about any person who dislikes the scenes of today's Sanitizer, Sylces City. <br /> <br /> It is also a crime to emphasize the scientific approach to solving brown and bolts ... In this case, killing a tattoo girl found in a abandoned car. Our main protagonist, detective group, Tabin and Currigan work on the foot, but without the "lab boys" tedious and painful efforts, they do not get anywhere. Although this technology is not in the same league, the police here assists with the firmness of the CSI. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some critics wrote about this picture, you think Ed Wood would be directed and played extra from his movie. What a bash! I enjoyed John Miles as Gangli Ex-Marine Police Tubin ... He has reached a happy-go-lucky, easy way in this role, most of the films of the period, a welcome change from the horrors of the ordinary stone faces of the police. . Patricia Barry is tricky and delightful as her perky girlfriend who helps solve crime. The old detective Corrigan is Walter Kinsella's stuff as well as droll. I rather like these two chemistry and it creates somewhat different than the robotics "drugnet" method. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep and will not be stepping into the ultimate chase and shootings off course crime movies, but it's a short time running time, more than my interest in "tattooed stranger".
