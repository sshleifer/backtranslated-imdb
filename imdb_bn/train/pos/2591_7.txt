Insulting about two different brothers, and rather a leisurely sleeper, both of which do not seem to be just "the fire started" (with the same name as Stephen King's graduate-festive book), but for a woman to interfere with each other forever. Having a pyromaniac is rather rather bad habits! Well-known special effects (especially at the end), the performers have played from a beautiful talented trio to the top of the playful and really interesting and weirdly soundtracks, finally "Wilder Neplum" can see a unique characteristic of the film ... if you find that it is! In a personal note, I was fortunate enough to rob it from two dollar bills in my local video-rental shop. (*** **** in it ***)
