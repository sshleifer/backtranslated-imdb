Paul Verhoeven (talent and master film-maker) strikes back with the perfect low-low, still a "messy old man's way," Hall Man. The first two works are so good that the final act of slash is frustrating. Still, I would probably suggest a proposal for Min Blowing Special Effects (probably the best around it) and two bandwidth performances. Verhoeven's moral question certainly agitated thinking, and even though the film closed a lot, although this movie is quite soft for old Verhoeven. <br /> <br /> The two main errors: Josh Brolin (the sky walking walking the sky) and the whole deal with the elevator. If there was an entrance staircase, why were they trapped in the lab? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie for a Saturday night.
