Sally Field and Hypie Goldberg Sally are going to Mall to revive the flapping spirits, the scene is good enough to enjoy this movie, but wait! There are more! It's a great TV movie of the day, below movie stars, (and above) and the horrors of love. Robert Doni Jr. looks the lair side of his talent, and Kathy Moriarty is fantastic. The dialogue is done with malicious skills, and is physical humor. This is a movie that will appeal to those who really enjoy acting, direction and writing industry.
