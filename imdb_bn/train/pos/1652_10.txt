This series was written to me by Deuten and when I was a kid when I was young and I love this presentation of the story. But I will disagree with the above comment. From what I read in the past, it is not Holem's performance that led Deitan to refuse to release Syria, but three books are available in the translation of the screen. A great example of this is the rewrite of Border Crossing that ends in Samson's field career. The scene is not in the book, the character killed in the mines was not in any book, and the crossing of Sync was from East Germany to West Germany, not on the Polish border. This whole story clothes. Changes in sets alike story fidelity damage My view on Holm's performance was that he portrayed Samson's indecentness during his wife's hatred and I believe that the old aged agent is trying to keep the classified department. Both Samson have made money for his father's idealism and are suffering from his influence in his life. As Clevemore's opinion, he got an education on himself, he might possibly be running the department. I think the actual loss of performance is more than physical appearance. Holm is the smallest of the book's samson - a physically attractive person can use its size to bring the presence.
