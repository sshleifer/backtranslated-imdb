Yes, okay, this is it. I firmly believe that both of the N64 and the weird looking controller have been designed so that this game can be made. For the first time I saw it's huge environment and colorful characters and it's amazing now. The control of the game is perfect, the graphics are beautiful, and it is that the Nintendo charm that is always so integral but arbitrary. For an N64 owner, and anyone else has a reason to get an N64.
