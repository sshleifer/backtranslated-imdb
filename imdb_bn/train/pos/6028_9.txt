This is the mid-length movie of Antonio, which most critics quickly resign as a 'flawed' look in the 60-year-old American youth culture / politics. For its value, I think it is more sensitive and memorable than the more praised movies like Elventura, because perhaps she shows more emotions and sympathy than ever. The story is simple, but it is used as a framework for Antonio's brilliant observation of the American consumer culture, student life, counter culture, and the whole opposition, the anti-war reaction, which was so prominent. <br /> <br /> From a completely technical perspective, this is a remarkably created film; From the 'Open-In' Desert Desert Desert, using Billboards, and from right-wing jaw drops, catharic finals that use up to 17 camera setups (it's in its own way, strong wild clusters of measurement). Also, a pioneer lady with Antonio Daria Halperin chose one hell, the screen is one of the most beautifully graceful. Not many 'acting' is involved, it seems more like a Doku-drama and therefore works quite effectively in relation to the use of non-professionals as a lead couple. And the soundtrack is not only full of extraordinary music, but its use is impressive (I can not forget the beginning of the movie, mostly because of music selection - Pink Floyd - which makes the visuals very good). Contrary to popular opinion, it is the achievement of most of the film, and I encourage people to encourage someone with taste or tolerance for encouragement. Good search capability, and one of the major films of the 60 claiming to recover / release a DVD.
