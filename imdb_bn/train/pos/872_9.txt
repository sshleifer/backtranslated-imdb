Help comes in the form of Paul, from an incognito hoodlum jail, fresh and cleanly manered routine of office environments in the environment. <br /> <br /> Both of them raise a sexual sensation and keep him in spite of his unwillingness to embrace the work week Karl is determined. When Carla came out of an important agreement, she negotiated by a thin colleague, which led to the use of Paul's offense by stealing the contract. The colleague quickly realized that he was behind the robbery, but when he opposed him, Paul's preparations were easy to push for the face - but this lip came at a price. <br /> <br /> Some people are given 'running' as a reminder about Paul's unrealistic debt. He formulated a plan that uses the ability of KÃ¤rla's unique lip that robs a gang of violent bank robbers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> .
