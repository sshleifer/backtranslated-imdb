Why do people say that this movie got them scared because it was !! This means that some people have watched the purpose of the movie. When I first saw this movie, I was scared and thought about life and religion. This is not a blood and cowboy film, but you can think of how the movie was written. Of course the non-believer would say only a sci-fi movie. True, this movie must be for your thriller collection, even if it is a religious scene. If you are a fan of the classic thrillers (Oman..HCT), it's one of them and it must have it. I have never seen Siegel (Distant Thunder), but I believe where it will end this movie.
