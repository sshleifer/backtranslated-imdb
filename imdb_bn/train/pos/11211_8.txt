I enjoyed the innocence of this picture and how to deal with the reality of having a powerful creature among them. Gorilla looks very horrible, and eyes were especially in lifespan. It would be a little scary and even a little afraid of children without topping at times. Rene Russo wonderfully plays his role in feminine. Generally, such Hollywood movies that have happened in the past require the creation of a stroke-man villain, but Gorilla is the only revolution. We feel the same emotions to close to people close to people, and yet we can not behave like them because it is not actually. Many movies are not introduced in this region and if you want to think about the likelihood of human beings, it is valuable.
