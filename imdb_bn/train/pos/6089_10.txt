OK, I at least owe it a bit to offset an unstable review. But I've enjoyed it. I do not smile aloud, but it is my interest and dragged me without me at any time. Created the story. Yes, you knew it would be a happy ending - this section always did. Occasionally, it was quirky with sight gags that you could miss, so pay attention when you watch. Stiller and black again delivered skillfully. Good team They should work together. It does not know to be a godly classic, but it certainly was a fun ride. What is not that good about BOB, or Dirty ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS? It's still worth getting out of your way to get and watch your movie.
