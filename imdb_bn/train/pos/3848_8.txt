Gerard is a writer with a slightly overactive imagination. She is homosexual and Catholic Catholic in crime and is cloning something clairvoyant, or think so. Christine's 'provocative' way of flushing When he discovered that Christine's new lover was a bit annoying, he decided to stay away from the distance. After all, forced herterosexuality has its compensation. He then realized that Christinn's three previous husbands had died in violent deaths. Christine killed them and he or boyfriend, Harman, is going to be the 'fourth person'? Verhoeven's overheated, over-aged melodrama combines a taste of Hitcoal and David Lynch, full of OTT sexuality and religious imagery and a terrible lot of red color. It often shows up and feels like a dream and we are sure that what we are seeing is not true or a screenplay of Gerard's imagination. The fun is figuring it out. Kristin is also an infinitely much more likable character that promotes Gerard or Bullish Herman, which we rarely like to root for men on it. Actually, Gerard's reception can not come soon enough, just right. Jerein is very easy to play from Krabbe and Rene Saudendjak, and easily the best of Vernon's film 'Surprise Truppers' is the fragmented piece of pieces.
