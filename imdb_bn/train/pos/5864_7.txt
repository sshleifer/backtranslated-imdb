I did not like ugly and overrated Apocalypse now. Perhaps my favorite Vietnam war film, Hirak Hunter. Die Hunter paid attention to a part of the war, and then centered on life before the war. This movie is primarily deer Hunter 2. The script is very loose compared to the diamond hunter. This story never develops that the audience can truly feel and feel for characters like Derhter. Vietnam Flashbacks Deerhunter is not gripping or engaging like these. For this reason, I can give this image only 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> However, I think acting was outstanding. DeNiro and Harris are really amazing actors. They fully immerse themselves in their character and express their fierce pain to two former friends who lost their first fight to Bobby in the war. Harriss's character hides half of his alcoholism, who is trying to save Bobby's life. <br /> <br /> I also like supporting cast. Everyone in town is part of the movie. The city could not possibly handle Vietnam vets very well. Like many small towns, it's cool, humble, and thinking about your business. Harris's character can not be all this. It is interesting to influence how people fight. Some people rebound quickly, others really do not recover.
