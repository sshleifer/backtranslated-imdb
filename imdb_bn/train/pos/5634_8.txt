Extraterrestrials are a boring, radioactive screen version of a game by William Marthiosimon (who is a choice of screen for his choice). One night a woman attacking her car was attacked by her rapist in her house and feared that he found her purse and knew where she lived. The next day his roommates went to work, the man looked at his house and tried to rape her. The story takes a wonderful turn when, at one stage, the woman becomes a man's table and is able to overthrow him; But when he realizes that there is no way to prove the rape, and if he is arrested, he will just stop, until he decides to get confession from him, keep him in the house. Impossible? may be. Bothered Certainly, but this movie has a wonderful claustrophobic feeling, especially with the middle and its attackers, that you can not fully understand how you can walk. I did not see this game at Broadway, but I imagine it works like a good piece of stages, but it does not give the film a lesser experience. In order to play Broadway, the last actress Farhah Fouzet was awarded the title of the film version and was given a deep and intense performance as the victim of prevention from hunting. Many critics have found the performance of foos as a note, but for me, a woman from Margie is completely immersed by what she has done and works for me. James Russo, found out to be more of a challenge he assumed as those who as rituals as rituals of slimy and appealing performance in his career. Like Murphy's roommates, Alfred Woodward and Diana Squareweed co-star, who came home after Marjorie, imposed on the man and staffed his fireplace during his arrival. And it's the arrival of roommates, which took the story to the unexpected level because they did not see what they saw through the margin and they did not seem to think they should call the police and man should manage. Not for the heart's dissatisfaction, but if you can decide on it, then a fascinating movie experience that will surprise you.
