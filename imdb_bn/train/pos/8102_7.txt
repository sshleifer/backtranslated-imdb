Coming Things is a historical movie. Along the metropolis (1927), it first stands as one of the greatest science fiction visuals. This is one of the first Dudeford movies. How filmmakers predict the beginning of World War II in a year and even in a fine way, the year of the year will end. But the film goes away from reality, which shows a world devastating by war (alternative toxic gas that is not only available in 1936). <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the film created incredible sight, model and groundbreaking of matte paintings - later became the science fiction staples of the genre. It is unfortunate that after the advent of Things, science fights will be identified with the cheaply created films, a stereotype that will not be broken until 2001: A space oDC after more than 30 years. If they were stuck with the effects of this movie, then Hollywood topics were very different. <br /> <br /> Raymond Messi and some of his co-stars have played more than one role in this film, have a good effect. Messi played a great role as a pilot of a progressive (1970) civilian who tried to conquer the people of a devastating country ruled by a common psychological war, (an effective influential Ralph Richardson). Finally, the story covers 100 years. But this is a big problem with this movie - there really is not a collective story. It is difficult to put a conventional plot, but I felt that the material could be made more, and although the final scene of the picture is really stunning and worth the price of admission ... Plots are indefinitely and the movie is suddenly just as interesting as being last. Perhaps the producers are thinking about the future of science-innovation: a signal? <br /> <br /> Things are a movie that every serious science -free should be viewed at least once. But unlike the metropolis, it can not carry a repeat view.
