Zero Day is a movie that some people have seen, and what is shameful? <br /> <br /> When I saw the last, where two main characters fall on the room and kill people cruelly, then commit suicide, and take it on my stomach. I was shaking, that's how powerful this movie is. <br /> <br /> The movie is amazing. It's incredible to not get a perfect ten. It is tragic that so few people understand the real beauty of this movie. This is not a budget that makes a movie better, the makers feel like entering it, which makes it good. <br /> <br /> It keeps tabs on your mind that you can not get out easily. It realizes the true horror of shooting - especially if you want to know that person, and this movie feels like you know this guy. <br /> <br /> I think they are mature enough to recommend their zero hours, it is enough to see. I'm 14 years old, and I think it's very awesome to insert the film into words. It seems to be seeing something that has actually happened.
