Looking at some of the negative posts, you have to really think about something fun .... <br /> <br /> I was very lucky to see the film in very short drama. The audience laughed his head. I can see a tape while typing and it is still dazzling! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Ariana Richards and J. J. Anderson Lead is as great as kids. And Martin actors, though Mim is limited, do a great job <br /> <br /> Another thing to look at is the background details. Film is full of respect, pastiches, and other SF and Fantasy films references. Next time Martin dress up. One of them is wearing Marty McFly, the other is the Hustbasket, the third is the House Att√©rid Uniform, and the fourth Starfighter is Flightweight.
