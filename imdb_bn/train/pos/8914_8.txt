I grew up in Reutersford, in the foot town. Where was Jerry's market. I have to remember going out for watching my whole family filmed. I remember a man showing me and my brothers "blue" in a bucket. I want to share that my mother was in the movie. Her hairstyle was like a crossover and she was ill on one evening and she saw my mother and told Steve McQueen to take a few shots to sit in the car. They gave him $ 25.00 and gave a story to tell him before he died on August 1. My mother was not a teenager and she had a few months to give birth to my younger sister.
