This is a fascinating story about a woman from London, who is married to a tea planter from Ceylon, whom she rarely knows. It's full of cliches, and lease Taylor's character is not credible. It has a wonderful set, some external location footage. It shows Taylor at the height of her beauty. She looks stunning.
