Why people are jealous about this movie and not about terrible movies like The Godfather. Titanic 21st Century's greatest movie. Great acting, direction, influence, music and generally everything. This movie has always been dumped because one day some have said that they do not like it and most of the world has agreed to agree. There is something wrong with this movie. What I can say is that this film is not the greatest Oscar award-winning film of all times, the greatest of all times ever, and sadly one of the movies I have never seen. Still, this is the best movie. The only movie that can be something like Star Wars and the Lord of the ring trilogy or Hitler or Spielberg or Tim Burton. These are all good movies and directors but no James Cameron's Masterpiece matches up to Titanic.
