This German documentary in English, a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldwarthy. She makes art from the objects of nature. For example, we saw him at the beginning of the film, that he seems to see the parts of the ice cream and "gluning" together with a slight moisture in a spiral shape, which often goes through a vertical rock. <br /> <br /> course melt icicles, but that does most of the work of Transfers Goldsworthy's work. He goes to a site and gets a feeling for him, that is how he understands how it makes sense. He says having a "dialog" with stones and other materials, he works with * trying to work with * rather against them. It can be stone, or flowers, or leaves, or stick. The sculpture may last for a minute or a year, or may not even be long enough to be done and done in photographs. The work seems to be a process more than a goal. <br /> <br /> The picture, and the work is beautiful, inspirational, and stimulating. It gradually moves slowly, which is suitable for the material, but you must be sure when you go to sleep good night. But if there is a chance then do not go. <br /> <br /> Search the web on any other page, read about the native sculptures of Andy Goldwary or Stanford University. There are some books with photographs of his sculpture. <br /> <br /> My thoughts: If you want to find out completely what you want to say to this movie, please read this section. I remember a few ideas that happened to me when I thought I would still share your studies. First, the most marginal nature of Andy Goldsworthy's work reminds me of the natural life and the flow of human life. We were born, we live, and finally we die. It is natural, and it is also naturally a part of Goldsworthy's industry. Another thought was that Goldsworthy was able to integrate his passion and his work into his life. Most of us have a job that is best tolerated, a life that we rarely feel alive and that we really want to spend more time if we think what they think. Andy Goldwarthy was able to create a set of all aspects of her life which looks like it works well and is nutritious for people around her. Wow <br /> <br /> I saw 8/28/2002
