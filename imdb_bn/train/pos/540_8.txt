Indeed ... the effect of that "video camera", it's an effect, rather a good .. (Do you know a lot about the direction of a film?) This image is actually better than the original, great fun to watch TV, to follow a rule Not required. I killed the first girl, its annoying, because number 1 is hard to see. And always, we're routing Jude Nelson to get rid of him, we're next to the audience. I hope one day we'll see the 3rd cabin in the lake, but I doubt it. Seeing this movie, you can understand how you can create real movies, because it is like a film in a movie. Jude is one of the most horrible villains of all times and he is more realistic, he not only manipulates people like psychological other horror.
