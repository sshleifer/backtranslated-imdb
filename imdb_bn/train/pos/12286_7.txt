I like the movie, first of all, because it tells an interesting story, but the story in the movie was felt that it was narrower than a long story. Since the book has more than 400 pages, that means. It has spread a period from 1922 to 1970, in a fictional South American country, which is a lot to fit within the available time. I think it has been as good as the six-hour mini series than it has to be as a 140 minute movie. <br /> <br /> Although it ran, the story does not escape so much that it gets confusing. It is said to be fairly well. One defect is that Clara's supernatural abilities appear inconsistently; They should have appeared more similarly through the film, or they should have left. Two more errors (which could be spoilers): Esteban's last goodness happened back to the last of the goodness, and it seems to wear worn curses, although the tone of the story suggests that it should be tolerated forever. <br /> <br /> acting is excellent. Glenn Close, Durant Spinster Ferula, outstanding. Jeremy Irons, as a brutal self-reliant rich person, is also excellent. Although Meryl Strip was great as the main character Clara, he was often better than this movie. There were a lot of small performances in small performances. The biggest drawback is that the film seems to be lacking in a dialect coach; Each actor started talking a different kind of pronunciation.
