From the 90210 saw only the show! Why do they stop it? This was the only show that took the top of Hawaii and you think it's a part of it! It should be released at least on DVD! <br /> <br /> I saw the same show, but nothing came. Cast was incredible chemistry and I was looking forward to each episode with much prospect. <br /> <br /> They made a big mistake by dragging that show. If you have any information about someone who can get a North Shore DVD, please post some lines here. Thanks! Light!
