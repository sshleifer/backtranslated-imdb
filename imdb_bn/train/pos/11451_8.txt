Very interesting documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldworth, whose work consists mostly of small sculptures made of natural ingredients. His work is made from rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., when the wind blows when the wind is hit by the sea or air. In this way, most of Goldsworthy's work did not really end, except for the photos or movies they had. Now, someone can claim that Goldsworthy's work reflects death, or reflects that effect, but it is not easy to say that what he does is simply beautiful art. And at the time when artists are stereotype, they are mostly bitter, provocative, often mentally unstable people who live in urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, neutral, family-based person who loves nature and lives a little in Scotland Village (Of course, I'm sure the same reasons why he is such a few artists Barbar has survived, who thinks his work as sculptor or sponsor).
