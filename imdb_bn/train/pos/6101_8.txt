So I do not destroy it for you, I will be very short. Have some great acting and funny lines from interesting cast. A young graduate from Harvard Med School (Brian White) finds out that he does not know as much about humanity as he does. She went to a small hospital in Florida for her internship because a girlfriend (Mia) left her for a job as a TV producer. His senior resident (wood Harris), surprisingly helped him by his 'creative partner' (Jo Saladana) brought him to the speed. They help protect their career, and they have huge possibilities, rather than being a sympathetic doctor who only wants to earn money (like many of my former friends seem to be true).
