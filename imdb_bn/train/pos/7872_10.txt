Seeing the first stage, I saw, "What does the Madhur Bhabar finally want to say?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . This is a film that captures many corners of the issue (I do not know there is a problem here) and still does not solve the solution like a middle movie. When I realized that the movie was almost like the same scene, I realized that this film defines so many characters that are completely different priorities and completely different ideologies and Yet they are all part of the system which is all overwhelming. I can say more but will have more spoilers ahead. So if you want to see one of the most mature films of recent time see page 3.
