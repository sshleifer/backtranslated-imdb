Strong languages, rattling for violent content and some nudity. Quebec ratings: 13+ Canadian home video rating: 14 at <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Tap.It It is not embarrassing that many people have heard of this gem of this movie. If you manage to find this movie, do not hesitate to buy it anywhere, even if you do not like rap music, there are not many comedy movies. I give a perfect 10/10. At this moment I can think of this, this clerk, the World Mouri to Garp, the 40-year-old Virgin and Chasing Amy. This picture is a ridiculous stereotype culture of Gangsta Rap. The film is a woman named Nina Blackburn, who is making a documentary about the fantasy rap group NWH (including the N **** z hat). It is basically a rap group stereotype that produces many controversial rap songs about the killings and a gangsta. The fear of Black Hat is a great comedy movie and I recommend it to you, although you do not have a fan of the Gangsta Rap scene. This is a shame, this image is not Top 250. <br /> <br /> runtime: 88min <br /> <br /> 10/10
