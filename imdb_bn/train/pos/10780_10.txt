By my favorite cartoon Spielberg, after anemicack Although the rating was low, I still enjoyed it and liked it, so it was fun and I used to enjoy Caste, was there at the Hoy Jace Hernell and Trace McNeil and was just fantastic, the whole cast was wonderful, especially the legendary Frank Welker. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this cartoon again, I was so amazing and the jokes were bright. I can also remember the hilarious moment where Brain is kayomoz, you hear his voice and played it on the PATTBIE THEME machine, it was fantastic, I like it when I like it in cartoons. I come back to these cartoons and animics, I like them
