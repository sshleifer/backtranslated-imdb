I must admit that such films that I would normally surpass, but I basically rented it for that reason. I was not really sorry. In fact, as you see, I rated it five stars This film is the perfect combination of sharp instruction and superior acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> The crime becomes very bad - thus three of the Hanson family The person started the test. Through a series of flashbacks we can learn Charles Hanson and understand the implications of the relation between father and boys. <br /> <br /> Little brother, han originally screw-up. He was always having a problem with the work and went towards the wind. Han is unsafe, nasty, and many under the influence of his elder brother. Ethan Huq gave Hong Kong the character "nailed in one" and probably gave up his best performance so far. He has shown us a man who is really good hearted but is so influenced by outside forces that he can not follow any important task. But we quickly discovered that he had become addicted to drugs and embezzled money from his company for his habit. Andy snatched the plan to loot her parents' store, and she forced the weak deliberate Hanna to do the job. Philip Semu Hoffman - Of course, the actor of our time - played Andy. Hoffman is an actor who has the power to portray a man, who loves him with patronage, but likes a real slam ball. He was absolutely perfect for Andy, or it could be said that he made Andy the perfect part through his superior acting skills. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney plays like a father for his generation. Charles Hanson is not a bad or sad person, but he has a very shameful relationship with his son, because he never understood what he meant to build a positive bond between his own boys and himself. He has always been very quick to give criticism and advice. He always made it clear that he supported his younger son in his old age and thus made a great deal of pressure among himself and Andy. We wanted to know Charles and Andy, his idea of ​​looting from his father, his idea became less incredible. <br /> <br /> In personal note, I can not believe how much Charles Hanson has reminded me of my father, and how many Andy and Han reminded me of my own brother and me. Perhaps this may be one of the reasons to enjoy the film, which has struck the distant, critical father, the story of the more successful big brother, and the less successful brother younger brother so close. Thankfully, my brother and I have never been in a position to commit a crime against my parents - assuming we have created rigorous and more moral material. <br /> <br /> The director, Sydney Lumet, combined with the complexity of these personality and tasks. At the age of thirty-eight, he still gave chaos a respectful character and combined work on the surface of collective action. 12 The Angie Man was his first film fifty years ago, before David knew that you died, but he lost some part of our magic touch that would make our characters look as chronic. <br /> <br /> The Devil in the Devils in Events and Cats, you've been stern and unreasonable, and this is not really a movie. However, this is the two-hour final entertainment that I totally recommend.
