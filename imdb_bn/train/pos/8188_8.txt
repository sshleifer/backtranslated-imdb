I enjoyed the first part of these two potters, the Imposable Planet, and was somewhat worried that the second part could not be perfectly well, which was true in the past two partners of the two series. But with gratitude I could enjoy this episode as before, because my fears were disrespectful. Anyway we start with the members of the living crew on the run from Ood, who has become the devil's fur. I've enjoyed quite a lot that there is some philosopher in part of this episode. It is a good hard doctor who needs to tell stories. Even though the young viewers could be very intense for it. <br /> <br /> My grade: B +
