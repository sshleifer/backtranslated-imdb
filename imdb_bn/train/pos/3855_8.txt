The story is supported by a nice screenplay that uses the Catholic symbol to create tension associated with the smart dialogue; The fantastic performance of Jerin Krabbé of the role of a disturbed Madina writer; And stunning cinematography Excellent resolution is open to explanation like many European movies that explore the audience's general knowledge and intelligence. Medium directors use nudity in front of men for the promotion of their films; However, Paul Verhoeven uses the Gerard Reve's nudity as part of the plot and seeks out aggressive or sensationalism. Last but not least; Sexy Renée Soutendijk's curious beauty perfectly fits her role in a woman that attracts a lesbian writer. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O 4o Homem" ("Fourth Male")
