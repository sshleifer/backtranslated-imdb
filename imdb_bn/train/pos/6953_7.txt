It is a movie that produces better trailers than full-length feature films. The idea was really cool and different, humorous was unique, I just felt missed the opportunity to "punch" this movie. So many lines and gags were left hanging very long, with no specific end and really did not leave me smile. Wilson, Wilson, Farsis and Thurman were great. Bunda Cykes underwent in this movie and needed more exposure, and his character had more chance of spawning more screen time. For me 10 out of 7, more to rent a DVD. Also, I was trying to find a good music video during the last achievement, this romantic comedy has become like a trademark for movies, Marie about La Samping, The Ment Theententes, but again, I was a little more intelligent that it seems There may be a little more music and a better movie with punching punch lines. It felt like rushhed in the theater.
