I found this picture in Brooklyn's screening - the plot is hard to describe; It's a very fragile character, but just tell me when I have a hard time choosing a difficult time, I do not know where I start. Even the peripheral role is well written and well-played. <br /> <br /> Many small touches that make them unique and very enjoyable, there are some "devices" that pop up and add another hilarious layer. It is refreshed to see; Some recycled stuff I have not seen before so many times. If this picture can reach to a larger audience, I'm sure it will be a real thriller, the story is so original and heartfelt. <br /> <br /> There are so many fun, final work and dramatic conclusions set up which misishaps and misunderstandings. A very interesting movie with a ton of cross-eyed heart; It's a touchy story with full woven accelerated comedy. Of course look valuable!
