I think if you mostly ask JW that they are expecting a miraculous treatment because of their faith, you will not get it. I do not know if I do not. Instead you get what they believe in the promise of the resurrection of Christ. So even if we were to die the worst and even our integrity, we would die, but Jehovah can correct it and fix it. <br /> <br /> It really comes out in a simple question: Is God real to you? Is this all believed only? If he is true, and you believe in him, then you will follow his instructions that the outcome of any period may be. <br /> <br /> I had a heart attack about one and a half years ago. My family was scared to see the words "no blood" written on my charts. I argued with him that if I am in a position that only blood implantation will protect my life, would it be good to be angry at the time that only time will come back to me when the time comes? He does not get it - God is not real enough just for him. very bad. I hope I can give a strong faith in comfort.
