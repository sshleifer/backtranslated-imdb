This is one of my favorite family movies. I love when I was young and now I'm getting older, I'm old. I can still laugh at the same old joke and even flick a tear a bar. I never care more about animals talking or at least for the United Nations Animated but I will stand up for this. This is an old movie but it will always keep a place in my heart. <br /> <br /> There is no other living creature movie which I can think of at the moment that I can compare this as much as this one. I am very much praising this movie but I do not think of show. I really hold that great message that "home is where the heart is." Or at least that message I achieved from it. Definitely recommend for a good old family movie night.
