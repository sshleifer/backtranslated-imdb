The geographical eye is not your average Giallo ... and to be honest, I'm not really sure it is a Giallo; But Giallo or not, despite some problems, this is certainly a very interesting little film. I do not hesitate to call it Galele because these movies that they create are not usually in most cases. But many kinds of breaks break the mold, and it can be one of them. This film does not show the characteristics of a brutal murder as a work of Geiloro, but it is a guest who has made a delusional plot to stay afloat for the atmosphere and to be attractive for the time being. The plot seems simple that it monitors a doctor, who is convicted of his executioner Julie, who for some reason, sees him as his boyfriend and father, and when he walks over him, be offended. We were so many people who moved to a big house, but it seems like many hidden mysteries around the events that happened before the arrival of July ... <br /> <br /> It seems like something looks like a rose. It never stops and I just like to sit behind and the film likes to enjoy what's happening than being concerned about any point (if any). Eye in the Labyrinth, Director of Mario Kaio, Director Dr. He did not create the atmosphere in this film as he had already done; But the myths of the story are well closed, and the mystery continues always, which prevents the movie from becoming annoying. The movie star Rosemary Dictator, who provided eye-candy throughout life and provided a good performance. With the exception of Adolfo Selby, most of the rest of the rest is notable, notably significant, as well as the Pieces and Alida Wells, which will remind the monk fans from the whole host of excellent culture flights. The film does not explain itself at the end; Which is lucky as I'm sure I'm not the only one who was a little confused! Overall, this classic element can not be; But it's good enough and worth seeing.
