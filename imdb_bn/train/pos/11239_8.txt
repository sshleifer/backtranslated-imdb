Notable Frontier's Longest Internet-Based Star Trek Fan Series. The production quality is not equal with fan productions such as the Starshit Exporter or New Voices, but the hidden Frontier focuses primarily on the story, and in that case it is very good. <br /> <br /> No physical set of hidden fronts; Instead the actor is pictured against a green screen, and the background is inserted digitally. One of the greatest achievements of the hidden Frontier is the perfect size of the work they have produced. One of the ways to achieve this is to insert virtual sets at the time of filming instead of post-production. Although it saves a great time, it is also valuable that the footage quality is not as high as it was produced after production, although it still works for it. <br /> <br /> It might not be a cup of tea for everyone, although the hidden frontier is a shot valuable, although you can be the best to start watching the third season, but the producers from here really start to hurt them.
