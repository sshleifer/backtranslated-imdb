I agree with anyone who does not like this movie. <br /> <br /> When I was young, I loved this movie and still do it. It's sweet, funny and warms your heart. And it proves that love and friendship can never be destroyed. <br /> <br /> And although she did not have many stories, it was nice, I gave it 10 and two thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Yes and it proves that your deepest desire and dreams can be true. (Tear, tears) <br /> <br /> I love this movie, if someone says that it sucks, then I will say "take care of you." It was a delightful small movie and I was glad that at least some people liked it.
