William Wyler operated this adaptation of Moses Heart's Broad Broadway with Music / Recording Poster-Vivant, but his own military commitments interfered and it went to an unlikely Hellman: George Cooker. "Women's Director" has clearly touched on many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and in general, it operates in conjunction with more inexpensive humanity than in the war-fighting clause. Of course, the GI-Wise (and completely white, reserved for an uninterrupted Chinese-American appointment) is better than the free and real life of a new hobby, and talking about home and mother and wife and children is quite thick, but it is effective promotion And are stirring nicely. Notable for the mass male cast, among which there was no reconsideration for several years: Lon McLaster, Edmund O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Button (dragon as Andrews sister), Peter Lyn Hays, Karl Malen, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J . Cobb and Don Taylor. Also for a very quick look of Judy Holiday, the film does not show up to one and a half hours, but there are some good little sequences such as O'Brien's worried sick Brooklyn's spouse. Very bad its right is a tangle and 16mm is the only print of anyone; Clearly, it was released (for quite a success) in Fox after the thirteenth century, rights were brought back to the army and there were 35 mm printed, but probably it is located somewhere in the Pentagon's gut. It is located in irresponsive and stained places, but it also assumes the rigors of military training and the terrifying aspects of the war, and it is more widely seen.
