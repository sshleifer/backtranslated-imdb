The camera on me is a misleading intelligent film. It is actually a complex manifestation of children's psychology and gives attractive insight into the development of adults and artists. On page it is a nostalic look of some home movies made by a group of children around the class of the 80's. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly served as the artist leader for movies. Sure, this is just some cute kids having fun But, this much more. It looks at a few moments when children are involved in various confusing problems that all of us face life - fear, sexual awakening, unexpected love, loneliness, and just trying to understand the world of adult world exploded around us. When we grow old we forget that we were realistic when we were young. <br /> <br /> This film makes it more valid to see a young Daren Stein as a little more common in the filmmaker's view. It is clear that Darren is running this show and these small films have been informed about their views but their confusion about their friends, their problems, interpersonal mobility and the horrors of adult life. Many children make movies at home, but I have never seen or saw children making "small" movies about the disability and inability to fit into Holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war, and friends. These kids are facing and dealing with some heavy stuff! <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell hold the power of this movie together with different scenes in the interview with the kids --- Now all adults and all friends. Adds a new angle to this picture. How many of us have contacted our childhood friends? There are these guys. And, the things that they took are still running between them two decades later. <br /> <br /> Conflict of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a "childish" issue between two men in a very normal childhood experience, ongoing relations of ongoing resentments on mobility and who are still members of this group Charge and remains at the center level! Which makes perfect sense as a watch in this home movie progression for several years. Darren Stein is a director. There is no doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Stein and Shell periodically chat with each other and nobody can help but imagine the oddity of allowing these people to give us an insight into their lives. This is especially true for Steiner, who has made great success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. I saw the cameras from my first camera, trying to find out all of the appearance of a gay little boy. We also look at artistic minds and personality aspects, which are not always "beautiful" or "caring" - and it is a bold step to share an artist with the audience. <br /> <br /> There are many publishing moments, but one of the most annoying and critical moments is that there is a movie that we tortured the victims of a Jewish collector camp and killed by Nazi. We discover through interviews and description that Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the victim is driven by a poor child. It's a painful annoying moment that looks at the horrible dark side and how children work through fear of adults, more than adults, which understands the child a lot less. <br /> <br /> It's a lot more than some home movies. This documentary captures pain, beauty, joy and sadness. Strong things --- and see good value! <br /> <br />
