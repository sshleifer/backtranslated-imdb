With Barbara Stanvic, the original is only preserved by Stanwick's performance. The story and other performances are very sickly sweet and the film itself itself is very date to be enjoyed today. Bette Midler's version is much more interesting. She refused to help Stella Clare, an independent, free-spirited single woman who was pregnant and her support from her boyfriend (Stephen Collins) or his friend (performance under John Goodman). He raised his daughter Jenny, Trini acted so sweet by Alvarado, and then came to the conclusion that Jenny's father could work better for her and eventually make life-changing decisions. Through the film, most of the smiles, tears and memories and Alvarado have memorable moments. Jenny's sister will be a co-actress with a mosquito mosquito, although the wealthy person will have a very good influence on her. If you like a good movie with a mixer, goodman or a lot of passion, you will enjoy Batty Middleer's Stella version.
