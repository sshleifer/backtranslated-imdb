Caution: Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes <br /> <br /> If you do not see this picture and plan to do this, keep reading here and accept my word for it. You will see this picture. I saw it four times and I still do not think what happened in this picture. What I have to say is because if you do not see this picture, then stop reading now. <br /> <br /> If you are still reading I will write a few questions to you and if someone replies to you, you can email me and tell me what you think. <br /> <br /> I remember my grade 11 English teacher quite well. His name was Mr. Chrisak To me, he was more knowledgeable than his year and he was always the only limited way to teach you things that you probably were not very interested in. If we do not like Shakespeare, then he has turned the story into modern day romance with modern language so that we can understand it. Our class room never was in the room, it was a cottage and we were on the lake reading a book during our leisure time. This was some branding's own unqualified way in our sponge-like mind. <br /> <br /> I started this review of Vanilla Sky by describing this brilliant person because he once gave us an assignment that is firmly embedded in my mind, such as the phone number of the long lost best friend and finally after watching The Matrix. Some ideas were made. Now if I did not know well, I thought that the Wachowski brothers were my teacher. There was just a nickname for Krisque. But given the benefit of their doubts, we would guess that it was not. But this work was more than being disqualified for the first time. <br /> <br /> He asked us to prove our truth. Show me how real you can tell you This makes your usual ideas clear which I can make sure. Feeling of hunger, feeling of loss of appetite in the feeling of hunger proves to our teacher that we were true. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you had someone else's dream? What is that a messed up question? This is a question / situation questioned us 15 years ago, before the astronomical usage of the Internet and the rapid progress of computers. How is it possible to think back again? But if you look at today's technology, now ask yourself, what was the part of someone else's dream? <br /> <br /> This year another bright but well-coveted film was searched by David Lynch's Mulholland Drive similar area. But Vanilla Sky could be more deeper than any other picture. In short, it is a film that literally hurt your mind from all the possibilities around you (if you have given it). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Aames, a young, hot shot, religious, revealing himself and owning various magazines. He inherited this inherited from his father and even though his talent and business intelligence, the governors' board, Seven Darfes thinks he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. They think that they did nothing to achieve the success of success that every one of them wants to go to them. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of this movie we got together with Julie Jaini's David's gorgeous toys, with Cameron Diaz's unhappy but bombarded fullness. David and Julie play a good game, both claim that they are there to use each other and that they are not interested in exclusive, committed relationships. This kind of relationship corresponds to David's other flings in his life's sexual love. And although both of them talk about a good game, we can say that only one person is saying true. <br /> <br /> Then we meet Brian Shelby, Kevin Smith's good friend Jason Lee's genius played with a stroke. Brian Davids is writing a book to reveal, but they are very good friends. David is rarely in his life and at the beginning of the film you can take real care of each other. Brian has a famous line which he keeps telling David over again. And that "sweet is not sweet without bitterness." He told him that one day he would find true love, and this part of the time is not a boyfriend, he blames all the bahazis living in bed at night. <br /> <br /> <br /> Bryan has played his date with Sofia Sorrano, Penlope Cruz, which is so great that the actress has the best performance this year with a huge birthday bash (Steven Spielberg's favorite birthday wishes for wish). It's just a bash by invitation and at first David and Sofia seem to be playful with each other. And usually David's fashion, despite having his best friend, he started flirt with Sofia. To make things complicated, Julie looks uninvited and starts to spy David. David then spends the night with Sofia, but they only talk and draw caricatures to each other. There is no hunky punky. The next day, David Sofia's leaving the apartment, Julie welcomed him, who offered him a ride and from there ....... Well, I think we saw all the advertisements. <br /> <br /> I would really say about this plot, because the film here is holding us back from reality and what is unclear perception. We have known a character played by Kurt Russell and some other films characters that everyone plays a part like this labyrinth delusional. A prevalence of death and possible pancreatic-like healing-all of which can not create the possibility of everlasting life. This film is just one of the curiosity that offers us, but it does not end there. <br /> <br /> Many movies seem like this day, this movie is hidden. Sixth Borrow may start this madness, but look back further and you may thank Angel Heart Heart for starting madness. Whatever it is revealed, Vanilla Sky is one of its own confident gut busters. And it makes it so interesting that the film gives you a very clear formula along the way, but you are not enough to give an overwhelming solution to the truth and you have kept yourself in lies. I saw this image four times and every time it was because I want to see if I can take anything else, I understand more. To be able to work your mind in the theater, it is rare for a movie to be able to open it for a new possibilities. Ersatz is best called "the best picture of the year in the information" but nothing spectacular. They lack substance. A beautiful mind was chic but flat, Royal Tenenbaums were interesting but uneven. Vanilla Sky is a boring cause because it's a movie that leaves you intensely to ensure your satisfaction because the film and it's been cared for. I know this image has got mixed reviews but I just think those who do not like it, they do not understand. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be like making this photo. This is a film you are supposed to do. It is supposed to make you feel anything. This year, most of the other films are empty space. This is not the one. <br /> <br /> 10 Best Movies of 10 Years I would like to see it to be nominated for the best picture and I would like to see Cruise Up for Best Supporting Actress, Diaz, for best actor, Cruz and Jason Mewes should be shoes for the best supporting actor. Cameron Crowe should have been there as well. None of this can pass, and it is a shame. This is a film that should not be missed. <br /> <br /> And in a final note, I'm sure Mr. Crisk will like this picture, and perhaps it's a movie that can answer his question. Can you prove the truth? Or are we just a figment of someone's imagination? Are we artificially replaced for someone else's mind? This is a film that raises more questions than answers. And I'm sure he's okay with that. <br /> <br /> Open your eyes
