Hello Playmates. I recently saw this picture for the first time and this is my first experience of Arthur Askey, I must admit that I was very impressed by this picture. Generally as a fan of black and white films, passports, lavender hill ridges and Tommy Tinder (apparently remote relative) to Pimc√≠llo, appealed to the film that it would provide British fashion with old fashion. I noticed that there is something here that has criticized Askey's performance, but in my opinion it's time to test a time as an excellent example of Pulsie's comic performance and if he adds anything to the image which is more than just stereotypes, then now shows the dominance over the film. If you can hold this movie, I would suggest you catch it, shamefully these movies are not shown on Sunday afternoon. I'm glad to have another chance to see the other pieces. The work of Arnold Ridley (Parent's Private Godfrey). I thank you
