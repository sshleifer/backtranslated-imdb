In the late 90's, the early 90s-90s, growing up in NYC, I can personally say that this is one of the most important documentaries to cover that place during this time. Madonna did not come to the idea of ​​suffering but she came from there! Instead of falling into the fierce battle of one another or the evil cat, allow people to "fight" in the smallest extent of touching each other (which will provide an automatic disqualification). These unusually gifted / well-organized "clust-downs" clubs did not have anything less than spectacular philosophy and there are all the big names coming from early in the day ... Pepper La Beija, Paris Paris Duprée, Xtragavaganza etc. ... Malcolm McLaren's " Deep In Vig "has been reminiscent of the memories of this time, like the song ... no matter who you are and who came from, because when you have these doors Iye the "magic kingdom" were part of something larger than yourself that you took part / valuable / and most importantly create your own initiative and imagination ... and in any case, from anywhere in the king (or queen) can be. Words and wit were just sharp as moving on the floor. This movie is very urban nanoscopic, tension, and magic all. Bright !!! Please release the DVD for the world !!! Thanks!
