It is so shameful that due to this title the film will avoid those who hate football. Like Beckham, it's more than a chessy sportsflick. The story line is touching without soppy and knowing, the joke laughs funny fun, and the characters are well played. Parminder Nagra and Keira Nightly Teres and Bright like Jess and Jules. Unthinking as a worried father of pompous surprise, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so badly surprised at 'Ride with The Devil', is so good to look like a nice man, using his fantastic Irish accent altogether! Even if you do not like football, check out this movie. If anything you have to smile
