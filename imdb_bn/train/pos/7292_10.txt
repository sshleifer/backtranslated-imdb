I got this Los Lleeil Los Angeles Film Festival in Beverly this Friday. This movie got the most worship in all the movies in the evening. Considering the first open of two music videos, they were grabbing too fast and concentrating, I did not know what to expect, I was not sure I was ready for a short time. But to my surprise I really enjoyed it. I was really good at the main actor giant guy. I was so impressed with his performance that I verified his name. I was surprised to see this witchblood guy. She has gotten so well since then! The fact that he or the lousy role is given or the director for this short has been pushed by really hard. The girl is working on a right. I guess its hard since being its first performance and so young. The father did not do well There was really a really good CGA work for it, both for this and the next "Mexican Hat" which was very nice, but I enjoyed it most because it had depth and passion and I actually care about it characters. Another was a very simple story. The story was illustrated and dark! It used to be more interested in dealing with real issues using interest in people interested in it. We will not even talk about the last image I put in that block. My only complaint is that I only saw more of the character of the monster and have done a little less at the beginning, so I gave it 9 out of 10. I also think the last credit has gone a bit slowly. Otherwise it was beautiful, called and edited. Nowadays, it was very nice to quickly change everything from MTV to complete changes. In the future and the actor will be coming more from this director. I can now recognize him as a witch actor, not Witchblood.
