Fantastic movies, realistic imagery of contemporary Finland, touch and deep. One of the best Finnish films ever made. Small city of Central Finland, captures the wonders of everyday life in the human wins and the weakness, joy and sorrow. Brilliant early fall brings clear cool environment in this clear test of people in sunlight society. Lampla is actually one of the most promising Finnish filmmakers. He found that it is possible to create popping films without machine guns and bleeding. His next film, Ila, looks good even though the story of cleaning up women's jobs is mostly not as interesting as the fate of Jockeys.
