Most movies I went to this movie are slightly jaded by hack-and-slash films. Boy, I was surprised. This little treasure was pleasantly paced with a dark atmosphere, Monday. More surprising yet the limited amount of blood actually shown. Like most of the good movies, it gave up something for imagination and did a great job under Bill Paxton's direction. After watching the "Anatomy of a Sina" episode after the tape of the video, it was good to see the scenes shot inside the car and it was nice to see that some fine, yet wonderful things that I noticed were not intentional "Oh, that looks good, keep it" Kind of direction This is a Moody film, filled with grimace. However, for the dark matter, a significant portion of it is illustrated in daylight, some more annoying scenes. Acting is remarkable (well, I always have a fan of power booth), and never goes on top. AU controller, it is very inferior that works very well for such a movie. If there is an area that lacks this movie, but it seems to be very short, which seems very little, but works on the simplest level without destroying the mood or movie message. What is the message It is something that everyone decides for himself. Overall, on the 1-10 scale, this movie likes the South Gothic style (like: "Body heat" or "Midnight Midnight at the Happy Garden"), and for those who score about this, 5 people. 'T.
