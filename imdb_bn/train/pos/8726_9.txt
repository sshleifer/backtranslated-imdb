Now this will be a family movie! In recent years, there are several films that have been targeted for their family or children, which are truly popular to watch them; But this is one of them. My whole family came away from the film, awed, entertained, dazzled, and happy. We're still quoting a little narrative from here and there. Children liked it and so we (Havai and I respectively 36 and 32)! <br /> <br /> Characters besides its beautiful and striking animations (they are as small and as they are fabulous) are very well developed. There is not one of them that you can not empathize with them. Those living in the life of this little creature combined with the skills and artwork of Disney's best animators, sound voice voice genius. This is a movie worthy of Walt Disney. I think Mr. Disney will sincerely approve this new film ... Fleck, Dot, and their colleagues of small heroes can become popular in our time as Mickey and Mini. <br /> <br /> It's a family who wants to see the theaters again .. and buy videos or DVD ownership. I'm interested to see it again. For the first time I've missed what I missed. (I have never recognized my kids so quickly and completely and embraced the letters ... My daughter is still talking about "dot". <br /> <br /> This picture is fun, heartfelt, clever and fun for the whole family!
