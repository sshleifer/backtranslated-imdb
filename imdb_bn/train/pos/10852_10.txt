Hello, I was Alanrickmanius. I'm still a crazy-hobby. It was partly on TV that I saw another movie. Then I had to find out how to get the video tape finally ended. Then I wanted the DVD, because the tape showed the first signs of erosion a few weeks later. After the DVD I had to put my hands on the soundtrack. Then several film posters and film scripts. Right now it has become worse that my website and still try to push other people into addiction with crazy party. <br /> <br /> How could it be? What happened to me in addiction? <br /> <br /> It's funny, but a tragic, tragic, intelligent comedy that the British can make. <br /> <br /> This movie is different from stuff like 'Easy E Spinal Tap', because of the characters, which are not children or too cold, but practical. This is a story of getting old men, too. A story about men getting along with each other Or not It is possible to have some of the best actors. Team Spell. Stephen Ray Bruce Robinson. Jimmy nail And go down the bill. Bill Nayyaji who keeps the best performance I have seen in a film. <br /> <br /> Well, the soundtrack is incredible. Foreign Mick Jones wrote songs for the fabulous band Strange Fate. Jim-Nyl is actually singing the diamond-man Les Wiks and Bill Nighi acting actor, Ray Sims, a realistic but painful singer. We know about Jimmy's nail, but if you only hear the "love actually" bill iger's song, then you have no idea how wonderful your feeling is and how strong it is. <br /> <br /> All right, you get fever for each scene for x-ray, especially the concert scene. The strange results are working "around the world" while singing at the top of your lungs when you will be able to stand in the crowd of dancing. You love to spend thousands of people weeping and celebrating for the rebirth of a truly strange fruit at the festival of Wisbeck. <br /> <br /> It's hard but ... I'm addicted to this picture. I'm addicted to strange fruits. If there is a world where this band really exists I would go there. <br /> <br /> Still crazy crazy?
