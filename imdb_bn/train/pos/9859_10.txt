Ice is not just the year's animation (in my eyes) it's the best animated feature I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Teaser has excited me last year and I spent many happy hours on the website. Scrat calm! And so the rest of the sub zero heroes. <br /> <br /> animation is pretty cool. Your heart really goes out of the characters of this film. They have good lines of dialogue and are well developed. Saying no one stole true picture. <br /> <br /> I feel their journey with laughter, tears and wonders. Nothing is compelled or done. The true dramatic second half of the emotion, was genuine. The last film to be deeply influenced by Anastasia in 1997 is also a Fox Production. And before that it was the earth before 1988. Everyone earns real elegance and tries to entertain all the audience, not just rapists. 10/10 <br /> <br />
