I am black American and I like this soap opera. About 5-7 years ago, I saw the telmundo Spanish language. The story was a true story of a black slave, who led a love relationship with a white commander and lived a strange, strange life in his leadership. <br /> <br /> Many of us can learn a lot from XICA. He did what he did, took nothing, and saw his possibilities. Many argued that she had sold herself - but she tried to secure her future and her future children. <br /> <br /> It was such a nice sub-opera, which I think will be released from the DVD, but it is not being released. This soap opera was sometimes the best soap opera. We need it to release the DVD or to broadcast the TV again. It is now playing in Azteca America, available only by PayPal in Mexico or the United States. We need to release Telemundo again.
