I liked ghost stories. Night bumpers can not be explained in the ghost stories, voices. Now I have seen a lot of them. Today's movies have more consistency with special efx, to find some real diamonds, you will go back to the clock when writers and directors really have to use their heads to really create real ghost stories. Now, this is very rare, the pilot episode called The Ghost Story, the TV series "The New House", was one of the most horrific movies I have ever seen. It was once in 1972, I was only 9 years, but then there was nothing more than that. All the Hollywood remakes are going on, some have to do with such a special "efx" like this more than EFX. This episode was as crazy right down as hell. I'm lucky to finally find DVDs and are very rare and hard to find. The other two Ghost Stories were even closer to being "The Hunting" and George C. Scott "The Changing" Someone wishes to make more ghost stories like this.
