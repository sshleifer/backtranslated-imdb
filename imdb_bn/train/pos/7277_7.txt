It's a weird movie about an archaeologist studying the culture of ancient Hohokam Indians. She takes a (really looking fake) mummy out of a cave cave and brings it home to study it. Well, soon she started acting weird and started talking this mummy. And then soon after his son became possessed by Mummy's spirit. Even spirituality happens when the soul then tries to destroy the family of women. This is actually an extreme, overall, and it will fall asleep in the first few times trying to see you. But if you keep it, you could end it. <br /> <br /> Ah! What is the mummy secret? Has the spirit of the soil been removed from the cave or angry? You will not be able to determine what the motivation of the soul is, but if you like the wicked Schengenes in a low budget (and 70's hairstyles!) It will be a specific comforting application. <br /> <br /> The story that I have described is Jamelled, annoyingly, the film is much clearer than describing the story. Could a boring movie really be interesting? Well ... somehow that one has achieved this one. Maybe this heart is a good movie but executed in a rather painful way. I do not know. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (with a machine version of the theme song) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (with a machine version of the theme song) <br /> <br /> featuring a horrible and fairly well-ordered sequence that shows rolling stones and stones by them and ultimately attacking some people in the campus. Other scenes in the film are simply or playful; But this one scene is actually quite awesome. <br /> <br /> Check out this! It's weird and it's worth your time. You even like one of your shelf.
