As a popular sport, surfing is preferred by many people. Just after seeing the documentary, I realized how dangerous it might be. Actually surfers also fear big waves Even someone has been killed by it. But they still keep surfing and enjoy themselves. Only brave people can do this. <br /> <br /> According to what the surfers said, they knew clearly what they felt when they came in large waves. You have to avoid direct strike from your best combination and big waves. When you win it, it will certainly give you lots of satisfaction. <br /> <br /> Amazing cinematography can not be ignored. Enjoy that absolutely visual. <br /> <br /> is an excellent sports documentary. 8/10
