All right, I'll be honest, when I first saw the program's trailer, I think it was for some sun-screen product ads. With all the people walking around the beach. Despite this, I decided to watch it, it seemed like it would be some new show that I could laugh. But I was deeply surprised. <br /> <br /> I was blurred from the first 10 seconds of the program, why he fell into the tree, why the plane crashed, Combine humor, action and mystery. But 'Lost' manages all this. With a great cast and crew, beautiful location and superb decent special effects, anyone who tunes 'Lost' will catch them, and anyone who sees Cesi sitcom and anyone with a painful reality TV can get sick. <br /> <br />> Lost Channel 4 (UK) 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 = around on Tuesday 10th
