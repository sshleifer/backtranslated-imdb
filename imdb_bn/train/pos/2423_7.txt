Life once is a hoodlum, always a hoodlum once, and nobody gets 'free' life out. New York's neighboring hoodlums sell drugs and run scams because they can not make it in the legal world, perhaps they have a criminal record, or a drug habit, or they are simply lazy. This simple story with two twists about most hateful characters guides each other to find sympathy from the audience for their loyalty and sympathy. The film is written, produced, and directed by Lawrence Fishburn, who is 20/20 Mike (the nickname of all the hoodlums) and based on his play 'Reef Raf'. It seems like a game from start to finish, especially during the longest scenes where three main players can decide. Most of the time the dialog comes very fast, it's faster than the stage and I think it's the biggest fault in the movie. Street poems are mixed as flashbacks throughout the film, a kind of Emblem Pentameter Rap, which reveals the film as violent and inventive around the world. Poems make it difficult for men to lose, these hoodlums who kill, cheat, and betray each other, incompatible with our attention or our humiliation. The annoying thing about this movie is that its reality does not show us how these people live, but how they all suffer for the same reasons. An innocent, another junkie, and the last listener suffers conscience, even seeing the audience ridiculous, convicted of hanging him for hanging in death row to convince Jokes.
