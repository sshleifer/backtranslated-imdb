Although Chris Christopherson is good in this role, but do not want to see Avis Pressley instead? Due to the drug addiction and fall from the highest fame, the agent of Alves was afraid to separate the film, it was a mistake. This has been a perfect movie for Elvis. Although the soundtrack is far from horrific, Paul Williams and Barbara Streisand do a good job in creating an original soundtrack for this "timeline" piece / musical instrument. A story about a love story, a drama about this grace and the fall of a gift of freedom. Like most tragedies, the protagonist of the story died. Also, Gary Busey is again perfect in a perfect role.
