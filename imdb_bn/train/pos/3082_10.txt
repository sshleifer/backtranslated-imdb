What is really sad, six degrees and shows like real brothers and sisters, real-time TV, not pregnant women who do not have much more to play in the glorious game. I think there is a lot of celebrations in the lungs in the lungs for a few years, with a very few periods of cancellation. But networks can start this trend in contrast with Jericho (which I enjoy) and other voices fans' backlash. I like others, I will not support any new shows until I have been given a new season. I will probably watch and watch on DVD and watch online. Then to ABC, you lost me as a viewer on a new show.
