Enjoy Drew Barrymore's great acting and his wonderful acting in this film, where he is a very complex young girl (Holly Gooding), "Skipped Parts", 2000, who left New York and traveled to California and shared an apartment. Up and coming writer, George Newbern, (Patrick Hyskith), "Far Harbor", '96. Many strange things happen to Holi and after her father's death, she is looking for her brother-in-law's brain. If you look very close, you will actually see Drew Barrymore's soil as his mother in this picture. If Drew Barrymore and George Newbern do not play well, this image should be seen only on Halloween night! Anyway, sure it's a surprise in the end !!!!
