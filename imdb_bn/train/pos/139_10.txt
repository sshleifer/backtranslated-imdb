First of all, Riget wonders. Good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time. Nice combination of wonderful 'dogma' style of story telling together with good music and great actors. But unfortunately there is no 'end'. It's unacceptable to me. I was thinking ... how to keep the story without helmera and druce? ... and I have some ideas. I think Lars Riget III should be a little bit. I'm sure that the third part without Helmer will not be the same. So here is my suggestion. A little bit stupid, maybe not I know that Lars likes the test. So why not do small test with Riget3? I think the only solution here is to create doll-driven animations (for instance Tray Trak's "Team America") or even create computer 3D animations. I know it's not like real actors, but basically I believe that it can work ... it's just possible to make the actors alive. It should not be so big for Riget fans - if the animation is done well then 'Watch' will consider it as normal after the first few shots of the film. Now the most important thing is the story. It is fully understood that it is not possible to make Rigat 3 with actors nowadays. So why not play with animation? And ... find out what possibilities it gives you! Even one marketing! The Great Director completes his Trilogy after 10 years using Putul Animation. Just dream? <br /> <br /> I hope to see the reggaet 3 days ... even to see the script. I wanted to know how the story ended ... and as I hope - there is everyone here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said "I'm not talking about the kingdom. Hospital" by Stephen King ;-)
