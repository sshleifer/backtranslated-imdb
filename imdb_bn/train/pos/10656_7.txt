Another repeated Stenwitch film that I see on the other night. "Hazard" was fantastic. It was created in 1953 and probably for double bills, but it kept me at the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation. The husband is lying from the jetty and the only way Barbara can return to the garage with some ropes is to save her. <br /> <br /> He is a psychiatrist (Ralph Maker - one of my favorites) and is followed by a game of cat and mouse that repeatedly tried everything in his power to return the maker to her husband to get back to her. <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - I was not expecting such a great film. But I think I could understand - what are some of the surprising things that Stenwik has repeatedly?
