Every time I see this movie, I'm more impressed by the whole production. I came to the conclusion that it is the best romantic comedy of all time. Everyone involved is perfect; Scripts, acting, direction, set and editing. James Stewart can always be dependent on good performance, and supporter Cast is fantastic, it reveals Margaret Sullivan, who was an underhand actress. Comedy is not easy to achieve acting skills, while its tragic personal life gives hardness towards its qualities as an actor. Lubitsch managed to get the best and she probably gave her best. See for a number of scenes which glance at one - exciting
