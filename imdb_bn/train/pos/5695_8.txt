Some films lead to live alone on fundamental issues - "Wonderland" is certainly one of those movies. The script manages to throw almost all the feces of insects, but it makes it inconsistent. This thriller speed is not to cover a weak script, rather to accurately reflect the drug-added reality. <br /> <br /> As Director, James Cox is an extraordinary way to act as his actors. Most of the characters are on the verge of eternity and often they are rather ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has been described by John Holes as a hostler, capable of manipulating and controlling. Kilmer is no crime, but Holmes seems to be able to control his version of only extremely weak psychic. Yet, it is a stunning performance. Compared to Killer's 'Hollywood', compared to that of "The Saint" it can be compared that it shows far more indigenous indie flicks than the house. <br /> <br /> Actors are all involved in the original power. Especially women - there are several little performances that stand out. Carey Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow all have limited screen time next to their male opponents, but they all are fantastic. Alongside the killer, Ted Levin and Dylan McDermott gave a weird, stunning power in their roles. <br /> <br /> I stop watching "Wonderland" because I think it's a movie about a porn actor, the hardest sense. Yes, the story revolves around John Homs, but he has nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this film is the mystery of the murder, and as such - it's nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> Rating: 7.5 out of 10
