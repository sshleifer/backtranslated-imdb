Jackie Chan is a stunning series of pieces of story set for police to show her unique talent and courage. Here are some of the stunt Jackie's best and most risky. The end of the whole malal battle is probably the sequence of Jackie's greatest single wars, more cruel and less comedic, then at the end of the war, Project A or drunk master can often cause you pain. But unfortunately, the rest of the picture holds this quality. Because it is relatively formal than the police thriller with some comedy elements. I always like Project JC, such as in the project where its natural trick is enlightened to the competition. The serious limitations of some elements of police story does not just work for me. It's still with the fabulous stunt work and Jackie's best films for just shiny reasons. <br /> <br /> It's a really terrible stick to save the DVD version from the WP version naturally with Hong Kong Films. Subtitles <br /> <br /> Great stents, if the movie starts right then you have not seen any jersey movies and the value of the clock price for any movie fan is 7/10
