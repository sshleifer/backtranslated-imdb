I do not understand why they decided to introduce this movie to American singer Jait Lee's Dynamo. Legend fist has been a great choice. However, black masks are not terrible, but it is certainly not great. The final battle sequence is directed by Yuan Wong Ping in order to adjust the mindset. But English releases are suffering from rough edits and dubbing. (I'm begging the Hollywood studio for misconduct with subtitles.) Jet Li shows her characteristic charisma in the title role, and the fran√ßaise episode 701 has a quiet but concise role. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is a weird Goth style which adds some interest but it is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. There was so much focus on Lee's superb physical skills. Black Mask is a decent film, but to benefit yourself and raise the fists of the lidend if you want to see a great movie that really shows Lee's skills.
