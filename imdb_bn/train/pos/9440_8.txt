One of the best exploitation films that came out of the wonderful wonderful 1970s film "Deliverance" was one of the exploitation films. <br /> <br /> A group of friends placed on a banana trip in the river. The south and they are hunted by a bunch of toothless hills, which mostly try to destroy their lives. It's awesome. <br /> <br /> We are sexually assaulted, deadly deadly shoots, bow and arrow killings, shooting, broken bones etc ... Many like "Texas Chainsaw Genocide", "Delivery" credible to be imperfect Will be. Even in the Dark Age of 1972 it can never be and never can be. <br /> <br /> "Delivery" is a very entertaining journey and full of action. This is one of the biggest waves of exploitation films since the early 70's, and it (controversially) is located in the upper part of that pillar with its great acting, extraordinary cinematography and excellent writing. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 kids.
