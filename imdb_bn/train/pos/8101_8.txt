HG Wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century, with little doubt. Zeus Verne has been claiming to be the father of science fiction, but his stories are more adventurous stories using great discoveries as a plot device. Wales was deep and brought its subtext to the story. Perhaps his greatest heritage is that before the 20th century, there is no evidence that people believe in other planets where many people, including Richard Dawkins, consider it to be perfect. Of course there is no proof and no one can wonder how Wells presented this thought in human thought? Undoubtedly it was the wells that sowed the seeds. <br /> <br /> Asa's words were adopted from Wales itself. But it is obvious that he can not tell the difference between writing novels and screenplaces. The dialogue is often heavy, heavy handling and unconvincing. One point on the point is that the two pilots on behalf of the opposition are discussing the nature of the war, "Why do we kill each other?" This criticism has been reflected, Orwell, in his writings, he paid nostalgia with Wells, Hitler and the World State Wales. And it is true that anti-war messages in Wales are painfully overstated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Heralds the end of civilization that took place in 1940. In the background a child like a Phantom Army March hits a drum and surprisesly wonder about the collapse of society and the fear of Wonderland sickness. Even the setting of the year of the setting is rather an attractive nature. This is an image that produces this film with Arthur Bliss score which makes the movie a memorable one. And by asking Wales questions to be fair, "the universe or nothing. What will it be?" In short this is a photo whose errors are easy to forgive
