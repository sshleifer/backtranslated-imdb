I said, I waited to see it. <br /> <br /> I will not try to loot it, and some people have really spoken the pilot brilliantly. On the other hand, I do not understand the rebels who claim to be BSG fans and not like the pilot. <br /> <br /> What did they expect? Background is being done 50 years before BSG, we are helping to get there for the birth of Slon, saw the life of Adama family (we have already learned something from the BSG), the depth of the population of Makriri and other views of the colonies, and perhaps the belief of God's people and the unique Cylons God is the source of faith. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the same idea or space opera like the previous series, although I know that the map of MSpy will be strong. <br /> <br /> It's committed 1h30, I believe that it will force BSG as well for the conditions. I hope a lot from the following but I'm not sure that we will learn a lot. <br /> <br /> Watching the DVD gives you more components for your brain chin by watching the deleted video. <br /> <br /> Looking forward to January 2010
