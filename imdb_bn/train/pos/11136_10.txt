"Midnight Cowboy" is one of the reasons for the films that have announced a great composition for good reason - it's actually one of America's best films. Both artists are legitimate but fully accessible and commercial. It was not a huge success when initially released. But beware, it is one of the most entertaining films ever made. Characters are memorable, well-developed, and finally sad. Filmmakers should not be praised for the end of Hollywood, which was essentially compulsory in the 80's. Yet, from 1967 to 1977, I searched for this movie for American films. This is a time when most diverse movies can be made with big budgets that are well-established, innovative, and offer hollywood. This time "Star Wars" was released. <br /> <br /> The instructions of John Schlesinger make material work. It combines a simplified style with some experimental editing. In contrast to other films featuring these cyclical effects, "Midnight Cowboy" has been quite good. It is still as strong as it initially released. Although what this makes a masterpiece is played. The backgrounds of the letters are not fully explained, but performance improvements them completely. Both John Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both memorable and sympathetic (despite their occasional reprehensible actions). Alongside, as a fan of vintage exploitation film, I like the 42nd Street Street scenes. "Cowboy at midnight" is perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made. (10/10)
