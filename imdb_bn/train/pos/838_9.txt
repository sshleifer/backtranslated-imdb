*** 1/2 Piers Brosnan, Greg Buyer, Hope Davis, Adam Scott, Philip Baker Hall. Directed by Richard Shepard <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2004's "After sunset" brings his new role to smile and a great time. Professional veteran, Julian Noble, in a job in Mexico City, just opposite, a high-business businessman, Danny Wright (in Kainer's, perhaps his best role), talks with the wind. Two on-screen jewelry accuses a laugh, smile laughing and does not let them laugh. Among his best performances from "American Spenders", Davis gives another charming and malicious performance. One of the most enjoyable and best movies of the year. My final rating is 9/10
