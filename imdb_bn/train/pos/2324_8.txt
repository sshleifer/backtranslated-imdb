When I saw this movie I started to feel very nostalgic. As a child growing up in the rural areas, I was once again a child! Swimming pond (this is called a "tank" in Central Texas), running through the countryside like a wild free spirit! The story was very credible and I completely lost it and cried towards the end. Through the pain we go through life ... life can go and be forgiven.
