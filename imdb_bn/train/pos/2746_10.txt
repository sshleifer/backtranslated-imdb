Think of getting your remote firms out on a cold night and then going to bed. There is no need to close the door. The only word is the whistling air through the trees. In mid-midday, shutting down the lights and driving in the car. Moments after an infiltrator beams a flashlight in your dark living room. <br /> <br /> What makes this image so dire setting: a remote farmhouse ... at night. Based on the best-selling book of the truman capet and compared to the best silent films of 1940, "In cold blood" with a B & W discussion discusses a horrific story, especially in the first law, because the plots are widely used in the country, and the rains flowing in the rain. Road. It's the element of nightmares. But this is no dream. The facts actually happened, in 1959. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a memorable, and hunting, made for the movie. <br /> <br /> Two main actors are closely related to two real-life killers. Robert Blake is not as believable as Perry Smith, a small and stocky man with a little bird, who dreams of looking for the Carthage cemetery. Often good like Scott Wilson Dick Hickock, smooth dialogue artist with all American smiles. <br /> <br /> Both of them were in Mexico after their assassination. The events are horrific, so they come back to the United States, steal cars, beat them, and usually walk around from the place, they are usually unfortunate. But it's a fool's life, and the two outlaws soon regret their actions. The final 20 minutes of the movie is becoming gentle, like the rains, the ropes become stiff, and what we hear is the crushing of despair heart. <br /> <br /> Even somewhat modest mid-law, the "cold blood" riveting stage is a real-life story that still hypnotizes, details about half a century later. It's that setting it does. Do you think people in rural Kansas have still unlocked their doors ... at night?
