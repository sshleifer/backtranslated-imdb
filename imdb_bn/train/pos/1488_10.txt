This is a movie to see if you are married or married couples. The film depicts a couple in Italy and works on difficult issues such as miscarriage, infidelity, joggling work and family. <br /> <br /> The so-called "culture of death" that we now enjoy in the world is terrible and this movie will certainly make you feel. <br /> <br /> One must definitely see. I hope it should be distributed. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to actors and actors. <br /> <br /> Two spit from me and a 10 star rating!
