Among the priceless jewels of Auto Prummemmer's Dana Andrews Chakra (most of the genre) are desserts. Because there is a lack of paranoia, migraine or hesteria, they may come out of place at that time, but with clear imagery, identity, generality and complex game with representation, the existence of traditional psychological theories, the unstable, geometrical style seems to be amazing today, and Melville is very similar. Strong iron of this film is so lustful, cruel and ridiculous that the 'happy' end is the worst in Hollywood's history. Brilliant, intense, and packed with doubling dialogue in the entertainment thriller level.
