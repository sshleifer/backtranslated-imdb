Ghost Stories (TV Movie - 1972) was the pilot of the NBC series. The film was well-written and well-played and I think, halfway better than the TV series movie, when the 1972 -73 TV season starts, NBC is a winner. (I was available on this video in the video !!) Serious was frustrating - even William Castle was executed. Producer However, if you have an opportunity to watch your real TV movie, Ghost Story then check it out. You will not be disappointed.
