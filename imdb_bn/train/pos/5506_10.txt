I do not understand why "critics" have given this documentary "0" without any political reason for political reasons. No, the film did not investigate both the "side" of the story, but then should be seen as an attempt to adjust the overall description of a film for Chavez against the tide of campaign against him (especially A. History: CIA-related terrorism in Latin America - Google National Security Archive and B In that country and Chavez fans are clearly in the hidden scene The existence of protesters). The most amazing thing about this movie is that filmmakers have coupled all the way to the President's palace, though the coup - is definitely the first documentary to make - the picture of a coup on both sides !!!
