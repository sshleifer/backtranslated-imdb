Do not have any problems with parents? And do any parents have unresolved problems with each other? <br /> <br /> I know, it is heavy. But the film is played laughing, making the comedy better and making drama even better. I always like Paul Reisier and Peter Folk, and although I was a little worried that their star quality might be too big for their small-quality movies, I was enchanted from the very first scene. <br /> <br /> In particular, entertainment was the discovery that the boy made his father look like a person. And the solidarity of Peter Fock's hard work, the sacrificial father and husband were perfect balance points. The scene that did not play so well, the movie seemed to be very low, and the character is much less interesting. <br /> <br /> Perfectly done, Paul and Peter!
