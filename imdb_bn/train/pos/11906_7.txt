This documentary by Schlokmister William Kassel took some cheap shots in the '50s-60s' simple, where he did the most characteristic work - look at the funny, silly people with ghosts - but it is also tender and vivid, especially with John Waters' brilliant commentary, who At that time a target audience and Castle of the Castle for those things, who have a duty towards his father Dabbed and he was quite aware of how he awakened his skills. (We will never go to other castle's descendants.) Movies were not very good, it made it clear, but their marketing was bright and they were a sweet, hard working family. Funny people keep popping up, like Dian Baker of "Straight Jacket", who looks great and Anne Helm, whom he replaced at the instigation of star Joan Crofford. Daryl Hikman exploded all in the blissful memory of working with the Castle on "The Tingala" and there are enough footage to give an idea of ​​the talent level of the castle - too much, but not very energetic. A beautiful look at the audience getting more easily satisfied, and it makes you simple movie nostalgic for the day running.
