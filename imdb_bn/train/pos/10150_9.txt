Of course, this movie is full of sad and sweet and clich√©s, but it's entertaining, and I watch movies for it. For entertaining. Natasha Henstyz is even stunning with short hair. Her smile is bright and her beauty can not be concealed. As Michael Verton, I'm sure women love him. Both of them looked really different in this picture. I did not understand the comments that were in any chemistry between them. I think we want to see what we want to see. <br /> <br /> It was fun to see Olivia de Aubo and Michael Regli, even if the British accent of d'Abb entered his supposed bronze lecture. In fact, if I could not read these comments, I did not really notice it, but I went back to the DVD and now her dialogue is more pronounced to me than British, but she was an ideal for her role with an exception. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is a story of two wonderful people who marry others, but their souls are interwoven with each other. This could be an unlikely story, but who says that movies are supposed to play like the documentaries? It's not that the tube that tunes per hour is more unrealistic than any theater. That's why we look at them for a short time to protect them from daily living and enter the world of screen characters. I thought this actor has done a good job of it, but hey, I'm a passionate guy who tears easily. Although I do not think it's wrong, it must be a sensitive scene, and this movie was very large. <br /> <br /> I'm just giving 9/10 because I'm saving 10/10 for him. The invisible super magnificent movie that I know will come in a while. Create a note to see whether you see the ad coming in movie channels or live movie movies or whatever it is. I think you like it
