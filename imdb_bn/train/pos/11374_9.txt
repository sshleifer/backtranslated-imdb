There are some nice comments and observations on this photo. I'm happy to compare Fritz Lang's "M" with (forgetful 50's incomplete reunion with lightweight David Wayne). The real villain is the torture murderer (Jeffrey Demon's extraordinary good performance), but his sex frustration over his victim - most children He intended. The real villain is a brutal bureaucratic Soviet system, which has been sinking into its own corrupt inefficiency. An incomprehensible Dedicated Man (his first role since "The Game", Ray is in his best role), a well-regarded progressive who is willing to use his advantage (Sophiereland in this kind of role always), a hesitant, frightened but scheduled psychologist (unfinished Max Shadow) , Prosecutor (Bright Britt Actor John Wood) and Intelligent Investigator (Joyful Supporter, Emailed Staunatana) of the quiet, supportive wife goth, warm bureaucracy. This is a great fine film. Its darkness and flexibility works against success which is supported by a corrupted, disabled system illustration. It has been played in so many recent films, which do not need to be drowned in cow-bearing slices' n die sensationalism. Gore was present - this is a terrible story - but it portrays a pathologically twisted mind. The accuracy of the story is: These are such a person, a person like you or I was accused by a man. You and I are choosing to choose our frustration through reasonable ways, laughs angry at our innocence and weaknesses. , Our son. Excellent performances of this story are well illustrated by the superb cast. - I think our Australian friend did not like this statement and there was no doubt that they liked to speak in their non-English language. Well, very bad. This fine film definitely worked for me and everyone else I talked with saw it.
