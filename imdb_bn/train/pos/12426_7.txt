David Duchovney created a role that he had to duplicate Californication - the disturbing talent. And it's a role he plays well. <br /> <br /> This thriller starts off at a good speed and eventually carries you. Timothy Hootton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie plays out. The story of a disgraced doctor to find his way into a criminal world is well scripted. Drug addiction and a desire for the proud Jolie to mix a great cocktail. Unfortunately, the story gets a little weak at the end and the relationships between villain and the FBI are damaged and the final scene is ready for development. But, besides that, a movie is worth watching.
