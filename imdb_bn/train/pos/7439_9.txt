Ancient Marana is a true classic piece, as was the original poem. Context with the old Mariner / setting yourself fine, clear, and without adultery. With the reading of the poem that the artistic work completely conforms time and time to its work and time, carrying the audience still, with the still consistent consistency, with excellent pace-movement techniques only won well. Pre-MTV era producer and more current work is much clearer. (MTV TV and Video brings a static movement that is often used to be irrelevant, from theme to theme, from theme to theme, and explicit relation between theme or story.) The voice, sound sign, and biography of Redgrow's lessons bring this sensitive poem to life. With fear, conflict and pain In addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the fiction of the writer and the creator of the tragic and surprising story of the ancient Marina (sometimes a positive mood under the theme of the story) and occasionally concentrate. It is essential for classic poetry, sea, and love for a long story, which is almost completely true and a story that has had lasting impact on our world and culture. Who does not understand the meaning of "elbotros"? Or "water, do not drink water and drink water everywhere?" A really fine experience. Mr. for bringing us life Thank you, Silva, never forget.
