Samuel Fuller was an interesting film producer, mainly his film in his inconsistent politics. "Shock Corridor" and "The Naked Kiss" represented an effective portrait of America's hypocrisy and plunder and the horrors of "Big Red One" warfare, although "Merill's Maroders" fought for the necessary fire and "pickups on the south" "about the dangers of communist espionage. All his films made for a very entertaining scene, and although he is often the B-movie producer "Full-time pickup" is no exception, and despite the dated theme, the filmmaking style is significantly ahead of its time, it is very fast, tight, and sometimes brutal film silent. br /> <br /> Actively acting across the board, Richard Wyommark creates a great anti-hero and Gin Peters has his charming spy The actress is quite sexy as a girl who works for a breakthrough, although Thulla Ritter is a delightful performance like police style. The angle fuller work is great, acting sequences make it even more exciting and cruel (it is very fierce for her time). Tarantino and his school continued the camera for 40 years. "South Street Pickup" is a great step-by-step noor thriller. "Shock Corridor" keeps my favorite Fuller movie, but it is very close second. (8/10)
