Movies can not be seen from the first release, but it was memorable. Rip Torne and Conchta Farrell's performance were fantastic, photography was excellent, story lines and anything else about it were of the highest quality. Yet it has forgotten a lot <br /> <br /> UK is probably a diverse market for him but I have not seen the film in TV or video, which is tragic. This has made more success in the United States, where it can be correctly seen as the right historical drama? <br /> <br /> Always 50% good movie music and though I'm not sure the title theme is a simple but moving clarinet solo "Jesus did not have a friend to us". Then the debate started with that picture! Am I right or wrong?
