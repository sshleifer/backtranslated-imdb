"Jug är nyfiken ?? yellow" is a lot of fun. Like at least one other critic, I have to laugh lots of times, laughing several times Yellow Energetic, Playful, Self-aware, Detective. Do not expect Bergman here. In the mid-60s of Sweden, this movie has read about the young person and * contradictions about these issues, the nation and the world that faced it. Occasionally yellow seems to be the greatest social-political documentary, Lena, the main character and others interviewed by both ordinary people and politicians (eg, home in Wolff Palma). Other times, yellow looks like this kind of documentary parody. All the time, Yellow acts as a personal personal documentary, which Lennon's life - her own life, her love, her political opinion, her own views. He is a complete person ?? Complex, faulty, contradictory, happy, sad, weird And this is all recorded on the director, Sjöman, and the wonderful extra level of his crew recorded himself in Lina. It gives me really yellow wings, for me. They suddenly do not appear in some interesting times and in some fun way, reminding the audience that it is fiction and artifacts, but their presence itself is another layer of film; They are filming themselves. Am I reminding a Bjork music video with the same quality ?? A music video about creating music videos, advertising infinitum, getting weirder and more cartoons with each repetition. I think Sjöman might think of something. Although "jug är nyfiken ?? yellow" can not be tea cup of everyone, it is certainly intelligent, malicious, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic.
