Blubby's 1950s B-Movie Cy-Fi Flick Perhaps you know this story: two teenagers (Steve McQueen and Anta Corsoaut) hit the ground by hit a meteor, and when they go to see it, they become old with some weird ones ... Blob is tied with his hand. They took him to the doctor's office, and then went out to find out what had happened. From there, spraying the blob, eating it all the way. Special effect is cheesy fun, as the story. Police opinion in a radio with another police officer in another district is very good. This is not a great composition, but it has a special place in its genre. Steve McQueen is very good. 8/10.
