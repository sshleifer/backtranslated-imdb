It is an emotional movie, a person's dreams and drives and drives them to realize. This is a beautiful and inspirational film. Why do some people try and find out the fault with each film, especially good ones. Dennis Quaid Jim Morris, a science teacher and high school baseball coach, demonstrated strongness in this true story, pushing his team to take another shot at the professional team's baseball career. With the support of Brian Cox, along with a wonderful supporter Castro, without support from Crusty's old former Navy Navy officer who gave so much credit to his son. It was better to see something other than a villain in a film. If I have a complaint with this movie then this is: Do not allow Royce Applegate to sign in to the national anthem again. <br /> <br /> Seriously, this film is in great baseball films like "Bed of Fields" and "The Natural". It's two thumbs up and a big "well done."
