I do not agree with the critics of this film in the international film industry of America. In the post war England (except the "Blackboard Jungle"), Besill Dardon has conducted a ruthlessly realistic film on the honest effort to portray the rise of anti-child crime. Cinematography was excellent because it really achieved the immense abnormalities and isolation of huge housing estates. The estate looked like an old prison. Stanley Becker was excellent as a strict detective, re-nominated in the teenage section - "Emergency, Emergency - Five Eyes Lolly" !!!! He's getting a lot of jokes on the butt. David McCullum showed that he was Britain's top rival of the 50th Century. (He played a different role in another Stanley Baker's film "Hell Drive"). After Johnny and his inspiration, he was fantastic, his screenplay was very scary. Ann Hydeg was also very good as a cynical Cathy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> As evidenced by the fact that it can lead to a success, he is recruited in the Juvenile division - he is quite hateful in what he thinks is not proper police work. He got his first call in all the hacking - a bribe of six-year-old Morphy couple in local lulli shops !!! And their neglected sister Kathy She is grateful how grateful she can turn into kidnappings of young children in housing estates. Because of more involvement with the family, he realizes that there is a strong link between a fierce Chinese youth who works for fire, Johnny and a laundry. Local cleric (Peter Cushing plays an unusual part of Hammer's fear) explains that when Johnny was young, he rescued some people in some burning buildings and congratulated a hero. He wanted to recover the feeling of importance and was useful and he felt the fire could burn. School blockade was filmed in a very practical way and the visitors felt the fear of children - teachers (only thinking about their own safety) stopped and clashed them with horrible gunmen! <br /> <br /> I thought it was a really nice film that tried to show some of Britain's social problems after the war. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
