<br /> <br /> I bought this movie in DVD and it was the first time I saw it for the first time. I have been a fan of Tokyo's work for almost 4 years, since I came from high school. I did not grow up in this movie ... probably my mother kept me away from here. It is certainly not for children. This is not bad in a graphic sense, but the themes will move correctly in most heads up to 10 years old. Overall, this animation was excellent, it was considered in 1978/1979. I followed a fairly good book in a loose sense of stories. But I'm worried that Baskh has not added more than 40 minutes or more and works on the King Partner's return. That would make it the final movie. I was annoyed by his unexpected end, and then when I heard the king came back, I was more annoyed. Too bad it was not a great animation film. It may have garnered a high vote from me. I give it 7. I can only expect Peter Jackson to do book justice with the new live action LOTR.
