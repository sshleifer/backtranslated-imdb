I think the movie is kind of weird. In the opening scenario, a person was killed for some reason. She is not mentioned again. Special effects might be good but I enjoyed watching an old horror movie. This is not the best example of a classic horror movie, but it was still a perfect movie. I give it a 5 in scale at about 5.
