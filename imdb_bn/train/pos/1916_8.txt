"8 Easy Rules ... for my Tejage DAUGHTER date," My opinion, an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure I did not see each episode, but I still enjoyed it. It is hard to say that any episode was my favorite. However, I think it was always fun when an accident occurred when it was always fun. I always smile that. Even though James Garner and David Spad were good, John Ritter preferred me more events as a leading figure. If you ask me, his sudden passing was very unfortunate. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope some network show fans will bring it back to the wind.
