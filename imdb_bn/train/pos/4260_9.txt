Fatih Akins first worked with "Im Julie", which was fairly good, he made a really fantastic Italian family epic. This is a German film, which unfortunately is a bad predetermination because we produce very few medium movies;) But this movie then created some great snapshots of time. "Solino" about the Italian immigrants in the 60th year of Germany's "Ruhr" region. Immigrant and his family then started the region's first pizza restaurant. Characters are excellently drawn. Especially Gigi, the main actor You live every second, every feeling he does. Acting by his brother, Moritz Blabatru, it's not good. Well, you just do not believe in her role. But the character is balanced and fits perfectly into this script. I'm an urgent need to compare this film style with "The Godfather" style. Many people will probably hate this movie, tell her annoying. More tension? - Yes, but an insulting movie. 10 out of 9
