I saw this movie almost 4 years ago and I hope some fun, like CB4 I was flying away. I was so flat on my butt to laugh my movie off this movie. CB4, characters, songs, plot, everything better than Top authentic independent film "Two Thumbs UP" was given to Seychelle and Egbert (and if two old white people can understand the humor of this flicker, you know it well).
