A great innovative film from a pair of highly captivating and talented filmmakers Harry Dodge and Silly Howard, by Hook or Bye Crooke. They manage to tell an original story in a unique cinematic style and it's nicely done. Rose is shot, and surprisingly written - true poetic. <br /> <br /> The main character acts as a role model / inspiration for the true hero and chest Dike and trance. This film has so much energy, so many shocking emotions and it is San Francisco's heart scruffy. I can not recommend it enough enough! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
