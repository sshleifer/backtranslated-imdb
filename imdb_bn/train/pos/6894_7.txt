Men can sleep in a lolloire, if they like (or her lolos - she gives her name a nasty posture for French), but women of divine Gerard Phillip even have a taste of chicken that is not only beautiful. Your version has no subtitle but will not be disassociated because these are not easy, love and awesome stories of war, which are all right, they do not need them. What you need to know is that at the beginning of the film, Lumbrobrigidge read Pamph Philippe and told him to marry the king's daughter. Then the story is quite simple from the gallery gesture and running, jumping and swordplay. From the tragedy, the boldness of the story and the heavy letter of the tone has become somewhat tiring, and it is annoying that the French apparently feels superior to Hollywood itself, even annoyed to try their possibilities of exciting stunts. And of course, the non-French-speaker Oh-la-La sometimes miss something, such as: the real girl: I want to tell you that my heart belongs to the phanfan. Dear, my dear, do you think I was interested in that baggage?
