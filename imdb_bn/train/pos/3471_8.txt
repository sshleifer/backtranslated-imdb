Recently shown on TV only, the film is opened with the opening of a claim by surrendering itself from a true living; That's itself an eye-catching. Yet the script and the main characters are fantastic and I found myself lifelong. Because there is no small way of fantastic, thoughtful and fun conversations. This film is compiled in two-day real-life music "Legend" pre-compiled together then. The film captures the essence of their life and philosophy, a story which proffer an interpretation for their primary "split". It is so impressive that the actors who play the characters, the flaws, and everyone give such a seemingly realistic screenplay, that this viewer at least believed that I saw almost every detail a true story. The great skill of this game is that with miraculous writing and basically acting "two of us" can create an excellent picture about the conversation. At least 10 out 8 is a worthy.
