I was very happy and saw a "Milanese" movie in Milan. Alessandro Altri is a Roman director who has been properly and fortunately printed in a film by Milanese philosophy. <br /> <br /> The movie tells the story of an ideal carrier from the Milanese couple starting with "birth". Death. Unlike any wedding planning that became real and how a couple came to each other and felt in love with a flashback story of married guests. Life in Milan's "ebb" life was difficult, and old days became hard and difficult after sweeping, finally the product: a child, which would make it weak rather than a stronger relationship, because it is "selfish influences" like today's "metropolis" personality. Under the Stress atmosphere, all "creative" advertising environments help to get better involved in the plot. We are losing the value of life and reflecting in this nice and sharp film from this well and deeply sindhu's director. <br /> <br /> The actor chosen well, Stefania Rocco is excellent and well characterized, and a positive surprise, an unexpected good FBO, which is known as "Trash" TV series: Lei Known <br /> <br /> Ratings: 7/10
