I have made the kids movie still this way; Dark and deep. The development of character (and character of Charlie's dynamic character), plot development, excellent animation, emotional involvement, and rational, related, and consistent themes. If you do not have the music-and-dance routines, then you never thought it as a child's movie, and that's why I gave it a high rating. This movie is an excellent movie, let alone for a kids movie. Which brings me to the second point: This is a darkest "children" film that I have seen several times, it's 22-year-old I would be surprised to see a child under the age of 8 in the middle of the next half and totally scared of the first half of the film, and it ends with the ending of all the end of any symptom (Ala "Jurassic Barak", who is your 'Futuram' fan) , And makes this movie so well. The film publicly creates emotions, because we generally do not think it is bad and do not make the movie itself bad; Actually, it means successful. Good funny movies are supposed to make us smile; Good horror movies are supposed to be afraid of us; Good sorrowful movies are supposed to make us sad. My point is, good movies are supposed to continue you, not just entertaining; This movie has been removed from me. Also, this movie is incredibly violent and relevant to children's movies today, according to today's standards, that is not suitable for some children. Dad, I want to see it first. I usually do not want to say anything about this kind of thing, but I saw yesterday and it was even surprised at me.
