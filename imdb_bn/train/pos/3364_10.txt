I was very surprised to see how many people voted in this film, and it is just about writing something about HAD, although my comments are already similar to those who wrote. <br /> <br /> I like a lot of movies. Fantastic acting in Mastroianni and Loren. The way the movie is described: Humanity and love are gradually developing among these two outsiders, and the fascist radio announcer (who may be a partner of the Maurianians) and running from "running" and "coming from the show." A very fine movie. Perhaps some of you will argue that anti-fascist "messages" are very clearly distributed, But it did not destroy the film in any way to me.
