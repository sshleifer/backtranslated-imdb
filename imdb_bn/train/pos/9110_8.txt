You know Our soul is asleep, based on that revolution ... I can explain, I think !! Well ... until it did not happen on April 25, 1974, our freedom was limited, we had no freedom of speech, but when we got the revolution, it seems that the Portuguese people have lost their opinion, we do not use our freedom of speech! This is the result of the revolution! I think it's clear ... ... about the film ... I think there are some mistakes in some of its characters, but I'm going to see in Portuguese movies. I like it too!
