Many diseases born in the minds of people who have been given life in modern times. Persistent alert or collected information in the case of piscicosis, psychologists, counselors and psychologists have been busy working for decades to keep up. Occasionally, some of these psychological phenomena have no knowledge about their remedies even even their existence. This is the premiere of the movie titled "The Night Lynnar". It tells the story of Gabriel Nunan (Robin Williams), a popular radio host, who spends its evening with his brilliant stories about Gay morning's life and spent the evening. Perhaps it is losing its true veneer because it accepts that she is no longer herself. Feeling abandoned by both her lover Jess (Bobby Kanevale) and her and best friend (Joe Morton), she seeks shelter in her deep despair and isolation. It's here, ask him for a mysterious voice help at night. Feeling useful at noon and Peter (Rory Kulkin), the 14-year-old boy will suddenly reach the voice. To read the boy's annoying manuscript that illustrates his early life and sexual abuse in his brutal parents, plans for Nupon and wants to help. However, things do not seem to be what they say and Nun soon finds a medical nightmare drawn in a quick and malicious story, wrapped herself up. This film is pure Robin Williams and not for Tony Colette, who is Donna D. Logrund played, Sandra was as Pop as Anand and John Kollum, it could be ridiculous. Instead, this could be one of William's more serious performances. ***
