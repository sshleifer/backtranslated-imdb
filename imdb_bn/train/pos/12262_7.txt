Almost thirty years ago, author Numa Sadaul published a book-length interview with Belgian comic book artist Georges Remy (known as Herz, Tintin's creator). This movie remembers Sadaul's event today, when he remembered the interview, we could hear the cassette (Herage died in 1983) and saw his own old pictures and footage. Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Hedge and we now knew how to deal with his divorce with his wife, after the relationship with one of his partners (the year after that will become his second wife). The film does not fit very well. After a few years, right-wing and imperialist books (Trinitas in Congo, Tintin on Soviet land) were completely transferred to imperial books in tintin books. Blue lotus). Overall, I came out of this movie to see more things about hedge and see it as more unlikely than coming to this theater.
