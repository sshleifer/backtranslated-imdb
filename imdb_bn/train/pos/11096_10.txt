Based on Elmore Leonard, this is a fierce and intelligent action film. Story: A businessman is blackmailed by 3 criminals. Roy Schieder works great like a naughty psychopath sort who go to John Glover's leading character and special credit. I must mention that the characters of Vilane are very complex and interesting - it is very rare for an action film. Also features some beautiful and sexy women - Kelly Preston as the most notable young bets for Sheler's character. Vanity gives a very good performance and look like hookoo attached to three blackmailers. I'm glad that Anne Margaret still does not get it - this is a true babe of ladies. Do not look at the rate of this photo. I do not really know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and to see this real secret and low quality movie. You will enjoy it, that is a promise. Recommended a +.
