A Disney movie that dares to do something else should be paid for at least the effort. "Hollus" does not make the same mistake, like a Disney movie hopes for young people in camps. The details of the event for the first time are not explained. Flashbacks serve really a purpose in the scene and present a number of mature topics that might surprise the audience. At first I must admit that I was a little away from the seriousness of the movie. But soon I realized that we had to bear that moment to see the beauty of the story. In addition to the story, this film works well to question some of the methods used in corrective facilities. (An example where Geheimman Jr. is banned from studying because they want to dig their holes, to learn to read, do not contribute to the character). "Holus" is a movie which is smart and beautiful. A must watch!
