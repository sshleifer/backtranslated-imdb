The title of the title shows trades written on the road as well as on the road soaked; Alfred Newman's song "Street View" provides music to anyone. Then we fill the dot. Sergeant Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews), who always wanted to be his old man, was not he: A man on the right side of the law. But he is very naughty for a good man. After several complaints on his offenders, his boss, Insp. Nicholas Foly (Robert F. Simon) demo him. Folie told him that he was a good man, but he would have to get his head straight and be like an egg. Leigh Thomas (Carl Malden), who got just one promotion. Meanwhile, Tommy Scallayz (Gary Merrill, in a superb slim performance) is going to play an illegal dice, and looks at the creation of a Dryer, from the rich Ted Morrison (Harry Vaughan) to Kane Pane (Craig Stevens) and His beautiful wife was brought by Morgan (Gene Terni). She is too late to use her as a decoy to her husband's stats, and Paine strikes her when she refuses to play along. The impressive Marrison intervenes, but Pine cools him down. It seems to be the worst, but later it became active that person died; And the pen seems guilty. <br /> <br /> But this pine story will not be. Dixon soon lost love for Morgan? But before losing her mood again and trying to break it, doing a terrible job. Morgan's father, a fictional taxi driver (Tom Tully), could take a rap for him. It is trying to blame skikike. <br /> <br /> Otto Prumminger's William L. Stewart's novel "Night Cree" refers to Ben Hect and three of them a script for a script. This extraordinary performance and silence is a solid film with all the shady photography and dirty morals we hope from this style. It remains intact until it blooms brightly, which shows something that is used to destroy studio sensors. Of course, the classic silent driven by Premingma and Andrew and Tierney played "Laura." You will enjoy this, but you can not miss that.
