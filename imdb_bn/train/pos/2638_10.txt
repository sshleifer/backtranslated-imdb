One of the best movies for all ages is one. You can not see Lion King again without worrying about the extra history of adding this movie. Almost 40 years old, I saw this with my wife and two sons after working tonight and I did not laugh and enjoyed a movie for a long time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It will remind you how Disney used when you were a young man.
