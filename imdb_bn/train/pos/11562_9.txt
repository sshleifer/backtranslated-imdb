I can not easily understand how bright is the pair of Walter Matthews and Jack Lemons. The movie does not require an additional character like this, because you can not get tired of the conversation between these two. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The labels already have m There are many famous films like Roberts and The Apartment. Fountain of Fortune Cookie (Another Billy Wilder film with Lemon) Oscar wins Mt. This particular movie was not so great because the story could not survive so long running (I think it was almost 2 hours). However, it goes back to a long one and a half, although the role of events reaching Limonno in Mothoor's apartment is quite long (so this sentence was). Although it's a minor impressive and you have a wonderful time for the remaining running time. <br /> <br /> How I was able to suck the follow-up of this film and I will not go deeper. In that Why it may be so much fun is that just as the movie began to boycott the innocence of American movies quickly. There are some sexual references but they have been equally innocent that you could not find "the best, I have ever ..." there. It's fun to see a movie of a long lost era and perhaps it does not work as a reason why Ma'tau and Lamon say a number of F-words and it is not suitable for them. <Br /> <br /> Of course, now the two of them are gone and you may just be happy that you can still enjoy an extraordinary movie like them. I think this photo's only male actor John Fiedler Edelman died recently. So there you have it. Just one of the best comedy and movies. Add <br />: Recently I learned that John Fidler has died so I am deeply sorry for all his fans. I do not mean any disrespect and blahing blahing at the next time I will try to be more cautious.
