I first saw this movie about ten years ago and I thought it was very funny. It was not bad as some critics were making it. It was generally written by the reliable John Hughes shows that you can expect at least some interesting dialogue. (I think, strange science is very good, which was written by Hughes at the speed of lightning). <br /> <br /> All the primary colors of the film - using red, yellows, it has a very big appearance etc. - which looks absolutely unique. Cast is also quite good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
