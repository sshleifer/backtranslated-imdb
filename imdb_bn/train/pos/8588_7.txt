It may not be the best movie of 2006, but there was only one movie to encourage and think. Sentinel is a good political thriller film that feels like some other political thriller films, or even line-in-line fire and stage-wise candidate. The basic plot of this film is similar to other movies: the plot to kill the US President Michael Douglas acted as Secret Service agent Pete Garrison, who led the operation only after discovering that he had been created. As a kind of contender named David Breinridge and Eva Longoria, Kiefer Sutherland's co-star Jill Marin, who is a Rocky agent Agent Brechinis and director of the Academy Award winner Kim Basinghe's first lady Sarah Ballantine, is undergoing guidance. An improvement for this movie can be more because some sources are considered action films like this one of the thriller movies, but instead of plotting a murder plot to kill the US president, the good thing about this film is also a joke about the joke (betrayal) of the Secret Service Reveals, who led the President in a wrong way Giving me
