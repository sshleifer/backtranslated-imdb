I hope Timothy Timothy is going to be good as James Bond's fan of Dalton and although this was not his deserve 'third bonding' but it was a smile. Belushi brought some good humor to her part and the dolton hammered it nicely, but was probably underused. His part was preferred by Jack Nicholson's camp-up version of some good men. It was a bit strange to another Bright, but overal it was a smile.
