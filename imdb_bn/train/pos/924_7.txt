The proud father is amazingly amazing: it is funny, malicious and plays some great voice. The show is about the lion's family acting as the cigarette and the attraction of Roy Shaw. Indeed all of them stereotypes but it makes them so much fun. FOTP is not a Kiddie-cartoon but it has some crude adult humor but also in a very light way. It is full of popculture references and celebrity kayomas and most of them are very effective. I would say, I can give ten out of the show because it has run well but not very basic, I've seen most of the stereotype before even in those special cases!
