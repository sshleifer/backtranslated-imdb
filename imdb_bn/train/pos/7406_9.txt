The treatment of this film is very different. A simple and easy explanation of local Chinese disciplines, looking at the daily activities of public baths conducted by the old owner and his disabled son, when the eldest son returns home, mistakenly believes that his father has died. Every person in the city can also chat with normal spas-like therapy, play games, discuss personal matters and get good advice. When older people die, older boys are charged with strong and faithful family bonding, so public bath operations are not hampered. And finally, the time to reduce the arrival time of modernization and finish the way along the way. Public bath will be destroyed, a commercial complex will be built.
