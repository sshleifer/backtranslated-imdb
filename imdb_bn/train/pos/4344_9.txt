The film gets the intensity of tension between a boy and a father. <br /> <br /> works as a great way to present bright dialogues, beautiful scenery and extraordinary acting onions that keep onion behind the back. <BR> <br /> The contents of parenting, communication and manhood are indirectly discovered. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> All this will happen in a road trip format. Just as the primary fall of rural New York state backdrop is changing colors of plants. How nice!
