In my opinion, it is one of the greatest movies of all time in America and it won every single prize and it has been ranked in the top 100 list of the AFI (although the IMDB top 250 list is shamefully short, it's only written at # 183). If you enjoy playing the highest quality (Voet and Hoffman is a great match), good drawings and innovative aspects, editing and film screenplay, just as much as you did it would love me. Schlesinger has always been holding credible pictures at the end of the last 60's of the New York City scene and is struggling to overcome many personal giant and many victims of the 42nd Street New York City's survival, poverty and despair. <br /> <br /> <br /> The film-making techniques employed in here underground capture New York City's (and city) underground feelings and are not surprising. I saw many ideas stolen by other filmmakers (with quick execution, voice-over flashbacks management, drug / trip sequences, and cartoonist leaked during the assassination during the assassination). br> <br /> The relationship between Joe and the night is conducted in such a way that it is shown as abnormally strong friendship or it is related to homosexuals. I think that the director has not managed to get this time out of censorship in a subtle way, but instead focus on the importance of connecting a strong man to life, whether it is sex or not. <br /> <br> The Midwest Cowboy is a brave, ongoing film, influence and importance which has not lost any of its impact over the years, so if you do not see it, you are not really on the true American classic. I recommend this photo to everyone. <br /> <br /> Score: 10 out of 10.
