I was a young man to know a lot about Rajkumar but in the past few years I saw many violet rain negations and I thought they were calm but I did not want to buy a shirt that I did not know anything about. So one Saturday it fuse came and I decided to see it. I did not know what the movie was going to be like before but once it was found it was great. In the movie Prince was not as a prince but known as "baby". All the performances that I had but my favorite was the violet rain, Darling Nicky, and I'll die for you. When the kabutara jumped aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly began to sing loudly loudly. I was just how cute the driver with the way flirted with Apollonia. When I met Prince and Apollonia's first club, he liked and he stood standing and then he turned around! Great movie and now I can not even find one of those T-shirts :(
