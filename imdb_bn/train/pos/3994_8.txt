I went to this movie because I was dragging it there and I could leave again because the audiences were mainly elderly people and I got out of place. However, this film was far from impressive and targeted at the old people. All of the characters were very real and believable and I discussed the film, characters and storylines for a few hours after myself. There are a number of exciting scenes, but they help you understand the situation better and better. After all, this is a great and valuable film - a little bit of mainstream, but it is not absurd that this movie can not enjoy the mainstream preferences. This is an exciting and interesting movie experience.
