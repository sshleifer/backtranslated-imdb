I returned to Swant Green in 1973 when it was first released and probably appeared on TV or video a few times. It's always one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Houston movies. <br /> <br /> Recently, LA was a twelve film by the Egyptian Theater in Charlton Heiston archaeological. I came out of state to see six films of two days. Solvent Green looks great on a great Egyptian screen with a completely new print. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And Eddie Robinson remembers the past as a great man. <br /> <br /> Their chemistry together is wonderful. The film looks very good in 35mm print. Fleshara really knows how to fill the screen, and cinemaphora, writing, music will be used and everything works about it. The film is very shaky and very powerful in the very visible scenario of the future. How the world population grew, the rain forest disappeared, the wealth has been used, since 1973 the green house effect is getting worse. I wonder why this movie has not played in theaters all these years. His reputation should be better. <br /> <br /> While honoring, people often do not play Churchton Hesson. Looking back at El-Sid, Soulant Green, The Warlog, The Omega Man, Will Penny and Major Daddy, I'm sure he is our best actor. Of course, he made about a dozen big films and what they know for those who care for you. <br /> <br />
