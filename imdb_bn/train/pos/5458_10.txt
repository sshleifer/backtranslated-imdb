I enjoyed this movie a lot. I thought that the plot of the film was realistic and relevant for any time in American history. She always wants to do what she wants to climb in the class system. I think the character of Lily is properly illustrated and it is not possible to do it better. I really enjoyed what he really enjoyed when he really enjoyed it. All the people around the film had love for him, gave him everything, even lost his career. Until she met the Courtland, she could not understand why this man left everything for happiness. The way to end his life was far away from expecting as much as he could. I would suggest this movie to a mature audience so that you can understand the content and the underlying meaning of the film and the plot.
