If you are unwanted in the world of thunderstorms, it is a good place to start. If you burn Star Wars or Star Trek in the fire, here you can be submerged in a compelling, realistic Sci-Fi series. The story of the simple boy-preservation-world-monster robot may not be expected, but rather complex, emotionally compulsory space war drama where the lines between "good" and "bad" boys are individually less than the minimum. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Bullet 0080 Al-Ejurhah, a neutral place colony. He spends the day about the mobile suite and spends his day playing in the fight with his friends. During this series, Al An "Enemy" soldier, Barney Wiseman's friendship. In the end, little al-war may learn some hard lessons about the reality and necessary sorrows and sacrifices. <br /> <br /> I like this OAV series, its great mastery design, story involved, and favorite characters. I recommend this series to anyone who likes the realistic SF Anime, or those who think Anime is just silly or sexy entertaining.
