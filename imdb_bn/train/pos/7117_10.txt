This movie is a fantastic movie. In my opinion it was top notch from everything played about acting. I know Mr. Garfield was blacklisted in the 1950s but most of the movie's videos are not on DVD. The case is going on, why not? A friend will record it off TCM for me but the DVD will be great to have it. They could talk about maritime historic warfare for special features, and if Mr. Schmid's wife or son is still alive, they could also be interviewed. Anyway this is a great movie and I highly recommend it. If it is ever expected then it will not be colorful. Its coloring will only ruin the full impact of the movie. The battlefield of 1945 was quite realistic, the film would be gone. Mr. Garfield did an excellent job to illustrate Mr. Schmidt. Some actors maybe Mr. Sammyd could have been tempted to challenge the part of disability, but I think he did it right. I sincerely hope that they would ever respect the courage of Al-Schmidt in the DVD and the other bodies dedicated to us in World War II.
