Usually De Palma produces a movie with many styles and some scenes that will take you to the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> The style that makes this movie even better as an average thriller. It has some wildly edited scenes and some scenes that are truly nerve debris which will take you to the edge of your seats. The best view from the movie; Museum scene and lift lift. There are some light erotic scenes and due to the motion of film, this movie may not be enough fast enough for casual visitors to fully grasp. So this movie may not be suitable for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is also good but this is the style that works in the movie! This can be for fans only, but casual visitors should definitely appreciate their excitement in the film. <br /> <br /> There are some nice characters illustrated by a good cast. Michael Kine works as an attractive casting and Angel Dickinson works just fine (not bad for 49 years old!). <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> " <br /> <br /> Brilliant Nerve Froing Thriller. I love de palma! <br /> <br /> 10/10
