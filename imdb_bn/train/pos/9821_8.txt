I saw this movie in the true movie (which automatically makes me suspicious) but in fact - it was good. Why? Amazing plot twists or exciting dialogue (which has a little bit of it) is not because of the fact that people are saying that the film was right in the illustration of teenagers related with conception. It's not Dawson's Creek, they are captivating, cool-witted characters who do not wind through sex with the simple wisdom. They are kids and they work like kids. <br /> <br /> They are all confused, painful and annoying confused about everything. Yes, it could be by accident and they may be just bad actors but I do not think so. Dermat Mullrini (not trying to be very quiet) gives very credible performance and I like him for him. Patricia Architake is intense and annoying, but was she pregnant and a teenager? The two adjustments are not exactly lavender on your pillow. Plot was too predictable and so what? I believe in them, his pressure and disability to cope with - his brave, yet a little confused attempt to bring them together. I think someone else has played the role, they were really annoying and incredible but they were not. They reflect indifference about the condition they are in, he is sitting in the class and he is walking with the child in the campus. I became angry for him, I became so angry with him to blame him for his childhood. I feel it all. <br /> <br /> Finally, I liked it and used to recommend it. <br /> <br /> Watch for the scene where Dermot Mullroni is going from a devastating counseling session - career performance.
