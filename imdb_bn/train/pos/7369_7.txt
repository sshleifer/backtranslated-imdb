Personally, I could not get into 'It's Not A Love Song', it's a brilliant film and it's a big story line, I just found myself to check the time of every minute to see how much my phone was remaining <br /> < br /> <br /> I love the relationship between Spike and Heyton, where they depend on each other and live their life. At the same time the relationship was more than relations. Hetton is in love with Spike, but Spike does not love Ibsen Hiton, or he does not know how to love him. Betrayal in two parts, has a big effect on two people. Both of them ran away because others had fled and abandoned them, at the time when they needed each other to be absolutely alive.
