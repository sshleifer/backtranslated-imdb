John (Ben Chaplin) is a lone bank clerk living in a small town far away from London. Although he is in contact with a Russian firm Bride on the Internet. He can be lonely and shy, but he certainly has a good taste, is not he?) And when they meet each other, he understands that he can not speak English. Communication between each other is primarily limited by gender (Again, imagine, a terrible situation for the man, Nicole Kidman has some weird sex!). On his birthday, his two Russian friends visited him. Then, many surprises will happen. I liked this movie: First, it was almost impossible to label. Is it a black comedy, an action, a thriller movie? I believe all the choices are right. Nicole Kidman is pretty cool as usual, and I'm very passionate about her Russian: she's definitely talking Russian in a proper pronunciation, or just faking? However, I found it an enjoyable movie. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "An Iska Perfection" ("The Perfect Byte")
