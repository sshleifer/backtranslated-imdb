Girlfriend is using some well-known sources, however, I watch movies that do not do well or it is not trustworthy. I believe that it is easy for women to enrich the character and thus the movie touches more. <br /> <br /> Although your life and environment are completely different, the film is encouraging both psychological and physical, and I think viewers can still get lots of benefits by watching it. Although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports, this movie gave me a spark. <br /> <br /> So the plot is known / common. The actor is good But thinking that it can spark my opinion makes it average. It made a big impression on me and I know I'm not the only one.
