I actually see negative posts by many people I wrote in August, although the film was not published in the United States until at least mid-September. Perhaps this is the unhappy expats living in Korea who saw it early. I am in the United States and have seen it today. I think the special effects are far better than the trailer. The story was non-western, but I think we used it from many other movies. It was not difficult to follow. The role played by leadership was weak, but other people were quite good. There was humor throughout. I rated it at 8th because it was my good time to see, that I went.
