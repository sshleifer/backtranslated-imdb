People do not understand about this film, it's a beginning, middle, and not the end, it's just the end of a 26-episode long TV series. So keep in mind that when you are not searching enough all the world to talk about. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What really loves me this movie. It was frustrating to see the characters I followed in 26 episodes, and Guizada was walking with sadness in floating debris, when Lia-chu sharpened his blade, it was almost disrespectful. <br /> <br /> Then we got a complete contrast with Lion-Chu's war with this awesome horror dragon (which was featured before the series), when Guizoda is threatening dangerously and indirectly to kill Joe. * Shudder * I was surprised that this particular scenario warns more. Any kid will understand that Guizhou was not himself and the entire purpose of slapping a little girl was. It was enough to annoy me, and I was 15. <br /> Earth is amazing, the plot is much better than most millions of blockbuster, and it was a great way to see me. Go to favorite characters. See it :)
