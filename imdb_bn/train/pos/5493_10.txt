It is really rare that you have found the internal scene of a media fraud that is widely reported as a "true" official and that many "news" organizations, including their pants have been captured. In my view, this film has qualified for every value of journalism - the purpose (yes!), The brave and a real "scope". Without this comment, without counterfeit scenes or leading questions - everyone, including Chavez, fools in their own language equally. The filmmakers had to keep track of "only" events and keep their cameras rolling. <br /> <br /> Venezuelan elites teach us "how the president will resign and sell it as a victory for democracy". It's wonderful that they finally lost - so far. From what I know, the biggest TV station involved has only canceled its ground license, they are still broadcasting through cable and satellite. I suspect George W. or Barack Obama will be tolerant after an attempt coup. But then, do not worry about them. <br /> <br /> "Chavez supporters shot innocent civilians" Repeatedly so much scam throughout the world that the so-called "free" established) media has really become, or always has been, just so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The US secret history of spreading "democracy" around the world, or Jupiter Hopkins, has killed 1.3 million Iraqi wars in Iraq's war, according to "our" - with the effect of the atomic bomb, Not to mention 60,000 Afghans (in 2003) that have never been mentioned. For the purpose, Saddam Hussein was harmful to his people compared to the United States. And the United States is ready and willing to be more harmful to Iranians. <br /> <br /> I am very much interested in the upcoming trial of some Khmer Rouge leaders before the International Hemant International Tribunal; In the 80's, the mention of "our" involvement in the support and training of Paul Pot's guerrillas will be mentioned when they were greatly defeated by Vietnam. . Probably not. <br /> <br /> If there is no fraud, there is more reason for independent media for independence.
