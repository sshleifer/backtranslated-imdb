Director Masel Cheng claimed that it may be the reunion of the autumn story after the eighth year of 1987. Melabel uses rock music to express his life in the middle of this film, in which love, desire and consequently frustration play a significant role. Rock music can not be the best way to express feelings and it is still not unreasonable to use it because the life of underground rock musicians is more intense than a normal. The director focuses only on faint favors rather than rock music, and on the final horror screenplay of life. The love between father and son, boyfriend and friends is distributed delicately and sensitive through fine acting. Mabel Rock does not try to make music artist as beautiful, instead, he is trying to revive the real life on the screen, a massive effort to work for years in this project and Beijing collecting information on underground legs. <br /> <br / Daniel probably gave the best performance of all his films made so far. His birth-centered enthusiasm and spontaneity perfectly fit the blue mood of the film.
