A spectacular example of the spectacular Burberry Berkeley musicals produced in the early 1930s. The audience will be very surprised to see James Cagney in this type of car. In contrast to its "public enemy" 2 years ago. Cagney sparks a tangled out routine and joins addictive tales and intrigues and adds interest. But the highlight of the film is again 3 mass production figures. First at the conservative "honeychandra hotel" number, followed by the very sight-seeing cinnamon "by a waterfall", following the closing "Shanghai Lil" sequence, it only takes part in the opening number of the bars at the top. Counter with ruby ​​keeler Cagney's name, "Shanghai Lil", is excellent but somewhat exciting and incredibly slow "BA Waterfall" after choreography, comedown and anti-climatic If I was a manager, I would have entered the "Shanghai Lil" number in the middle and was close to "by a waterfall", which is the second number of words from water and in my eyes the best of the number 3 3 Production numbers are frosting on cake and James Cagney's performance is added to cake decoration. An extraordinary musical achievement, a 4-star film, final music, good looking observer, you will not be disappointed !!!!!!!!!
