I watched this film premiere this Sunday (1/19) on Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved. Sitting in a theater and initially hearing through the soldiers was more than I could bear. The other among the listeners alike did the same and when we wanted to flee, at least we could bear testimony because the men and women shared their experiences with us. Robert Akhosta, Paul Rickhoff, Shan Hughes, and Herald Noyle, all of the war fighters in Iraq and featured in the film. They can be at home now, you can say this fight still inside them and probably will always be there. Whether you support war or not, we have the responsibility to support the soldiers with something other than a bumper sticker. Check out this picture!
