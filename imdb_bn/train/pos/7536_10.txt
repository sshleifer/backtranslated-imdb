Pat Robertson feels bad and does not have anything to compare that evil and righteous person to his person's bad comments. Bad its definition is evil against the evil. The Bible itself says that in the last days people will call good evil and evil good! He even did not even know that the Bible prophesied full! If you do not know God and now refuse to let him know, all right. But when you still love you, you will eventually humble his knees to him, and you will, it will be too late for you. God does not send anyone to hell, even you do not! You must go there on your own decisions and define it in your spewing! May God have mercy on you and give you a Damascus Road experience. 700 club and Pat Robertson's ministry are still here. Alcoholism, fornication, and perhaps at the end of death, God reached the TV screen and used Pat Robertson to do it and thanked God! You have the right to say what you said but you do not have the right to curse your words. God has mercy on you.
