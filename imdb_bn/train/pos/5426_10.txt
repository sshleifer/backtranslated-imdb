It is almost time that the Ganges Day DVD is released. I can not say how well I've seen this fine movie, but I am never tired of it. The lead actors work so well together. An unexpected team of Victor McGeglane (Seyte McChesney), Kerry Grant (Siege Cutter) and Douglas Fairbank Jr. (Sigt Ballantine). <br /> <br /> I can not get their exploits in India. Your first surveillance on Sergeant III, when you see them involved in war with other soldiers on other so-called Treasurer maps. Three sergeants have been sent to an expedition that can tell what happened to the communication line, which they enter most of the desert city - or they think. <br /> <br /> They take part in the necessary repair and soon find "hidden" residents. They attack a group of crazy people and rarely escape from the base. Afterwards, they were sent to another mission, which gives Sgt Cutter an opportunity to go straight to DGG. They found the temple of gold and trapped the evil Kali supporters. Dean is sent for help and Cooter is caught. Soon McKenzie and Ballantine came with the day, and they are very captive. <br /> <br /> As soon as they are killed, they guard against helplessness because their regiments come to rescue them. The evil activists will watch the clock and make them a wonderful attack when an injured wandering clerk will dump on the golden dome and blow up his bug, which will alert the British to attack. In this way, Dinah was shot dead. <br /> <br /> The soldiers attack the evil and defeat them soon. In the end, Dinah was honored as she graduated in the British Army.
