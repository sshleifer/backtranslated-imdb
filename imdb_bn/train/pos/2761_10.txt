I first saw this movie on 1st August 1996, from Paris to New York Air France. I believe this picture is a wonderful composition in itself. This is such a movie that people should create. I still think Daniel is one of the sex workers around theoutuille. In this French film, he plays a divorced father and businessman, who lives in Down Down Syndrome, a man who is in a company with Down Down Syndrome patients throughout his life. In fact, actors with actors of syndrome make a credible friendship and relationship between these two impossible men. Daniel's life and our down syndrome change forever with humans. He realizes that life is not just work and not for sport, it is alive and loving and that's what life should be like. Although the end is kind of stupid but I still think it's one of my favorite movies. It is enough to bring a tear to your eyes.
