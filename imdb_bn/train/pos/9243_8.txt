Do not listen to many asbestos and satirical comments hacked on this photo ... Simply, regarding the Nizam film, these friends get as good as me! <br /> <br /> Yes it's stupid, yes acting and scripts are totally shocking, but by disappearing - it's so bloody fun! In fact, often in the case of B-movies, terrible 'acting' (which I was ever happy to see in movies, really the worst of them!), And ridiculous 'plot' just serve to increase the level of enjoyment tenfold. <br /> <br /> Clearly, war scenes are such a major attraction and although I'm happy to say most of the time, they are very good dancers, especially the final showdown (in which we see that Nijanya is not visible by general rules of seriousness ....) <br /> <br /> Trust me about this, if you are a fan of movies and you still do not see Saka killers, then you are true Either missing on my opinion, one of the genuine jewels in the style crown.
