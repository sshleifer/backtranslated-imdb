Here I hope to make this film a complete lockdown to read some comments on the message boards - but when I saw it I could not laugh! It has officially become my new favorite movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know what the hatred is here, maybe such a movie has never been around before. I was damaged by the loss of another full female operated comedy name Most of the comedies will have one or two actresses, but there are many supporters of male characters. It was almost all women - in addition to Seth Mears, a short presence of Justin Hartley and Will Arnnet - and it worked. Actresses have delivered a very interesting performance (especially Miss Pill) from a diverse and loving script. <br /> <br /> The attraction of this movie seems to me, his fine feminist message: Who are you? , The success of women in the public, the power of female friendship and the gender role break. Although it is light hearted, every major character faces their challenges as well as their 'feminine values' with 'funny' conflicts and they knew who they were. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pyle proposed that the film has missed a theatrical release due to all its castings and there is a big name actor to get a studio behind it, and I would like to agree. Everyone recommended that I like this movie, and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating the comedy was not widely accepted and successful. <br /> <br /> I love this movie an open mind or female centric comedy.
