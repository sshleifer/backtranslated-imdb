Excavation! To tell Metallica 'what kind of monster' I would like to say, this is a type of top-type documentary on the spine, which is one of the largest bands in the world, acting like psycho kids while breaking. It's fun and interesting. Digging along the same line! Two movies about 'Dandy Warhols' and 'Brian Jonestown Genocide', two Portland bands, who started to watch a song in the house, became huge for only one band and deviated from the history of musical instruments together. Book. Starting from the right, two bands can only make good or bad decisions in the opposite direction. The film has been shown for more than seven years and sometimes we are seeing fame for the painful brilliant enthusiasm (thank you for the Bhadoon advertisement!) And Jonasatton's basic scenes are read by the discoverers to curb vanabab. The band gets more hesitant to stretch the tension of friendship and most often snaps into arguments and even stage fights. See all these half funny and half tragic and faith or reverse. I told you at the beginning that you can see the Metallica movie even if you are interested in the band. Excavation! The other side is slightly different and more enjoyable and if you have a passing interest in the band, see a whole lot easier. Still will not be encouraged as a career path as a good movie and a band of more rules. Excavation! The coat of rock and roll of the tail is a crazy journey and a fine example of being famous or inevitable pitfalls and joy.
