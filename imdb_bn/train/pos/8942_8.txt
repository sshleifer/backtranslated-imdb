A number of participants have mentioned the age differences between Stuart and Novak. She was 25 years old and she was 50 years old when she released the film. I think the difference does not matter for a mystery drama like Vertigo, but it's a matter of fact for a romantic comedy. We can easily understand why his character will be attracted to him, but why would his attraction attract him? <br /> <br /> Yet the film acts as a light romantic fantasy. The scene where the cats look at him across the head, fold his bold drawings and his hamming and the dry words of the cats are true magic. It's a little flashing, so when the scene is moved over the Flatin building and we look at the age difference very quickly. He embraced him, he reached to move his fingers through his hair, but stopped that motion and lightly pushed his fingernail against his hat.
