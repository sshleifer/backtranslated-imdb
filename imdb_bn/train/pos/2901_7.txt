Tiempo de Valientes fits snugly into friendship worker movie style, but excellent casting, extraordinary relationship between her lead and outstanding photography, thanks to her roots. Diego Peretti Dr. A star like Silverstein, a collapsed shotgun with Detective Diaz (Luis Luque), who has been involved in the operation of the conspiracy of the surgery, has been appointed to investigate the murder of two small hoods. Diaz was suspended from the job, but he should be the best person for the job and professional psychological support for the reinstatement. Silverstein and Diaz have soon discovered themselves in a conspiracy involving Argentine intelligence and some uranium, and the film distinguishes them into a very important point, allowing Silverstein to develop some of his own captivating skills. Perrotty and Luque are fantastic together and reminded of Terence Hill and Bad Spencer in the screen team, although Porter Hill is not as classic as handsome. Significantly, Timpo de Valentes does not wear her welcome for more than two hours, and in fact, author-director Damian Sizphron has established a series of possible sequences in the film's charming code. After all, a wonderful and very entertaining action comedy that is not crazy to the lowest universal majority and does not insult your intelligence.
