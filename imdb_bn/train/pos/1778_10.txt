I just want to say that I am very happy when someone tears the beans at this time. Bravo "Spaz", Bravo! This movie is a funny mystery for making movies. Especially for a student film! I want to give credit to spazes, take care to find such a rare picture for a weird time, and then comment on it! Most people know I do not have that kind of time, especially a small number of it will end. Sir greetings However, the movie follows a thin story which is at least incredible and simply plain intelligent. I understand the concept behind creating a mockery of Charlie's Angels but why hire these tyrannical actresses! Also, what kind of work the director did, write, produce and edit photos too! Choose one profession and keep all your love in humans! This is a shame because I have heard that he has created a good movie about a killer toothbrush. Again, thanks to Spagg's bringing the screen back in the film, people like you find a rare one.
