This is a completely fun and unexpected film. You start by following a young man to play football in order to qualify between Bahrain and Iran. Iran will win if they go to Germany in the 2006 World Cup. The problem is that a young girl girl and girl (or female for her) do not allow "to sit with men" in football matches. Performed with a wonderful comedy, consummate skills by a small ensemble shield that followed. This image searches for the absurdity of sanctions on women's freedom (and in that case young soldiers want to correct them). There are some excellent set pieces, not least when the girls will go to a toilet and of course, the stadium has no toilet for women. The camera is easy to work and in some ways this story can be called as a stage play. Yet it is a small scale that bites the film. Great movie No, probably not; Great entertainment - for sure.
