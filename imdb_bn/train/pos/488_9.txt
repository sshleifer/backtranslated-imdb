The part I have enjoyed from this movie was that John Tarturo and Emily Watson (enough to see 2 reasons) did not know much more than that, it was a specific time and involved chess. Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected. So, I do not have to give away so much. Not saying that Tarturo is an amazing, emotional and deeply weak chess genius, and M takes steps for steps such as a thought-provoking woman who pushes him. It is sincerely compelled to love the love and emotions than boarding and after drawing me in the first half hour, I was completely compelled. And I deny someone the last second guess.
