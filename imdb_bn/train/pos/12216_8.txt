The film was released this year (2007) only in Indonesia, two years after it was officially released, and many illegal DVDs found the way to the public. Apparently the popularity of illegal DVDs is popular for the theatrical release, which still comes to public view. <br /> <br /> This movie is an epic, which brings Japanese culture out of your home. Sometimes the comedic story is known to the theater writer, who wrote a story for his theater, the plays of the regular Kabuk Theater are something that he feels annoying. <br /> <br /> The audience is perhaps a little confused about the story of what we are following, but when the story is uncovered, we see that love between man and woman giant leads to a great story for a new poet, uki theater piece. . <br /> <br /> If the spectators are in the dark in the dark, this story seems to have happened in Japanese tradition and mythology, but it does not matter. <br /> <br /> The story of the story is called with the love of the theater, expressions, bright colors, humor and tragedy, making a great journey on the Japanese movie and the roller-coaster of the theater. <br /> <br /> When you watch this movie, let yourself go completely, try to watch it in the movie instead of a movie on your television. <br /> <br /> Although a critical point: Soundtrack is sometimes a bit annoying. Although most of it is great music, but in a few moments of the film, I think they have chosen some more dramatic music. But maybe this is a laughing moment in the story that has been chosen for a light moments in managing director.
