For Slashar Flickr, this movie is really consistently much better. This is the prediction of the predicted-brown buffalo goes to kill, people die, yada yada yada. However, there are some good positives in this movie. First of all, I really wore the mask brown wore.it it's least and probably unique to say definitely obviously unclear (although I have never seen each single slash film made), due to the bad reason something happened before I did not see it, and finally he finally ended her The conclusion contains the novel, as far as I know. I also like the choice of weapons chosen by Mr Siko for most killings. The murders themselves are not as the most graphic. Movies, but it is a small concern. This film does not take itself seriously, which is worse than most slashers. While watching the film, I quickly reminded "13th Friday on Friday, which took seriously the seriousness of the movie, some scenes, murderers carrying a sudden, are very similar to our horror icons. Shot of movement and its reactions and the meaning of how he was going. But there is a scene near the end, where the sweet crazy carries more and more similarity to another famous horror title (actually a complete rip off). And in the last scene, we have Scambag, again, I mentioned that like the first horror Icon Looks exactly like the last scene is almost completely off the rip from another icon in the slashher section. This scene is weak and one pair Law (of course). The film is set in Australia, so if you are a dog for Australian dog with an accent (like me) you will be in heaven, if you are not, it can only be spread over you. Another great thing about this movie : Beautiful Kylie Minogue (not very attached to it) has an unaccomplished, courtesy of Molly Ringwell. Above all, there are no more reasons to see. I enjoyed it and made some fun. So, I have to give "cut" to 8/10, which may seem too much to some people.
