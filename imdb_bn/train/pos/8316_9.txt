I watched this movie every chance I saw, came back to Seventeen when it came on cable. It was my role in Harlem, which impressed me (and Bill Clinton). I was still very young, and the movie made a big impression on me. Other young girls are growing up, trying to determine who they want to be, and a lot better to see a movie that likes some bad choices and good looks. I was fantastic by the looks of Lonette McCoy, they were finally dressed up in big clothes, and blurred conversations. Anyone being raised by one mother, I could really identify with these girls and their lives. It's funny, these characters seem more real to me than Bayonce Knowles!
