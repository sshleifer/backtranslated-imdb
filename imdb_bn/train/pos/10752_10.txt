This was the most spectacular, moving, amazing and incredible story I've ever experienced. Quite obviously, even adjectives can not describe it. I just can not choose a scene that stands for me. I think if I were given a few lists, the fireman would react to the shock of the victim; The people's response, stuck in the elevator, was not known of what was happening; they finally appeared in a horrific scene; Shock and observers' disbelief; And finally silence. <br /> <br /> That day, even now, I remember Star Wars (1977). Obi-Wyane says, "I felt a big problem in the army, as millions of voices suddenly shouted in terror and suddenly kept silent." It's amazing how this description is so amazing, this army was really a problem. <br /> < This documentary clearly expresses this problem: the feeling is incredibly visual, anger, frustration, shock, fear, fatigue, and the perception of its dimensions. It is a powerful and most moving documentary and it is not suitable for Amy because it is 9/11, but it should only be everything. <br /> <br /> <br> /> If you want to see, do not forget to catch a box of tissues, you will need them. I know that I did.
