The movie can be as low budget as it is the best psychological thrill I've ever seen. If you accept it from the low budget starting from the beginning, how well you understand how well the script is written, how well the script is written and how grateful it is for filmmakers to create such a nice thing with so little money. <Br /> <br /> All the elements of a great movie are here. Though visual on the digital, the place was superb. The bizarre, lucid feeling of the film was caught apparently with the view of a conversationist, which was just amazing. This is a trippie piece work, but not in a provocative way, and because of this I have full respect for this film. It is recommended that anyone looking for something extremely unique and impressive, and there are different from that repetitive film that there is.
