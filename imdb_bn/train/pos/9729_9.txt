Weak start, difficult middle, superb finish. Anyway, this is my impression of the film. I saw him in two films - Simon Pagake --- Hot Fuj, and Dead Sean Here's his role, a completely different turn. It shows its range as an actor, but still I do not like the real character because it was portrayed at the beginning. <br /> <br /> One kind of humor I call "Comedy of Depression." His supposed "joke" and intelligence are not something more than really painful and awkward moments. Like the Bian Characters, Rowon likes it. There are other comedic actors who also portrayed the same characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that this is based on the real story. Hmm may be. The story of the film ceases to be annoying, and in the final third, "small people" win. It does not need all the pictures to be sugar and light - but in short, this image has started to become more happy as it gets better. <br /> <br /> It was also a joy to see an old favorite, Jeff Bridges, so playing a role of skill. I like "Iron Man", but Bridges's character was a villain. Purely personal taste, of course, was his performance that was fantastic. Nevertheless, he was a wonder here as bigger than the larger of philosophy, as Sharp's publisher. It was nice to see him in a role that I can truly enjoy. <br /> <br /> Overall, I like it! I just came late for 40 minutes and missed it at the beginning.
