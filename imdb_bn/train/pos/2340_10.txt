I immediately fall in love with "Pushing Daisies". This show managed to maintain a smile on my face with a great story, a malicious dialog and a great acting. But do not do it at all: it manages to keep you up until the end. The basic idea behind the ceremony - to resurrect the human being with one touch, to finish the unexpected condition with the second - it is interesting and may still be in the next season. But adding suspicious murder cases, unique appearance of the ceremony and the highly skilled narrative experience. But "Pausing Daisies" is more than its part. This is a definite charm that I really enjoy and I want to enter the world in Ned and Park in the second season.
