"Ping My My Ride" will break his wheelchair to see an amazing documentary about a teenager (Wemes) with Darius Gius's West Teen Mascular Dstrophyte and his 11 friends who took him to cross-country trips. <br /> <I recently saw this movie at the Sunscreen Film Festival. It played twice during the festival. This movie is about a man's spirit, and a wonderful story about the spirit of Wemee's friends. I do not often say this about cinema, but after watching this movie, I feel inspired to do something for this reason. This festival has taken part in this festival, which won the award. This is the Tribeca Film Festival, and it's going to Greece and Athens. I would not be surprised if this movie goes all the way from the Academy Awards. It is snowballing out of control. If anyone can see a chance of this movie, wherever it is playing, go! Take as many people as possible, and go! It's heading towards New Orleans for a movie festival, then in Atlanta and Palm Beach, FL. From Darius Georgia, so I hope the tickets will be sold fast to show Atlanta if they are not already. Please watch this movie! DGW (talk about it) <br /> - Kish
