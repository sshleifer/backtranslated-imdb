... Perhaps this would be the best word to describe the film (in my opinion). In addition to a fan hack for fan girls (well, that priceless ~), it was that the story blew me away. Tackahisa judges and gaktera for the hare! And I know that some people would disagree with me about this, but it did not have any of the three major actors (shows, sons and anyone who played) which is the best performance (for me, whatever). This was Yommot, son from Royal Roy's # 5! <br /> <br /> Do not make mistakes, I like Hayed, I worship his voice, but the problem is that some of his scenes have been closed, but I like the scene where he dances, The boys are killing. And Gackt was not that bad, I was kind of different from how to start her character. I can not say anything about my background to Li-Wang Wang, I did not want to know him, but his own weight was taken with the star-staided cast. <br /> <br /> This movie has saved the way to a great support I have never heard of, neither is Orange, yet (if it is wrong please forgive my spelling). When the whole song lasts for about nine minutes, then you will not notice the length because you are enjoying listening gait and haid together. However, this movie is not only for fans (huge fan base) but those who enjoy science-frees, future films, Asian-style.
