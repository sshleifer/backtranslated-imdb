I will be honest. I have seen and enjoyed this show because it was fair, objectionable, ridiculous, and unaccustomed. Yes, there are many humor for all the flavors. If you are in comedy that is related to the fun of people falling on the skateboard, for example it would be a great time for you. <br /> <br /> Or, if you enjoy the extreme stunt activity people are bad, you have a great time. And if you enjoy skeletal humor and extreme situations, then you will enjoy this event. <br /> <br /> I enjoy three types of humor which offers "Dirty Sanchez". I like a hard smile with show scenarios Compared to "Jacques" than a park walk. So if you're tired of Jackass's common American stupidity, then try this extreme stupid English in this show. With all the appropriate respect <br /> <br /> This is a show which has a little taste or class. It is not easily offended or recommended for sufferers. <br /> <br /> Now, these guys will see psychologists. Especially the pacos character.
