The Dirty Harry series started with a great crane affair, and almost became light for almost "Magnum Force". During the time that "The Enforcer" rolled around, Dirty Harry was less than a television police show (only reserved by Ten Daly). After a seven-year break, Wendy Harry finally went back to her roots. Maybe he has spent too much time for this time. <br /> <br /> Don Segel made the first, Clint Eastwood made the first well-known Harry movie, which significantly helps. Harry is again a dark character, he does not get nice deals. He can say again, "go ahead, make my day" and really mean its meaning. "Sudden Impact" is a truly dirty Harry Siegel. "Enforcer" should never have been. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 7.2
