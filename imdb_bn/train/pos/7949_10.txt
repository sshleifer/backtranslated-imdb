Speaker Alert <br /> <br /> Homework Band: Incredible Journey is an important film of my life, because it is my first movie which is watching my home movie as a 4-year old scam. The story is based on the novel of Rocka Barnford, and why it is not possible to turn it off as an idiotic lassie clone. <br /> <br /> The original story: Two dogs and a cat live happily. When the family of Savar gets the job of a new husband to the mother of three children, he has to temporarily shift to internal San Francisco, although for the few months the animals are sent to live animals. The bonds that are monitored between animals and children are particularly strong, and Shadow is of the golden age and the Scythian cat cat is impressive as a child, although the young and happy-lucky American is known as the Bulldog Chance. Less anxious and somewhat violent (her part is meant to be abandoned as a dog because of her voice-over, picking up for animal shelter and being bought by the family), although her story is very much like a character during the story <br /> <br /> Pets escaped from the bird and went away from a wide and dangerous desert (the road-filled desert setting), by the direction of Shadow Is ricalita. They fulfill various dangers around, they expect to build houses, when the family and farmhouse hosts are suddenly concerned about animal invisibility. There are interesting moments through the wonderful dialogue between the three creatures and the lively lines (see - memorable quote), and the growing comradeship between the stories, which have been paused by sad moments (like when Sasir wakes his pride in trying to cross the river, in the river Enters into the water and falls under the waterfall, deep in the viewer A moment lost in the way it feels) <br /> <br /> I failed to see how the inclusion and survival of the missing girl in the desert was going on. In any case, it seems unnecessary as part of the story. <br /> <br /> When the shadow falls into a hole in the tragedy and strikes its legs, the last one pushes the cricketer to the cricketer. Up, tired, then wanted to climb up to climb the moon, told him how important he was to him and how he pushed him so far so that he could not throw it so easily. <br /> <br /> The way this scene (brilliantly completed) challenges and sassi leaves an ambiguity in the final scene, but the shadow is never seen anywhere. Then everything is just as lost, just as it appears slowly, and reunited with the family. At the end, the Chancellor talks about his journey and his colleagues who have developed a colleague and realizes the realities coming from the long journey to reach, leaving a great theorem to show how much his character has increased, but how the other two are there. . Hold on for a second, I think I'm going to cry ... <br /> <br /> However, I did not read the book of Rockford, so I did not want to know the difference between books and pictures, or false. But this is a movie that all the family can see, and when Tots love the talking creature, the older viewers will understand the plot line better (as I have seen the film after many years). This movie is a wonderful work in the movie, and I suggest that if you do not see it then you go outside and get it! <br /> <br /> and please skip (see my review for homework band II!)
