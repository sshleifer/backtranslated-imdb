I did not go anywhere. I was on a Vancouver flight. If I did not choose Air Canada, I probably missed this movie. On a small screen behind the front seat, I found these impressive and mesmerizing. I drifted in a few places and had to go back but I had to see the end. Now I'm looking forward to DVD releases in Europe, even if I can close the door, I'll be transfixed, still not being discovered! <br /> <br /> The photographic composition is stunning and the film gives so much insight and 'fills the story of photographs'. <br /> <br /> Recommended (if you have time).
