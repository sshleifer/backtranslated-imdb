This one stood for his originality. I am very tired to see the Hindi film Holliving and the whole band's hatchach patch. Some errors were inevitable, however, this movie must be seen. The screenplay of the Sun's cleanliness, the wise policeman (the painter, the hungry we normally see), was excellent. He came a long way from Neruku Ner's work. I love the movie so much that I had it. I'm not usually the kind of stupid violence, just as I really felt for each character and so I can not call myself 'stupid' violence. I do not understand too much melodrama and sensitive scenes with most Hindi and Tamil movies. I absolutely liked this movie for the same lack. The response to the loss of ACP Unsplugan's wife, not overdone, is like a heartbeat and my eyes want to get out. When I want to hit the FF button there is some time when I'm watching a movie. Many times I wanted to do this in movie halls. Wanted to not have time to watch this movie. I'm really hopeful that Ghajini will be released soon.
