I've been looking for this photo for years. When I was 14, I believe it was broadcast on television in 1983. I can remember that this was only a teenage girl, the crash of the plane alone and the Amazon was saved. I think the man was looking for his (family) and he knew how he could take care of himself - he describes the story and I clearly remember to know the bags under his skin. I do not remember anything more about this movie, and want to see it again - if it is the same - and if you have a copy, can you email me at horsecoach4hire@hotmail.com? I'm interested in getting a copy to see if I really remember the same image. It was aired in Thanksgiving (USA) in 1983 and I was going through my own problems and this movie had a great impact on me. Thanks in advance!
