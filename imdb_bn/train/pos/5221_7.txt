I did not have much interest in watching The Flock. Andrew Laui cooperated with Infantal Affairs Masterpiece Trial, but he was fired from the flock and was replaced by the replaced nils muller. I thought that Lau had made a good film but it did not satisfy the research, so they fired him and hired another director. It usually does not work well (let's remember the attack). But the flock could be better than I expected. It's not a great movie but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller. The character development is done very well and I know the letters very well. Also, the relationships between the two main characters are natural and trustworthy. Richard Care and Claire Dance come up with an able performance. Let's go to the negative aspects. One element that bothers me (at one point it bothered me) was more than version tactics to give the film more "attitude" and style. The tricks that come out of place are their presence deliberately. Plus, I think the film should be more ambitious. Nonetheless, I recommend the flock as a good thriller. It's not memorable, but it's entertaining.
