"Incompleteness" is far from the great movie from a stage play directed by Nick Rog. In the film projects of the disease, it is on most of its post - "Do Look Lie No" is the work, which is considered by Thrace Russell as the lead actress. He is actually very good here, and like the bad movie "Bad Time" and "Cold Heaven" from other bad movies. Marilyn Monroe as "actress", Russell is very effective, she is completely depressed, but portrayed as favorite sir. He played well as well as Michael Emil as Einstein, who is remarkable at least. He sees the part praised, and when Theresa Russell does not look like a mind, he must be quite interesting enough to make the part a real part. If other players are adequate if Emil and Russell are not arrested as well. A pretty effective, intelligent script is guided well by Roeg, but certainly does not brilliantly, like "bright" or "performance". Later, like the disease films, he relied heavily on the obscure, incomplete flashbacks, which made the film very small. In many ways, the film will work as a little smaller (60 minutes), more modest pieces as well. Still, a quite acceptable, passable film. Very nice at times, but a little overall lack. Ratings: - *** 1/2 / *****
