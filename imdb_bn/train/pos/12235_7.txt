"The Incredible Metering Man" is a fantastic conspiracy, crashes and energetic Z-grade production, which is to be seen only for every self-respecting camp - terrible fate! The typical way to describe this low budget 70's mummy is the shameful copy of Hummer's "Quarmorous Expert" ... just a thousand times dirty! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a catastrophic space mission, but makes an awful disease carrier which makes him radioactive ... and dissolve him! After the shock after seeing his face in the mirror (can you blame him?), Steve came out of the hospital, stripped the body of the body behind the sticky piece. Doctor Ted Nelson has to find out quickly, because the disease has also set Steve on hunger hunger for human body. The courtyard may be utterly stupid, but this flick is very entertaining and has a great make-up effect from Rick Bucker. The face of the Guiling Dude looks like a roasting pizza and its heavy breath makes him like a Dryer Vader! Another great advantage is that the script of William Sax does not waste any time in a tedious scientific explanation or mental lecture. Repulsiveness begins immediately and the film lasts until the last moment. Just enjoy this silly horror and try to switch your brain activity as much as possible, because if you start thinking about the many stupidity of the script, you will miss all the camps!
