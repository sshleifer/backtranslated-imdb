The Most Amazing, Spiritual Raising Movie About The Recovery Of The Gospel Far better so far than any other film, or movie made about recovery. If you do not see it, hop on a plane near Salt Lake and see it now. You do not regret it! You really knew about the first honest people who had to fight, in which there was complete and complete faith of Prophet Joseph Smith. You finally get a chance to understand about the persecution of the Prophet and his people. If you have any questions about the Church of Jesse Christ of Lotter-the-Day Santos and our modest introductions, see this movie, then it will create complete and total feelings later.
