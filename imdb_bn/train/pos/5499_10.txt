I had no idea about the information presented in this picture. I took the information presented in the media, keeping in mind the situation: confusing around the suspect's personality: Mr. Chavez A revelation of many realities of the film, I have never thought of anything in this caliber. I think the character was Mr. Chevez, but everyone is coming in the picture <br /> <br /> was important and ultimately the reality of that antichrist: people were too much. Thanks Kim Bartley and Danacha O'Brien <br /> <br />
