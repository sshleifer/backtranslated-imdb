It's really a treat for every bolton fan, some might think it's a little at the top, and it's about the ring and Mark Ahoos, but I think it's like another concert video, that it's a mark, not just a guy! I especially like Alton John and Rango Star music videos for children of revolution. This clip is worth only all the money, I can not believe that they did not publish this version as a single. The movie is really fantastic, especially right for us. Now, I was not alive at 70's. But in general, the Danes were fully fired from what was happening around them. Midi Bolan and T. No popular music or play of the media, including Rex, was seen or displayed, but they played only with Dad, although it was only popular songs. So, I know from my father, seeing it, gives him a part of his youth, he can never get the experience. <br /> <br /> I do not do it too much, so ... if you have at least a bit fan of Mark Bowen, you have to see it. You can find boring or said earlier, slightly above. But at least you have seen one of the greatest musicians! <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes me a little disappointed is that the white voice of the night is not on the tap. But I gotta get it and so, it plays surprisingly.
