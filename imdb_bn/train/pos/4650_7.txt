As an employee of the Swedish Air Force, I enjoyed the excellent Gripen and HPP 9 (MBB B 105) flight scene in this movie. One of the few disappointments is the EWS 39 jammer pod, in this case an inactive Arabic 75 (Maverick) missile as well as black in black with "EWS 39" character. The real jammer pod must definitely not see, at least not what I saw. <br /> <br /> But in addition to this it is a entertaining movie (last minute). Anyone interested in seeing the Swedish military unit, which now includes the legendary SSG, must see it. <br /> <br />
