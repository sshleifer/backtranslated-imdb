This second film is interesting and no doubt as before. We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is indicated on the screen. Then the pleasures come from different ways and ways of their inheritance. We know there will be dynamite in the car, which will lose a wheel, the car can only talk about the crash. And that will happen. Now you have details and details for discovering them in the picture. Some deceased women can be cheated by him, it is clear and he has to come, but we know that he has already seen through him and he knows that he is caught. How is he going to get out now? Do that you have to discover yourself by yourself. And do not worry, he'll get the main traffic but how another story A speed boat does not match our busy beaver in the river. When he is going to be injured, we also know. They do not know what bullet-proof jackets were. It has been discovered recently that some GISs did not have such equipment in Iraq. But what is the meaning of such a picture? Traffickers and victims of this blindness emphasize this that it does not seem to ban that issue. But the film is a constant and perfect illustration which is no value which can stand in the way of this moral revolution against the power of evil. Why can this product be legally valid so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? When things are not illegal or pushed from the path, they all enjoy less fun to use them. It is interesting that it is forbidden or prohibited. <br /> <br /> Jacques Collardou, University Paris Dufin, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sovereign and University Varsils St. Quentin en Yvelins
