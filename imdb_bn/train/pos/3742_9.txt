I've enjoyed this movie perfectly, but it's nothing new. <br /> <br /> Here everyone is grouping it with other war movies, this film has been disconnected! This is not a war film, "A flight runs on the Kakuo horse" is a harbor movie or a prison movie "Cool Hand Look". It is a movie about personality, inconsistency, self-confidence and the type of persona cost. <br /> <br /> Plots are similar to "Flying in the Kakuise Nest" and "Cool Hand Look". Better in the company, and own it. It should be compared against these movies and should not be compared, "now apocalypse" or "platoon". <br /> <br /> Eric
