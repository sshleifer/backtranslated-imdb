This performance of the stack should have got the academy prize for the time being. This is a crime that he did not. It's wonderful how he is a rich-worthless character. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Malone has earned a well-deserved academy prize for his performance. Actually, all the acting in this movie is wonderful. <br /> <br /> The plot starts with taxi taxis, then an air travel begins, then a passionate ride continues, which keeps your interest in caving. You will get entertainment! <br /> <br /> However, it's just an extraordinary soap opera. One dimensional, 100 percent candles. Because you might call it the final candle, win so thoroughly on the acting element. Acting nicely, well guided, but strictly in its soap genre. I do not even call it a melody (such as "Milled Pearce" or "Life Imitation"). While not denying the great entertainment value of this movie, you can only imagine this fantastic cast and what the director has achieved on more important topics.
