"Bend It Like Backhum" reminds me of the excellence of these 80 pugmy-boopers directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-colored world, where everyone is interesting, there are some easy-to-resolve discrepancies, which sometimes move away from most happy processions, and a lot of plots summarized by Montage set in pop music. Something wrong with this, however. "Bend brick like backhum" Full treatment from the beginning. We and my wife completely won the fun of us, and even so, we also praised it as embarrassing to accept (and we saw it, in our living room, or theater). Watch and enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Grade: B +
