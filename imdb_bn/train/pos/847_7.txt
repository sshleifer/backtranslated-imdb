Julian Noble (Pierce Brosnan) Hit-Man Or a "death facilitator", as he is called as loved. He is also a drunk, a man and a woman, and the crisis of medium life. Danny White (Greg Kinnner), who is an incredible businessman who thinks he has just copied a recent pitch, but not sure, in Mexico City's job. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />? But it's not. Instead, Matador studied a fun and sometimes touched character. It avoids each wrapping that will recommend the summation mentioned above, sometimes even drag them even slowly. It is a film that respects its characters, so that they can move with them, feel the need to push them into the keys of inappropriate plot. <br /> <br /> The broker's hit man must be compared to his bond, but this is inappropriate for both performance. A consolidated idea of ​​a half of bond, a product that's gone before; Julian is a fully formed character with its own motivation and flaws. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> with a normal job and normal problem. He envies Danny; Hit Man has become disturbed by his life, climbing closer to his inevitable "Bern Off", as he said. But when Danny revealed his only son's death, Julian tried to change the subject with a dirty joke. He is a man who is "running from a passion" in his own language. Kinna retains its opposite brochure performance, and her attempt is an injection of attractionist Danny White. She is the perfect foil of Julian; When the next drunken is distressing and hedonism, Danny is down the earth, just with an indication of warmth. But he also became deeper than his established personality, when everyone faces far and wide face of financial and family destruction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the highest Visible: hotel bar; During a bullfight, during which Julian Danny says what he is for a living, and takes him through a dress uniform to a murder; And a scene that Julian comes back to Danny's house after six months. This scene represents our Danny's wife Ben (yes, bean) properly. Another example of Matador's respect for his characters, Bean (Hope Davis), instead of being terrified in the presence of a tenant in his house, simply forced to calm down and ask, "Did you come with a gun?" The scripts are not quite good as it could possibly be after another rewrite. One or two lines seem to be forcibly forced, and some of the pairs also need some more work. But in the scene where Julian and Danny (and later Bean) are just talking, writing is fantastic. There is no need to keep the characters in a strange situation (without fulfilling a hit-man and talking about becoming a hit-man on your door). It just allows them to talk, pushing them towards the softly-needed plot point. <br /> <br /> there is action, but only when reflected in letters. One of the notable examples of Julianian getting a job in Budapest is because he sees himself through his own rifle opportunity. The rest is about the character, how they interact, how they affect each other. And, finally, it's about friendship, even at the most promising places. At one point Julian told Danny that he was his only friend. And he really meant it.
