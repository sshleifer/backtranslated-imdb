Taylorland / (2000) *** 1/2 (out of four) <br /> <br /> Black French: <br /> <br /> The audience watched the movie of war throughout the year and understood the potential See, and anyway producers and authors come up with new and innovative methods to illustrate the soldiers of the battlefield. Joel Schumacher ("8MM," "A Time to Kill"), one of the easy-to-run risky directors, found his similar "Tigerland" similarity with steps like "Thin Red Line" on the steps of a soldier's shoes. Written by Ross Clavan and Michael McGathher, this movie has more frustration and ridicule than the "thin red line" or even "saving personal royan". Although the dramatic effect of this film has diminished due to the current distortion of the object, it certainly enlightens us with a new approach to trained youth. <br /> <br /> I would like to know the experience of Joel Schumacher with the army. People really are this unabashed and brutal? I'm sure some of them, but the film looks at its incompatible world in the eyes of a young man called Ralleyan Boaz (Colin Farell), which is rebellion against the ideas of war His personality immediately responded with many other characters, who became his best friend Paxton (Matthew Davis) and another Wilson (Russell Richardson), whose firing often provoked Bozz's tension with the idea of ​​going to war. The war described in this production was not found in the battlefield, but based on the training of Louisiana-based instruction camps in the field of concepts and fears in training. This film is especially about war preparations, nothing less or less. Finally, when the soldiers went to war, it ended, after being a witness in the act, they worked as a super-paid wage earner. <br /> <br /> Staying at a location of around 28 days using 16 mm stock and a small budget, Joel Shuvaat shows a radioactive, distorted, cruel, and helpless environment using handmade cinematography, unique negotiation techniques and direct words. . Evangelical and pierced out pictures make the movie a documentary feature. This unusual style of filming only contributes to the hard core reality of the movie, it is quite graphic to use a bold language, perhaps a bit annoying. Wave visitors to the word of four letter words, some shock what they were listening to. Even the extreme quantities of inconsistencies do not impede the dialogue as heartfelt, truthful, and psychological. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If there is anything, then the country "Tigerland" in the first phase of the war. Such courage must be listed in the army during the war, to know the pain and risk being taken. It is possible to create such thought-provoking ideas through hearty performance of young aspiring actors, portraying different trainers. This movie is not for all viewers, but young people must be watched before enrolling themselves in the army ... and adult audiences must realize the courage to do so. <br /> <br />
