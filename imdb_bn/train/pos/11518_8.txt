You can do a lot with a little cash Blair Witch is the proof that. This film supports it. It's not more than a sitcom between length and complexity. However, it is public cleaner like Sherlock Holmes because it leads to a budget that does not carry a shoe store. The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe, sincere, bursting Watson, his obscurity and gradual foils as Cleese's quick-tempered intelligent. If you ever run across the film, watch it for a quirky smile or two.
