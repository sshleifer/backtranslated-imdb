I have seen this picture and the author-director, Juan Gerard Shona, speak at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I knew it was an 8-year story - how the influential boy and his family and family were affected during the Cuban Revolution in 1958. <br /> <br />'s first scene will be considered as "movie paradiso". In fact, the film fills references to classic movies: the roulette wheel (Casablanca), "chicken shiny" (a reason without rebellion), Bunuel, "Evil's touch"; You will find more Homeless people (George Stanford Brown) is a reference to the Cuban locale that is often used as a black chorus Greek chorus. <br /> <br /> This picture is really the result of dreams. He loved his life to honor Gerard's family and the middle of the film. <br /> <br /> This is Juan Gerard's true story and all the people in it are real, as illustrated in the events. Girard was actually an architect and engineer (and enthusiastic film lover) but he had the dream of making the film. He and his wife decided to live in that dream and Harvey Ketel was an "angel" who believed in Gerard and agreed to be the producer and star for him. Keitel holds the screen as powerful mysterious and secret grandfather "Che". Brown and Keitel thrown America is the only American. Ibn Hijell (High Fidelity) and Gall Garcia (Yu Tu Mama Tambien) give firm support to important roles. <br /> <br /> Actually, the first half lines of the movie do not strictly distribute, but keep it. The last half is better with the events of the twentieth century revolution, and combined for a good mountaineering. This is Juan Gerrard's first attempt, but it is honest and he came with his passion and heart sincerely and sincerely in the first cross-border effort. I'll definitely see it again, and hopefully she's going to continue her film career. <br /> <br />
