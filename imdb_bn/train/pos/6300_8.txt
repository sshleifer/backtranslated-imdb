I like this picture. I will be easy to see it, and easy to forget. After watching the DVD, I ran, did not forget the VB! <br /> <br /> The script is bright, and the welding can not be more perfect. Each character has their moments, and I was laughing hard across the film, at the comedic time spot was on. <br /> <br />
