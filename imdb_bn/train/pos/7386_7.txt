OK, so Oscars seem to get hyped a little more every year. And I was winning "Gossford Park" (come, Robert Ottman was eligible for Oscar for many years!).

Yes yes Robert Redford will know better. But unlike previous critics, Hooper was not the worst host of Goldberg (among the previous hosts, Bob Hope, for which I have no respect); I really like her jab at John Ashraf. <br /> <br /> Although I did not give "a beautiful mind", the "74th Annual Academy Awards" still satisfied me (I must admit, I enjoy oscar more than my own birthday).
