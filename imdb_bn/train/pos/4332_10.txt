Paul Reiser did a spectacular job writing this movie. Peter Folk gives his life's performance. This is an Academy Award-winning. This year was one of the most poignant and fun movies. Reiser's wit was fantastic and as he gets and he was on his long running TV sitcom "Mad Me". Peter Folk did his job as his father, and now Peter who is young at the age of 78, he laughs and weeps at the same time. Helpful Cast Tasks were especially equally fantastic, with fantastic Elisabeth Perkins. It must watch the movie for 2005. We believe that everyone of this age group and religion will love this film and in some way it will be related to it. We are at the movie and movie like this in the movie and siblings. We were both together with good and bad times and the wishes were the same but different.
