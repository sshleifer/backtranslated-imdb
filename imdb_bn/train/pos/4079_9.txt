When I was at the age of 8 on the UK TV, I saw this movie (where it was known as "Loopa: The Flying Island"). I absolutely love it, and after a while later it is repeated and I miss it. I was enchanted by stories and characters, but most of all by hunting and beautiful music. It was the original English Dobbed version that I saw - sometimes incorrectly known as "streamline dub" (Dab was actually by Gibli himself and was distributed only by Streamline) which is unavailable except as part of a ludicrously expensive laser disc. Box set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I think the division is partially released. Voice acting is fine, but the conversation does not have the same raw power that was "Streamline" dub or original Japanese, and I think James van der Baker seems too old to lead. They made some meaningless changes, such as changing the name of the main character from "Paju" to "Patzu", and some dialogue has been added. But I think it's the worst that they have destroyed so many scenes with sincere music - for example, the first scenario of the airship was largely silent, thanks to Disney's Moroccan needs, that whenever there is no talking, the music is going on, which I find many annoying in Disney Pictures. <br /> <br /> This image has still blown up the latest animated movies, and I can not recommend it enough. This plot is still straightforward and the film shows a flare that is sadly absent from the most modern mass market, homogenized animation.
