I first heard this movie after buying the 1976 Flick "Snaf". I was told that the devil's experiment was very good, so naturally I went ahead and guinea pig box set it. I really wanted to know that Charlie Shane was trying to ban this movie or the second, so my interest increased. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just 3 minutes of torturing a woman for 3 minutes. They tortured him in different ways to beat him, forced him to take drugs repeatedly, forced him to drink alcohol, for 24 hours forced him to hear a loud sound, washed his hand with a handle, set fire and set magazines. Burns, burns, and ultimately raises sharp needle with his eyes. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the film is like fake, visible scenes. But then, some part of it really did you very well. The scenes of the women walking around in the circles let me see it. Or it is painful to think about the scene that is forced to hear the sound of 24 hours. Worst eye scene I do not think the shutter while watching it but simply "godly, looks pretty good for such a low budget movie". I enjoyed Flicke but I do not know if you have seen most of the worst kind of offer, but I can really recommend it. 7/10
