I get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears on film, and they were not frustrated when I saw this one. I cried many times but believe that it was not on happiness. I expressed regret for the family and I apologized for this person because he knew himself how he tried to free himself. Denzel was always as incredible, and so was Chris Wakin. Mickey Roberts, although I was not even recognized; The year has not been kind to him. I can not re-watch the movie until my husband is historically shooting the right war (graduate !!!!). He has seen this movie five times now and I have to show the DVD again because he wore the tape we wear and I saw the whole time.
