I can not say the reason for the frustration because I read some reviews before watching and it does not work as my opinion. The bar is not set high, so my expectations are met that the truth is not saying much. <br /> <br /> Good: New York City. If you are in a city like me, you can recognize certain places and realize that the city can be more than just a setting, rather than one of the main characters. Real neutral moments, ridiculous conversations, and plot twists are left and right, which keep everything interesting. Worse: After leaving the theater, I think that I want more, but not on the positive "fashion to leave them more" fashion. Of course, good skates / scenes are worse than bad, but many skits fall into the "intermediate" category, actually many, which eventually brings the movie down. Also, the diversity of New York City has been mentioned in many distant pans and movies throughout the city, but indicates that the issue of city justice is not really implemented or analyzed. For example, most skits are involved in doing well in middle-aged slaves. I mean, the city is inhabited by a population of populated populations, but Paris Jytim's plot and character diversity consider New York City to be truly white in Lancaster, PA or elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You know, maybe you do not agree with my opinion, and probably you will . You will never know until you see it for yourself. This review is not intended to prevent anyone from watching this movie, because everyone in the industry is different from the opinion. I'm just giving a very vague head on what you expect.
