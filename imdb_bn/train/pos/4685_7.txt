Lei Borden's "Love Crimes" (1992), Shan Young is a great DJ. At In Atlanta. She is a person who encourages herself as a famous fashion photographer and seduces women, to compromise her photo, then leaves them leaves (Patrick Bergin) leaves very deeply involved. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They meet, they love, then the things that he knows next, he's on his neck, being fantastic (Note: The striking scene is only in the "Orrtated" version of this movie, and excludes the rated version and other scenes that will make the plot stronger.) There are several scenes of nudity and annoying images of this psychic thriller, such as Bergin's surroundings around his victims Follow one and every step back and forth to the ank. <br /> <br /> As thriller, "Love Crimes" is at its best when Shan Yang is playing his cat and playing the mouse with Bergin, an incentive to try to catch him at work. It's unfortunate that the movie is not over, it just stops. That's true. Director Leigh Borden may have gone out of the story, but after 9 2 minutes the credit roll may be, and we have a confusing "what happened?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> @ yahoo.com)
