Although the original story was supposed to be held in Morocco, the film was highlighted in 18 days in a very tight budget in Romania. However, their cards may be broken, actors and crew can play with their extraordinary skill and commitment, so that I finally get both touch and happy results. Nicholas Costaar-Waldau provides a great performance as bad guy. Provide some gems to the script and direction. Whether you like the movie or not, the title role will probably depend on your acceptance in Alexandra Staden. Other critics have mentioned stenrents as lack of modes as blues. They may have a point, but I found her explanation pleasing and very suitable. Managed to overcome the terrible curious through humility discipline, inherent genius and courage. Sadden seems to be doing the same thing here.
