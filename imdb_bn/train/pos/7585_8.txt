It's a weird, cerebral, surreal, esoteric film. If there are things like "Intellectual Horror" movie, this movie is about it. I started to panic and wanted to see it with me, and it's a plot! I think I want to see this picture again more than once. If you're a person who likes "My Dinner with Andre" and Gorded's movies, or if you've changed a lot of psycho-drugs, then you probably would enjoy this movie. How nice.
