I liked all of Michael London's films and Casting of Michael London's Jr. Dale Medieval "Claire Davies" was not good at all. There is a way to stop this character from Dell Midchef. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The visit was only God's time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think you can see this movie and understand it easily. Still go ahead and want to see the previous three films due to the history, all the characters are behind them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> More movies from her in the future.
