The film had many basic values ​​of family and love. It was the expression of people's emotions and was an inspirational story. The script was clear (it was very easy to make children perfect) and was occasionally enjoyable and ridiculous. There were a few charge marks for viewing. Cinematography was acceptable. This idea was not in the context of many movie-makers working on this day (which is quietly taking little precautions). It was clearly illustrated but it was a nice soft quality. Although the edit can be done better, I think it was a beautiful movie to enjoy a family. And the organization of information is only thrown to you that I do not like, but it was a good movie.
