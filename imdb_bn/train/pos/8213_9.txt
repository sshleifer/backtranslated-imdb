Anyone who testifies in our judicial system - or lacking it, will really appreciate this movie. There were not many shades of gray or complex colors. Almost every character in this film illustrates what is best and bad for our society. The popularity of this movie is probably because of one or more of our time, most of us have been forced to deal with the names of Pambi, Lily-Lived, Melly-Muted bureaucrats as well as Skambags, who empower them as "Political". <br /> <br /> Performance was compulsory across the board, I was sympathetic to the victim of rape - at the same time, she remembered how she remembered her, she was proud of her former attackers, especially in the face. Among the most annoying characters in the movies that I saw were Dike, so his former victim was well off his face Was nice to see. Lead to the rapist and psychopath equally ugly, so it ended up only a voice to the poor Harry stopped surprising fashion. The first is that the Dirty Harry Siegel was the only one Saga.
