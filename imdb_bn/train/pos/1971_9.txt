I have no idea what the people are complaining about. I saw this movie yesterday and I really liked it. The stone again delivered a great character. She was just as good at first as the Basic Institute. He still has those smart but clever answers. Although Sharon may be 48 years old ... he looks amazing! I'm not as fake as a Barbie I care about. She looks good and that. Basic Institute 2 gives you everything you want from the first. Gender, violence, and a great ending that will give you thoughts and talk for hours! Half of the commentators did not even see this movie. So do not listen to them.
