Since I was a young child, I can remember this movie, I loved it and still do. I was able to get it on DVD for my 18th birthday and was glad because it was very difficult to find before and it was rented when I was young. My favorite character is Charlie because she learns to be a good dog. The movies are filled with fun songs and music. Animation bright and character voice perfect. This movie has always been a teaser for me, but I think I did not see the film when I was young but I did not see it as fascinating and attractive, I still believe that I still like it because I like it too. Am really in the animated movie.
