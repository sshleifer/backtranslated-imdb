Seriously, people say good to Antz. An intense movie, but I enjoyed the bug's life a little more. I can not miss another Pixar animation except two Toy Story films, I started to laugh so hard. Animation is clean, story is original and does not promote. What is to do in this movie over the voice. Dave Foley gets a hearty beat that gets himself in much trouble. Hooper is always a wonderful characteristic of Kevin Spacy, Haydn Panettiere as dot. Starring is also supported from Dennis Lauer, David Heide Pierce and Madeline Kane, and I could go. The script is superb, so funny and sometimes touching. Ant's lack of social messages, but what we have is rock-solid entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
