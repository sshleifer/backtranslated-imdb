This is a famous French sex empowerment of the decade, among which Gerard Depardieu and Patrick Deyen played a very satirical role. It is available by Blair, one of the many dark psychological plays in seventeen / eighteen years of "Serie Nair", "Buffet Foed", "Bau Pere". However, if I want to correct the previous comment posted in the movie: The title translated into English is far from the French version. It is true that both the plays are "going to the place", but the literal translation of the French title can be translated by "Waltz Dancer", which is the metaphor of the movement of laboratories.
