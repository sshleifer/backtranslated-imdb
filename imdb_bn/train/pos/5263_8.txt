For information on silk stockings, this short feature is to be mentioned in Netflix. That extra-produced fluff is superior in every way. This was much better than Cole Porter's song and much more power. Silk stockings have become a big disappointment. Fred was getting too old for such things, though Dance and Cyd are lovely. I will watch for Garbo - Melvyn Douglas version of Ninotchka. Peter Lorr was ill when making silk stockings - did he seem very passive with very active numbers and fewer lines? It is very happy that I have a pure accident across the road. The whole experience is more enjoyable. Bob Hope, the authentic joy as a simple "song and dance people".
