There is a lot to recommend to me that any movie that PIGs (public servants) show that they are in real life as a crazy threat of power. <br /> <br /> Well, supervision and editing of scripts and, sometimes, direction is faulty, so there will be people who disrespect the whole movie and ignore good moments. <br /> <br /> I saw the original path when it was new and hated it, it despised, it hated it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please, consider them as two different movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For those who want to promote uniqueness, who believe in human rights, who recognize the threat of independence By doing so, especially the federal government can be. <br /> <br /> "Voice" with the state policy, wearing a cap on New Hampshire: "Live Free or Die." At one time it was the policy of most Americans. <br /> <br /> Despite its obvious flaws, "Vanishing Point" is a movie that is very happy.
