When the songs were not displayed for the crewographer, we had a nice movie like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wodehouse and Hollywood are not quite mixed, but close enough . Some of the humorous American Vaudvillie, the slopstick, is not ironic, Vaudhau's conflict with British humor. But overall, American style barter considers American characters to be real rather than cardboard characters. <br /> <br /> For some of the dancing numbers, up for the lack of a Busby Berkley on top of dance numbers along with some amazing staging, floating floors and nice reefs with fun mirrors. They feel more realistic, if you can imagine that people started singing and dance as realistic. <br /> <br /> The lack of genes Rogers and Eric Blore does not hurt the film, but rather they can dynamise in different characters. It's a nice cracking, headstrong love interest is not nice. Instead we have an interest in a gentle gentle love, much more to be observed with Wodehouses' young elite women.
