All right ... this is a weird ... really, I can not tell you all the BEST's internal plot points, nothing happened in the first 45 or more minutes when I lost interest - but wait, <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, you will see "Best" The scene takes place in the search of lost sheep in the forest surrounding an elite woman walking around. The sheep end up dead and the woman is afraid. Shoot the best pop ups, chick rapes and over 400 gallons of spunk on it. Eventually the dog began to enjoy the "attention" of the animal, resulting in the results of some novel symulated sex scenes, in which there is a strange sex foot masturbation scene where the woman shakes the creature beside her feet and the giant loads huge loads everywhere. (Yes, I'm getting a foot fetish on my foot - so blame me ....) ... The whole movie is called flashback and long windscreen dialogues, which is considered to be a bit tiring. A "damn" but predictive finishing ends this very strange movie ... <br /> <br /> Best is a movie that is hard for me to lose. Cinematography itself is quite attractive and set, costume and position wide. The plot seems to take it spontaneously serious for a little bit slowly and a knee-knuckle knit like a rat-bear ends up in such a strange sunny film. The film is a good bit of tits, ass, and hairy 70's French bush to help make for the first half of the smoker. I really want to say that if this is not for graphic scenes for all the BEAST's graphic scenes, then this film was really a real boro - unless you like shameless conversations and some graphic horse sex (at the beginning) a horse and spank covered female horse vagina Boning two horses including a very up-close and private scene ... YUM !!!). But BEAST sex scene is so weird and one of those fresh changes from the rest of the film, which I want to say, that the scenes can only be made for a real snoop. I recommend to all of them that they think they saw it - BEAST rape is really out there and there is something to give evidence. Also 70 of 80/80 sled movies have been recommended to any fans - this is a pretty high quality with them. A look for you sick moth-fox fowl lovers (like me) ... 8/10
