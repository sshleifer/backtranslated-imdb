Jafar Panahahi's comedy-drama "Offside" is trying to enter some Tehran Sports Arena through which women are banned. Official Reason: Many dirty language, and football players showing their legs. But of course, it's really a case of sexuality. So, most of the movies are composed of light-hearted relief because women try to ask men's serious questions about banning women from the stadium, and a woman even brings her own plan to defend the men. <br /> <I> I understand that all the movies of Jafar Panahir (this included) are banned in Iran. The actual tragedy is to overthrow the CIA's 1953 Prime Minister and after the support of the atrocious Shah, Ayatollah Khomeini gave an excuse for establishing a forgiving society to use the narrow interpretation of the Qur'an and to present the current policy of George W. Bush to Iran, to help Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's cowboy and strengthen censorship An excuse for Above all, it's a handsome appearance for people to come up with ways to challenge the system. Not a great movie, but worth watching. Considering all Jafar Panahi films have been banned, I am surprised how they can create them.
