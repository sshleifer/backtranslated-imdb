Walking to the house after the movie, I was going to dance to Natalia and Alexander, the familiar Waltz music. I've heard before - where? Ah, from Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shot" (track 2), 'I got it just like the door reached. It is played by "Jazz Sweet No Waltz No. 2", by the city of Primherim Philharmonic Orchestra, composed by Dmitry Shastkovic. Yes, I took the soundtrack of the tower. What a treat! Alexander Displeat's movie score was full - there are fifteen tracks without two tracks of delightful Waltz. It is often these days that we do not dedicate a complete soundtrack to a fully integrated film score. The memories of Morris Zaroo's favorite song remind me, Annio Mikeron (track 6's early notes are traces of "Novo movie paradiso"), Georges Delreu and John Barry. Strain and notes from string, celeste, piano, and harp have fine fineness. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and John Tarturo provided a credible acceptance of pair performance. The story of love, his close connection, like his child in Alexander and Natalia, is still his inner shocking pain, and much more in his liberal and brave understanding - a relationship for both of them. Marlin Garris, director of "Antonia Line" (1996 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in the Netherlands) gave us a quietly sensitive film - without his uncertain human conflict, curiosity, passion, family effort, love and respect. The front-end matter is the mind-game and the mathematical reasoning of the chess. In the 1920's it could be a light tearzer in a play. Senatomology captures the cruel beauty of Lake Compo in northern Italy near the Swiss border. <br /> <br /> If you love to go to movies then I highly recommend soundtracks. Alexander Despotit's lyricist of "Luzin Defense" completes the film.
