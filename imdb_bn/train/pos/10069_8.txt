This film is valuable for the beauty and acting alone, but there is also an interesting cultural data of aladkaran. Both women and actors (both combined with the role of transvestite opera star supporting role) are unable to play a universal role in China. This is an old street actor and a young girl has an unlikely bond between more powerful relationships as victory over the local culture. <br /> <br /> I was the only problem with this film that the tendency of swelling with soundtrack was unnecessary by the performance of actors. <br /> <br /> A welcome option for unhappy summer cinematic movies.
