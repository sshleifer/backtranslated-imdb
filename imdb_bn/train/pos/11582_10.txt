For anyone who thinks Jane in the Daily Mirror Strip cartoon, this film is a nostalgia exercise. In that context it is wonderful, but the young visitors will undoubtedly find the comedy laughing and the actors will miss that point in the cartoon characters. The platinum is a little longer for today's audience, but it is very well reflected in the greatness of the 40s and 50s. Jane, remember, was a fantasy piece of war time, which was created to increase the morale of the soldiers. He gave a double meaning "strip" in the strip cartoon. <br /> <br /> The story is common with the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard. The theme was known to readers of that era, a group of Nazis separated by some tomb in England and set in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> See for the fans of Gen. For the rest of you, a damp squib. <br /> <br />
