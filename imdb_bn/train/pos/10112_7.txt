I basically put one back in a movie theater in this week's 1996 run this back. I was under the impression by it and my feelings did not change much. <br /> <br /> The infamous Edward D. covered his life and movies. Documentary about Wood Jr. Those who worked with him or knew him were interviewed. These include: Vampira, Dolores Fuller, Bela Lugosi Junior, Loretta King, Gregory Walcott and Paul Marco. Interviews are mixed with movies or some bizarre entertainment clips. Is it interesting (somewhat) but this was really needed? I have seen all the wooden movies and they are just terrible. Wood was a height but not a bit of talent to carry them. I have never said that he is the worst director but he is there. Do we really need a docu of a very medium film maker? I like something that they did not try to satisfy some outside of the wood. Some of the interviewees (especially LuGosi junior) hate most people and come through loud and clear. They also completely disregarded their films in the adult film industry in the 1960s and 70s. If you're still a fan of Wood, then it's an interest. Best interviews Vampira (who separates wood tears) and Dolores Fuller (longtime girlfriend).
