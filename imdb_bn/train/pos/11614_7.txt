This is controversially produced by the best film director Heim Buzgolgo. Trained by an expert TV director, long story, and directed by his actors, he tried to capture a very low budget movie, especially under the permanent danger of terrorism, attacks on Israel's very psychological condition, resulting in 'distorted' life. Each character is trying to save his own life, watching and controlling others, being controlled by other characters and then with regular pressure, by political and historical power, outside his control. Some people call this fate, but the film has a very strong representation of the fate. <br /> <br /> There is no clear political statement in 'distortion'. Characters never discuss politics, even at the point of saying! When they heard that a new terrorist attack happened. Their reactions to the incident were counted using the official and media terminology for locals attacking and the dead and wounded. They do not live in reality, but live for a bomb to survive and wait for the next event. Personal, social, professional life seems to work a bit, but it is deeply flawed and affected by the events. The main character directed by the director is a playwright who is lucky enough to increase the medieval personal and creative crisis by the pressure of events and to carry out terrorist attacks a few minutes before the bomb blast. He recruited a private detective to follow his girlfriend, who is a TV investigator reporter, whom he suspected of falling into the next show - another failed person, former military, whose business and family life emanated under the events. He started writing a game that would implement the carbon-copyright and bring it into the theater in the movie scene, which reminds Hamlet and 'Snydcheche, New York'. Charlie Kaufman will not have the courage to doubt Bjgel√≥l's shoulder that he must not necessarily, but the next image (and the first being directed by Koufman), the Israeli director screen brightened. As American film actors play with real people and meet reality with them-match-union-level-meets-reality-reality that is not least rational, at least not artistic reasoning. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do it. Its style is much more free than its TV series and 'distortion' effects, though borrowing from American horror movies works quite well. The ending seemed to me a bit incompatible and unhappy drama, but the shadow of suicide killers who are hunting the film and the entire situation in a temporary loop will follow the audience while remembering this film.
