It's hard to find this film as well. The hero of the movie (and author and director) Simon Gaste - a man "with an agenda." She made a fake magazine for interviewing Los Angeles in Los Angeles - actors, models, musicians - who believe that they do not smell their own clothes. With clever dialogue, Zucovic succeeded in this work. Sure, the budget of this movie is probably paid for the car used, but this film is so difficult and so good that it works very well. Anyone who can reconsider the 'Scrum' of the Edward Munque Reflection of silver trash bin in a local coffee house, must definitely be nominated for some of the awards. Give this picture a chance and listen to what it says ... because they are building the same car since 1986 ... it's called 'cars'. Bravo, Zukovych, Bravo!
