I've been looking at this mini series for a long time and I'm glad to think that his memorable ability prevented him from examining time. <br /> <br /> Most of the 'Perfect Perfect', Lekker's best novel adaptation, in my opinion, the top drawers. Its outstanding aspects are the musical score and the skillful screenplay, later written by Arthur Hopkcraft, writing, I believe, a few years ago, artists of 'Tinkar Teler Soulier's Spy' with Alex Guinness a few years ago. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Peter Egan is interesting to see because his face varies with each camera angle. The effect on the physical presence of time and characters is done very credibly. I was amazed at how old Peter Egan was at the time of the filming. The character of Magnus Pim is a young actor named Bendict Taylor, who may most likely replace old Peter Egan with ease, from Oxford, only a quarrel comes. But it's a minor and unnecessary SIM. <br /> <br /> When Egon becomes a gentle word only then it is difficult to believe and he has to "feel bad" emotionally, like tears There is no easy time for actors to do with these moments, the most wonderful Francis Temelti, who has played Pegie Wentworth for all his pricing and easily stole this episode. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That is, Mary Pim Rudiger Weigong Axel, funny, satirical and brilliant. I also enjoyed Sarah Badell's camp turn as Baroness. <br /> <br /> The British view of the Americans is clearly written in some dry sunny scenes. When Yankees came abroad in conflict with Bo Braamel (Head of MI6), American soldiers were portrayed as an empty-headed Baboon, who have reminded a long word from the dictionary and have generously torched them with American Jargon and Psycho Bubble. Many of English's disrespectful misery. <br /> <br /> Humor and sadness are very mixed. LeCarré has a knack for combining elements unlike his story and Hoppah has captured nicely sadness, yet wistful, original atmosphere. <br /> <br /> A perfect production (what?) and still LeCarré adaptation to reach film or television from the best dates. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for lovers of all spy-thrillers and especially lacquer fans. DVD available from acorn.
