Mar√≠a Brun married her and her husband in the middle of war between Hermann. A blast started with the building, and he and Hermann had to sign the papers on the street with a rock. Probably something that might happen, which might be the metaphor of heavy hand for tomorrow: Maratha marriage, so to say. This is a wedding event where the husband goes to war and stuck in a Russian prison camp, helpless but optimistic and proud Maria, who stands beside the sad road of the train station, some come home, others do not, with a sign waiting for Harmon. <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As one of us, we see Maria as one of the best (Hana Schuiga's role in this role). Be sure to work in a bar for America's GI, but he will stand by his man, even after Harmon's death, he heard from a fellow soldier and he It will stand near the black GI and near the birth of his child (ie, naturally, he reappears Ben and a murder takes place, and the wrap so that she may be safe), or a German businessman (effectively sympathetic Ivan desani) and sometimes accessories and rising star in the company. Maria will succeed what will succeed, but she will always get married. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to say about Maria that is not interesting. Money, sex, strength, all these became interchangeable for Maria. She is like a woman who got her cake and ate it with a proud smile: She gets less or less (much less for the last ten minutes of the film) when getting the accessories - a man who dots on her whenever she can, servant, secretary, A new and costly house with money - due to the poor condition that others around him might already have or live somewhere with a person (like a secretary, enough money Played fairly) by the fasciinder's mother) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> He speaks of American soldier and the poor and the sick and ill Oswald - he loves them and at the same time, after being released from prison, confused and spirit The investigator's husband Herman sent it from Canada to the same pink. . She has published a profile that likes to fall in love with a feminist fear, but realizes where she is coming from and going all the way. <br /> <br /> Fasibindar uses this underlying conflict and goes against Maria Murray for a few moments of conventions. Melameda (for example, Harman kneels and walks in half-nude Maria and GI, an excellent painting scene, Marie's reaction is not surprising or guilty, but due to authentic happiness it can be seen that she is living alone) such as an aspiring strategy to her gun as a director A story that should be predictable. But it is not really that. This is a big metaphor for a country that can not proceed to normalcy after the war. The fasciinders sometimes put the sound of the radio in the background and we see that Maria is roaming around her family house and wandering around her and the radio speaks of a divided Germany, which is still very annoying. Maybe the only way to cope with is extra, or is it just my explanation? <br /> <br /> It's really hard, the faces of eyes and eyes, whatever. It's such an incredible performance, one of the slogans that attracts the glamor and charm of an old-time Hollywood woman starter with a down and dirty policy of a street girl. Most do not say that the opposite dress sees a scene in a scene when she is finally with her husband, where she gets dressed up without thinking about this piece of super-ridiculous black underwear and high heels, and then even after doing it. It's almost a summary of what Maria, and Schuyuga, surprisingly it has diminished, is a headstrong but somehow loving person who is disturbed and confused by men around her, sometimes in one sentence. The fascinator holds it in the wonderful first part of its "quarter"; Although I like Veeronika Vasa as the best composer overall, Maria Brun is perhaps better as a characteristic of character, which sustains a woman and there is nothing to lose.
