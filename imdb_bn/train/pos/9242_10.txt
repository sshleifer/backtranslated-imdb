It's hard to rate films like this, because you're hitting it or producing it fun? <br /> <br /> I saw this photo in 1988/89 or when I was a boy and I'm sorry to say it started long life with Nijda. The plot is terribly frightening and acting is terrible, but in this movie there is a certain mystery surrounding Nijon which creates a very good environment. What are the battlefields important, when a 'little' sparrow is really good. <br /> <br /> I must say that when I was a boy, then I can now see the incredible dirty thing. In film, but "Come back with a few beers" I can not blame it like a martial art film, it is far better than the "American Ninja" mountain, and the genre stacked hundreds of millennia in the 80's. <br /> <br /> In an interesting note, the writer and director of Sakura killers, Dusty Nelson Bonar, film the flag of the film "White Fantasy" Was. Sakura was not meant to be a series of killers, but I do not have any idea ", but the Sakura clan is similar to the same logo with the same logo and similar story with white ninja, although it was also scary in most cases, the atmosphere was a small feeling but To be sparse and erect, very terrible. <br /> <br /> So, if you're a martial arts fan, it's a blast for a few hours. Let's fight!
