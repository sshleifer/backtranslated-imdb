"Ko to Tomo Pavo" is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Before the beginning of World War II, it is a tragic event to see deep and deep impact on the fate of human beings in the eyes of the ordinary and ordinary people of God-devoted provinces. I saw it in a small film theater in Russia, where there was very limited distribution in the film, and since then I have no chance to see it. It is tragic that this wonderful movie is almost forgotten. I searched for a VHS or DVD copy many times, and lazy - no one found I would be most grateful to other fans of this little wax making film for suggestions on buying copies.
