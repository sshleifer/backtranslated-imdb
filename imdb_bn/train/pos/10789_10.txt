When I was a kid, my parents got me to watch this movie. I really liked it, and I saw it over again. Even when I was in the Third Class, I have seen it from time to time. Recently, I saw it again, just for Nostalgia, and although the show was not noticed for my age group (I'm in my late years), I still am entertained and educational. This show teaches well along with good lessons and others with imagination. In some parts I found quite entertaining. Also, there are no bad stuff on this show, so you can leave the kids alone through this show and do not worry about picking any bad language or what they do. I would recommend this.
