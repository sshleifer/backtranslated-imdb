When Filo Vans (Edmund Loay) stands uncertainly at the corner of a balcony above the city, apparently being hypnotized and gradually stepping in step by step to his death, after another nine years, reminded me of another film, "The Women in the Green" Between Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rothbone) as well as being transferred to hypnotised. <br /> <br /> Both Happy, Filho Vans and Sherlock Holmes survived the assassination attempt by illegal criminals. This scene is both exciting cinematic mystery. Will they imagine that you can not cloud the imagination of great imagination?
