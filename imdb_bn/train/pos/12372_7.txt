Sentinel is a movie which was recommended by my dad many years ago and I have seen it many times. It always guides me to entertainment, effectively being vague effectively Flashback scenery is really made for me. Cristina Raines's father runs around all creepily, with two awesome women, always manages to send cold back down my spine. It's a good versus thing versus your ideal, but at least it's managed to be entertaining. In the end I consider the best one in the history of Harrow. Buzz's Meridith was at the edge of my shot after seeing his work as Cheyenne, with plenty of flashing and suspicion. Sentinel has the perfect build-up. We are not completely comfortable if Alison is on the screen. We know some terrible always waiting for him, and that thing made all the more tense. This movie is often neglected by the horror fans, but I personally think it is better than this and it is certainly satisfying for all the fans. <br /> <br /> acting Cristina has its timber in the rain, but although there is a great way for the most part. She looked beautiful, and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural. Chris Sarandon boyfriend, Michael is as great. She had an instant screen presence, and I could help her but not help. Martin Barsam, Jose Ferrer, John Carradine, Aha Gardener, Arthur Kennedy, Silvia Miles, Deborah Rafin, Jerry Orbatch, Richard Dreyfas, Jeff Goldblum and Tom Beerner have a memorable role. Burgess Meredith is awesome as Chazen. He looks like a normal old man, but what we find is absolutely horrible. As Eli Wlach and Christopher Wlaken as well, as the bumbling detective. There is a cool view of Beverly D'Angelo, which I will not loot. <br /> <br /> below. Sentinel is an effective horror film which is a hara fan, sadly neglected. This will give you thrills and intimidation which will make you happy. Look good appearance <br /> <br /> 7/10
