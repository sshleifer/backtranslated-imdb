Sindhui Yaman, sometimes without a doubt, is one of the best ghost stories made in the film. Written by the Siling Pool and managed by Sue-Tuong Ching, a Chinese ghost story has it all in it.

Loneliness alone is dangerous with wolves, and lives in a crazy Tawawandi monk temple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is forced to seduce men for his wicked , But when he meets innocent sex Choi sin they fall into love. <br /> <br /> Ling Ling Sin is a fool stupid but his heart is in the right place, when Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the jungle, he tries to protect him from there who is trying to kill spirits in the forest . As he breaks into the great martial arts, even a beggar even drunken song as he performs the religious Taoist sword form. The film is very old martial art films, acrobatics, magic and flying in the air, from trees to trees, with elaborate long gowns and scarves, but the film flows and everything is effective. <br /> <br /> Tsing is married with an evil tree monster, which can not be good, and we are not really nice to those who meet her sister and maternity where we feel her woe in her house. <br /> <br /> They will eventually fight a tree wing with a deadly tongue, and in order to save their souls to go deep into the heart of the hell for a thousand years of evil war and to properly bury the link ashes may bring them home His regeneration is a chance. <br /> <br /> A beautiful story that really gives attention.
