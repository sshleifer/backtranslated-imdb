Although it's definitely a tear-jarker, it's definitely a "feel good" movie. All actors are excellent and Will Smith works as always, and it's good. I could go but pick up ten out of "10" ratings and they're even better and probably better said. However, for my comment, I must include at least 10 lines, I would say that Rosario Dawson was unknown to me as an observer. Her performance was most enjoyable and I was waiting to see her acting in many of her films. <br /> <br /> This film shows that Will Smith will not have to prove anything in terms of his power as an actor.
