This movie was powerful for me. I do not want to be a spoiler, but a friend of mine was years ago; We were like brothers. For any reason, I could not vote for this movie, which could be 10. I got a message saying "no vote was done. ..." And yet I saw the figures there. I'll try again tomorrow (Monday) <br /> <br /> I ignored minor flaws. It got me the relation between the characters. Beautiful acting and real situations. I was in a couple of them. <br /> <br /> A movie is a small jewel. Just like "spring forward" other neglected gem. I'm still having a very happy movie like this; Relationship between people, good writing, sensitively unfolded with acting and direction in the first class. After all, is not it all about what?
