Although not a horror movie in the traditional sense, this provides a little bit of movie products. It looks like a small animal in a small German city has a skin animal that is different from its blood. Police Inspector Carl Bretschender, among his first roles, is a suspect believing that a vampire amok is underway, a suspect believable in Melvin Douglas. His only reliable Ruth Bartin (Faye Ray) is the Inspector's Girlfriend and Lab Assistant Dr. Auto von Niemann (Lionel Atoll), although apparently a prominent scientist went with the theory of vampire. The inhabitants of the city suspected the Hormon Gleb, who played with his usual frenzy by Diet Fry, who enjoyed much fun about his role. There are a number of comedies in this movie that help in some of the benefits of the intensity associated with the killing. In a fun part, Gassy Sandapman (Maud Uren), Ruth Bartin's aunt, Harman thinks that Herman has turned into a dog without a bat. Maude Eburne and Dwight Frye create a good comedy team. <br /> <br /> This budget brings elements from the movie "Dr. Calgary's Cabinet". From the "Frankenstein" man's use of blood to create laboratory life and "Dracula", the assassination is believed that everyone except the inspector and the daughter of the bleeding worker believe it. Thses are well mixed by the director Frank R. Strayer with a little comedy thrown for better measurements. Concoction works. The recovery version I saw tinting used to increase the spooky atmosphere. If possible, try to view this version.
