Soldier can not have special effects in acting or Lucas but it certainly does for me. I will not tell you what it is about, I'm sure you already read the essence. This is a great destructive future action / science fiction movie. Cart Russell does not say much, there is usually a lazy or drone appearance on his face but it fits the character. There is great action and war scenes; Some of the scenes are unreal, but Hollywood believes this role is to be released from our normal life. I have not seen soldier 2 but this one is my favorite one. I digs up on a movie that there is a guy that is lucky enough movie; We both love this movie and those who love hard guy / sci-fi movies recommend it.
