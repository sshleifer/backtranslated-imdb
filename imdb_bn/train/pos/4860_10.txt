A sad daughter is happy because of a terrific supporter cast under the leadership of the great Garcin song, Fred Astyayer, Joan Fontenay, and under the leadership of Gracie Allen and George Burns. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As Barns, They concoct a story of having a love bug with her left and right victim fallen. He ran into Fontaine who was captured by a royal aunt and a guilty father. Cruel plot <br /> <br /> One of the great songs is a Fogi day, things no link up, nice work if you can get it, and I will not be bored anymore. Fontaine is not singing, but there is a brief (and decent) number with Astaire. Among the few dance numbers with Astaire, a varnish and allen well wonderful, including an inventive and fun ramp through an amusement park. <br /> <br /> Reginal Gardiner, Constance Collier, Montagu Love, Harry Watson (as Albert, Ray Nobel, and my favorite - as John Dogton's Lead Madrid singer in the cast <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> Her expression was pleasant, she was a scene runner in WC Fields Comedy, The Old Fashioned Way, Cleopatra playing on paper. <br /> <br /> Most of the misuse has been done in this world, because Zanzar Raza The absence of the absence, which has been mentioned elsewhere, has been disappointingly frustrating: TCM host mentions that Ruby Keller and Jesse Matthews were considered, the father would be more catastrophic.Fontaine Alice is just as fine and dynamic musical numbers as Aster, Barnes and Allen With wide comic relief. <br /> <br /> Fun pictures, great songs, good cast, and John Ugagana a rare spotlight!
