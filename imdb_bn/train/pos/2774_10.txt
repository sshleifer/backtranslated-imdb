All of me have a story telling movie and acting The story of David and Bethsheba is a tragic event that can be felt deeply by reading and understanding the Bible account. In this film, I think the story of Gregory Peck and Susan Haredd was their best. David and King of Israel to know and understand his journey and understand, all of these stories are more compelling. You can feel her desire for a beautiful woman, Gregory Pack showed the real body of this person who was bigger than her life. Susan Hayward's fear, reluctance, but the loyalty of her authority was illustrated by her as nicely as her king. Someone might have felt the pain of David that Uriah entered the house instead of night. As well as when he was killed in war, he was sad. Raymond Messi's powerful and authoritative condemnation made me feel angry at him. The set was real enough, and the atmosphere is trustworthy. Above all, I think it is one of the best films of this kind. I gave it a rating of ten.
