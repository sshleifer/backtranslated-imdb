This picture has a special place in my heart, when I first caught it, I was teaching adult literacy. It was very true to me and even I was an outstanding student. Scenes that embrace you emotionally and those who laugh at your face with your character and illiteracy with their condition. <br /> <br /> The fun and Robert Dinner's performance, which is rated by their best work, is a great turn, the most enjoyable and rewarding experience by a young Martha plummet, an inspirational story line and a hunting musical score. .
