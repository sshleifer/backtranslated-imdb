OK, sorry, but I like this movie. I love only 80 of these types of movies, because you do not see many such people! I want to ask all of you who this film is merely a rip off, or a chessy imitation, is it imitating? I have never seen any such movie, good, not horror. <br /> <br /> It is essentially about the popular group of schools, who want to make all hell alive, so they decided to choose it. Marty son named Marty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But ... they only accept them! So they go back to the old school, and fall one after the other ....... Yes, you know what's going on! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I just disappointed me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, * ~
