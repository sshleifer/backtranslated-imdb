I would say that this film gives a panic intimation that a young mind can face when a family is divided by divorce or other disaster. I would recommend this movie especially for parents or family planning for the family. <br /> <br /> I think the characters are attracted and very sympathetic to many sizes. <br /> <br /> Although the scary monster is not scary to most adults, there is a very real indication of what might be the reactionary imagination of the unknown horror-faced child. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is fun!
