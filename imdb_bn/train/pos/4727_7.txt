I'm very surprised I liked this movie. Wicked writing (some got "inside" jokes, others I did not - probably because the actors spoke on top of each other), great acting (notably John Casini), great camio, interesting and unique instructions. I hired to see Jeffrey Mick (very disappointed, he became very disappointed, shocked and you will miss him!) But the movie got extraordinary entertainment. I will see it again before sending back to Netflix. I want to act and actor actors will enjoy this movie perfectly. Finished somewhat expected but they are willing to do some different (and more positive) work. Very bad movie "festival" was found better except without the market. I recommend those who love acting biz.
