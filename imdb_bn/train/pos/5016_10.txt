This movie is my very favorite one. It is difficult to explain why. It may be that Corinne Neameck's innocence and Cheryl Pollock's courage, but they must have something to do with the soundtrack. Also, there are a few lines or movements or moments in some characters that are making fun between themselves and themselves. Finally, the story always spreads to my heart rhyme, and the last scene is so diverse. After all, I love this movie; This is a gooey, sensual girl perfect for the night.
