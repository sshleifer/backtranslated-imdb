Excellent story about teens, leaders, high school football "big". How far do you go to protect your friends? False, kill? How can you lose if you stud by an innocent girl? Can love to beat love? Can you defeat small people in narrow minds? When your friend scores and you "lose", do all you can to pay for it, or will you be a man about him, and respect the right to choose? Do you rape her and show a "problem" girl as your victory? To take your own opinion, to make your own decision, to take your own opinion, can only stand for the sake of sin? It seems to me twice before giving my verdict about who was right and who was wrong, but definitely - a very annoying movie and the theme is in general. Sabas!
