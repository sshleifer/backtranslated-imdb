I went to see this movie twice in a week and can add it to only one word (which I usually do not use lightly): Wonderful! In my view, ever made the best movie. Who is the winner of the Oscars and other awards that made the final full-length scene of this Swedish crew? The character of Daniel Darius's reveals many feelings and long-repetitive feelings among the people around him, the film does the same to his audience: you feel the excitement of your head and your heart full. Great stuff! The next time you ask yourself "what is the meaning of life?" Perhaps you think about how you feel after a wonderful experience like heaven: good, stuff, full. To say this with Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dolowie: "These moments are enough"
