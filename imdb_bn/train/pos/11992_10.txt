As I remember, I was flying and flying. I am now in college with a private pilot's license and want to be a commercial. Before I came across my old tile spin tape at my basement in my baggage, I could not cover this issue so much and it hit me, it was. My parents bought each single tape for them and this was the only show I would see as a child. I reminded the theme of growing up and I can still quote it again. It's absolutely amazing and I plan to buy DVD soon! It's really great for children and adults and absolutely timeless. I do not get enough of this show.
