Interesting, fast and fun <br /> <br /> I am not one of those people who see loads and television loads. When I stumbled across this show the house was sick in a bad case in a day flu, and immediately hooked up. I developed quite a crash on John Burke. He did a wonderful job of hosting both shows together and clearing together. You can really say that they both loved their work. <br /> <br /> Super Colors sections were excellent. I feel interested in something that I have never given a single thought before. <br /> <br /> Do I really want to know: what happened to dog jac? One of the hosts took him?
