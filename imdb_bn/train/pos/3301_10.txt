In addition to this, it was one of the few movies I have ever touched (by-Bye Madhuri), it is one of the most well-crafted Indian films ever made. From the fine-made sets, that hunting shows Mina Kumari, nobody can forget it. Pakeezah music is amazing, if you can understand the glorious poem, and much more "OMG, 5 minutes another song" one in the movie. Feel the trauma of Shahjahan that you are wearing in the amazing jewelery you wear, and it is helplessly walking the court, the court fountain. <br /> <br /> a parody of all the dreams you have dreamed ..... .....
