I must admit a little frustration with this film; I read a lot about how spectacular I was, but the real future took the sequence, science of science, very small amount of film. The sets are excellent and when we reach them, and some interesting images, this final order is in many other areas .... <br /> <br /> Most of the pieces are in the middle section, and then it's the 'high concept' From melodrama originating from the nature of science-fiction, and inadequately arising from strong dialogue. This part has a lot of people's lives, though the topmost fleet of the greatest Ralph Richardson small dictator, first called "boss". I dislike Richard Messian's lazy, confident visitor's presence and ideas, Richardson's behavior and line-up delivery. This boss is a postering, firmly misleading figure, unable to understand the small fry of its state ... it is not a great role, but Richardson makes many things. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The interesting thing was that any religious aspect was completely avoided; The 'upcoming things' seem to be a little ultimate goal in the anti-war brutality and science, but it only continues. In the last part, there is an enormous effort to raise some arguments and tensions in relation to some personal arguments, but most of them are still dissatisfied. The film does not have much interest in fine fineness; It goes for barnstorming spectacular and unsubtle, blunt morality, every time. And, of course, remember the Hedge-Bit Finale: Raymond Messi is getting lyrical about the uncertain things! <br /> <br /> In relation to a question about the picture: I must say that it is not considered as bad, since someone explicitly permits that the description of life is found to be the right one. The glorious idea has some of them; A war in the 1940s, perhaps it was probably expected ... for 30 years, the mind! In 2036 a nuclear bomb - "super gun" or something like that - a technocrat socialist "After the 1970's, we do not believe in the British government in independent countries" - Hmmm, one that is not near sorrow, chaps! ;-) There is no real politics that is shameful; All surfaces have a very pretty anti-war feeling. In general, it is believed that the dictatorship - Boneheaded-Laddight-fascist, under the boss or the scientific socialism of the hand-to-pump - * will be contracted * and these effects are not lost ... we must remember that in 1936 Nazism and communism How to change - even if they did not have any knowledge about how they were exempt - lack of consideration in this matter is to create movies in other subjects As well as his views seem humble. Most of the previous things should be spent in my opinion - and maybe; Only brief things could be necessary from '1940', but this segment may be rather scholarly and it's age before moving to Richardson-Messi portions. I liked to meet more with Margaretta Scott; Who is just a trifle suspect, cutting the spiritual picture of a flashing eye of the impossibly worthy. The character is not searched, or explicitly interpreted or exploited, without a scene that I will not loot and its relationship with the boss is not sought; But then it was in the 1930s, and then there was such a thing that there was widespread institutional censorship. Edward Chapman is gently amusing in his two roles; The first is like a hapless chap, praying for war, just fooling through other Messi characters. Messi helps a lot of himself, his parts play with restraint and intelligent mix, in contrast with most different casts, Richardson saves, and Scott and Chapman do little. <br /> <br /> I would say that "Things to a" made in Britain in 1936 is undoubtedly an extraordinary movie; Date is one of the few serious British science fiction films, indeed! Her set (piece) design and harnessing resources are ravenous, incredible. <br /> <br /> However, the script is ultimately overwhelming and mostly in most places. The direction is a flatness trend, though it is encouraging a beautiful gear or two. Cinemographer and Mr. Richardson is not really the rescue thing though; An amazing, disgusting performance that created the feeling of surprise and consistently beguiles the wonders of the technology of technology. This kind of shame holds the whole thing so small material or genuine filmmaking; It was a perfect director to do this work like Powell and the Preservatives - they are brave directors, bold visual storytelling characters and co-workers of dealers in first-rate dialogue. <br /> <br /> "Things to come", it stands, it's a confusing curiosity, which is valuable, far less than "metropolis" ... in Wales's words, as long as it is "long" it's like a miraculous power With nothing to do with
