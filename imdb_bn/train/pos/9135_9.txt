How bad I get purple rain reviews, this movie does not care about the rock! Nice movie, all of it, great music (thick prince!), Romance, and drama. <br /> <br /> It's really a very sad movie, very moving. I do not want to say anything more, I can not exclude the plot, but I would say - this film is very realistic, because of these problems there is so much romantic relationships that many families feel the same as the one pictured in the picture. I see it as very realistic and so real, the movie makes moving much more. This generation of my generation is getting bigger, so many of us have loved the Prince and there are many things to be related to any teenager in similar problems. She said, this is definitely not a movie for teenagers, ID recomend it for all ages. And it's not all dark, the movie has some great music, band performance scenes and sexy fun scenes between Prince and Appelonian.
