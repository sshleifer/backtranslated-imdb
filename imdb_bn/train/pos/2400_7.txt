I see what my forebears saw young young girl Bate Davis. He is almost superb in this madcap political comedy, which actually surprised Warren Williams as a political operator behind his sin. Vivienne Osoran is as bright as her ex, and I found myself rooting for her throughout. Williams is not all sympathetic to the character, and he does not even have a decent op. <br /> <br /> Guy Kibbee is the best one what he does. In order to prevent the contestant from nominating the candidate, he was dragged out of his political meeting and nominated as the candidate and elected to be the governor, so this whole mess was born in a party called "Progressive Party" in which internal political war was born. If you are in the political heart, you probably will see another group with Williams and Kebbi's representative "Progressive Party" representing one. I can draw the right parallel, but we are not here for that. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie for those who love this old humor for us. If you've seen one of the old Wheeler and Wolsey titles (Sunny half shot), you'll see Frank McHug as Williams's right hand, looking and behaving a lot like Bart Wheeler. He made me fool. <br /> <br /> Yes, I recommend both my wife and my wife.
