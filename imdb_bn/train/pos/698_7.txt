I have seen this movie a while ago, after ordering my friend, who is a large Dominion fan, The film was very interesting, although it was a positive aspect, which is for me the Donnie Darko type "WTF?" Factor after the movie is over <br /> <br /> Of course, negative points also come with positive. To me, the young man of this film was incredibly good and the Dominican Monaghan did a great job. Unfortunately, I do not have the opinion of Daniel Bark, who played Lonnie. It can be just me, and I do not claim to be a serious critic of myself who does not think of being a serious critic, but he does not seem to be a believer as an actor. But perhaps it is more interesting, although I am not a critic but it draws my attention. <br /> <br /> Finally, I think it's a valuable movie. It's interesting, confusing, and you should just see it.
