This image is an entertaining, fun and quality film. If the book follows a very clever guide, then the book tries to stop it in the correct lines. All of the actors are appropriate, and you will be expected to be their part. They use some famous actors who have a great effect on the film. Some parts of the graphics are a bit dodgy, and there are several errors across the film. For example, there is no such thing as yellow spot laser. The camp is not terrible as explained in the book, and they do not show the incident going to camp like a book. All his groups have been mentioned in the book, but there is no picture in the film. Overall, a great film for a rainy afternoon
