The law enforcement agencies have been created by the same indicator of 'Divorce, Iranian Style', just as it has been said, and there is a glimpse of our divorce court in Iran. Now they concentrate on the court system in Cameroon in Africa. What is great about this court, that of the two magistrates, which is unusual for such a country. However, they use a lot of men to catch their way around women, but this film is so extraordinary that it seems that there is a great progress in society, divorce legal and women's rights are being recognized. So the judge often punished men at the behavior of a primitive behavior at this time. The women present in the court do not get soft treatment. One of the main focus of the film is an incident of child abuse by Annie. The judges did not waste time in making fun of women. Who said the trial is no more? Behind the bench with this 2. They often carry the highest punishment! Yeah! You go girl!
