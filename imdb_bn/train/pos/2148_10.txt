While watching TV I always look forward to watching this movie. I have to get the guess DVD. Different types of range are great. It tells me that if they make enough efforts, then someone can be a dancer. My favorite character will be Mr.Aoki. She is so quirky but full of passion. It's a perfect movie with excellent dance. Unfortunately we will not have the chance to see their Blackpool go. If they were to do it for the perfect sequel. But I think it would leave your imagination to be what it might be like. <br /> <br /> is a very simple and innocent story. He was loyal to his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I did not see the Hollywood remix. Not sure if I want to. I really do not enjoy Jennifer Lopez. I think Richard Gere has more similarities than Lopez. I have a feeling that the remake is not easy and innocent.
