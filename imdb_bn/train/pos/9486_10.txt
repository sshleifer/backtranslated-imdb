Finally, there is a thriller that can affect the behavior of cars, explosions and other eyes. The film consolidates a common plot (a French president assassination) with a nice background. It monitors the human behavior with the authorities and explains why we will obey almost every order (even murder), which will be given to us. <br /> <br /> It also shows us how secret services can run history and how they can be controlled. The best thing about this movie is that there is no classic "Hollywood end" which can be easily predicted.
