Perhaps the best imagination film ever made. Handsome color, spectacular set, incredible, spot-on Miklos Roza musical score, perfect for each scene and mood. Acting is remarkable and can be striking and striking in the hands of the lower hand, but the poetic dialogue here is impressively narrated (humor is fine and delightful). <br /> <br /> Suspicious Spielberg and Lucas were enthralled by this one. One of two best motion pictures of Alexander Corda and London Films - "The Four Feathers" (1939), and one of the best motion pictures ever made. <br /> <br /> is a true, compelling classic!
