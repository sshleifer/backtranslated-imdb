Professor Johns Rook (Boris Karloff) has discovered the Radium X - a powerful force that could use atomic energy. Unfortunately the rotating pathid was polluted by radium and started to burn in the dark - and its touch caused instant death. Dr. Felix Bennett (Bela Lugosi) develops an incentive - but he becomes crazy due to Radhium and Antidote and kills him for betrayal. <br /> <br /> This plot is stupid and "effects" seem to be ridiculous in the light of Carlough's light, but it's still a funny little killer. It comes quickly, has some great atmosphere (the circular rouge "house" and the movie begins on the night of the dark and rainy season) and Karloff and LuGosi (as always) give great performance. Frank Drake (as Rook's wife) and Violet Kimble Cooper (as his mother) and performed well. So it's okay, but just below the other Karloff / LuGosi movies is a pure. The plot is too far for me to carry. I still like this. I give it a 7.
