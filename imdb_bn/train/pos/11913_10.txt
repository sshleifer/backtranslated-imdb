This woman is a wonderful film for the creators of the body and the female staff! I think Suu Kyi has done a great job in this film series (Sample 2,3,4) and proved as a great warrior. The powerful nebulous (Sample 2) has a very attractive appearance and iron desire to prevent it. Although the great cost-acting and well-rated acting skills are not the best in my life, the film itself was something extraordinary, a worthless jewel for fans of female body-building workers! Well, some parts of Nimesis 2 have been copied by other famous scientific-films such as terminators or predators, but this is not a matter. The point is at that. Pine is a very talented body-maker in this movie who has been able to show all his power and body talent what he can do. I really enjoyed that movie and saw the same enthusiasm as Nameses 3 (a rather annoying series) and Nimesis 4 (3 more interesting seagulls than). It has not expressed any regret in the DVD: ((
