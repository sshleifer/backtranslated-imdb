This is a colorful slasher movie. It's about it <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a mystery element that Scratch has made so popular in Slashar movies, but I do not care about such things. Finding the wrong person is that the thoughtful things are not as interesting as considering all the confusing things. <br /> <br /> Death scenes were inventive and poor, reminding of the horror films of the 80s as of Friday 13th. Another great thing in this movie is that it is difficult to identify the surviving girl differently, like Scrum and IKYWLLL, where it was obvious. <br /> <br /> Those who do not like slash movies will not like this movie. It's easy like. I really enjoyed it and waiting for the same kind of wait to see it again. <br /> <br />
