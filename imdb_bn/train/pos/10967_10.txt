I first saw this drama in my drama and dramatic course. I was awed at this documentary how beautiful and raw. This is a sincere aspect of the reality of the neutral life. The family is interesting and I have shown it really a Little Eddie at its core. ** As well as my professor told me that throughout the filming, Little Eddie Cameras has penetrated with one of the men. ** Beauty, which I find, comes from the normality of the family's inconvenience. It is clear between the relationship between mother and daughter that no one can work in society and you begin to desire for rehabilitation in Little Adi's society. Finally, the film is determined by its aesthetic qualities and it depicts wonderful beauty. Two thumbs up the way!
