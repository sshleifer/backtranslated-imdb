This movie seems like a film project. Although filmmakers choose a cross division of society without any experience and begin to work. The characters are uninvolved and naive kind though. Despite this amateurish feeling, the movie is effective. This is like a cross section where the surrounding children are trying to understand or follow their honest sexual feelings. Being raised by a parent of a generation, of course there is a shame in sexuality from that generation. This is provided for some expectations but well-matched rivalries. Perhaps the most enjoyable was the original character, its romantic relationship increased slightly by the depth of the depth of sexual feelings. A good watch but nothing stirring ....
