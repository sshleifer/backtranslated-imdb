A jewel in the movie, so good that they make a signal. <br /> <br /> This movie starts really well with a nasty monster, who is eating some people and a party, where two main characters are the first to keep an eye on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> Hell, we all saw the vampire movie, we know the format. The movie can be seen, but the actors are very woody and they do not want to stay in the picture, but it can be all part of the frustrating ambiance. <br /> <br /> Not end of choice, but there is a signal, it must be tracked. <br /> <br /> When I saw the film Brendan Hughes really did not fit the part. Afterwards, I could not stop thinking about him, he extinguished an eerie sensuality, so perhaps he was right for the part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Where is he now?
