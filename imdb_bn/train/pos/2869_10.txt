First of all, I want to say, "Thank you, Disney, finally for the release of" Cinderella "in the movie! Now you have all the Disney animated movies in the DVD (including the limited versions of 1999)! What are you going to do? You are going to Disney World! Well, technically (I mean, look at the castle !!!!!) <br /> <br /> Disney, in its 1950s animated classic film "Cinderell La "is a magician, in which the film has put fairytale movies on the map. We all have a story to tell the story of Cinderella, her kids, her date, glass slipper, pumpkin, which just say" BPT-Bupt-wife! ", And of course <br /> <br /> What I like about this image: This is a huge old fairy tale that children now have a movie form (as well as DVD is also included) !!!!! <br /> <br /> "Cinderella" - Thanks, Disney !!!!! 10 stars.
