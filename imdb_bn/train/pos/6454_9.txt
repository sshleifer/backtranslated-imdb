I saw this picture at the Palm Springs International Film Festival of 2005 and I saw 14 movies there, it would rank as my # 3 film. My initial interest was with my ancestors from the Norrland region of Sweden to be Swedish descent. I also grew up in rural North Woods in an area of ​​America where many small towns were like the settings of this movie. It looks like watching more movies by using rural locations such as their settings, Sam Iamelen. It was a very good movie and I'm sure it would have to be dragged together in a big film, but some of the director Pollock really stopped it in the absence of instruction for nearly two decades. Helen Szolom was fantastic in her first film as an actress and I would like to see more than that on the big screen. I enjoyed Michael Nyqvist in this good round molding lead. I highly recommend this film and will rate it 9.0 at a scale of 10.
