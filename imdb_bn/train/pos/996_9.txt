This movie surprised me. Some things were "clicheish" and some technical elements had me played "Smarter State" Will Smith. But in most cases, for entertainment - with Jamsie Fox and Music Epps, Ips and 2 Winbug bang Julio and some mix with Ramundo (some comic reliefs). This is a movie that you can show again-say ... some are nothing more when Wednesday night. I gave it a 9 for entertainment value.
