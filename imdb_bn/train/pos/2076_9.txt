The Good Earth is a great movie !!! Everyone will see ... it tears and warm heart. It is applicable to increasing the quality of love, consistency, humility and love for the family ... The story can be related to our lives today, especially in the poverty threshold. How we respond to this problem is very important and if a person is not strong enough to face such a thing, then he can be defensive and vulnerable. These characters are very happy about how young actors even justified their role ... their emotions influenced the audience. The film is made in black and white, but the story is so entertaining that you do not want to end. It really makes great! This should be a re-made for a very beautiful movie.
