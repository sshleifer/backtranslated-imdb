I am sure that most people already know this story - sadly there have been visits to the three spirits of Ibnizor Scrooge (Christmas past, present and still come), the way to save some of his life in the hope of preserving and changing his soul. Dickens' classic tale became the favorite of a favorite holiday in one form or another. <br /> <br /> When I grew up seeing Alastair Sims in the 1951 version, and I believe he is a certified screw, I was influenced by this version, which was released when I was in high school. George C. Scott plays a believer and meaningful Ebenezer Scrooge, and the acting actor of the ghosts is rather frightening and tragic. David Warner is a good Bob Crichit. <br /> <br /> This version is nicely illustrated and uses more modern filming styles (for the 1980s), which makes my kids more favorite than the 1951 black and white version. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's a suitable adaptation of the story and I watch almost every year in the Christmas season.
