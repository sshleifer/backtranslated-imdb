This is my favorite because I saw it in the theater. Since then I've seen it countless times and I'm not tired of it. There is a lot to do with the setting (Colorado I know it will be jealous), but the story is original and I like how it uses the small town mountain people as heroes. I have not been a movie I can compare this. John Lethgo plays a smart villain, but how I love him completely from his material - he has to follow him behind the money and that's why he keeps it interesting. It's an action movie of the best. I do not think it's one of the most entertaining. You will see ... <br /> <br /> You need to shoot 50,000 rounds to qualify as Action Movie. It just kept captivated by you, not shell-casual.
