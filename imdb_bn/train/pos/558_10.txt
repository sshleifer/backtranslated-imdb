Classic Drama / Action Western's incredible cinematography which is better than its time (1954). The product is very good and you can say that it is done with pride and love. The unique focus of American Northwest pioneers is very educational and entertaining. This movie is rated very low because most people do not like to see the reality. During this special time and space, "the lawyer" today was very corrupt / corrupt just like most developing countries. Although the programs could have been more realistic, the film has actually added most of the requirements. For visitors who want only pure testoterone type Western film history and philosophy ideas for this film are more for them .......
