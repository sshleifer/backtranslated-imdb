This movie is incredible. If you have a chance, see it. Although, an alert, you will cry out your eyes. I, every time I see it, and I own it and saw it many times. Performance is outstanding. It deals with darkness and pain and loss, but there is hope. This English film has seen me differently: a great experience like my English teacher. Also, if you have seen it, please note the interesting use of shadows and light. The Home Room is a wonderful movie, and I found it 10/10 - for the real - because of the excellent acting, amazing plot, and heart-twisting dialogue. Very intense, very moving Not all answer, but makes much better points about mankind
