The Devil Dog: Hell of Hell is a really good movie. Richard Krena and R.G. Armstrong The song is wonderful and the devil gives a chill! I like the effect on the dog and I think the animal itself looks really cool with its horn, it's just like the necklace and has really worked sticky! If you like the horror movie and did not see The Devil dog: Hand of Hell will be able to find and buy this rare movie before and it is a good film, and I do not think you will be disappointed!
