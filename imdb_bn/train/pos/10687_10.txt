I must admit that I was totally shocked by this picture. For one, I went to see it for some mediation hope, but it was given, it was the most frustrating thing that it was in a popular American movie. This British comedy is its best - dark, playful and funny that American films are sometimes not. However, I must stop briefly for this sincere recommendation to anyone; I went to see some, some English, some European and some Americans, and some of us like it (mainly from the first two groups), some people hate it and it seems worthless. If you think that you go then into such things then. If not, do not. 10/10.
