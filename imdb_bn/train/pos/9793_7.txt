I gave this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and unknown Batman created an interesting "guess" game. The film also requires more robin in this. He was present at the beginning of the film and in rest during the rest. I always think the new Robin character cleaning new animated series does little justice, let alone Knightwing. This movie just continued to bad traditions. The film spends a lot of time in Bruce Wayne and her romance, which will not be so bad if the romance is not so incredible. If you're a Batman fan then it's still a good movie and I would recommend watching it.
