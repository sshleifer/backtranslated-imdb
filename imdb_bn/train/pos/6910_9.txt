Paul was completely ripped by someone of paramount who made Dave completely. This is the same story, though not funny. <br /> <br /> Paul was related to me about this scene of Salim Davis, Paradora's new national anthem. He reached Brazil after a long flight from Vegas, had three planes, traveled in the car, etc. He could use a cane to stand tightly. She was in a trailer about my bathroom size. <br /> <br /> He does not know he can do it. Then he saw 6000 extra crowds, 7 taka. He came to life and they shot that scene for two hours. He is great, then almost collapsed. <br /> <br /> Paul is a great man, though very generous. A real talent
