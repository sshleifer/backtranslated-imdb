Everybody in the everyday life we ​​know from Sugium to Aoki and Coke from Taoyo. They were very normal, and the transformation of Sujiyyam is incredibly trustworthy. So moving the score, it brought my tears. The dancer was beautiful without athletic. My disciplined dance and charm gave me a Huspamp. Tamako is such a fantastic delightful character. He can often see the charming schoolgirl in her mouth, reminding her of seeing "The King and I". Ooki's character is both ridiculous and kind. Mascot is a very upset wife as a wife, you almost want to assure her that everything will be okay. <br /> <br /> This picture is really a defender.
