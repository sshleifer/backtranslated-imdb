I keep an eye on this movie because I had a new non-open release from Blockbuster and the store needed to grab something fast to close in the evening. Plain white cover and title intrigued me I'm a (relatively) "old" lady and my son is a 30-year-old young man. I like entertainment with six senses, interview with a vampire, Harry Potter and Bietzelius. On the other hand, my son enjoys film graduation and very special foreign films, such as Bergman or Hartzug directed. We usually hate each other's movie choices, however, both of us have seen the movie and have loved nothing! This is different from any movie that we have ever seen before. We both cynical / critical personality types and we usually see them when we crack on the movie - but in this case we just laugh and enjoy starting film from the beginning. It is our opinion that this movie was broadcasted and shown in the original film theaters of the US film, but it certainly worked very well.
