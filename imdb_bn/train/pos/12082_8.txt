I was most pleased to see this film on the strength of critics' ratings. Although clearly low budget, it carries signs of clever tricks. For example, when Julia wakes up in a strange room and says that I told her that her own separate light shot will be extended with an external shot focused on her face and then move backwards to include the house and its isolated location. And see and see! The next scene was exactly the last shot of that house, standing on the steep mountains on the edge of the water. There are other examples of how a cute director can promote his film at a very exciting thriller level. Savvy visitors will certainly spot them but should be assured they will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> As per the performance, George Macready recommends a power for arbitrary violence, its usual horrible self, although its balance. Nina Foke was surprisingly good that no incestious girl could be deposited without any war. But Dame May Witty, oh boy, he suspects me in my own eyes and believes that he can go away with his evil plans. <br /> <br /> This is a real diamond rough and will not be missed.
