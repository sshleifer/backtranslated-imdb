Well, I saw it in the theater when it came out and I do not know why. I did not see it, but I ended up on this page because I was thinking about this movie myself - I do not know again. But I think that it seems to speak volumes. <br /> <br /> The comedy is tough - much harder than a play. It seems easy to do it properly, but it's making mistakes ... is there anything worse than a bad comedy? Steve Martin, pay attention, you're going to fall into this category again for no reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> The other person who is responsible for the brain fits correctly in this section (Sun is mostly the Unreal Buck Jokes). <br /> <br /> One point debate - the end. It seems that the writer / director can not end a comedy. The ending tries to be a love story, undermining the swift conversation up to a little point. Then there is "tassle" view. While it should be seen (male opinion), it is the top and the outside place so it's like a shock. Another rewrite was needed for the end. <br /> <br /> This is not the genre of talent such as the Spinel Tap or the producer or The Hill Grill. But if you do not try to isolate it and you only get mad and sad fun, you laugh, I confirm it.
