My best way to describe top Europeos in my favorite movies list is the wonderful way to come from a partner after the film's ending: "I do not know that the films can be made in such a way". Completely in its visual style, it could be a movie, one of his best examples. It can get as far away from a "get master and coverage" style; Completely integrate many layers of images, sounds, effects, props, dialogs, voice over, performance, editing, lighting, etc. ... all equal, none major. Despite the "Conversation" of Hollywood, despite the myopia, the movie is not a subject of dialogue, nor is it about beautiful lighting, action or music. It works best for all tasks when all the elements are in the same footing, where they will present them only in the uniqueness, order, or combination of those elements. The contribution of an element is reduced or exhausted, and the film does not have the meaning. "Europa" movie should be struggling to be.
