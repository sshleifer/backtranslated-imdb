My favorite movie all the time! I saw many movies, but all of them beaties! Acting excelant, wonderful story You will start to love George as a "normal" caring person. Altough He is an actor, he himself and a very loving person. And mebi is the most important thing: you will learn to respect and learn to be separated from the down syndrome people.
