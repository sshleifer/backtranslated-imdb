Of course, this is a 50-drive, but do not fool you. In my little book, there is a lot of touch with humorous unexpected dolls. Frustrate Mrs Porter, who was supposed to monitor Doctor's place. He simply does not steal the scene, but knocks to the whole movie. And those indie producers bring money for the film in color, an intelligent decision, since Blob does not look good on B & W. Yes, the results are rounded around the edge because the goose numbers represent. But in addition to several teenage teenagers, non-Hollywood actors performed well. Nevertheless, walking among hot-rodgers and police comes as vivid and entertaining. A pulpit is better for a couple of more directors at home than a great sound level. Apparently, when the curtains were filled with "teen criminals" they wanted to portray a teenager in a positive light. Then, 27-year-old McQueen was rarely qualified at the age of, but anyhow he operated the hot-radar attitude. The film was then a hit, there is no doubt that it plays a lot of radio by the tune of interesting radio headlines. And unlike the unfortunate final effects, the film is still not very fun, drive-in or drive-in. Meanwhile, I'm looking forward to returning to Blow, that now the polar icecrip is going on, will we call the fridge water?
