I would not be annoyed to see this movie in the theater though I remember listening to my name over. I finally saw this week and what a joy it is For some reason, I was waiting for it not to be very good, so when I was sitting and stuck with it, I was surprised and then pulled myself completely. I have read other user comments and it has influenced me how many people talk about his battle in the ring, but what was wonderful about Diana is that he is a true warrior of life. Find out where he needs to be, and the ring helps him to go there. A very intelligent story and I wonder what this is for Michele Rodriguez - he did a wonderful job. Adrian and his coach were pretty good. <br /> <br /> This picture is a bit rough around the edge, but it is not a small thing. The story, the desire, and the performance exceeds any error (which usually comes with indie film making). A fascinating screenplay of finding a girl herself and winning her situation and career. Michele Rodriguez!
