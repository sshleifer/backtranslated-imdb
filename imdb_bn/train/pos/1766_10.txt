Last night I received a free pass in this movie and I did not know what to expect. The court felt stupid and I supposed it to be so shallow fun-fun-virgin humor. What a great surprise I laugh so loud that I started crying curiously. This film must be seen by someone with a little abstract sense of open mind and humor. All right ... this is not the movie to go with your grandmother (Jack Palance?) Or younger kids. The language is fake, jokes (too) filthy, and as a graphic of sexual conversation almost as well as you can find anywhere. What's amazing, however, the movie is still a sweet love story My girlfriend and I both liked it. Steve Carroll is great, but supporting (like office) cast really works in the film. All the characters have their errors, but they have depth and likability. Everyone ties their weight and chemistry perfect. I can not wait to get the DVD I'm sure it will be there with the office space for redirecting and quoting lines.
