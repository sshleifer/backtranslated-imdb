The Old Mill Pond exhibited more than 30% respect for the entire nation's desperation to African-American entertainers (Still, Stetin Fetchit caricature). In addition to the exact mention I have, there are also the Fable Waller, Josephfire Baker, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, and Louis Armstrong's frogs or fish versions. The Harmony Cartoon of Hue Herman and Rudolf Isling is in line with the perfect characters around. They all really make so much noise that half of my mind thinks they might be. If not, they are of course very impressive impersonations. Even the lazy, transmitted Fetchit characterizes an exciting workout here when he plays "Tigger that Hold" as he hold by a tiger. Very 30 animations and jazz music fans recommend.
