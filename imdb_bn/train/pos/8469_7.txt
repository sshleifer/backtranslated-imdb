I usually love movies like this 1930 Mystery / Police Charlie Chan, and this is no exception. However, some feel bad with this movie. A late attempt to switch from serial moto movies to cerebral Molecule films which focuses on the character of plot in the Salad Bar that is destroyed by clay relief. A typist Bafun seems to be seen somewhere from a strange English incognito to detective players, and even seems to entangled providing comedy relief to other characters. This plot may seem strange to us today, but then the possibility of archaeological discoveries of the era is not only real, but a common occurrence.
