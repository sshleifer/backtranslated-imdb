If you like movies of organizational crime, it's great fun to watch this movie. Those who are looking for criminals who act in a caricature lead to dream of misleading, they may be frustrated with the way in this film. <br /> <br /> This is a fun romp through a criminal underworld and although you are not familiar with the Hong Kong film, then you may be happy with this one. I loved some stories with some disappointments based on the story but overall a criminal film. Some things do not make sense but it seems ideal with the previous movie. <br /> <br /> People have been shameless about how they have been set up before their personality. It's a little annoying pattern that even enters this movie.
