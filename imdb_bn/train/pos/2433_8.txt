I was about 12 years old when I saw this classic "Friendly Horse Kaspersper" cartoon. This was not the case since Kasparte did not show * right *, similarly Preqi Pig does not show * right * in cartoons of 1930. But I digress ... <br /> <br /> However, this episode of the friendly Phantom's inwardness raises him friendship with a young fox whom he fears friendships called Ferdie. It is heartening to see a comer friend who does not know the cartoon that most people flee from him, "a ghost!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caspar and Ferdie got some fun. Until no one else has seen ... I do not hesitate to leave you with a semi-explosive, but the cartoon is only seven minutes long, so you can not really be confused. Besides, anyone who is reading the cartoon's IMDB compilation can determine what can happen next ... <br /> <br /> The end is a bit annoying. In fact, it's probably the most tragic I've ever experienced watching cartoons. But this means that I just moved, which probably explains why I decided to write a comment on this particular cartoon and not many. Or hack, I really remember this cartoon because of my emotional impact on it - I did not see it. But the cartoon apparently ended up on the note, and I was unhappy and could see Kaspers and Ferries happy. <br /> <br /> I'll give this cartoon 8 out of 10 Warner Bros. Cartoon "Peace on Earth", only to the second, this I have ever been removed by an animated short.
