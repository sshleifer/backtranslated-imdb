"Before Sunrise" will be a wonderful love story and in my top 5 favorite movies. Dialogues and acting are great. I like the characters and their ideas and thoughts. Of course, romantic Vienna is not present in the movie (you can not get the poem sitting in the middle of the night) and it is not possible to go all the way in just one night. Is (especially if you are a stranger and your first night in Vienna) But that's not the point. The relationship between two characters is very important and this part of the story is not unreasonable. Although, sometimes nothing happens, the movie never gets annoying. The end is "Titanic" or really sad without doing anything. Even if you do not like the love story, you will see this movie! I'm a little skeptical about the series that's going to get released in the summer. It is my opinion as the first part is perfect.
