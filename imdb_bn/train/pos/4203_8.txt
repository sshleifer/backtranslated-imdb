This is another wonderful and compelling film directed by Sam Fulla in the early 1950s. This minimalist and quick working director has some unusual for his previous films - a throw with some stars. Richard Wymark, Jean Peters and Richard Koney are acting in this movie about a group of communist agents trying to hide secret information from America - and they will not stop being successful. <br /> <br /> With Peters on a subway shown by the federal agents. They know a link to a long espionage chain. Everyone has a wild card in an unknown equation - a short-time pickpocket (Wyommark) is also on the train and they are directed to steal secret information that carries Peter. Wydmck thinks that this is just another parse he has vandalized - only afterwards he understands the importance of being stolen. Now it's its own widget - Commies and FBI hot on its trill. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie and the rest are related to starting and filming from the beginning. Although he did not receive top billing, he should give special mention of the ritter. This helpful actress probably had her lifetime performance as a stool pigeon. Very rarely he was allowed to do this work and I was impressed by his ability to play a broken old lady. <br /> <br /> As far as the script and instruction are ongoing, they are very good- but with a small exception. Initially, I like the way to contact Wimark and Peter. You will see a woman in front of one of the pictures in the movie! Now that's hard. Afterward, invariably, they are amazingly close - very close to being credible. Yet, it can be ignored by such a large drama and such an effective noisy film. See this picture.
