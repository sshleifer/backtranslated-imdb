Since this film was based on the real story of a woman, she had two children and was not very good, how real it was! Acting which pushed Mahima to give the movie. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton portrayed the protagonist Passie McCart, whom he had two sons. A real life story of her performance comes to life on a television screen. Some scenes were hard to see because they were really real when someone was addicted to drugs <br /> <br /> It was not difficult to look after this very loving mother. , But so true. I have gone through the withdrawal of the people and what they think was much more than what happened in this movie. <br /> <br /> I was also thinking that it was very risky for the director to do this. This woman happened to be out of the movie. Yet it has been very well done. I congratulate the director for making this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend anyone who has ever taken a drug addiction or if you are addicted to them, you can learn what can happen. .
