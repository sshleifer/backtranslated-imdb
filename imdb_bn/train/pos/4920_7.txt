No, not really, but it's really a very good film, and sadly a forgotten gem. Wish the black and white image. <br /> <br /> The straight forward formula was a plague of a man and he could look for the person who communicated with him before the death of the authorities. <br /> <br /> is very good direction, and acting is great. Richard Wyommark is better than male leadership, but Paul Douglas's police captain and Jack Palance (never better than that) and Zero Mustel as baddies. Sadly shocked some genuine second rate went to play similar characters in gangster or war movies.
