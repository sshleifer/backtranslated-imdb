I saw "blame" yesterday, and wow ... I was really scared, a good thing. I love scary-movies, and I really like this one. Many 'wonderful scenes' (what was the word of the word?) That makes you leap into your seat. Although the audience did not have much difficulty shouting laughing I think the most frightening scene was on the bus, when the face became blurred by the window, or when Echo was walking without its chin. Make-up is also very good. Sometimes you could really see there, but it still added to the scene a weird look. The boy was really very good, so very cute with so cute and so without make-up. The next time I hear a cracking noise I'm probably going to be scared ...
