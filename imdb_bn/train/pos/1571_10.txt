Spanish SquarePants I have not seen more cartoons on TV. The colors are great, the voice can not be good, the characters are so great, great cartoons. Hope this cartoon will continue to grow. Hopefully Season DVD will be released soon !!! I love cartoons like this and I hope more people will be protected from this great cartoon. Season DVD is very hard to find, so if someone finds a store that sells it, please let me know. The only cashbrush stuff available at Nick Shop is a great look shirt, but very very expensive !!! If you love Spongebob; And who is not? You love Catscatch too!
