Jontropop is very similar to The Third Man, another silent-film film set in Europe's terracotta. Like TTM, there are many inventive cameras to work. A innocent American who is mentally involved with a woman, he does not really understand and whose proximity is more attractive than that. [<br /> <br /> But I want to say that the third man has a better imaginary story. Zentropa is a bit detached in this respect. Perhaps this is deliberate: it is presented as a dream / nightmare, and it will be damaged by the effect of making it very coherent. <br /> <br /> This movie is sensitized individually - "silent" in more than one sense; One sun does not look bright. Grim, but playful, and frightening.
