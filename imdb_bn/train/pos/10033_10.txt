In the film Titanic it is also one more "to remember the night." It has again written a tragic event that will always be spoken and will never be forgotten. Why so much criticism? I have no idea. Can they ever make a movie like Titanic, which is as fast as you can see and touch it. They could ever replace such an epic masterpiece. It will be almost impossible. <br /> <br /> The director does not suspect that this movie was the main influence. A simple disaster film (watch boring) is an incredible romance transformation. Yes I'm not the type of romance, but it will not bother you, because you can not see such romance. Sure! Everything is amazing, music, superb acting. <br /> <br /> The movie creates an amazing scene and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend itself is shown very brightly in all classes of "TITANIC", it looks very, very home. Acting had real impact. Dicaprio and Winchester are the only best-known role-playing actors. Nobody can do good work. That's why the film is so great due to partial reason. <br /> <br /> I think there is not too much to talk about it. The plot is simple, the acting is bright, based on the real story, probably half of the consumers who will watch the movie on horseback, share the tears, thanks to the disgraceful end that can never be forgotten. Well if you do not see this movie in your absence as a hierarchy and see the movie for a movie Hollywood. Could it be better? Not in any way. Most of the time, most of the movies, do not listen to people, look for yourself, then you can understand. A contact (Not surprised if you cry too much)
