I saw the original English version on the video. Voice actor Disney's choice looks very promising. I can not believe I'm saying. The story is about a young boy, who combines a girl with such history, which is different from her own. Both are thrown into the most fun and playful storylines of any animated film. Animation quality is excellent! If you have seen Disney's work on Kiki's delivery services, you can see their product quality. It is about to recreate the lion's story about white color. (But not completely!) Finally Miazaki movie released! I can not wait to see an invalid English version of Nausika!
