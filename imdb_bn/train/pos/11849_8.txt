If only all the animations had this great. This movie is classic because it has two simple aspects: stories and characters. The characters of this photo are beautifully personalized. I felt for all the characters, and the cinema man-animal relationship works perfectly. Beautiful animations and 3-D computer animation did not work well in any other film. This is a great movie for kids and for adults who want to travel to the classic hero. 8 of 8
