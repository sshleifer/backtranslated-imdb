Someone mastered playing hard work with romance. In reality, sports and romance go together as oil and water. So, successfully integrating the two on the screen ... well, it's equivalent to nuclear division. I could not have done it. I would like to say that I do not like romantic comedy for the first time ... but I like sports and mostly movies about sports. Two of these movies were a pretty good mix. Being a baseball fan, I truly appreciate Ben Wetman (Jimmy Fallon), a Boston Raidox fan, and would appreciate the comedic chuckle. Anyone who knows anything about baseball curses father, who has hit Redox for over 86 years, and they know how much of the Redsox fans of baseball have. Farrely brothers are a great career that capturing and making it better for comedy. This is a very good movie which can appeal to many.
