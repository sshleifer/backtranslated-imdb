Although DG! Like the music industry, it was known as the most glorious. The director confused the Brian Jonastown genocide, the world has disappeared from the face of the world -98. And the competition between Dandy Warhol's and Jonathon has been milked. This truth is not really revealed in this movie. <br /> <br /> This picture is constantly quoted and it is a fascinating surveillance because we look at two groups of very gifted musicians by creating their art. The best thing about this movie is going to be a unique perspective between the Indie Music scene and the larger corporate scene. <br /> <br /> Recommended for most music and two superb bands.
