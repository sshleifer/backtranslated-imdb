Quite simply, this image is awesome. <br /> <br /> It starts easily, watching a rebel young girl like a studio and becoming a well-made horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect gore, or zombies. It is psychologically, and as he does in candimen, Bernard Rose manages to reveal the horror that is not believed. <br /> <br /> Every time you watch this movie, you feel more about what's happening and how it is connected to two people in this movie. <br /> <br /> Drawings were never awesome.
