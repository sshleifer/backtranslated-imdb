This is a powerful movie. For the first time I saw it, the pronunciation of Scottish language made me hard to understand and it destroyed the experience. I left it but then got the DVD, when I needed them, used English subtitles, and really got into this film, discovered how good it is. It's nice <br /> <br /> The WideScreen image makes it look spectacular with some wonderful scenery, and this story reminds me of Barbarahat, which is a story about a good versus temple. Here, Liam Nisson (good) vs Team Roth (evil). Both do their job well. <br /> <br /> Some actors come across as scary as chariots. Man, you really want to make this guy smram this irritating, Pus. (He loves his character so nasty and weak critics more than anyone else). Like Gibson Breivier, Nissan is a man's man and a strong protagonist. Jessica Lange is strong here as female lead. The movie attracts you and connects you completely, so it is ready to get a mental experience to see it.
