I cherish each frame of this beautiful movie. It's almost regular people, we all know, they suffer a little bit in their lives and have some luggage to carry around. Just like all of us Robert Deanero, Ed Harris and Cathy Baker are breathing life in their paintings and all is wonderful, but Harris is especially heartfelt and so very real. You will swear he really is a trucker who does not have to think so anything to him. There are also some fine moments like her sister in the unemployed sister - when Dioro gives her flowers in a scene, it seems that she was never given flowers and probably was not. Very suitable.
