A wonderful rental from the local video store, I'm glad to find the perfect media ridicule to challenge Oliver Stone's "Natural Motherland Killers". And almost as annoying as it is. I think it was better with my view at the end of 2004, seeing the Republican machine, there is magic on the population watching most of America's television. It raises the question "What are we really manipulative?" <br /> <br /> This has clarified my outlook. A big religious question is being raised - the story of Christ Can anything on the face of aspirant and overwhelming dependence on television produce a Messiah? The story of Christ exaggerated? Is it completely made? This is a subject that puts the film in a very sensitive light.
