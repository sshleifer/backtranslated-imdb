The first two parts want to emerge the rise of disrespectful warfare and the rise of rule by nationalist barbarians. The third part is that the key to ensuring the use of human talents and resources is progress and research towards the moon and its end. It has lectures that some viewers are dismissed as naïve or bombardier, but it matches others with excitement. It portrays the detector mass communication device, elevator, flat screen panel and a space gun / launcher with wireless intercom and a helicopter. It's probably wrong in the future windowless buildings. But it portrays a child-like outlook like unlimited scientific / technical investigations. <br /> <br /> I think it seems like a movie like a group of evolutionary thinkers, which is operated in search of immortality by spinogen-like morality. Living themselves and morally through scientific progress and a united world government. Pro-progressing letters (such as two cables) believe that humanity can 'live forever' by preserving our background and future generations, always standing on the shoulders of human beings as on our humanity. <br /> <br /> Arthur C. Clarke (Author of 2001: A Space ODC) This film suggested Stanley Kubrick as an example of an excellent SF movie. Kubrick hated it and said he will not see any other film based on Clarke's suggestion (Source: Clark's 2001 novel launch of the special millennium). Although late Clark recommended it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best SF films. It is a beautiful Menzij Art design, but medium special effects (esp. Toy tanks). <br /> <br /> I personally like it and think it captures Joe Zegegeist of modernity. It's a little naïve about the possibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period. It seems incredible about progress inevitability. I think we can not go back to the dark age easily or at least we can become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves through our inability to escape from the excess population or the next major natural disaster. But the importance of risking public against the potential threat of space accidents and deaths and the importance of hurry. It challenges us for the sake of progress on a small desire for safety or comfort or happiness: <br /> <br /> • "much more {rest} and soon, and we talk about death, and should not end - After victory, we should win - this little planet, its air, and the ways and the mind and all the laws which prevent him, then the planet about it and ultimately varies, and when it comes to space problems The depth and timing has won all mysteries - even then he will start. "<br /> <br /> KAWAL:" If we are not more than animals - we have to be robbed of small scraps of happiness and have to live, enjoy and pass Will not do anything more than all the other animals - or do it. " {They point to stars.} "What is it - or is this the universe - or nothing ..." (quotes from script) <br /> <br /> <br /> dedicated to the progress of society , Then the council member (world government) will feel like a technocrat. But in reality, those "technocrats" allow their citizens to be artisans or to follow other followers independently, and they must be suppressed by the ban on government restrictions, laws against science and examinations, and other mandates and abuses, which are shocking to their critics. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A large group of rebels, all councils of science and technology By the feel relentless, so they stop for the advancement of freedom and an end to the council tries to test. The progress-oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels, it will create 'peace gases' only during the state of emergency and only want freedom and space to move forward for progress. <br /> <br /> It is also about the story of freedom of science, as soon as it is about the surprise of progress. In the case of social society (as many people want to ban cloning) or naturopathy (we do not want to progress independently, and rather we just want to become) many in our society actually agree on this basic premises disappearing during slavery on earth) or fear / cause ( Some believe that we are not ready for advanced science / technology because we ourselves are destroyed Can). But the CABAL (Council President) answered the problem of danger: "Our {scientific} revolution did not eliminate death or danger. It only makes death and danger valuable" (screenplay).
