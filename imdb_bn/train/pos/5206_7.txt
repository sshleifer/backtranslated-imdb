This movie is based on Evil Bread: Samhain's legend, with little thought or effort. It is very quick to ridicule with "slasher" style glasses and normal dexterity glasses of general death. Actors had a D rating played as very little power show, and their stupidity in the film is very suspicious. The way they acted like their age is incredibly different. The pornographic vicious fit is divided into thinking that it does not really offer much and that any area that is respectful but quickly driven with the death of full intestinal twitch. Example is the poor colleague who is isolated from his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes. The question of how little fighting is a clear fight for the children. This movie is a good choice for some people who like to see some deadly deaths and practically torture.
