IQ, in my opinion, a sweet, charming and funny romantic comedy to find the right person for you. If you ask me, James (Stephen Fry) was really a dull guy. To me, Ed (Tim Robins) was more suitable than Catherine (Meg Ryan) than James. However, everyone involved in this film did absolutely outstanding work. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this sweet, impressive and comical romantic comedy that the right person does not see this for any Team Robins or Meg Ryan fan. You are so much sunny, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, jump back with a friend, and see it.
