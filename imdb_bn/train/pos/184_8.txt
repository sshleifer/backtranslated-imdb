There is no such person as "Show man" Marion Davies (as Peggy Paper) and William Hines (as Billy Buuve). My role with Mrs. Davis was a "clip" from this movie; She is one of the delightful spoofy which reduces a scarf to express various emotions. My presentation with Mr. Henes was to see this movie now; Although, it is possible that I played a less memorable role in him. Haynes creates an incredible impression when he joins Davis for a casual meal - tossing his hat in the ring with some wonderful bits in the dining table. Haynes and Davis provided fantastic comic performance. <br /> <br /> This story starts with Dell Henderson (colonel paper) driving Davy Davis of Hollywood, and he will definitely become the new sensation of Tinlton. Indeed, Davis and Haines already existed became comedy stars. However, Davis became a true drama queen. Leaving Davis Henness, and becoming a partner with the dramatic Paul Rally. However, the more ridiculous role of viewers is Davis; Perhaps the artist Raja Bhadar is proposing a case for imitation life of the industry? <br /> <br /> set, and close both, are full of great Hollywood location footage. The great "kayomoz" is full; At the studio lunchtime, on the star's table, Davis Douglas Fairbank and William S. sit in the heart. The best "bit" player, however, Charlie Chaplin, who is nervous enough to ask Davis for his autograph! Even if the kayoma is fun, and episode "Show to the public" episodic sequences is less of an important movie and helps to do more in an important historical document. <br /> <br /> Show people (11/11/28) King vs. ~ Marion Davis, William Hens, Dale Henderson
