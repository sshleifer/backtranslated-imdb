I was really good for the first episode of the first series. It was really fun and I was brilliant in actors. I think it was bad because it was bad because it saw the right time. When people say that it was not historically correct, it is really annoying because it seems to be not a boring documentary on Saturday night as an entertainment show, so I think the costumes and settings were just fine. A brilliant start and I'm going to love to come later !! I have spoken to many people in my school and they love to mourn! We all think that this is great entertainment and there are great stories to go with it.
