This movie is about an unhappy family but not a functional family. Although it is about the family of our nation (India), the film basically focuses on the relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and her eldest son Harilal Gandhi. It shows how Mahatma killed MK. Gandhi, how to dedicate his family life to our independence. Each time Mahanandas Karamchand Gandhi and his son will try to stop, the Mahatma will come among them. This is a beautifully filmed film. Akshay Khanna proves himself a top actor. He expresses emotions very naturally Gandhi's place as a lawyer for Gurukanta Desai, surprisingly, reflects Zarwali Gandhi, a philosophical visitor. (Like the true human beings, Ben Kingsley, who calls him God) Shefali Shah Mansoon's marriage girl also did a really good job. It shows how Kasturba Gandhi was separated between father and son. This movie is touching and its soundtrack "Raghputty Raghav" sings very uniquely. I just watched this movie 3 hours ago (it was released in Dubai on the second day), and when the movie was over, there was a "pin drop silence" and one person did not push others while leaving the theater (you can imagine our Indians are not pushing ?) No! There was a holy silence ...
