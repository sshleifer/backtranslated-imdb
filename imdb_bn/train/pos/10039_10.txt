Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this film was not about ten, overall in the IMDB user rankings. Maybe, it does not give a cold, temporal credit nowadays now, but when it was first it was really something. People came to the theater after the movie came out. When it comes out on my sister video and I see twice for a month. It was safe for us to say that we were safe and good reasons. It was difficult to forget some of the scenes of disaster, like a frozen child, or a person who committed suicide after killing someone in a suicide crowd. Many people died in that vessel, and Geneva was looking at Cameron that it was difficult to understand with immediate and emotional films. And do not forget the wonderful romance between Jack and Rose. Whether their relationship was a mockery of a fantasy, whether it was beautiful or not. They knew each other, but they would have to die for each other. They believe in each other Romeo and Juliet are giving their money a run as they are definitely hell. "I'll never go, Jack." Titanic is a great film down to a very original one. It is said by a strong story, brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music and a full crew of strict and dedicated workers. When someone says that they hate this movie, it really hurts my mind.
