Perhaps the best film of my year for me Office Secretary Karla (Emmanuel Devos) has been housed in the center of this small French film, who has been working for other men in his days, unknown, and as a source of conversation about their miserliness and lunch, which is very clear to him as partially deaf. Lip reading When he rents new stranger con Paul (Vincent Cassel) as his assistant, a change is set at speed. The relationship between them is the center of the film. For obvious reasons, mutual dependence, bonds of them. Karla is attracted to Paul and feels interesting about this matter that he feels for the first time. Paul does nothing to remove his feelings because he needs his help. He gave money to the local gangster and planned to steal from him, among which Karlas' lip reading skills involved. I think that the main issue pushes the film's path on an average mystery / drama, that is amazing chemistry between the two stars. Throughout the whole film, why do not you have any other characters on the screen, you can feel this extraordinary bond between Karla and Paul. I can not remember when I saw sex chemistry between two actors. Emmanuell Devos gives a brilliant performance (she won French Caesar for best actress). If you are watching a piece of acting you do not think, this is really Carla. Vincent cascades like robberies are nice She makes an unexpected character both interesting and interesting. I love this picture because of these two people, and when I finish watching this, I want to go back to the movies both times and want to get involved with them again.
