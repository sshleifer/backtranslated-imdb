After reading several comments, I felt I had to add to my two cents. "Sero Lost" is one of the most memorable shorts I think I've ever seen. I got the chance to see it in the New York Independent Film Festival. I felt this movie was incredibly beautiful and emotional. The story was pretty complicated - especially for so little time. The story is focused on a young girl who was hunted by her abusive father. He was soon given the option to "stop" by a giant run by "Witchblood's Erik Ittary". I was surprised to see how he played so unique and different characters. I knew he could do so well! His character was deeply complex and he was very persuasive. The acting was absolutely fantastic by her. The girl was right and the father was good. This girl also follows the girl around her until she is able to escape from her future. Influence and cinematography were absolutely mind-boggling. I wonder if I had at least a hundred thousand budgets for this. It is rare to see very low quality. The main feature of the opening was absolutely comparable to breathtaking with the film. This does not mean that it is not without its fault - I thought it took some time and the role was a bit long. But after seeing it my head stuck. There are very few shorts with this level of quality.
