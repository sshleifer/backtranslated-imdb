This movie shows that you do not need a big explosion, Fifty-billion dollar computer graphics, or a lot of paid actors and actresses to create a big movie, all of you are a wonderful story line and plot. The master of all Japanese films, Akira Kurosa, brightly closed. I suggest this photo of all that love pieces of an epic period. And for those who enjoy working before those Kurosawas. 10/10
