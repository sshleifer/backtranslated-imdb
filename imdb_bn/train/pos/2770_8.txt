Seeing David and Bathsheba, going to school on Sunday is a better way to read your Bible. Despite such a script, sometimes funny that the film is very entertaining. The studio system had flaws, but it did not cost any cost to produce an expensive product. The Peak Kingdom portrays David as a lively but painful poet, who does what he does to kill a sexy Bathsheba, Susan Heard in bed. Raymond Aunt as Nabi Nathan delivers his usual saturnine and fierce performance. Silent Screen Star Francis X Bushman saw King Saul and the new Genen Verdon as a dancer. Hooray for Old Testament and Hollywood
