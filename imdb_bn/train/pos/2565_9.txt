I really enjoyed this movie, which has been better developed by American soldiers and Japanese women after the war in Japan - as well as the obstacles that created East Bengal for them. If you want to fall in love with a Japanese woman and marry her, Brando is humiliating for Japanese (which is natural considering WW2). Her performance is OK (I'm not a major fan of her acting style) and surprising throughout the movie. The red buttons fell in love with Japan and received an Oscar for its sensitive performance of other GIE (though Japanese women who played it against them also did a great job). <br /> <br /> I do not want to waste it but it is good to see the film with a box of tissues. <br /> <br /> This movie directs to say something and to be entertaining at the same time. A most intimate jewel.
