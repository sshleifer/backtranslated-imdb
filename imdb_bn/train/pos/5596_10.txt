"The Tenant" Roman Polanski's greatest movie IMO And I love "Chinatown", but it's a lot more original and obsolete and cruel. This is a great black comedy. I've shown this picture * very annoying by some people, even then predict that it affects some people. In addition to Polanski, "The Tenant", it plays a major role in managing it.
