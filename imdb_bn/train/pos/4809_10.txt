With all the recent movies, dealing with the British Empire, is it really a different time? Answer: You beet! Another contributing to the waves of British movies associated with the Young Victoria royal family In this case, it is related to Princess Victoria's early life and the Queen of England and Prince Albert's events related to her romance and last marriage. The film also discusses the life and career of Queen and Prince of England as well as various events (political impotency, etc.). Emily Blant plays a brilliant Victoria in her youth, and Rupert Friend is his favorite and best friend, Prince Albert. The rest of the cast likes Miranda Richardson, such as Kent's discretes and the screen is always welcome, Jim Broadbint like King William, as well as others, enlightened on the screen. Directed by a winning screenplay of Gene Mark Valley (CRAJJY, Laser Love), Julian Fellows (Vanity Fair, Gossford Park, separate lease). I came out of my head, in the visual appearance of the film (cinematographer Hagen Bogdanzczar), who made each frame of the film a painter (with the help of production designer, Patrice Vermet) as well as some low edits (Zill Bilkak and Matt Garner). What I have appreciated in Phols script is that of Das, which uses some metaphor for the political motivation of the movie (pieces of the film pieces into a chess board) as a metaphor. It's smart, well-written, guided, illustrated, edited and edited entertainment (and illumination) that creates a very expensive evening in the movie. MPAA has been rated by MPA for some views of the results, some brief violence (a little bloody, though not very important), rude explosion of language and some screen smoking
