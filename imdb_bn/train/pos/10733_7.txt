Seeing this movie again has really brought some great childhood memories back. I am 34 years old now, I did not see it at 12-14 years old. I almost forgot about this movie, but when I recently saw it again, some scenes literally brought a tears to my eyes! That little robot "Jinx" (forever friend!). It was like revisiting my childhood. It was absolutely amazing experience for me. I will always cherish this movie for that reason. I hope you can relate some experiences to some readers, not for this special movie, but a movie that you have not seen for a long time. Very nostalgic ... <br /> <br /> - Thanks for reading
