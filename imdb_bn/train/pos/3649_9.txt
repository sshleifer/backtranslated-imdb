As a student I saw many TV movies during my time, most of the time wasted outside American television wasted. This one, however, was well designed and designed and finally had a very beautiful twist. In MacGyver and Stargate I, only Richard Dean found that Anderson was surprised by the amazing performance of expressions rather than the expressions he usually gave it to A-B. Daphne was very happy to see Juaniga a lot of days after dating to The Floy 2. Again a leading role Robert Guillaumme is nice to see. I can not say that I took Jenny Lives after her Beni Hill days seriously but she only managed to deal well with her role. All is a highly recommended film.
