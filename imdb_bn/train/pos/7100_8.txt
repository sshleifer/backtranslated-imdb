In 1986, I saw his movie in Texas in Dallas, Texas. I think their reward is given for awarding the film. After watching the movie, I can see why. The movie was not bad, it was great. The problem of this movie was to tell a side story. They make a new story, create new characters and try to wrap around Master Master Sea. My biggest allegation is that the plot is the second wave of robotek master attacking the world. They even use the same scene from Master Saga but through different dialogue. As a kid, I like movies. But unfortunately I did not see it as an adult and could not give a better review. Back in the back I was frustrated but now I want to see the movie and re-evaluate my position. Who said, will anyone release the whole world to judge this movie? I love robotake and can not wait for shadow chronicles.
