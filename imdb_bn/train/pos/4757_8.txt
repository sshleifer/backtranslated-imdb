Rod Sering was certainly a talent and his wonderful, playful, creative mind was in some time in which he lived and placed television examples of development. Now there is no such event, but rather the "housewives" sluts of Sunny Eve E Longghoria or Terry Hutchare by hugging our tutor screen. <br /> <br /> Jack Elam could not help me with the accuracy of such acting and with his usual madness, but think that Rod Serling was seated a week ago much closer to Elam, although he was a helpful in the flow of stories. This episode ends with a wrapper as usual, but shock and humor, especially "Sarlensky" is mixed with efficiency. <br /> <br /> Rex Lewis Field
