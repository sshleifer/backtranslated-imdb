Anyone can tell Pokemon to die stupid. This movie is superlative. After the death of Selvi, I tear a tear. I do not have much trouble! This photo is a touch animated thriller. <br /> <br /> In the fourth installment of this craze, Ash and friends will have to stop the bad quarrel to create the worst evil weapon Selengei with his dark ball. During the time, Sam and Celebei are traveling through time and are constantly hunting hunters. I like the dual fight piece and Sam's date palm is there (if you have played Pokemon gold, silver or crystal, you know what it is.) <br /> <br /> I was in charge of Miramax instead of Warner Brothers. Putting mini cinema at the end was a great idea. Pok√©mon of this movie has more life than ever before.
