Some people living near Buffalo in New York saw this story, even when I saw it, I got points with me. There are also a few parts about realistic news - people of TV anchor buffalo ... and, once, it does not hit the area. Helalujua! <br /> <br /> Theology-Intelligent, Poo-Lease !!! God still looks like humans and is thinking ... and, of course, to be a bit over liberal parties. Lightweight comedy is something that can not win any awards, but it's still entertaining and it's a great way for 102 minutes. <br /> <br /> There are some sunny slopstick comedy scenes and optimists, listeners - from atheists to Christians - have found something besides some laughs, such as the prayer will actually be. At least at least to the authors of this theory and to give a good message. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a pretty heartfelt movie that should be very objectionable.
