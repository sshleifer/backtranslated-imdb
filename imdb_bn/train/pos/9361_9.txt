The kingdom over me (which is the title after the song) is a film that is sure to bring tear to everyone's eyes. This is a guy (sandler) who lost his family in a moving story that attacked the 9/11 World Trade Center. After several years, he went to an old college roommate (Chadell), which he could not recognize due to the dramatic pressure caused by his family's losses. Two of their old friendships and the character of Chadle resurfaced Johnson, realizing that Sandler's character, Feynman, would get some help before it was too late. <br /> <br /> This first movie has made me cry for a long time. Time. It's fully viewable and after seeing it, I'm not positive that the audience will appreciate even more of his family.
