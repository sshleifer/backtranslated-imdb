Oh, have fun here! <br /> <br /> There is a flair for Amy Hackerling's comedy handy (Redmond High at the Fast Times, Where's the Talk Talking) but it seems that she asked the actress to go out and have fun. Michele Keaton easily breezes through the role of her best screen performance, Johnny. Joe Piscopo is as great as naming Danny Vermin, what shame director does not take on this. And I also mentioned Richard Dimitri, playing the unique vocabulary of Mirny and the character. I do not think its an accident that has been named Moron. <br /> <br /> The best picture is sprayed with Peter Boyle, Griffith Dunne in the whole picture. Marion Stapleton, Marilyn Henna gave a good line. Even actors will get a good line in a small role like Dick Batkas and Alan Hell. <br /> <br /> Suggest it to a friend.
