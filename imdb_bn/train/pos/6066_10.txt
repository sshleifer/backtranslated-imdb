When I first saw this movie, it was long before VHS-Video. I love this movie because it was fun and exciting. Some years ago I watched another movie, it has been said: * Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure * was part of the * lost state wizard * in this movie. They called this movie "KOR conquerrer". I started looking for "Core" -VVI for many years, because I wanted to watch the whole film, not only the parts that were used in 'Andy Colby' -Mov. There was no rental this core movie and no shop knew this movie. For many years I had seen my old VHS-tape, which was in my home and wonders ... I was still in this house for many years, but the movie had a different title, because it had 3 or 4 titles in Germany. So I was happy to find this tape at home and I had more time to see * conqueror again. The music is great during the hole film, but the best part of the compilation of music is at the moment, when the core is getting drunk through the green forest. Background music was some magic. I like BoSwenson, and the boy who played Simon in the movie. Both of them work very well. Manfred Krause, Germany, 26.10.2004. Thank you everyone for reading my comments.
