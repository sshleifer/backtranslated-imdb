David Web People meet Paul Anderson ... If it seems strange to you already, you are right, because it is. <br /> <br /> People are familiar with the moral effects of their scripts and the moral effects of mistakes, the value of life, etc .. They covered these issues at Blardunnera, Unforgiven, and there are a few of them in their screenplay. <br /> <br /> Paul Anderson's first successful film was fierce thriller. No wonder she has all the other movies! And here is a fierce thriller with moral effects! <br /> <br /> People's script is quite clear in the first half of the movie. Trained from the birth of soldiers, taught to be killed, and did not have a normal life. They were replaced by good, genetically engineered soldiers and killed the main soldiers on Todd and Todd on a planet. There he must adapt to a group of refugees, some want to hate him and there is an interesting drama here. But then ... <br /> ... Bullets begin to fly, because new soldiers come to the planet for military expedition and try to kill everyone. Large, violent, strong steps were taken, and the People's script became an Anderson Action-Fest. It is hard to believe that the script was written in the same way, but I hope the last product was even better. Ambitious, albeit, after the start of the program is not very worried, worried and exciting. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated: Many violence
