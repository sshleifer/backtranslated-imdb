Everyone will see this movie because every one of us has collapsed and it can help us to understand 1) My life is not as bad as it was bad and 2) How important is it to adopt a child if necessary. There are so many. It seems that this movie is actually based on a real person, our life has been thought deeply and how it will remain in the world and forever. Corrupt, but that corruption will not reach your home. We all have a choice! Definitely recommend it ... and when you're in it, I'd like to throw at Teddy Jacks "The Beaper Purple" and "Woman, Art Art Luge". <br /> <br /> To give a glimpse of movies and our lives based on all this life.
