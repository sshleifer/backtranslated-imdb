If you enjoy the humor of Cleese and all British 'Pythonesque' time, then this little jewel is absolutely delightful. <br /> <br /> <br /> When it came with friends on TV, and its classic quotes made a part of our jokes for 30 years, and will be forever ! I have it on the tape and it is constantly appreciated. <br /> <br /> Some critics are probably taken very seriously. <br /> <br /> I can not believe it is now only available in the US (of course NTSC), and not in the UK, it should be an essential part of British fun history!
