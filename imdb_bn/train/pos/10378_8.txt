This image has a good entertainment an hour or so and has some really fun moments. I like the matte, and the smallest character. They seem to be the most engaging and funny characters, and of course the most interesting. Matt is very good (such as his any good cousin), and the police female and blonde disorderly women supply some welcome eye candy. I found similar matches between Matt and another Australian actor, Eric Bana. My personal favorite part was brutal scenes, that's the choice. Overall, I liked the film and it got about 8 ratings. Penalty Anyway, I was frustrated. It was a side curl curl than a suitable side explosion. <br /> <br /> I'm definitely kidding. :)
