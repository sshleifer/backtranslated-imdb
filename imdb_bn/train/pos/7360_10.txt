How nice! This is a good movie! Acting was not good, but if you look at a few moments of the film, then go back, and watch it again, it's gifted! At the beginning of the film, the man walks with his suitcase against three people. WOW! I did not expect that. Then he kept coke in a suitcase and ran away. I bet that smoking guy against that three sold his drug after one of his comrades. And the talent quote: "Beautiful shadow, I need a pair" "'their' '.. If you think you can take them ..' .. only bright! And I saw the fight several times after the first person hit the table. He saw the second guy, and hit it, and in the middle of the film, a guy shot in a car a bar, then three fell, he noticed it really good. The rental costs a lot of money, the last is brighter, it is so exciting that James Cahill walks after 5 minutes and after the journey to the stairs and shoot Jason Petter, Jason Peters falls down, and he's dead when he's dead! How great is the movie!
