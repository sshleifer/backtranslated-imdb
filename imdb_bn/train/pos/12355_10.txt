I understand those who dislike this film lack of knowledge. <br /> <br /> Firstly, those girls do not grish, but barbarous tenants, and nobody knows the difference, half of them can not understand movies, and of course not ending. It is a complete art work of women's life and demand in this age. Everything is important, and of course they are the way to dress, the meaning of the word across the movie is more than that. Those who thought it was a boring Gaisha movie, I would suggest you to read a little about this society which came out of reality. It is the life of Kurosawa's work, and I am convinced that the director realized the silent meaning of Kurosawa's pieces in the correct intellectual range.
