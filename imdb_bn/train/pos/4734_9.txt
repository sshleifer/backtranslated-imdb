I am a huge fan of Jet Li! She is the best live star of the HK action film ... and as a result - this movie has been reduced! I saw it in the video store and it was in the mainstream mainstream video store, I did not register first in its presence and had to double it twice. I knew immediately what I would have hired My only competence (I guess its expected) is that it is (two and a half) not subtitles. Likewise, the film's original / strange / cool plot, and the whole thing makes it one of Jet Li's best movies ... though they all fall under that department.
