The Korean War America has forgotten the fight. As many as 50 thousand men died there, many people were buried in the questionless question. Occasionally, we are treated with a game or film related to remote, ex-frozen graveyard. Here's probably one of the best. This is called "Sergeant Ricker". This story is an army soldier in the United States. Paul Ryker (Lee Marvin) is selected for a top secret mission by his commanding officer. His work is defective of North Koreans and his service against the UN forces. His cover is so successful, he is priceless evidence of the enemy and given in the rank of Major. However, then he is judged as a prisoner, traitor and spy by the Americans. He had been ordered to forgive him because he learned with sadness that his commanding officer was killed and there was no evidence of his innocence. She is convicted and leaked. However, his determination is suspected by his prosecutor Captain Young (Bradford Dillman). His suspect General Amos Belie (Lloyd Nalan) credible commanding general was given a new trial and if convicted, he would be sentenced to death. The court drama is the top notch that includes Peter Graph, Murray Hamilton and Norman Fowl as the source. Max Winkler Korea was a far-off place, but the possibility of being convicted of the Communist and hanging him in the 1950s is much more likely. Due to its superior script and strong message, this play has become a courtroom classic. Nice viewing and recommend to everyone. ****
