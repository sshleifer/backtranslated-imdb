... this is a classic that should not be missing so great dialogues and scenes. Excellent story, interesting money-related condition, Mel Brooks is not a bad leader, perhaps not perfect, but he's funny! D do not pay attention to the rating, it's BS. See it, then look for something like the final destination (2009) and tell me that Life Stins is worthy of the same rating. If you do, I do not think we can be XD friends at the moment I recommend the Fourth Season of "Fourths of Your Rise" of every Brook's fan; vote against the 10-inch unreleased views! Do I have to do 10 lines here to post a comment? I do not want to write a book here: p
