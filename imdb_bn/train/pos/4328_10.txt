I've purchased this edition's DVD to compare with the current BBC 2005 version (which is brighter). 1985 Arthur was adapted by Hopccraft, who adapted Tinker Taylor Soliar's spouse for TV and died this year (2005). I played great, especially from Rig and Elliot, and moving music. (The music is a lot different in the 2005 version, but not too much to say.) To select other commentaries on a few points: Richard Carter is not Adele, Ad Clear's boyfriend Esther had no uncle. Charlie Drake never played Krook in the version, or did not play Toby Esters at TTSS! In the 2005 version, Kakadian played Johnny Vegas. Toby Bernard Heptton starred <br /> <br /> Both versions are a prestigious and commendable adaptation of Dickens's novel novel. Now read the book! It's not perfect, and sensitivity can make you worry occasionally, but I refuse to cry you - and smile!
