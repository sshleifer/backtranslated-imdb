These three stooges are a tie with my other favorite flick "Court Disorder" that flick. This humor is to enjoy these three stages fans. It is <br /> <br /> Gin itors in recording studio while listening to a great version of "Spring of Voices" of McIntyre's Casting McIntire. She is going to offer a record contract, but she scarred to be honest with her father about her choices in her career and proved herself as a real singer. When he and others leave the studio, the studs make a little fun playing his record and picking up like Christine. The woman, who has been working for Christine's career, is looking for a lady, and she calls her crying for Cristine and singing for her party. Of course there is a guy who is sitting in party and they destroy his loneliness in front of the crowd, so he can find a way to return to them. <br /> <br /> What a beautiful stig it, this should not be missed! <br /> <br /> 10/10
