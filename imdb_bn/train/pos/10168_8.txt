Look at Eva Longoria and Paul Rudd in a movie about a dead girlfriend beating a new girlfriend. This is Gourmet's helpless housewife and the person who used to wear Ancharman's "Sex Panther Colon". If you are expecting a Golden Globe movie then you will have to consider again how you look at the movie. However, if you want to suspend the reality for 90 minutes and want to watch a fun movie, you came to the right place. Characters are all fun. They work very well together. The real match up is Paul Rudd and Lake Bell. He was fun and good at the same time as he friends and he was fun at the same time. I went with my wife, she enjoyed it and did so.
