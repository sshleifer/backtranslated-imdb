I do not know how respectful I am about this movie, but for the first time I saw, I wanted to see how it ended. I'm not a big fan of Paul Weinfeld or war-dramas, but I was really surprised how and when Winnfield would find his child. He knows that the boy has green eyes. To be honest, I have not seen this film for several years and have been shown on TV for a while, but this film is a man's Audi after the war grief. Winnfield shows a sympathetic and heart-warming picture of a person lost by his memory. There is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking after the war and the last discipline of real humanity facing him. It's a mystery to me that why this movie is not yet on the DVD or video.
