I do not think this way, but my friend said that he first thought when he went to the headline "Midnight Cowboy". At that time, all that I knew was reciprocated with reference to the "SafeFled" episode, and the reference was made to get the Florida Forum in order and all the cries of Krems and the disapproval. <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is superb, and surprisingly excited and not as brutal frustrating as some PCs, I can not even remember because they are all shit. <br /> <br /> This plot was originally a clever young cowboy who was going to the chest. Trying to be a hustler (a male prostitute, basically) in New York, seems like it will be easy picking, only when the brick breaks will be difficult when a woman heslens and charges her for sex. <br /> <br /> Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rijko, who is called "ROSA" and the intelligent gay people who always make fun of him. You seem to be scary to him, but a loving one (Han Solo or Lado Carriosian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends and the film feels so sweet and heartwarming that they are friendly and so on. Rijo is actually a sad, sad person, who is very ill and very depressed and confident, calling him "Ratso" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be better and all his problems will be solved, and he is cooking there. And learn to be famous there. <br /> <br /> It shook aloud well aloud in Florida. The food at the Hippie Party, and the woman who says, "Well, you know it's free, you do not have to steal it." And he said, "If it's free I'm not stealin." It's ", and the classic moment is totally unauthorized and undefined where Hoffman is hit by a taxi and" Hey, I'm walking here! "Walking here!", And acting is so credible, Joe Boche does not believe that he will become a respected and respected actor, John Voight, and Rosho Rizo will become legendary and beloved Dustin, for the first time they did not work in limited role. Chemistry is so thick and intense. <br /> <br /> The sad part I believe is that it is very sad to say "sadness." Ratso Rizzo All cinematic Due to falling apart, can only walk, eat only, many coughs, ill, and reach a head point in the bus on the way to Florida. He was seriously injured, and just a mile away from Miami, he finally died on the bus. Gives up and moves away, sorry, but not like you go home and cry and like a 13 year old dog <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The song fits well and perfectly fits the movie tunes. See it, it's great, go buy it
