This movie is awesome and I would recommend renting it for the ownership of the local video store. Or, even better, the possibilities you are going to see over this because you can buy it. I can remember to see this image as a child and it was very good at that time. But after seeing again yesterday I found it amazing. <br /> <br /> A good mix of comedy (though "Mr. Magu" - one of my favorite favorites) and action. It is worth getting 10/10 and I hope they will soon make a sequel (fingers crossed). If you are taking care of the kids' kids, I would recommend renting this movie because it will entertain them for hours.
