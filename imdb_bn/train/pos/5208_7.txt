If Chaplin's view is limited to your favorite lover, and you get laughing at your stomach, but see something else. However, if you love to play the slopstick comedy as best you can see it. <br /> <br /> The picture is like a trump, which does not really get the girl. She ran another couple kissing on a park bench, and her fun bursts exploded. <br /> <br /> This is one of Chaplin's "Park Comedy", illustrated in Mac Senets Park, Pickpocket and with Police and Couple. This shorts work, because in the format allows the chaplin to shine, as he abandons through predictions. <br /> <br /> I checked the box because it could be considered a spoiler, even though you did not see these movies. Everyone ends in the pond without chaplin. She got the girl, in this case Minta Duri, K. Who Mrs. Rosko played the role of "fatty".
