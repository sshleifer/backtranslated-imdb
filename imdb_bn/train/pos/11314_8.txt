How nice! You can see the movie type ten times and are still happy with its looks. Absolutely incredible! If it was Vicquinty's first film, then I wanted to wonder what would happen to the film if it got any good in the film. His (at the time of writing) I saw the death of Venice - which was absolutely incredible: more fascinating than Osseini (attitude). One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, but his story was not involved as Ossessione. If you click "Miscellaneous" in the links on this page, then the movie is still there from that movie. They will not really judge with the film's experience: such as beautiful camera movement, such as beautiful compositions, such wonderful faces, such great characters, such as the development of a great story, James M. Kain's "The Postman Always Range" twice. "<br /> <br /> I can not believe this 43 years ago, Brando called the street named Desire (1951), about eight years ago to start acting realistic in the world, that actors can not use the method, that is, they They themselves did not feel anything (I do not know anything about it) - but they are by far the best, most real and realistic performance. Eight years ago, the street naming designer brought new intensities to the screen, the Oscation was passionate in electrification, the most sensual thing from the beginning of the movie! Yes, I was supernatural, but Osseini was just that awesome. <br /> <br /> Because the Oscation is on the road Influenced in Italy and was banned by Mussolini and re-cut America.American listener sees his full glory It's 59 years later, eight years after Street. <br /> <br /> I will not say anything more about it - just to tell you it's the best, most beautiful and exciting movie I have ever seen, and you go out and Look at it! Like another critic, I'm going to buy it as soon as I can buy it!
