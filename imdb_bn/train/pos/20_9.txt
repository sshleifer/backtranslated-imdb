'Stanley and Iris' shows the soul's victory over humans. For Stanley, it becomes educated and struggles to understand its feasibility. For Iris, the widowhood again found the courage to love. The beauty of the movie is Robert Deenro and Jane Phonda working together and stopping, everyone has the full confidence in each other and the skills and courage to acquire skills. In this sense, how well it often shows our life well, thus believable. Contrary to some other critics I think each image is in line with the full picture. Supporting Castes are carefully selected and they add a depth of character that adds value to the original performance of supported performances. All in all a nice movie. I hope to get the best things from it.
