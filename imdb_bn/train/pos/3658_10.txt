This image is like a metaphor in the Gospel. It is direct witnessing and innocence which you probably can not believe that it was created after the World War II was devastated and devastated and filled with huge homeless, poor populations. It is a monument of creative resources of the place of inspiration as well as the best qualities of the human soul. <br /> <br /> A character like "Idiot" by Totto Dostovivsky, a modern Christian finds her way to a big city. He fortified the firmness and purity by love, and his work encounters people he encounters, as soon as the miracle of the doctrine of the dove. The story has been described in the natural way and in the general style, but it is pictured with magic, which is almost predetermined by Feleni's spiritual imagination. It's one of the most inspirational, uploading movies ever made.
