Geo Trunka created a fault in his latest animated brief, which caused him a problem with his local Czechoslovakia. Some of the elements, the symbols are easy, and its trademark ornaments are almost absent here, allowing viewers to pay attention. In his room, a man dedicates to ceramics and takes care of his only plant. But suddenly a huge hand entered the house and ordered him to make his statue. The man denies and is oppressed by the humiliated gloved hand. On this day, most of the animations trying to replace the real world seem to be removing the fact factor, refreshing it to watch a movie, which makes its strategy a part of the enjoyment.
