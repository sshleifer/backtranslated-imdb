Zu's legend, I saw it, was a very interesting story. I think many people who do not like it do not see the underlying story behind the film. They expected something like Star Wars, and it was not. Joseph Campbell, I believe, liked this picture. There were several metaphors and hidden meanings that could keep an eye on an average audience. We all have a mountain in the sword between us. All of us have to go to our own cave of life. We all have to face one day our own insomnia. Some of the narratives were a bit misleading, and some steps sometimes got a little bit of hoki, but I think the other aspects of the film have made it easy. I want to see it again. <br /> <br /> I do not know whether there is a difference between The Legend of Zoo (which I have seen with English subtitles in Mandarin) and Zoo Warriors (WSA USA Edition), it may have been drowned for America. The audience, which would really be deviated from this film.
