I am a writer at home and Diagnosis Murderer is my lunch break - good, nice fun, good humor and Nostalgia's Dick Van Dyke show day. How innocent we were all (and how silly murder is innocent). I especially enjoyed episodes with other nostalgia stats like Joe Mannix. Bad guys always catch, good guys carry. They enjoy themselves clearly and without getting themselves taken very seriously, they get a force. <br /> <br /> One beef: Why are so many women or villagers? Amanda was very scary. <br /> <br /> I hope we do not see Dick Van Dyke on our screen and the family's end, SP. Lunchtime !!
