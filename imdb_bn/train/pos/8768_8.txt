I saw this film at a shop in the cheap section. I actually think it's definitely going to commercial and trailer for years ago. I thought "Hey Hey" and bought it, basically the plot seemed to be attractive and Claire's Dance was always a gifted person to me (this was before I became Kate Binsell's fan). <br /> <br /> So, almost two girls have been barred for drug abuse (which they are innocent) and then sent to Thailand prison. This image follows what will happen to them and sometimes asks their innocence. <br /> <br /> Both Claire Danes and Kate Binselsl have performed a great performance, and the plot of this film covers them unnecessarily and raises questions about some excellent moral discussions. <br /> <br /> I think it's a strong film, but some might improve. It can be long ... it helped strengthen these characters and create more insight into Thailand's justice system politics. However, moreover, it is a good film with some great performance. <br /> <br /> To find out the role of Paul Walker's two-minute role, you can find pop-culture junkies. For the first time I saw that I did not see him.
