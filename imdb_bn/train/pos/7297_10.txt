I really enjoyed this film. The plot was awesome, it was awesome. Jeff Combs has more talent than he has recognized for. I will finish the only part of this flick. The life of animals was much more dangerous for Saif Fai Channel. <br /> <br /> There were some interesting religious messages in this picture. Jeff Combs is clearly represented by a Messiah figure and animal charity (or shark if you prefer). There was some special horror scene that was 'the end of the world'. I noticed this only after viewing my third feature of these classic animals. I know many people will not get references to Christians, but if you look closely, you will find it.
