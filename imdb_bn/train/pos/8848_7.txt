I saw this picture very strange - I left it in my netflix list and could not remember why (besides Philip Camu Hoffman I knew it). Since this movie is not an opening credit, so I can not remember how it can handle it. <br /> <br /> My wife and I saw it, I went back to her about 45 minutes and said, "You know, I want to decide to hate this picture, but nothing about it lets me stop it. . "Then there is about half a dozen views stretched in the middle of the film, which is the power factor in the performance of real actors. <br /> <br /> It was like the last credit, which I realized was a Sydney Lumet movie. And I thought - Wow. I am surprised that Lumet is really bad, little story, true story of a broken guy. But it's a genre of its genius that I did not even realize it when I was taking it. <br /> <br /> This is really a really good Philip Seymour Hoffman Like the scary. Keep it up against Coptips and claim that I should have liked the Oscars for this film. <br /> <br /> I specifically recommend special feature with talking about the filming of Lumet, Haq and Hoffman - it is entertaining and educator, students interested in learning about Master Hawke's footsteps. Lumet definitely teaches you the first rules to work with actresses - kisses their asses kisses !! <br /> <br /> There are so many violent, composer movies that are when empty ciphers are called and done. And this film has an element in it - there is nothing left when the actor fills the air with passion and cleans the smoke. <br /> <br /> But Lumet gave us the network and Barley Eng Mani - movies that were highlighted in their own way in the highest echelons of the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is not on that level. But lingers that have something about it And maybe it's enough. <br /> <br /> If you see the number of comments about this short film on IMDb - and depth of comments and intelligence, pro and con - it's a pretty good indication that something special is going on with this movie. .
