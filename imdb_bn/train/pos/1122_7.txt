Four teenage friends travel to Fort Laudhelle for spring break. Unfortunately they get a flat tire in Medley, Georgia, and a girl in the girls is a witness to the cruel assassination in the woods. Local Sheriff is behind crime and nightmare ... "Shelley Grave" is a pleasant low budget surprise. Cast is preferable, direction is stable and violence is especially nasty and misogynistic. Especially the second murder is quite horrible. The murderer Sheriff is not a diminutive character-in. Some scenes seem to feel sorry for what he has done. The bay involved with the two sons who met the Diner can not go anywhere, but the wood-stained scenes are exciting and exciting in 10.
