To test a banned planet in a colony established 25 years ago, humans (literally) have been traveling millions of light years from a flying saucer to the Earth by a crew of about 2 million men of space explorer. It is more developed than a fantasy imagination in the world, a beautiful and completely socially inactive young girl, and her father, an ancient monk who is not afraid more than the monsters of ancient civilization, has drowned in itself. <br /> <br /> On the surface, this story is a gentleman scifi murder mystery. Some people compare with Shakespeare's Tempest, but it is a stretch and insinuation of the Sissy style in some ways. How does it stop a Sissy movie, sure, its tempest, but how many films can you say something like this? <br /> <br /> Below, it is a warning story about advancement and technology and the social evolution necessary for its proper and safe use. Yet the film has still come up with optimism for our future that we have come to expect from the show like Star Trek. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not the only reason to describe this picture as beautiful. Special effects and even the backdrop's aesthetics are strong enough to obscure clear directions and disproportionate acting. If it is not for the sophistication of the 1950s-scientist-East-Dico-Ness, you might think that you saw the fragments of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> This is a very special sub-genre of classical science finals, I want to call in the 1950s, and, though, my opinion, of course, of course it must of course watch for movies and special effects. Will be. It has been reinforced with clever tricks, now in Star Trek, Lost In Space, and even reusing six or seven divisions of Farske, it will be able to keep attention and maintain the interest of most Sissy fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in various aspects of this movie, which seems to be inspired themes inspired by Star Trek's original series, after almost 12 years, although they may disappoint themselves due to the 1950s sex and lack of any kind. Ethnic integration. Although I do not want to say nicot, the lack of social progress in this film was a big problem with me. <br /> <br /> Some people probably see this image being played only on one of the first of the acting roles, young, handsome Leslie Nilssen. Unfortunately, Nilson's performance is only average, and sometimes poor and poor (especially at the final stage of the film). Although Walter Kubura is very nice among other films, its role is even more effective. Mr Francis, Earl Holiman and amazing Robbie are the actors out of this crowd to stand out of this robot, although the whole star actor did a good job. I think the problems of featured performances are as much as the director and the editor blames. Although they mostly got the movie quite properly.
