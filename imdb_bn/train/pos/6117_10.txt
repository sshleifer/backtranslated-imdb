What I can say about the NeckRomanianus / Schizophrenic series is ... If you are not remotely "pc" or you do not get any humorous feelings, you probably will not get it. As sick and disgusting as this movie, it's not really a comedy and a "horror" movie. If you can realize someone who is pushing the boundaries of good taste and political purity for the most extreme limitations, it is so playful that it is so far away from the hand, then you must definitely see it in order to believe it. The film is not so much of a control that a major film studio can not touch 10 feet pole (including condoms). Although my opinion, the best, the most extreme piece comes from the underground way. If you do not see the same old formula that people see, they refuse it. <br /> <br /> I saw the horror, annoying, Z grade, indie movies stack that is only completely good VHS tape or DVD waste. I also saw sting bomber stacks coming from a big studio studio, which was a complete waste of millions of dollars. The two such cash movies come out from Ron Atkins / John ZiainSprro and all other "Shock" movies completely exclude the water, but you must take a second time to see the entire Indie movie scene. After watching it, you can really see how independence can be achieved by indie filmmakers doing their own work. The funny thing is, the others who saw this movie and "hated" acknowledged the truth that they ridiculed all through it. I do not think anyone can be annoyed by these two. So if you see what you see in the mainstream media, it does not take very seriously and ultimately the silhouette of the snooping can be silent, but you have to see it. You can be able to see it for just the stand alone, that's classic classical. Schizophreniac / Schizophreniac 2 is both among my favorite darling about 1000 DVDs.
