The summer blockbusters and the return of the movie have been so fulfilled and do not mention the disappointment of the prospect that I find it difficult to find a movie that I can sit and enjoy. <br /> <br /> If you do not want to fall further down the page (there are no spoilers here), I will add it here: it is more mature than Ella Enchantment (some suspiciously violent parts, a great amount of death and a little bit of blood Quantity view view), but it does not try to cross over its borders or exceed its boundaries. Think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical princess brides, and you'll be off. <br /> <br /> ------------------------------------------ ------------------- <br /> <br /> I may not be as extraordinary as a movie girl ... maybe one month or twice, I feel active. I'm a huge sci-fi / fantasy fan. I can repeat the repetitive story lines and movies with more flash than filling it faster than I can count 10 times, and this film is rough diamond in diamond. <br /> <br /> Here (August), I was tired of the disappointment of frustration from the big hits that I had seen on Bournie Ultimatum for Stardust. Transformers made my hopes completely gratifying for my addiction addiction, starred previews seemed to appeal, but I was definitely careful. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised like many others here. I thought of watching breakfast here from other generic fantasy movies cliched here. It's definitely a fairy tale, and it really requires suspends, witches, magic, and suspense immediately ... But the most refreshing thing I found is not based on anything that's been seen or read in the last 15 years, And it's really a good movie. <br /> <br /> ((Unlike other 90% of the movie which can be re-instated like a thornbust, probably coming out of the idea of ​​Hollywood? I can read a book this year, and in two years the movie is called "Epic Fantasy Story, Lotto and Others Just like "it will be out, so there is no name and no such name. No doubt.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To get my attention on what's happening on the screen, it does not even use the big explosions of the word (Transformers, I see you). It is not trying to show recent CGI techniques, and it is my understanding of lost conversations and story lines I have easily disgraced with which I have easily found the 3rd grade (I hated the boy). <br /> <br /> I Udhu saw. I saw before my eyes and enjoyed enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline. Of course, I'm probably going to happen throughout most of the film, I knew them, but you may forget it. It made even some parts twinge in my heart, but the most important aspect I've noticed was the feeling of the theater than that I went well. <br /> <br /> It's really a gem. This summer, many remixes and films which lowered my expectations were so hot, it was like a cold cup of sweet tea that I tried to get out of the hard work I did, trying to come along with them. My money's worth <br /> <br /> This is probably not for everyone, but do yourself good; If you enjoy the fantasy film of Time Alone (Madame Bride, Black Cauldron, Dark Crystal, etc.) you will really see this movie. While this little diamond is finding my DVD collection while saving it, you can believe it. <br /> <br /> Just wonderful.
