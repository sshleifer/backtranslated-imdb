This movie has surprised me! I never really expected much about the hectic! Because I wanted to watch this movie because someone said that John Woo Style has some serious action scenes in this movie! I'm very cautious when it is usually claimed! There is one man and today's day was not such a director that when it comes, his brightness comes! That "Moon Children" features a vampire even more convinced to me! How can you go wrong with the gun shining vampire! Promising and attractive words! The first thing about this movie is that the speed was slow! It takes time to set the fun! This movie has some wonderful Hong Kong style action scenes! But "moon child" is not an action movie! It's a drama about friendship and loyalty! Focus characters and their relationship to each other! Pop singer Hayd and Gact played a very good job and is very credible as friends! The only problem was with the plot! The film has been missing a few years without explaining what has happened for some years and why they were released! Example: When a member of the gang dies (very dramatic moment) Alexander Wang Kei (Hayde) drinks blood of the attacker! Without the warning and explanation, the film is nine years apart and most of the friends are not together anymore! Also, without a proper reason, the son (Alexander Wang) and the show (gaat) must kill each other! I know that some serious drama is added! Because of the actors it is very effective but sometimes it feels compelled! In addition to plot errors, this movie has an affinity and mildness that makes this movie difficult to choose! It's hard to explain why this movie is amazing! But that's right! The overall experience you get is impressive and sincere!
