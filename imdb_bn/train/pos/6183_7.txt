Financially locked paramount pulls all the stops for this '34 stage adaptation entry: Mitch Leissen, who is tagged as big budget, big cast, extraordinary production and director. what happened? Two things: Bassein Berkeley did not work for scripts for Rock and Kill Mystery, which was not worthy of the same trash because Charlie Chan came to the first street. I have to believe that the Great Duke Allington's number was cut in the wild, because it was not cut from Lisen's hand, but that does not mean that it's a look: its 'Sweet Maruana' number considers a heart-rending code of incomplete chorus girls; It is violently Toby Wing (which unfortunately fills horror lines and plays a prototype mobile phone) There is a Korean hot as Jack ahalayukta okira. Karl Brisson's performance is soft like melba toast but he is a capable singer. MacLaglen reaches for new Platauses as a stereotypical fool-detective. And try to spot Lucy in the chorus. This is a curiosity of 7.0 a. Think again in February 2010: I recently gave another look to this movie and now it seems that I was wrong to reduce the lack of number of Barclay production numbers. I understand the reasoning of Lee isen for more realistic production numbers in relation to the plot. I still have enormous problems with editing. The biggest studio in the city, Paramount, faced major problems with the production code in the worst of its history, talking financially, and finding all its stops (search for the beauty searches of 1934). Must see for a pre-code buffs.
