To bring a jelly creature, fall in a meteorite in a small town country. An old farmer was attacked by his aliens in his hand, and the young man Steve Andrews (Steve McQueen) and his girlfriend, Jane Martin (Anta Corsoaut), told him. T. Take it (Steven Chase). The local doctor used the blister carefully, and asked Steve to investigate where he found the old man. When Steve comes back, he kills Blob doctor. Steve and Jane try to warn their police and residents, but no one trusts them, although Blob makes many people grow up bigger. <br /> <br /> "The Blob" is a religious and classic science. . It's a low budget movie, many hamstars and actresses (with the exception of Steve McQueen), terrible effects, but fun and very, but very interesting. For the first time I saw this classic (I saw Kimi Dillon in 1988's Remki), and I really recommend this to 50-second Steve McQueen and fans of science-fi-B-movie. My review number may not be good on the subject of 1,400 films. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Bola" ("Blob")
