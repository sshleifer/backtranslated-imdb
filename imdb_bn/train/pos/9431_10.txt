And it's a very annoying film. I can be wrong, but this is the last movie where I consider Burt Reynolds as a real actor, who transformed the role and delivered a message. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are unassuming and unknown; Traders want to enjoy the country. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about this image is that such places still exist. In America, countrymen still hate the people; It's almost half a year after the civil war. <br /> <br /> You will enjoy this picture. It was portrayed in the rural areas of South Georgia, which still exists. Not just that, Alabama drives that drive; Still, the area has not been repaired even after Hurricane Katrina. 10/10.
