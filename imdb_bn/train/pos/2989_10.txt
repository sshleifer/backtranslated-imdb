First off, I just want to say I'm a big fan of Bate Miller. Stella is a very good film with a wonderful cast (Bate Miller, John Goodman, Trinity Alvardo, Stephen Collins, Marsha Mason) This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It works on the birth of a mother with a mother, she takes away many girls who came out of her way to bringing her daughter Jenny. This movie is very good and I would suggest you to have a copy to see it. Roger Ebert's 32/20 Star! And it deserves 4! Excellent! I give 4 of 4!
