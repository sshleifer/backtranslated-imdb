It is difficult to describe bugs in words, this is a film that is actually understood. It is more fluid and interesting than what I saw in the Liberation War of Hollywood, which follows a description. As its character responds to the chain of events in different ways, and dictates different paths to follow the characters in the event, the audience is merely an observer. Thinking about almost the extreme narrative flow of thought, the script will spontaneously spit on the screen, waiting to see how it finally works. And as much as the thematic element ... There is a special sequence in the movie that is sad, bright and beautiful, and then sad, in about a minute. And it works. <br /> <br /> This movie is pure magic. It reminds us why the independent film is currently the brightest star of the film industry. Perhaps with the more movies of the bug's quality, people will start to take notice.
