Just say, Oliver! One of the greatest musical instruments of all time. It is filled with memorable songs - "Give yourself a great food", "Oliver!", "Consider yourself" and "ohm-foot-foot" to name just few - and equally memorable characters. <br /> <br /> This is a perfect family movie, similar to a musical adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic novel and the story of Oliver Twist. There are some awesome moments - Oliver Reid's acting villain Bill Sykes is quite scary on himself - but overall, the film will appeal to adults as well as adults of all ages. <br /> <br /> - All of which are now aware - Oliver's little orphan boy and his life in London is growing. At first she is in the workhouse with her colleague orphan, but after receiving the courage to ask Mr. Bambal, the principal, she is sold as a family job. <br /> <br /> After many accidents and off Chavez, he met the artful dosher - played nicely by a young Jack Wild, who gave his role to everyone - and through him Greedy Fagin (Ron Moody), who is young boys Pick pocket treasures that he keeps for himself <br /> <br /> This picture is completely in Soundstage in Stopusas and Shaparton Film Studio However, it does not translate the film was uli. Set perfectly as a dress worn by letters, Victorian London replicas. Winner of a multi-Oscar and the huge success of his release, Oliver! Would be delighted to love a worthy competitor and film for the best musical of all time.
