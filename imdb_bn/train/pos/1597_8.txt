This is a kind of snowy Sunday afternoon, when the rest of the world can progress with your business, when you get a big arm-chair for a few hours and gently down. Wonderful performance from Cher and Nicholas Cage (as always) intriguing lines along the way. There is no rapids to cross, not a hazardous water, it's a warm and malicious pedal through the life of New York. Each feeling is a family film and one that deserves it to appreciate.
