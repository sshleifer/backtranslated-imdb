I really miss to produce the old fashioned spicy film. If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory were offered such a film, it could be for the lack of internationally known top drawer cast. This is a movie that you see alone in a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn and you do not bother till the morning because you just want to hide under cover. Bravo Directors Herbert Wise, author Susan Hill and Nigel Canale, John Bunker's production design, John Ralph's art direction and bitter me and makes me feel completely apart from living in isolated cities. In the world at the beginning of the 21st century. I gave it "9" out of "10" because of the tightening of television production and budget, they really pulled out a great show.
