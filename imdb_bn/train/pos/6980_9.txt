I must admit, I was one of the suspects who used to prematurely judge this show before any information was circulated about it. I'm sure it's Ronald D. Moore directed Ronald D. Going to be the cheap spin off by Moore. <br /> <br /> I was wrong <br /> <br /> The pilot is impressive on the spectators. Accessibility is incredible! Of course, BJZ veterans will plunge themselves, which focuses on the development of silos before the first war. (58 years before the BSG pilot incident). The pilot also allows for beginners, clearly presenting his plot and ideas in the first part of the episode. <br /> <br /> Do not make a mistake: "MapCoos" is not a BSG. We are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama depicted by provocative, brave, and controversial ideas. <br /> <br /> Casting maintains the quality of BSG; Stoltz and Morales are simply wonderful. Inspired by William's almighty screenplay, Joseph Adams Morales' screenplay provides an amazing view of William's heroic father. Stoltz's screenplay. GRESTSTON has raised many thoughts and questions. <br /> <br /> If there is any indication that the pilot's value does not yet come, then the RDM and creative team are ready to continue the legacy of the BSG for the first time. Television programmers with another masterpiece made with television masterpieces.
