There is not much going on in this story - there are two different ways to manage Vietnam's memories, only two men employ. But it's lacking in the beginning, it's more than being created for acting and reality. It's a cool movie about friendship ties and sharing experiences. We can also get romance (not unreal - another very real part of this story). It's a good price to see.
