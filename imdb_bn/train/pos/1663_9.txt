I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful movie and was curious about this female painter which I have never heard of before. So I searched his life and set out to work later. Expected, I found that the film was historically correct. Although I was a little surprised by the negative comments of the film due to this inconsistency. Come on, guys, do not have a movie and a biography (not a novel!). Any historical film distorts the reality, because it should be the work of its own industry. A filmmaker is entitled to use his material to make his world a reality and history. Artemisia is a wonderful movie and I think it brings many people to explore the life and work of this interesting artist (now gives some negative comments).
