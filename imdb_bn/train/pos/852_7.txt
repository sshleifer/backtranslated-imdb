Matador Hit-Man movie lights .... you can tell about a hit-man movie. Violence is not really shown but often introduced. At first I was afraid that I was in the mid-90s for the rebirth of gangster-hit-man-hipster-dark comedy, but when I realized it was a sweet and ridiculous story about friendship. There is nothing terrible about this movie, but every bit of it keeps me grinning. In recent years, there are three major Lead chemistry given by the big screen and it seems that they have a great time to make this film together. Although the chart is sharp, it seems to have been adapted from script play due to a feeling dialogue scene. This is a good movie which I probably would not remember very long, but at the time it was a complete joy. good picture.
