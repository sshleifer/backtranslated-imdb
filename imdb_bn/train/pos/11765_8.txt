This movie made me wonder, it was a good fishing and laugh, + a nonstop action-packed story that was accompanied by lots of guns and explosions. This movie was a lot of wonderful twists and watches amazing. Despite the fact that the plot is difficult to others, it ultimately keeps me interested in it completely. In conclusion; This is a great way to spend time film buff time.
