Marilyn Dietrich and Charles Boyer gave strong performance in this beautiful but empty film. Humorous that Dietrich plays a woman with a beautiful but empty life. Truly gorgeous cinematography and set, and yes Dietrich's clothes hinge trunk is also fabulous. He looks great; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Score by the highest stenner, and cast a good support. The image continues as 76 minutes and is edited badly, as well as showing or disappearing specific characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Tilly Lochch Dancer, John Carabin Devineer, and Basil Rothbone ... I'm not sure. He just rides from the desert and spoils everything! As others mentioned, John Gilbert was starred with Direcrick. I could not help but it seemed he'd be nice. The world's tired Boris role was very favorable for Gilbert. And with the success of Queen Cristina (proudly), she went back to her career track. <br /> <br /> I can not think of any other 30 films of Dietrich. She looks great and wears some awesome clothes. My choice is to wear a decorated decor as Valentino, which he wear by the pool. <br /> <br /> Surely valuable for the search and color and the search for two big stars.
