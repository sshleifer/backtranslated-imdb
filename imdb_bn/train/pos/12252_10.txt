I really enjoyed this adaptation of "Emma". I have seen it many times and are always looking forward to seeing it again. Although it only lasted for 107 minutes, novel plots and sub-plots were developed appropriately. . All the letters are well-imprinted. Most of the conversations did not come directly from the novel, with a stupid joke added to Emma Thompson's sensitivity and sensitivity. <br /> <br /> As a foreigner, I especially appreciate the perfect words of the actors. The setting and the costume were beautiful. I found this version equally with the 1995 edition "Pride and Prizudies", but then the producers and artists were the same. Kate Bekinissel has done a really good job illustrating "Emma", due to which Jane Austen said that she would make heroin but she loves. He is snobbish but still young and inexperienced still have to be preferred. Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr. Knightley, I think, even though he does not see the caricature shown by Col. Firth's Mr. Darcy Pride and the Prejudice. In addition to the last scene (harvesting festival) that does not occur in the novel, apart from showing it cold and almost unpleasant with Fumming Churchill, it provides a perfect end, when he meets the person in the novel, even told him that he was in his position, Dangers will be enjoyed. A strange exit from the otherwise shown loyalty throughout the film. I made the dress more beautiful and broader than the other adaptations of Jane Austen's novels.
