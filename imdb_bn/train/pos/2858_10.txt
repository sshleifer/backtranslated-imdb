Bonanza was a great cast of wonderful actors. Lauren Green, Parnell Whitaker, Michael London, Dan Blaker and even Gae Williams (1972 were brought to the casino for several episodes, when he replaced Adam during the series). Cast chemistry was, and they looked genuinely like each other. As a result, their weak stories work much better than them. This made their best stories in the great western drama. <br /> <br /> Any show that was shooting on thirty episodes per season, it is also forced to weaken. However, most of the episodes of each episode have an interesting story, some conflicts, and a resolution that usually does not include violence. Banana was a western, gunfight was not featured as the main attraction. I am a fan of The Rifleman and Wanted: Dead, Alive; Those shows usually end up with a gunfight. Gunfights were very different in solving the conflict towards the West, and trying to seek peace and instead of the assassination of Bonanza instead of seeking peaceful solutions. <br /> <br /> In Banana's early years, there are some interesting episodes, which have a feature, a lot of gunfights. Those episodes stand in contrast to the rest of the series, but they themselves and pretty good. In 1964, when Parnell Whitaker wanted to leave the show, Gai Williams was replaced by him. Williams is playing a long lost lost cousin. Unfortunately, Whitaker decided to stay for another year, and thus William Williams was written out of the series while going to marry Adam's old girlfriend. Williams used to stay for Bananzar, but no one can imagine that in the years following 1965, the series of Perneil Whitaker had become a series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The series, story comedy and more focused on the country's hyphens. Whitter was often a heavy game in many episodes, and the remainder of his absence left a void. Little Joe always wanted to play beautiful baby, and Hussein always wanted to play a good old boy with a golden heart. Since Ben was a kind and intelligent father of the family, since there was not much space for any gunfight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It was rarely than an older version. For more than a year or two, Ben was a teenager with another lost cousin (ie, played by forgotten Mitch Vogel), which usually had some problems with somebody. <br /> <br /> Adding a teenager, the studio was looking for attracting young visitors. It gives the author the opportunity to write episodes about teenage problems, alcohol, crime etc. Such promotional episodes were popular in the 1960s as a media response to the establishment of mass media movement. Although Dragnet was probably the most popular source of law and order TV, Hawaii 5-0, F.B.I. And many other shows tried to jump into bandwigging with TV shows, among which illegally seized children created frustration, delusion, and crime. <br /> <br /> Katrina gives more opportunities to show cartoons of a teenager link up and solve problems, but those episodes are very felt and common is not very good. After the death of Dan Blaker, the series was limited to one year or more for a few years before the cancellation. The last season was quite bad, because it had little Joe tracking his wife's murderers, and most of the episodes were somewhat depressed because Little Joe usually used to drink alcohol or otherwise thought how much he loved his wife and how much he had died. I do not think I have ever seen the last episode of the series, and I'm surprised that they have somehow officially covered it. Before Adam moved away, Adam (Lorraine Green) lived in reality, as Adam walked away (and did not return as a guest) and Jos died and Little Joe was killed by his wife (later) series drifters. <br /> <br /> Overall, the best of this series is the era of 1959-1965. Once Adam goes away, he gradually refuses it. The show was mostly very good since the 1970s. By the 1970s, the series had worked hard to make hip and topical, and it lost many of its western smell. The link between candy and teenage children also thrives on the general quality of listening and the death of Hussein (Dan Blaker) was the final nail. Probably Banana is probably the best West series, and 465 episodes were produced, at least one hundred excellent western plays in them! That's a pretty good record. Even Bonnarja is even better than most other TV shows.
