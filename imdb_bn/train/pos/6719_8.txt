I love this movie because it is a fine work of the movie, it has been made by people who are not enough for art, but only for home movies. This is a home-made super-surveyor, Greg Knoll, and signals herself with her 50-year emotion, providing a boat for amateur videos from others. Nevertheless, it has expanded to degrees that can reach aesthetic glory. It may be artistic genius, and the athlete is filled with talent, but trivial may seem to be a surfing athlete. Surfers are not pilot pilots or exam pilots. No they are the surgeon (probably) or PhD (again, perhaps). It is believed to find surfer. It is believed in people's folly beauty. It is a great gift of peace, which comes from the end of the war. 15 years ago the Japanese celebrated the end of the war on the northern beach of a Hawaiian island coming from Zero. With Russia's socialists, it celebrates the time of a cold war fight rather than a hot war. Surfing is the ultimate narcissism. It's dangerous, but only a little historian. I doubt Alexander Great will not be celebrating for his surfing strategies. He has to take and get favorable press he will win a few dozen countries. This movie has no military hero. It has no guns. The only beach-head surfers have a beer stand and a surfboard shop. It's not a problem. Peace is not frustrating. It is the exhalation joy.
