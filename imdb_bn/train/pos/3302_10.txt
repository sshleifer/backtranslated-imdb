Probably the most polished and accomplished in all Indian films - Pikazeah usually does not fall into a trap associated with Bollywood movies (i.e. the extravagant imitation of the theme / generator of western film). Pakeezah sub-continental and authentic indigenous, almost like Madame butterfly-plots. Characters are well-developed, directional, although sometimes accurate, accurate, and reliable by today's standards. Master speaker milieux understatement at Pakeezah and talks about subtleties of age! While acting (especially 'Appearance' and dynamic among characters) is happy to see, however, it may be lost to contemporary visitors or those who are not familiar with Muslim India and India's customs. <br /> <br />, an impressive screenplay is developed by a prominent musical score show, the classic show of classical Indian dance (kathak) display hero. For most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but without the viewer she will not leave her audience, she feels that she has been a part of the truly memorable movie experience. Pikazeh certainly is not the top of the production of Indian cinema and it is unlikely to be parallel.
