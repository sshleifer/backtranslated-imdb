This was a smart drama about the way of life of Hanky ​​Tone in Texas in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger have played very credible acts like Bud and CC Davis. This picture has really opened the domestic music scene and helped to introduce the American vapor to America. If you love a good romance movie then you will love this movie.
