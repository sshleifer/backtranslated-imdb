It is an excellent thriller from Turkey which is sensory. Great job from Gokbakar brothers. <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to point towards the screen play. Usually, screen play is not enough for most movies from Turkey, but Jane calls the best shot "perfect". And also the part of the transfer is really nice. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, "Jane" is a great thing that affects everyone. In particular, a woman who wants to be a postgraduate in Sanitaryri, has a habit that is a habitual madness. General reasons and psychological consequences are given in the general. All you have to do is combine all the hints. <br /> <br />> Doug Route and Sahan Gokbakar have played an impressive part of the impression. This performance can be more realistic than "Irvivervale (Monica Baluchi)". <br /> <br /> The last thing I want to say is "Watch this movie, you will be confused"
