This movie was great and I would like to buy it. The boy is going to catch a young eagle with his grandfather. The boy should feed the beef and take care until the dedication for the crop is old. The boy protects the eagle from killing and escapes from the tribe. Eagle helps her to catch a duck from a small pond that she feared the boy. The boy then shot a deer saying that a fool was asking because his arrows were very close. Until the thickness of the red lines is tested, they determine that the car has actually got deer. But it is unfortunate because it makes other boys even cruel, and ultimately they are moving on the mountain, but when you think that he will stop his pure love, the eagle will transform him into a golden eagle only. Necklace as a reminder about who he was. Please let me know if anyone knows where I can buy this movie. I have not seen it for over 30 years, but I still remember parts of the movie .deniselacey2000 @ yahoo.com
