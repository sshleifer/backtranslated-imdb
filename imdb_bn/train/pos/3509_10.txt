I have seen this picture a while ago and it is still at the top of my favorite movie list. It combines surprisingly and how does the film make a detailed tead bit (for example, 'Cafe Bustello' coffee track is reused as a cup for her grandchildren's hair wash) that people will not understand this scene because it does not see if you are not hyonic. This is just one of the cultures that are very culturally specific and special. If you have no prior knowledge of any foundation you have built it, please do not lean the film. I'm completely looking for the author / director, and he hit the target perfectly! This image is a very good rating.
