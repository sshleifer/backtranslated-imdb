Now I love American Pi 1 and 2, as well as 3 stillerens for the performance of Sun William Skate, but then the quality has diminished. The band camp keeps the quality high with the characters you actually cared about, but the nude mile recycled the same joke and plot-lines (like Erik Stifler's sexual issue is Jim). There were some exciting moments like playing soccer, "punishment" in the medieval and Kozemannan but lacking all originality and "mile" was just stupid and deadly. Not to mention the annoying girlfriend who does not have sex. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enough about nude miles. I have seen the beta house fear, because I think it will take the series to a new place but I was happy. There is no real plot to be honest but it is hot girls (Ashley incredible) and sexual jokes are full of plenty. Yes it is the formula and old Jokes, but the Duet Stauffler (Steve Tallie) has presented the bar with an outstanding performance. Christopher McDonald's Camio is ridiculous while entertaining the Greek Olympiad, especially in the last and final events. Although there are weak points. Kozemannan became annoying for the first time, how I was still upset as part of it. <br /> <br /> Kozemann is bad but Eric Stefler is bad. John White created pain to hate the nude mile but at Beta House, he took his performance to a whole new audience. First and foremost he lacks the charisma, a stifler prerequisite. You can not really care less about her. For the only reason I was disturbed about his relationship so Ashley could have been on the screen! As the rest shadow he shines on top of it. Sincerely John White is about the worst performance of the bad and a dead fish as much about Karimama. <br /> <br /> It says that this movie is entertaining and Kozemannan fears that his daughter is not really a girl, brilliantly funny <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
