[No Spoilers] <br /> <br /> David Lynch is filming, he may have an idea that most of his feature films illustrate his intelligent mind. But as the title indicates it is a very straightforward story. Uncomfortable stuck inside the normal linginian region, which usually occurs after watching the Lost Highway. This is a simple film but it's actually a great movie. That's both an innovative and an entertaining direction. It is innovative because it is not so lucid. But perhaps that IS Lynch He liked to pull our minds together and so put together a film that can keep us away from the mainstream and the lynch. Being a superfine director, he can create such a movie only to combine his regular audience because he knows what they expect but they do not give it to them. <br /> <br /> <br /> I would say about the motion of lawn mowers ... do not expect an action orgy, but the film is really entertaining for those who are flowing. Look carefully for those small details of Lynch's plot across the movie for our entertaining. Find great movies that transform this movie into life. And the score of Badlantie and the main theme, which really sounds animated by the animation and visibility of Iowa and Wisconsin. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth holds one of his best performances in this film, which makes him one of the most popular 'male' male illustrations in the film. She does not have to say anything to express her feelings and thoughts. His loneliness only shines through him, and his performance earned him the Oscar nomination. What would I say that his poor health did not work in this film? He diagnosed with cancer and shot himself after the film was completed. This knowledge only emphasizes in the film because it has become respectable to Farnasworth. <br /> <br /> All of the above are a very beautiful motion picture, which is suitable for all kinds of people who feel like they should be like a movie. Someone may ask for homily which is not clear and is not a bit naive, but it does not destroy the overall image, it is a memorable motion picture. 9/10
