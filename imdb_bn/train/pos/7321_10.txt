One of the best examples of Halloween independent film. It has been made very well and it has more psychological elements that you can first understand. This is called a simple movie very well. Music is one of the best and most horrible scores ... If you have not seen this movie yet, you must check it out. Cast is all awesome. I did not make sequel after they sequel. The first one was the best one and should end up like it without a signal. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She did not feel at the age (she is today without hairdo and seventeen clothes, as pretty). One of the most awesome things through masks!
