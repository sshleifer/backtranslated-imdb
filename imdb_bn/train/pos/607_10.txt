Maybe I love this movie so much because I feel dumped and it's a pretty little angel. Whatever the reason, I thought it was perfect pitch. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effect, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie has made me happier than a while. <br /> <br /> This is a very funny and cute movie. The prince of Rajkumar's brutal reign and the subsequent drowning of magical influences, and dozens of smart little touches impressed me. That makes so much better; It is a wide, special effect-portable movie that has more stories than most movies, but small things contain incredible attention. <br /> <br /> I'm just going forward and saw it again.
