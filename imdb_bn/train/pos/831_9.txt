I saw this movie when it was under limited release, mainly to see Pierce Brosnan beating novelty, but I became one of the funiest movies I've seen throughout the year. It starts almost as a thriller, but Pearce continues continuously in a ridiculous part of a lanor and great comedic power between Brosnan and Greg Kieyner. Also, when I say this movie is a comedy, it sometimes does not seem that it has a heart and can be touched very much when it is needed. When I went to the theater, I do not know what to expect a lot more than Musa, but what I got it for a long time I have seen one of the best movies. Out of the theater I felt very full from the film and planned to see it again in a wide release. I suggest it that those who appreciate a good written script and a good comedy with a big spice.
