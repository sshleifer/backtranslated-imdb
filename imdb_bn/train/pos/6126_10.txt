I saw Jack Frost for Â£ 4: 00 at my local store and I think it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so I bought it and I was right that it was good. In the beginning, this image is about a murderer's snowman, so that it may laugh about something and how it looks, is more fun than Snowman's cover. <br /> <br /> The role was correct and like Jack Frost said, "I just threw you away for smoking" and "the world's largest PI is closing the snow cone" It's so funny and camping? At the beginning this story was quite funny and stupid, "Jack got up suddenly, Jack fast, Jack candle took glory with a stick". If you search for a B-movie comedy horror that is full of puns, then check Jack Frost out. 10/10
