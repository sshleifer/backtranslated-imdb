I really think this movie is great. However, every movie has a downer. Now, some of you have not seen Hilary Duff's 'Rise Euro Voice', but if you think about it, then the two shows are very similar, if you know what I mean. In 'Blave New Girl', it's so bad to go to the Holi Harry Conservatives. In 'Rise Euro Voice', Terri L.A. Want to go to a Conservatory (do not remember the name of conservatism there). They both have both music fields, and they both have sung to the semester. It's really fun how these two movie units are. I personally like 'brave new girl' though like 'raising your voice'.
