Stranger is a very, very different film. James Karen and Brooke Adams are in the film and they have performed quite well. This image builds up firmly and it keeps you going. However, due to the scenes and the plot, you want to be a horror fan. There is a nudity that can be dropped without any nudity, and to some people this scene can frustrate someone like me and think that the staff destroys a good movie but it comes at that time. There is a scene where Adams's character goes to nuts and kills a cat, but you can not say it real. Music is very different but very good. In my opinion unmarried is a really vague film that is unpredictably unpredictable and that's quite weird! I recommend all the awesome fans of this movie!
