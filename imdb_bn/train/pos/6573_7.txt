The film has a straightforward feeling from the beginning - I think it will play better than a movie because set and drama consider a movie version to be more artificial. But, still, it takes fairly well, and is interesting in the story and especially dialogue. They have just taken the conversation right from the original game. Perhaps it is a good introduction to the show's plays. <br /> <br /> Main character Rainea is a mood for his head and drama in the clouds, and Helen Bonham Carter's acting plays a good part here. Her fianc√©, Serges, is very cartoon when she is supposed to be really an extremely beautiful dashing figure. Her dad is quite entertaining.
