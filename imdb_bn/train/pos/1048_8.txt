For Muslim women in Western Africa, married life can be very difficult in the hands of insulting husbands. The community can not explicitly support such behavior, but equally they may not be ready to see it as a criminal, an attitude that certainly enables it to continue. Fortunately, the Cameranian law pledges to equality for all, and this documentary follows the real life exploitation of female practitioners in the Cameronian legal system, since they try to secure justice for women and children. Noteworthy (except the appeals central story), despite their formalities, if a case is actually bought, the court is progressively progressive. The program gives an impressive insight into the entire Cameronian lifestyle, which seems to be amazing psychological and delightful compared to being enjoyed by the inhabitants of Europe or North America (in particular, from featured horrendous crimes). And when I acknowledge that this comment may betray my part, then this attitude seems to be catching up with the delightful Pidgin-English. Overall, it's a terrific little movie and you can watch even more fun than you imagined.
