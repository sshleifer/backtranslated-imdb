I was surprised and amazed, how much I enjoyed this most worried controversial drama, which, instead of an estimated 6.6 rating, I almost missed; Since I rarely give the time of day to a movie given below 7/10. That said, I am very happy to see why the Stone Angel deserved it so much. And if you are one of the increasingly sensitive, passionate and thoughtful people among the people of the living form of this world. <br /> <br /> I must say that in many ways (although not all) for example, its theme, execution, style, production etc., many of the Stone Angle reminded me of "notebook" praised. I am surprised that other commentators have not found many similarities that hit me throughout the movie, so I can only guess that those who comment are still not seeing the notebook. They can not share the theme of Alzheimer's, but I can confidently say that if you enjoy the "Notebook" you will certainly get a lot of things to do with your most effective product with "Stone Angel". But if you have not seen the notebook and do not read this step based on a book (which, in fact, I am not), but of course, you must find a lot to keep your attention firmly - as long as your favorite styles are included in a fast paced action thriller do not do. This is a film for thinkers and those who remember the time spent, how life has changed over the years and what has happened in life like a gauge in the year's life <br /> <br /> <br /> This odd one The underlying yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8/10. I gave 11% of eleven 11% to 1/10 for the current rating 6.5 / 10. This comment attracted less than 300 votes while writing this comment. However, if 11% think that it is possible to have the lowest ranking, then why do not they expect the movement of cars and explosions ... why they are in the movie premiere and promotional lines for a few seconds? Oh dear ... Whatever the coming of the world, do not miss this most intimate son of this movie - only * if * you have a brain (ie, you do not include the top ten transformers, fight clubs or the terminator)).
