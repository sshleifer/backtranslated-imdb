An excellent concept of a simple concept has evolved into 90-minute scripts. <br /> <br /> Set up does not require any bell and stairs, no long exposure or wardi background; Kate (Frank Potente), a German businessman who lives in London, left while waiting for the last tube train. He awakens to find the place emitted, but quickly he can realize that he is away from alone. Someone, or something, is there with her and its purpose is completely contaminated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Please.

Welcoming the idea of ​​a certain feeling of mystery and reminding us that the journey to this movie is always going to be more important than the right destination. <br /> <br /> I think the budget for this movie is at least, at the very least, in this case, our appreciation for British this horror should be strong, because at any time there is the impression of failing to print angle cutting or effects. <br /> <br /> This sounds like your kind of movie, but perhaps it's Buy a ticket and ride in the sea.
