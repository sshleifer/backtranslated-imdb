My opinion VIVAH is the 2006 best film, coming from a director who has been successful throughout his career. I am not very interested in romantic movies this day because I saw them as "old wine in new bottles" and so predictable. However, I have seen this movie thrice ... and believe it is a great movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film gives relaxation in all entertainment because it can reflect (or will) reflect on what we can do in the wedding. In this sense, Suraj R. Barjatya made his home work well and portrayed a very realistic story in a beautifully entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> A few sequences of this movie will immediately catch your interest: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amito Rao) - then she and her family try to see him very clearly Do it. <br /> <br /> * When the first conversation of martyr and emirate comes to see him - that is, what Shahid Shahid knew is not what he really knows. But pull a decent conversation about me. It also gives soft answers to Amrita's innocuous nature, limited contact with eyes, shy characteristics and martyr's question. <br /> <br /> When Amrita and her uncle (Alanknath) broke the image, they returned the form of Shahi's team to the form. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is apparently related to Amrita Rao. Actress Poonam has played the role of this firm belief that you can not imagine anyone else. She looks beautiful throughout the whole film and portrays a completely innocent and shy traditional girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> He provides a promising performance and the sun rises. He is not less than Salman Khan while playing Barrata. Actually martyr and Amrita created inexperienced on-screen couple without suspicious shadows. Other characters - Alak Nath (extraordinary), Anupam Kher (Bright), Mohan Joshi (very good). <br /> <br /> Completely, Viva gives her promises, a consolidated and realistic story of two families. To enjoy this movie, the film has top performances, extraordinary stories and great music, as well as being managed by Suraj and Barjatya. It must be seen!
