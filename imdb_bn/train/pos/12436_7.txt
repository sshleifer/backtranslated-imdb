I have collected the number of stripes, now have to read the modest Blaise for several years. Many years ago, after the creation of Foysco movie, the first book was based on "Modalie Blaise", I was surprised that this result got better. <br /> <br /> What I got is not based on movie or action. The director was focused on history and psychology. How humility was based on his own story, and any part of his life was influenced by his nakedness. I think you'll understand more about the movie next (I hope) for the movie. I just like the old style movie. <br /> <br /> Not everything was good, gambling was not good. Almost boring and unrealistic The performance has been very improved. I can not feel bad guy in this movie, that's why there was only one reason that someone could talk about his story. They can also extend the film, when it creates "network" and more about it, but I guess it will be for the next movie. <br /> <br /> and forgive me in my bad english
