A great gangster movie. Sam Mendes ordered this beautiful movie to be seen by another father-son cameradar. Brilliant star Cast with Tom Hendes (Michael Sullivan) did a great job. Again he is acting in his role. She is an acting legend. Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig are also acting. Cutting is very good. The plot is pretty good. You will enjoy the movie. A great screenplay of the gangster in the 1930s. In the 1930s, it will definitely be seen that all gangsters of the era are the genre of the film. Suitable for soundtrack movie. It shows a great glimpse that the father is going to protect his son. I got bent down for my choice. Completely recognized 10
