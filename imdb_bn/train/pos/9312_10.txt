All the scary scenes about the Raptors because I love to see a lot of this movie. I like the raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts look at the back of the pillar overnight, because it reminds me of a scene from a girl who ate the banana on July 13th. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this film because the computer graphics seem a little fake, but it's okay because once you enter the film, you rarely see what's going on and I think it's a good end. Although I do not understand what is happening to me. The first couple visit I figured it with time and that important part. The second important part is that if you are seeing it for the first time, how dinosaurs can be terrible. <br /> <br /> This is the best movie.
