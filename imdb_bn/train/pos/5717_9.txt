Omegosh, this is the most horrific movie I've ever seen. Not saying that I love horror movies, it will be reduced and I saw the haps (considering it's limited availability of New Zealand, it is much more), but I could never sleep in the light ... until I saw it <br /> <br /> Some might say that it's ring of the ring (both based on Japanese horror films), both of the same (yet different) story lines, but blame fears itself Kara movie - saw the movie, I did not even yell at the movie to a certain point. <br /> <br /> Acting from extraordinary, especially supporting characters - KD Strictland is fantastic and steals a show, she is such an enthusiastic person. Jason Behr is a real hottie, and William Mapper looks like he's having fun. Anyway, I'm usually a fan of Claude Duval, she does not really think of this movie. Among the supporting characters, she probably got the most depth and back story, but she does not seem like all there. For Sarah Michelle Glamor, is she the same about all her movies and roles? Ghosts were really frightening, music and sound effects were diminishing (especially voices when KD Strickland's character answered the phone in her apartment), the end was very quiet. <br /> <br /> made a super recommendation. 9/10
