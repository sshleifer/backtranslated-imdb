It ran from 1959-1973. This series says a lot more than its longevity. It has changed fashion and taste changes from 50 second Cyclical 60 and has been popular in the 70's. <br /> <br /> I think this series is repeated. This is a successful combination of stories, cast and all the elements of the production which makes it exceptional. Lorne Green had its sympathetic iconic character from this series. His application was throughout the generation. All members of the family can enjoy this. It balances morality with violence, humor with seriousness. Due to its effect, a cartoon series spin off it from it. The shame that this series is no longer repeating and many will not know its significance.
