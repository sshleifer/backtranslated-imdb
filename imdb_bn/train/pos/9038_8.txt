I liked the Sky Sky. The thing I liked most was music. It worked in two ways: it gives time to viewers in the first hour of the film. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, takes a mechanical score. Music now fits perfectly the mood of the film. <br /> <br /> I just did not enjoy music, I also enjoyed a lot of custom. Jake Gilillahal as Homer Hickam was especially surprised for me. He stopped the first-class program as Chris Owie (Quantin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam). <br /> <br /> I've seen this movie run away from the life you have already given twice, and both of the times I enjoy myself thoroughly.
