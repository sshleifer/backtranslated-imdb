Michel Rodr√≠guez Diana, a high school girl who has a disgraceful scolome and 2x4 on her shoulder. He is ready to fight with someone, especially his father who is paying for his brother's boxing lessons. Diana decided to have a good way to focus her anger on boxing. <br /> <br /> I like the relationship between Diana and Adrian. Santiago Douglas as Adrian is nice. See how each of their emotions towards each other is shaped by round circles.
