I love this program so much and I am so incredibly sad that it has been canceled so I think it's back again, but only two fooled weeks Horrible I hate how we all eventually do not find out. It sucks. Get it back! ABC does not give stellar shows like Superini and Couture but better ones like six degrees. If they complained about ratings, it was probably a bad slot because it was really a good show, which I could have related and expected. JJ Abrams, he's awesome, I hope ABC can only believe enough to complete the story. I liked the whole cast too. I could not wait to see how each one would meet each other. Everyone's story is incomplete, now I will never know whether Steven and Whitney will be together or Carlos and Mae. I wanted to see what would happen to Laura or Damien and everything else. This is really such a downer.
