I look forward to Nicholas Cage, and I appreciate him as an actor. Now watching this movie (in 2005), I see that it is not really appropriate in the style of movies coming in the early 90's. I do not really think it's a movie silent, but it's mostly dark because of the character's light and weird personality, it's quite dark. Typical performance actors from each of the three main stars, who did a good job with their role. I think, although Hooper and Boyle's letters have not been adopted, because they have difficulty understanding what they are doing and why they're doing it. Hooper loves him or hates him. The plot is really good, and even though I think some part is too unreal, there were some parts where I had to hand over the director (as he first saw the sheriff). All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching. *** 1/2
