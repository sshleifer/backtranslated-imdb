A mature woman is an excellent scene, which is going to lose everything (even the parent has a mortgage). He has completely mixed the way in which this particular "business", integrity, and the link between the real love exists among the small city people, so it can provide us as a fresh, light and funny comedy. I could not smile with a very funny scene of two older women in a drugstore. <br /> <br /> I love European movies, and with movies like this, my opinion gets stronger. I also close the eyes that I have closed with my eyes, the same way the Walking Nine Divine. <br /> <br /> Saving Grace, a comedy that many friends enjoyed like me. You love it
