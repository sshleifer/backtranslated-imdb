After making an anonymous phone call about a space station in contrast to frozen wood, two police officers proved the incident and evidently went away from a Martin spot. They travel to the nearby High-Way caf√© and they wait for a bus to stop and restart a snowfall on seven passenger bridges. However, the driver said that he had only six passengers when he was parked on the bus. During interrogation of passengers, strange things happen in the diner, lights switching on and off and turntable is on and off. When the passengers are released and the bus follows its journey, a passenger returns to the diner and publishes a plot to attack the world. <br /> <br /> "What will real Martinian stand?" This is one of the best mountains in the great series. Curiosity is a satirical and malicious dialog, funny character and circumstance, and surprisingly and totally unexpected plot points. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "And Marciano" ("Martian")
