The 1970s horny movie was less than today's Triplex Romance, which is good. Because there is a good story around naked shows and sexual scenes. Of course, I wish they had had some vampire effects that were for some time during their time and the story got a little story way. Plenty of times were difficult to understand in the timeline, but it is valuable to see an educated version after seeing the edited version of David's Playing Edition edition. But if you are not worried about nude women's dancing and sex, then this is not a movie for you. However, I've enjoyed it and I give it ... 7 Star.
