A dramatic movie in full sense of the word. It tells a trail that we do not understand how sad we live in Greece as a daily routine of life. Certainly this is something extremist .. But every now and then beyond the real life sorrow industry. The goals that we follow and deeply critical to build the entire social structure around them. This picture gives deep understanding of life, stereotype and social structure in Greek way. Like most Greek movies, which is not like a specific fast-food-mainstream audience, it does not specifically target anyone, but if you look at it, you feel that someone places the best possible words and images to describe your feelings. I'm not a big fan of traditional music but I do not want to hear anything else while playing in the film. <br /> <br /> If someone used to tell me to say something against this film, I would like to define the following, sometimes the scene takes a sudden or slightly cut. I think it would be 2 hours for the theater to fit the theater and cut it to fit a bit. However I can write more about expressing my thoughts on this issue but I think you will see it and discuss it with a friend. A must see
