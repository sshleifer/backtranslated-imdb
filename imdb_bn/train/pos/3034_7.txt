The underlying combination of Graham Greene's Cinematic Canon - his perceived flaws can now be viewed as a quality. Director Shamlin, the dramatic director, frames his work with an oppressive hardness for the element, and apparently indicates inactive compositions. A dark thriller and a story of moral rebirth (for the female character !, 40th thriller!), A cruel hero of this movie who turns crazy and slayer (and probably padfiliyake), brightly brings the distant ideology of the Spanish Civil War to arouse the dangerous reality, a horrible Wonderful insight into murder, class and capitalism, clever theater Ru A Greene is a rare anumanikata God and towards the end, however, only be happy if you know anything about the history.
