In December 2000, I was delighted to see the Contemontant Man for the first time on the TV premiere. <br /> <br /> An Infectious Disease Specialist (William Hart) lost his family when his unidentified person entered his house and killed them. . Now a few years later, he is now in Russia or elsewhere. I'm sure exactly where, I do not know that it takes place somewhere in that area. However, due to budget cutbacks in an infectious disease laboratory, they are forced to stop most workers from them. One of them, an unbanked security guard named Joseph Muller (played by Peter Wella, who was known as an unforgettable Robocop) went there and demanded to serve him there. She needs this list because she is divorced and she needs her to support the child. So he goes there, breaks out a fight, and get some things, knocked on dangerous things. It has soon been discovered that Muller's deadly disease has become resistant. Actually, it is so deadly, one of the blood will kill one person in one drop seconds. Soon the word comes out and he is called in the investigation into the heart specialist and later he agrees with the American journalist. Now Muller is determined to stay home to see his wife and son, and he will not stop in spite of being infected with the Russian population. <br /> <br /> Now I say this picture has been reduced a lot earlier. . We have a bizarre person (well, down the fall of Michael Douglas) who would kill some people in this process but will not stop achieving the goal. Later, we have a hero-type person (here hartal, falling Robert Duval) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the opponent. <br /> <br /> Corrupt man is a very good movie with a good story. Line and some very good performance. <br /> <br /> 8/10
