This movie is easy to enjoy, ridiculous, charming, and light entertainment. The place for a very serious history lesson in Hollywood so I simply took it as it is. Bing, in his usual unqualified style, played well like the iron artist Hunt Martin, who accidentally sends him at another age during King Arthur. Though married to the brave and energetic Sir Lancelot, played by Henry Wilcoxon, the love of Hans is a sensational flamoring flavor of Alsandi or Sandy. <br /> <br /> I like that episode when King Arthur (Cedric Hardwick), Sir Sagar Garg (W.M. Bandik), and Hanak (Bing Crossbows) wear perforated clothes and for the first time to experience the state with their atrocities high Go to the streets. King Arthur's comment, "I say, we are not alone" when his scraffy clothes give a good scratch, one of those delightful moments in the film. The script of William Bendix is ​​unusually ridiculous, that does not mean much about "Old English". <br /> <br /> The story is not deep but my opinion is good and I enjoy it every time I see it. This is a very big family entertainment. <br /> <br />
