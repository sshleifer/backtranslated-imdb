I had to start apologizing because I felt that the first 75-80% of the film was ridiculous. This is mostly due to Brad Pitt's performance. Spot on <br /> <br /> All involved actresses were quite good but Brad the movie stolen. The atmosphere was perfect in all cases. I'm not a monster pit fan but it's been his best role of all time. <br /> <br /> Brutal, honest, lucky. All good words to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> I was reading the previous review and the person said that the argument behind Early's violence was not explained. It has been explained but they will not go to graphic detail to get their points with gratitude. <br /> <br /> Overall I've given it a 9 because every scene times 1 or 2 was effective. I think the first half is a comedy or a suitable for this movie. Rated.
