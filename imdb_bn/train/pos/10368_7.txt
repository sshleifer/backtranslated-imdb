Merrill Strip was incredible in this film. He has an amazing drama for the pronunciation, and he shows the incredible efficiency of this film as a whole. I felt really for him when Lindy was being tortured. He actually played well. As the media, the government continued to remain unhappy and unpleasant, and the government continued their steadfast discretion. I did not expect much from the film initially, but I was really interested in it, and the film was based on real people and real events. I turned out to be better than expected. Sam Neil was also outstanding; This was the best thing I saw from him, and I really liked him for other movies (for example, piano). I gave this picture 7, but if I could rate acting, then I would give it 9.5, and a perfect 10 for the strip.
