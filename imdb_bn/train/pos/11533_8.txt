This movie, which started with the attractive opening of two hot blondes, got it on the driver-less, moving vehicle behind it, has quite a playful little personality to boot. Seven customs (though a girl does not roam around for the bodyguard, which is unfortunate because the number of deaths already small) is all too hot, because our stories take part in the wilderness in the thirteen year. An odd but effective setting choice), black black gloves and jeans are hunted by a curious man who runs a black truck. It is predefined by many dates of car inspired slashers ("The Trip", "Joy Ride", "Zipper Crippers"), where the murderer's car itself becomes an evil opponent. The killer is quite annoying himself, and we found comfort in Jennifer McAlister's very favorite heroine (see the attractive symbolic image of all the black-colored evil killers, when our kind heroes play all white dresses, as small and well-liked). The director Bill Crain tried some really great things with his camera, some delicious tricks on the screen, and tried their best to throw them. There are plenty of holes in the lower body to favor the cow's fans, and there are enough women for T & A fans. Overall, this flick is widely asked for undated and slashed movie worlds because it has been found to be very rare in video. Highly recommended.
