The title of this movie almost stopped me to close it. Not the fan of Manchester United, it was a little too late to mention Beckham, but I kept my ancestry to me and I was happy. <br /> <br /> I do not expect much pictures, but I was pleasantly surprised. The picture does not roam with me, looking at my watch and I enjoy every second of the film. If you like the previous one, you would love this movie. OK, so the story is not new, and the classic storylines are in the film, but it makes fun and breathing fresh air. The film moves very fast and gives auditory entertainment. Eventually funny moments are not a good chocolate and humorous effort, and best of all it's a good British comedy.
