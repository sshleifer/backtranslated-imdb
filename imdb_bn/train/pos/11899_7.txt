Those who gave so low ratings to this production have probably never seen the live stage of production of George Ballchin, or McCleii's Calcine staring ban affects their judgment. Atlanta Ballet was lucky as the first ballot company to grant this product to the New York City Ballet in the 1980s until the 1980s and 1980s, and I saw it several times live stages. I can assure the readers that this film is not a good stunt dream to showcase Kulkina in the use of a child with limited dance capabilities in a proper presentation and title role; This was the concept of childhood to use the child in this role, just as Mary had the idea of ​​using the child to play the role. The "heavy" dance story goes to adult adults. <br /> <br /> This is deliberately a periodic film; In a way, it is similar to Lawrence Olivier's "Othello". Just as in film, stage production sets have been enhanced in the form of movie sound stages, but not less artificial, and the band is easily photographed with intelligent closeups, and the confusing "music video" is composed of the Morris Sedac-Carroll Ballard version released in 1986 without a quick cut. This 1993 film has only two false steps. One of the confusion and complete unnecessary sound effects (Mouse Skies, Baby Drosselmeyer, etc.) "Ma-gic!" Whispering to add The effect of that sound is never heard at any stage of any "Nutcracker", and they can not only enjoy the idea of ​​watching a ballot in movies who have been kept as a cheap discount to satisfy outstanding audiences. <br /> <br /> Another false step is the nail build up of Coolkin, which seems absolutely ridiculous at Maclee. When he is on the screen as a reminder, instead of wearing a huge mask (as it always takes place when the ballerina takes place during production), Kulkina is actually made as a toy - he is a slap cap, which looks as well as a white wig, whiskers, and a Beard His face has also been reflected in his face, and the worst part of his makeup is that it is still recognizable by his face, the make-up by the decision makers of Roy Bowler, Jack Haley and Bart Lauer, "The Wizard of Oz" (although the makeup result of that film, spectacularly, is not as one of these ). And compared to Barishnikov's recipeer in his * product, how brilliant masks of Birishanikov were creative - when Barishnikov jumped behind his head, the "jaw" was really removed. <br /> <br /> <br /> version is nice, of course, without Kulkina herself, whose dance, as I said, is not even meant to be spectacular. (The Chopper Plume Fair and his Cavalier's Belchline's "The Nutcracker" is a distinguished dance role in the production). Although it is a fiction, the colors of the film may be a little shiny. Danceography is also bright and its adaptation is so trustworthy, in order to include an additional music sequence from Tikovsky's ballet "The Sleeping Beauty" - as Mary falls to the lower level, sleeping on a sofa and "repairing" dreamsmemeer "broken commentator" (This sequence must, Tykovsky was not included in the original ballet - this is the only sequence of this production "The Newtracker" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who missed the movie, or those who (or hate it), can give it a chance despite two big losses, after listening to the first in Kulkina, very good.
