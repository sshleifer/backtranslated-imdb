It's one of the definatley evokes up the best stand up. Never Eddie is so far from the wall that I have seen this great show for almost five years, and it is still every single stone. Everything from its big broad physical comedy to just a little off the side of the head, it's a masterpiece. You do not have to see anything more than this line.
