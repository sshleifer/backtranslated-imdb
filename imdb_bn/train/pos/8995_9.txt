Can not find anyone to see the DIG! Since I did not know there was a fan of the band. Naturally, everyone thinks that if you only like Daddy Warhols or Brian Johnstone massacre music you can enjoy this movie but it is far from true. The only need is music and / or generally interested in pop culture. It is impressive to see the true representations of the two-team carrier that can take a band parallel, and to eat the public and tear off the Dandy Warhols. I agree with other reviews that it would be good to get the final sound from Anton, because he is clearly looking at his worst enemy and front of the status of the band. To me, BJI (despite their lack or mutual interest) and Anton (despite his uncertain behavior) respect for Dundiss. Dandy Warhols respect the group's art, even if the group stands on behalf of the Dirty Warhols, they do not hate (even controversial). The best line is when Dandi's drummer says "I will not renew them anymore" and with the guitar's unconsciousness "I still buy their records." To me, it shows how good music can be. <br /> <br /> If you do not know anything about the band, then definitely check out this movie. It has made Rock music more popular about themes and how they develop. Following a group for such a long time is very rare.
