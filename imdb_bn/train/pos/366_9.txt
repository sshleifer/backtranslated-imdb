This movie is so wonderful, it's hard to find words to describe. This is the only time I can not determine the book, or the movie. <br /> <br /> Hoopi Goldberg is extraordinary, and Oprah Winfrey, such an actress, can be fun, happy, and tragic. All at the same time. In all, the film directed by Steven Spielberg was well-conducted and should not be passed. 9/10
