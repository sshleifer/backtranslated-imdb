The 'one round' Jack Sandler is called because he is a carnival boxer who beat any person in the audience. They can finish one round, they win a prize - a popular way to draw customers early on the journey ride. Jack is in love with the girl, Mebeel, although Bob entered the crab ring and his head started quickly while trying to find his potential with Jack. Nobody knows Bob is a champion in the war, so he is able to defeat Jack - though it does something for him. As a result, Bob tells Jack to be his radioactive partner and to leave the carnival circuit. Later, Jack made so much progress that he too became a legitimate boxer. Slowly, he worked on his way to ranking until he is almost ready to become champion. In <br /> <br />, Champ and Mabel started to back behind Jack - though Michael now married Jack. So, when the final battle between Jack and Bob takes place, it's very personal and Jack is ready to kill him. Is he good enough? Bob will increase the rage confiscated or interfere with its performance? Tune and see. <br /> <br /> This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and it seems weird for today's such director to be known for mysterious films coming back in the 1920s, there was no specific section of Hitcoke. He has written or wrote (he is both for this photo). Actually, this film is a hint of silent style in Hitakoos because one of the next silence came in some of the similar conspiracies, The Manxman (starring Kurt Bryson's acting husband). So, when it seems like a standard boxing movie, it was not a fundamental departure for this great director - even with the onset of it instead. <br /> <br /> Overall, somewhat anticipated and playing a boxing champ Ian Hunter seems stupid, the film works well. Far from a perfect silent, it looks good value and packs a nice punch.
