The best thing about this movie is that it stands alone - you do not have to show the original. Unfortunately this is the biggest error. It was good to include some of the original characters in the new story and saw how their life improved. Sinclair is really nice and provides the best comic moments for movies, because it tries to deal with strange and embarrassing situations, but the supporting cast like the original movie is not strong. Congratulations on transforming the character into a main character and for brave efforts to create bold movies, the film is eventually defective and the core is warm
