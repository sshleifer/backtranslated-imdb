The content is really great because I will definitely give a perfect perfect rating how to move. The previous critic commented, I have no idea how the movie has found itself in the 100 list below the IMDB! That's ridiculous! Other movies - especially those who share the theme of the dance - can not hold a candle in coordination with leading, believable acting and amazing dance routines. <br /> <br /> To finish the underlying story from the beginning (it's not just about winning a contest), and surprisingly realistic. Of these, no major characters are dual in any way, and at the end of the film, it is very easy to invest emotionally among them. (And if you do not cry, you can cry a little before credit rolling.) <br /> <br /> I must definitely recommend this movie to dancers and even more, who appreciate a mood and good acting story. you can do. How to move it is not perfect (no image?), But it is certainly cutting on the movies, which uses beautiful faces to hide half-baked plots and / or letters of the characters. Actors and settings of this movie create a very realistic ride which encourages the dancers to give amazing talent equally!
