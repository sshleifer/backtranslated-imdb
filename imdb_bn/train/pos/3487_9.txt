Rhesmanyia is not seen in 14 of the best WrestleMania, but I am not at the top, if I am the top 5, I will keep it personally. There are so many great things in it and it really refers to the birth of the etiquette era that was the best time of WWE, in my opinion. HBK has a lion's heart, and he was out of Austin's way, out of his way, his part was pure class. This is one of the hottest crowds you'll see, and Jay and the King have their announcements at the best! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> L.O.D. The royal louid pops battle for the team's return. I'm not a fan of the royal war, and it's still another average. Very predictable, even when you see its first, it is L.O.D. Win Looking for sunny for 8 or so minutes, definitely helps. <br /> <br /> 2/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Taka gets amazing pop with her aunty. Fast, high flying, and very exciting. If these two were over, they would certainly have closed their roof with their stuff. Mikinooku won the driver. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Here and one heart stripulation, Chain was handed over to the killers. Excellent pop for Owen, mixed response for the trip. Indeed, the really intimate match, which is actually one of my favorites for Reslemagne. The two are very well mixed together, and can go with anyone on the oven. Win the trip, with the familiar intervention <br /> <br /> 4/5 <br /> <br /> Mixed Tag Match. Mark Mero & Sable vs. Goldst & Luna For women, that's strangely, pop definition for Sable. Sable actually looks hot, and the crowd is just eating him! Constant Sable chants, and their ring gets erupting almost every time. Not bad for a mixed tag match, it was entertaining antics, and with good times as well. Sable's team win, when Sable hit TKO <br /> <br /> 2 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> WWW Intercontinental Championship. K Shemirk vs. Rock | C. Before reviewing the match, I want to keep in mind that Rock had shown his extraordinary feasibility in his interview with Jennifer Phulas before his match. Excellent pop for Shamrock, Large time heat for rock. Very frustratingly short, and I thought the end was stupid, although Shyamrock's snaping antics were awesome to see, and the crowd became brown for him. Keeps the title of the rock, when the referee reverses the decision. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For Dampster Match, the WWF Tag Team Championship <br /> Outlaws are not as end, they will be at this time. The crowd was somewhat dead for this, but I thought there were some great hardcore bits with some sick looking bumps. Cactus and Terry finally won the title. <br /> <br /> <br /> Celebrating big time for the Undertaker. WrestleMania is much better than 20 overs, and it was really good for a big vs. match of the year. The Undertaker was getting sick by the table, it was a great explosion. The WHE was fantastic, even with the defeat of Keane or even by defeat. After 2 Tombstone kick out, Techer finally took him to third place. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2/5 <br /> <br /> <br /> WWW Championship. <br /> <br /> Special guest Enforcer "Mike Tyson" <br /> <br /> HBK | C | V Steve Austin Large heat for tyson The crowd goes to AP sh * t for Austin, one of the biggest pops I've heard is obviously the one. Mixed reaction for HBK,. This is really a special match, one of the greatest events of the greatest Wrestlemanman in history, when you go to J.R. You can even say beyond breath. Hubbies all of that, which is considered to be his last match, and Austin has rarely been good. The rage and power from the crowd are fantastic, and as it gets as exciting. Austin won with Steiner, Tyson joined Michaels at 3:16. Seeing the victory of the celebration of Austin, it is astonishing that you will ever see with the most dusky crowd, the king just said, they are becoming nuts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> the last row. WrestleMania 14 is the greatest one for the original. It's what you want in a racemanyia, and actually start the atria era. This is very special to me, because it was the first of the kindlemania that I have ever seen in 98. "The Austin era has started!" <br /> <br /> 9 1/2 / 10
