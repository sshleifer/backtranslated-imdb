I would not be surprised if Soderberg was forced to avoid being a graphical corruption such as the former revolution Cuban. It's not going to make it with young people just reading a few statistics. Nevertheless, the section, which almost shoots in the jungle, takes the feeling of that place, especially when it crosses the mountainous regions of Cuban. I like the interpretation of Che Guevara's personality Del Toro. Castro, Birchi's acting actor also opposed all kinds. It is clear that Soderberg is not looking at these people, but it is also clear that he will not appeal to make 'Yanquis' away from the recent past. Contrary to some of the more important historical aspects I have read. All my attempts to achieve acceptance from the United States were not tired until Castro appeared in the Soviet Union court in my knowledge. But on the other side, he is directly entitled, especially because of the looting of the islanders, the island goes under another rebel control. The country's treasures were left empty.
