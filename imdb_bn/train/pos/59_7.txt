When I was in the video store, I was browsing with a dollar rental and came on this little jewel. I do not know what it was about but I was just an intimate instic about it and I was never right. <br /> <br /> The story is about two girls who have survived a school shooting center. One of the girls is Elisabeth, who is the only witness to the teenage attack and another debt survivor who bullets her head with some miracles. Throwed together by fate, they gradually cured and started showing a cure beautiful and I hate it when I read amazing movies through Crack. Because the busy Philips and Erica Christensen do not mention any cast of the cast! My only complaint is that the DVD was pained on special features. Oh and the jump of the film was a bit like Jarring. But all an excellent movie.
