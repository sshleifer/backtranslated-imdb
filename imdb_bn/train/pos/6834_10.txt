Let's go straight to the point: I'll take this movie with a desert island (with a DVD player). It's just perfect. If you have any reason to watch the movie that you love actors, you want to look free in their spaces and feelings, this movie is for you. See the scene when Martel (Roulette) gets drunk on the stage and Mauris (Casavetas) has to improve because he does not follow the script anymore. If you are sensitive about the camera's speed, you will be impressed by the camera going on stage, special flow, which will impress you on the camera by following the performers such as "personal space" ... ... and storytelling and realistic plays just a brilliant The mix. Cassavetes again debates about Hollywood and the politics of the princes, but this time, he got through Broadway , Making the theater one of the most exciting movie. Well, this movie is a joy.
