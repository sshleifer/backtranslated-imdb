I just returned from Hong Kong on my summer holiday and saw Jizu's legend. I thought it kicked! It was so creative and unique. It's Crawling Tiger Hidden Dragon with much less drama Even if someone thinks that there was too much special FX (yes right!), You can not complain about cast. Zhang Zia and Seychelia Cheng are so beautiful !!! Legend of Zu ..... a kicks * !!!!!!!!
