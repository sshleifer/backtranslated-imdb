There are many movies related to WW2, but Mother Night is quite different among them. In this picture we got acquainted with Howard Campbell (Nolt), a Berlin American, and married Helg Noth (Lee) of Germany, taking the role of espionage: More specifically, a CIA agent Major Wirtanen (Goodman) to enter the highest ascellons of the rule of Hitler is a Nazi Campbell recruits to become propagandist. However, the deal will not accept Campbell's role in the war due to national security, and Campbell has become a hated person in the United States. After the war, he tried to hide his identity, but the past came back and frustrated him. His only "friend" Wirtanen, but he can not do much for the events that have diminished even on the Campbell Poor <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is a great patriotic, treated by disdain by everyone who surrounds him. Not only that, but he slowly understood that even his closest people had their own secret. With Campbell's Frustration Building, Vanguat provides us with an ongoing environment and surrounds the audience. <br /> <br /> Nolt plays the role of my life; He is even better than "sad", although in both the roles he played tragic figures, who became self-reliant. Sheryl Lee is also excellent, and can generally be called for the entire cast. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book, so I can not judge how I compare the film. In any case, there is no importance here: My criticism is on the film, and the film is completely 9/10 worthy.
