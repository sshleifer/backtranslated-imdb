The whole family can see together how beautiful a movie is. Josy Bissett and Rob Estes (who married in real life) marry a couple in Las Vegas and they do not just have to rush news to their kids, but they try to get in touch with their own family (each have two sons and two daughters) a solid family In the unit. When a group that has four teenagers, two pretenders and two small children is clear, then it can be a real surprise for both Kerry and Jim, and then they are surprised at first. Fights between the children (and a little love relationship between them) can all surprise together if everyone can go all the time. Brady is more interesting than bunch, it's a completely enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Recommended as a good movie for all ages.
