For the first time I saw this movie as a youthful boy in the 1980s. My dad actually records off the TV. I have seen 20 more times before the recent release of DVDs. <br /> <br /> I certainly bought and watched the DVD and were amazed at how much the conversations have changed. In the first version, which is still in my VHS, the mood of the film, thanks to the dialogue, was actually very dark. But the new version featuring van der Baker et al. Is more ridiculous. <br /> <br /> To show it another way, to see the real US version of it coming with that duty, the literal translation of Japan before looking at the remaster version <br /> <br /> I am not complaining, do not refrain from the story and quality of the animation, but Miyazaki raises questions about the purpose of a lighter or dark narrative. Theme in her picture ...
