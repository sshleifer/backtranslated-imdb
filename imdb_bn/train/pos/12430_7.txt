Generally, I do not see action films because they are usually quite beautiful. There was a series of stereotypical action movie scenes in this film, but the film's capital letter and originality made it much easier. David Duchovny was great to see, which bended his usual acting approach. Of course, Angelina Jolie was beautiful and acted. Great all cast together. A similar old action movie must be seen for people indifferent.
