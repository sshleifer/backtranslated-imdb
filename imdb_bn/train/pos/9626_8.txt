Warning! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Plot, this is a The movie that came through me. I particularly like Lex Dog's acting. Sometimes I got the impression, that he is * l amil le. But I would not be surprised, what happened to Bob, Casey and baby in the end. After setting Bob first, I said in surprise, he eventually loved him and regretting what happened to his brother and forced him to lie. Otherwise it is a wonderful, that she will carry her baby and love it. It's up to the audience to decide - and I do not like the end of such. Dean Cain was as good as before, Erie Roberts .. Well, I saw him better but worse. <br /> <br /> I believe that this film is a crime story, analyzing human relationships and responding to unexpected situations. <br /> <br /> At the bottom line, I like it a lot.
