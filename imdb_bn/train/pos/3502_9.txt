How nice! I love this movie and love Judy Marte !! This girl is not just an awesome beautiful face, she's funny and really really talented !! She smiled a lot of times because she was very rough with Victor! In the next few years, we will see him a lot ... and probably from director Peter Sollet and co-star Victor Lucas! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a lot of days! Very refreshing! It's true, beautiful, funny, well illustrated, it got all: good story, good actor, good movie direction! <br /> <br /> If you like simple, slow, real life, like city movies, such as the daughter of Jersey Kevin Smith, you'll love Victor Vargas! It's good
