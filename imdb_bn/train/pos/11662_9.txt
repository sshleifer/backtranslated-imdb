Kells of Secrets is the most unique, beautiful and eye-popping animated movie I've ever seen. Before watching this movie, I was sure that no run could run for his money and it was a shoe-in to win this section, but I found a serious competitor in Kells. <br /> <br /> Kells tells the story of a young orphan named Brendan, living with her uncle, Kell Abbot. Abbott is a loving parent, but perhaps stronger and more anxious to strengthen the walls of the wall around Victim's attack than raising the imagination of the boy. Legendary brother Eden (who looks amazingly like Willie Nelson), and takes the boy under his wing, Breadon travels into the forest and meets the lovely beautiful forest named Isling, who likes him (and preserves his life) more than once). With the aid of Aleling, he tried to save the city and helped Brother Eidon complete the mysterious book, which could turn the legend into darkness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />: http://theoscarsblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/movie-review-secret-of-cells.html
