Ossessione is in a very bad condition but now a complete rebuilding at the Copenhagen Digital Film Lab is underway. The used material is managed to hide from a second generation Visconti fascist from a "Master Positive" original print. It has been scanned by the Spirit 4 (as 2K RGB information) then processed using Davencivil Revival software. After that the rest is manual labor and we do not predict the end of the spring. Next year it should be available in DVD and hopefully it will be released in HD DVD. This picture is beautiful and we hope many generations of recovery efforts will be enjoyed.
