Start by telling me that "War, Inc." is not a cup of tea. This, though, is very enjoyable (and you think - "Oh, shit"). It is not clear whether the comedy was involved in this film - it is very fine (Tamarline tanks, dry cleaning services etc.), and it changes and becomes intriguing. <br /> <br /> I can only be one, but I will not compare it with "Grosse Point blank" because it is different. John Cusack - I did not say he was "amazing" or "shining" - but he was good. On the other hand, her sister (Joan Cusack) was unbelievable in her line and comedic timing - though she was rarely in the film (I used to say the same thing about Ben Kingsle). <br /> <br /> Marisa Tomomi plays a believer reporter, and managed to drag it. Hillary Duff is very commendable for her role as Central Asian Pop star Yonika Babi. Duff's bKash as an actress is very attentive in movies, and she works very well (though her pronunciation is unprecedented like a habit). <br /> <br /> Overall, what I say is "Recreational". It's not a specific storyline, and it's pretty stupid at times, but it has a delicate message. I want to say it's a clock price.
