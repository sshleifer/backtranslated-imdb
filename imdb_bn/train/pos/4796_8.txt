This is especially "strange" because it was not like the movie in the last 15-20 years of Lin. Those who were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Heart Anti Heart, Mulholland Drive) and it's the opposite. I know it's so frustrating to her fans. The other was delighted by it.

To them, it was a sleeping pill. <br /> <br /> I saw her trip quite interesting but you already have to understand that it will not be a suspicious Lynch crime story. It's slow and if it's ok with you, you can choose it. Elvine enters the picture of some people all around, such as a misguided young girl who is running away and some beautiful townspeople who help the old man in trouble. (Henry Kenn as "Daniel Riordan, about which a standout.) Harry Dean Stanton gets the third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie! <br /> <br /> Iowa Scenario I live there for many years I could see it in the mountains and the rich ground, it is a wonderful place with nice people .... like this movie.
