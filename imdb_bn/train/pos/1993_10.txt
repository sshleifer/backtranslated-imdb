This is a musical adaptation of Dicken's "Oliver Twist". In most cases, the original story has been preserved, although the specific sub-plot for film streams (such as the summer she's revived and half-brother) has been dropped. The biggest difference between the movie and the story is that after the book is finished, Fugin is hanged - this is very different from the musical instruments. <br /> <br /> It's a kind of music - whose style and opportunity really did not match before or after. The songs are often very unimaginable and not memorable, but the sightings of the movie's dancing photography. Although most of the musical instruments are either dancers or even a small group of dancers, they often play hundreds or more songs. It was really a sight to see and I was lucky enough to show it at dramatic times and it is one of my first childhood memories. Just watched it a few moments ago, I would say that this movie has been better with time. Great set, wonderful acting and singing - this is a special treatment that is not difficult for love. <br /> <br /> When I saw this picture again at night, I was amazed at just how high and the female was for Mark Lester's singing. Well, according to IMDB, his singer is dubbed by a girl and this will definitely account for her voice.
