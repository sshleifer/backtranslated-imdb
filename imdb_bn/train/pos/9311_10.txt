This is the worst movie I've ever seen, yet it was the best movie. Sci Fi is supposed to be bad movies, that makes them fun! Line, "I have worked like my dinosaur meat!" Perhaps the best quote! Also, the plot sounds like something out of a bowl inspired dream. I can imagine now that the authors wake up after a long night to achieve highs and dance drama, then combine these ideas: Space Marines found the alien planet, which is associated with dinosaurs and has medieval houses. Protecting a science team studying the planets. The best idea ever! Actually, the entire film fits in the original film checklist: gun dinosaur medieval space space travel terrible acting <br /> <br /> Watch this movie, but do not buy it.
