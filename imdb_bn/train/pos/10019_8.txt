When the movie comes, I can be very fond of, and I complain about anything and everything that's wrong. <br /> <br /> If you read the last review (it was difficult, because half of it was written in cap and there is no real data), you might believe that this movie is not very well done. Unfortunately, if you read more than 3 lines in the same review, then you have denied the reason for the poster: the director does not seem to be gay (or the production team deceives Crack ... apparently). So, I have never been able to write a review, but I think this movie is based on its merit, one is not entitled, its director's sexual orientation is not. Let's go quickly on a quick checklist: 1. Great Plot? Absolutely I do not have to give it a cone, but the plot is very compulsory and definitely will not expect what is based on commercial. This is not a thriller, horror, and it should be contacted such as. The story will really surprise you, the more because it is true (and the plot was quite faithful to actual events). <br /> <br /> 2. Wonderful acting? Yes Robin Williams had long been freed from the comedy type-cast chain, and then he played a serious role in writing a lot of people a decade ago. Again, he played a superior role in the role of The Night Sterner, playing a radio host who has been increasingly frustrated and involved in this ... well, I will let you see for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> 3. Excellent direction? Of course. Now, what I mentioned is the opposite of another poster, I actually know something about the direction. I have now been sutdying the directional direction of school for 3 years. Of course I do not think that it makes a difference (this is the only important thing if you like the aspect), but I thought I should re-establish that my opinions here are both important and relevant ... for example: Director's Not sexual orientation (or practice habits of the production team). <br /> <br /> Patrick Stettner's instruction was moody and dark, and he allowed corners and illumination to help us create feelings of "intensity and release" instead of dirty, fast-camera cameras and quick cuts. Today is regulated. Some people can really show a story through their cameras, others think they can talk about the camera. I'm really grateful that when somebody is daring to use the camera at the moment, which is an eye-catching thing that we all see. <br /> <br /> 4. Lighting, Cinematography, and Editing? Great around I've already written a lot, and I can go for ten paragraphs about these ten issues, so I'll just wrap it up. <br /> <br /> In short, watch this movie. Do not listen to people who have the primary purpose of dispersing them, especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly publish the purpose of 1/4 through their posts. You do not answer! -Ben
