Fred Schepisi's "IQ." There really are no important attributes, it's still valuable. Walter Matthew played Albert Einstein, Mechanic Ed Walters (Tim Robbins), in love with Princeton mathematician Doctor Candidate Catherine Boyd (Meg Ryan). Perhaps the most interesting scene is that Dr. Fritzseed and friends (Lu Jakubaki, Jean Sax and Joseph Maher) tried to see Ed as a scientist: he looks like a French influential. <br /> <br /> Clearly less movies are historically correct, but that's not the point. This is not for any purpose other than a light comedy, since the beginning of Robbins's most famous film since 1994 (The Shoshunk Redemption). A film about Einstein's whole life, not only on his scientific achievements, but also his political activities, such as Scott Bro wrote a letter from Nine and focuses on the outbreak of nuclear weapons (it has reached where FBI holds a file on it). /> <br /> Anyway, this one is acceptable. Also starring Stefan Fry, Tony Salahub, Frank Hall, Charles Darling and Kinn Kartis.
