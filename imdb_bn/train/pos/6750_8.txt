It is a very well-crafted film, fine-tuned and played with some nice characters which are sometimes running deeply during acting - for example, scenes with trusted but irrelevant sidekick police and his wife. The plot is done out convincingly and exciting. Gangster character is particularly attractive and plays a place of worship around the life of the hero. It has been clearly stated that the police are rough and ready to be as underworld character. <br /> <br /> A little reservation: I ended a little bit because it celebrated the successful integration of Hero's constitution. Police and judicial system that breaks the obscurity of police character, which has been operated till then. Also, I think the lead female character is somewhat weak: a little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, he thinks he is crying and hard people fight.
