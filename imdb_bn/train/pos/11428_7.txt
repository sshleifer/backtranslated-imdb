In reflecting this film, I can help each other to keep from perspective. A relatively forgotten but same geography cover coupe de turtle, another thousand miles away, and the opportunity is very big unforgettable Indochina. Claire Dennis has created a film that has a complex and obscure relationship between the Grand Underpinnings of Indochina, France and its colonial issues. <br /> <br /> I got hurt by Potter's dignity, his dignity among his colleagues and his white bosses in struggling to keep him. I got hurt with love / hate relationships between him and Aym. It later provided the movie with its driving force, which later linked it to Indochina. <br /> <br /> Not sure what motivates everyone, although some letters are needed to remember colonialism. This is the worst aspect of the story related to the coupe de torch. The more confusing story than them, perhaps unexpectedly more interesting, but Dennis reminds us of all tension and unresolved relationships. <br /> <br /> The American Green Revolution is another interesting aspect of a journey to the beginning and end of France in which we offer another interesting aspects in the Western world when we look at Africa. He said that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother. He is coming home, but they just feel him a little distance. France, the character and the girl grew up in Cameroon, but they do not fully understand how they can not remember it. <br /> <br /> <br />
