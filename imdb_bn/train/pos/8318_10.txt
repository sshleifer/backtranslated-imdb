A nice movie Mary Alice, Philip M. Thomas and a young starring Irin Cara. His role in Tony King Satin was very realistic. This film was one of the "all black" movies in the late 70's, and in contrast to that era "Blaxpliance", this film was actually a plot and was done very well. Movie Soundtrack, by Auritha Franklin, was popular at the R & B charts at the time.
