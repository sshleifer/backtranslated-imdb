Good Times was a Ground Brem comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the Chicago project. Whether you live in the inner city, the gateway, the suburbs, or rural rural areas, this show is still a treasure to show and watch the family as a family instead of listening to a poor black family. But they do not live in it. They find humor and have strong family values ​​and ethics. Despite the story behind the scenes, this event was not eligible for air, except I did not like to kill his father, which I agreed with Easter Ral, who worked hard to keep the family together. But despite all the battles behind the scenes, Good Times had a show about a family. We all like JJ's dynamite and its antics. We saw Janet Jackson Penney growing up. This show was groundbreaking to show the frustration between drugs, gangs, and alcoholism. In addition to not being promoted, Evans always tried to do the right thing instead of doing something wrong to get out of hectic.
