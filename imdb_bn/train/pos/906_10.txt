Vivah My book is the best movie of 2006! PERIOD !! In my book, it is sometimes one of the 100 best films made in Bollywood. It is sad that this movie does not have many reviews and it is not so popular. <br /> <br /> Vivah is again a real creditor from a director who does it again. HAHK and Maine Pyar Kiya have pulled a brilliant one VIVAH after sunset. <br /> <br /> The most easy and intelligent movie I saw this year. Seeing Dawn 2, the cap and then dum 2 defeated Don on this matter, finally I see a movie that is very close to my heart and my culture. <br /> <br /> I do not know why Bollywood is moving away from that beautiful culture and making movies like Hollywood Smoke 2 and Dawn style crap movies like Dawn. <br /> <br /> The story is beautiful and it is very much related to the wedding of the Indian groomed wedding which I also want to be part of. Follow our system that teaches us to obey our elders, and of course follow their thoughts, so much so that the film has been shown so beautifully! Of course there is no power to choose your life partner, and it should be a brief meeting between the couple and above so that it is displayed wildly in this movie. <br /> <br /> Come back to the movie ... VVHT is a story about the beautiful and beautiful journey of the wedding. The man who met the girl! Both of them understand each other ... both if they can love each other (like our system) and for many who will happen at the time of the wedding. <br /> Amrita Rao is bright in the picture ... Shahid is okay ... and Alak Nath and Anupam Khe are awesome! Song brilliant ! I especially like Hamari Shada chief Hafat Reh Gay Chara and Do Ajazen Ajanabi like ...... Anyone who believes in Indian culture and heritage, and I certainly do it! <br /> <br /> Watch this movie ... I just want to say a word ....... <br /> <br /> <br />!
