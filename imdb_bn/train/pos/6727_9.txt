I realized a few days ago that the creator of this film kept a play on words in his title. This film is not primarily about "giddy ride" work, but most people who can change the emphasis on sports giant, red giant. <br /> <br /> In my age I had a block from Wedge, one of the world's most harsh-breaking and best bodysurfing spots. I've been out of surf from 15 to 18 feet, and several times have been attacked by 10 and 12 ft waves. Because of this experience I am in the full scare of the Surfers in this film. Jeff Clarke's idea that everyone would have died naturally, for more than a decade, they could go around Maverick's Bay Hymelf. The first safety rule of any water sports is "Never surf / dive / do not swim by yourself." She went to the place where sane people did not, and lived to tell me about it. If the water is 75 degrees and the shark is left all I will not go there. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: The first shot of the waves of jaws always tigers my whole body skin. These are not just scary waves, they are uncontrolled-bowel-deletion waves. When we see Layard Hamilton surviving in 40-to-60 feet waves (I can type them very rarely), but actually I see a fun day like Rincon, I blow it out. Big wave riders have a dedication and focus that are comparable to any person in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I gave it 9 instead of 10 because it neglects to mention the biggest wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton / Kalam Cruz, and I think they are worth mentioning. Outside the log out of the cabin is divided into broadband and it is 10!
