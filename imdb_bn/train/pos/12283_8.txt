This bid budget production photography is surprisingly bad. The colors are foggy and brown and it is very popular in the 80's. Directions and edits are often quite unclear and like TV-movies too. * And * In the beginning only the film wants to torture its viewers with statues of sex and violence. Hans Gimmer's score is also a simple and transparent work of this superb, uninterrupted musician. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching the film then you have a very moving family story, the eps demon version of the family version of European Edna Ferber. At first you were surprised why Clara married this stupid man, even his character became deeper and more background could judge by him. Clara has provided a great and ongoing statement against the terrible events of his country's spiritual lessons. Her daughter, whose boyfriend, at the beginning of her international career, a young Antonio Banderas, understands the lesson and endeavors to live by her. The road to building the plot with the ultimate mirror at the beginning was great. Actors are all a great job, too. I am surprised, who is acting actress Blanca? All the time, but of course, it was really a young Gene Rider. <br /> <br /> This movie really wants me to read the book.
