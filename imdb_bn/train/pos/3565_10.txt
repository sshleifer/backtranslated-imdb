A unique game based on the letters of the characters and dolls. Sky Masters <br /> <br /> (Marlon Brando) is a high-ranking gambler who is betting with Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatre) for a thousand dollars. Nathan needs money so that he can run his usual bad game and make a fortune. It was good that Sky Havana would not be able to take a girl in Cuba and she chose the "doll" she was <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not go to Havana with her. They were falling in love towards each other, but later he accused her that there was no part of her. Nathan ran a punk game to the missionaries that they have gone. Nathan's 14-year-old adelaide (Vivian Blain) Nathan denied the gambling and tried to stop him. However, when the movie ends, it's double <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was no singing of Brando and he could actually make him WW but it really does not matter. He has done a wonderful acting (obviously seen as Brando) and his character played very well. I watched a few movies with Gene Simmons and thought that this movie was his weakest, he could not sing. <br /> <br /> However, singing Frank Sinatra, Vivienne Blen and Stubby Kee. Vivienne Blen and Stubby Keio were originally <br /> <br /> Broadway production of Goods and Dulles. Vivienne Blen had a terrific voice and was the perfect Adelaide. If you like musical instruments and you do not, I would recommend it to you.
