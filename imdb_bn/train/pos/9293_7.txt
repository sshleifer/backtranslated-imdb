Tip Number One - Read the title as "Mad dog time" or perhaps dog. It's a pretty good piece piece (look at Cast and look it up - you know you're already weird), and the first time directors bishop gives them the opportunity, spend time, interact letters and chew the scenery. Wait - not enthusiastically - for the return of "big boss" and any vengeance comes down. <br /> <br /> For some of us, highlights are seeing Christopher Jones after the customary exile from the movie; She remains in the presence of a commanding film. And yes, with Christopher Jones, Larry Bishop and Richard Pierre involved, this "Wild In the Streets" reunion party!
