There was a full house and still a great show. This is a good show for people of all ages and a good family show. It really does not have any more show. Although kids are very cute and although it is an impressive, it's still good, especially for anyone who saw it when it's a baby. I want to see the interview now. Anyone who wants to see Cast interview, where they now type things for the special features of the DVD, go to the petition spot website and sign a flower called Full House reunion in DVD, because there is a petition for it that can cast it want to do. Yeah for the full flower!
