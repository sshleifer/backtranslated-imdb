I think this show is definitely the greatest show. Jessica Alba makes it such a great job. Michael Weatherly is also an extraordinary job, as well as the rest left to work. The shows are very impressive and they have wonderful storylines and their stunts are amazing. It's like watching a 1 hour movie. It's definitely worth watching.
