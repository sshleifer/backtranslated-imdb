Two sailors are on vacation - female male Joseph Brady (Gene Kelly) and shameless innocent Clarence Dulitle (Frank Sinitra). They meet both the beautiful Susan Abbott (Catherine Grayson) and both of whom fall in love with him. There are some more, but you probably guess it. <br /> <br /> The story (for the musical instrument of 1940s) is ridiculous and everything gets beautiful and healthy - it gets very annoying. Also this movie is very long. This is 140 minutes and much more for such a stupid story. There are some annoying numbers by Jose Iturbi and his orchestra. Still caught this catchy. <br /> <br /> When Kelly is dancing or singing Sinatra or Graceon it becomes witch. The songs are not particularly memorable, but Sinatra has a beautiful voice that you will not care about. It is shot in the rich Technicolor with all glass mgm. Acting is okay - Kelly is fine (though she's seen as a woman, she is pushing it) and Sinatrasara is just great (though the shy guy was pushing her too!). Grayson is offered for nothing but he looks incredibly beautiful. Some of her shots literally take me away breathing! Here are a lot of highlights: Sinnetra and Kelly's large dances and singing numbers; Sintra sings something; The only famous animated sequence with two songs from Greson and Kelly with the astronomical mouse! Tom is not a very funny camio. DNA Stockwell is also something that steals every view of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is very long and does not hold the plot, but it is still worth grabbing. It was a huge hit on his day.
