The arrival of a world-famous concrete set of unexpected events and feelings in small villages. Some people manage the church singer and gradually threatens how people change. This movie is heartfelt and lets you leave the movie with a smile on both your lips and tears in your eyes. Wrote a nice script based on the idea that best man to bring it and who has become famous for who Pollock has become. The actor's outstanding, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was a new, and I had charming contacts. He left a most obvious face that untouched one. As Gabriela's husband is almost part of his partner towards Mozart, he is very scary. Only one day he wants to cast an excellent man to act, so we can see that he is not even the owner of that character. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that will not be printed on you. If you have not seen it already, do it today!
