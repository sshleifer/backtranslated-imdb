I did not read any other comments in the picture, but I am judging from the average rating that I can see that they can not be very fulfilling. <br /> <br /> I saw it with my children a second time. They absolutely like it True, it was not the adults rolling around the floor, but the sounds of children enjoying it seem so. It is a true Mel Brooks Farce, with lots of moral content - it is notorious for our money, we are not for those people, and how our friends and partners are inferior. There are many more movies about similar topics, no doubt, many of which will have a more ridiculous or emotional impact on adults. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
