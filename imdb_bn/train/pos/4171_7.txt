On Sunday afternoon I ran in the race a few years ago on the channel surfing. It was obviously a Chess TV movie in the 70's, but the direction and score were done quite well which attracted my attention, and in fact I was a Hooka and I had to see it till the end. Recently I got the opportunity to buy a foreign DVD of this movie (oh, at least a few months ago a domestic person did not see it), and was very happy to be able to see it again (and completely) <br /> <br /> I understand the whole story I did not, but in the 70's, there seems to be a lock in horror movies, which is really scary. Before the decade of the '70s, some beautiful shots made movies and our lasting horror icons, but are they really scared? No, not too much. Likewise since the 70's we have received horror films which are cooler, more exciting, many good production standards and sophisticated special effects, it's a more fun, fun, effective "jump" moment and creative use of some beasts, but again ... they really Do not be scary! There is something about the horror film of the 70's. Grain quality of the grain Unusual spookily dark scenes uniluminated by the vast high-tech light rig. The low quality and curious and literal EQ'd score of "Dreamland Edge" dialogue Permeating everything in the weird sense of turmoil and prejudice. It works on behalf of the horror of what works for the frustration of most of the 70's films. <br /> <br /> In particular, in this film, the devil's dog cools, the sharp shots rotate under the people brave. The dogs were more effective than they went to the more obvious route of pregnancy, slavering, and overtly hostile ("Cujo"?). The filmmakers wisely save that when the dog appears in its full-fledged form. The effects that happen when, illogical by today's standards, literally let me cold. Strangely, weirdly defined, "I'm not sure what I'm looking for". Certainly I see that the hip-real, crystal less obviously reduces me than the real optical printer / digital compositor, rather than a real supernatural vision. <br /> <br /> The characters of this picture are not as congenitally transformed as their generosity or the world's inhabitants, actors all work well. Brothers and sisters from pairs of movie "Witch Mountain", rather than stunt casting, such as pairing, brothers, sisters, but they decide. Yvette Mimieux is always unexpected if managed to be entertained. Richard Krenna gained more sympathy from the audience as the film progressed. Because of his self-confidence, he is surprised that his family's hatred is really due to a mysterious plot or whether he is only very dangerous to paranoid schizophrenia, although he thinks that it is impossible to explain what he is enjoying due to regular physical hard work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And how they would feel about it. <br /> <br /> The detectors of this movie can say that this is a feature-length vehicle for some nios. Retina shot is burning, but hey, you could say the same thing about "blade runner". :-)
