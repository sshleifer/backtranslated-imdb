I grew up in this classic Western series, and a child always considered being allowed to watch it for having a watch Sunday evening. Bonajana is still continuously seen in the run again. <br /> <br /> This series is a series of cartridge family events, which can be a chronicle of residents of a farm near Nevada, Virginia City during civil war. Their animals (known as Pondosa) are run by the widowed father, Ben and his three unmarried sons, Adam, Jos, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, many of whom have died many years ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Ponderosa stars require a lot of horse horses so reach its extremities. Also, often frequent travels are often needed to buy or sell cows. Needless to say, few of these trips pass uneventfully. Despite the hospitality, most of the cartwheat power must be spent to protect their farmland from their sensual area or to protect themselves from the fame of the stars and the fame of the stars. Cartwrights are not a fair bit of air and firing such as their guns, but it is absolutely necessary to deem when shoot only kill. They are involved in various city affairs, even in the political life of the Nevada region. <br /> <br /> One of the main resources of the series is the intrinsic warmth that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent disagreements between three brothers). Now, a brother can now beat everyone, but at that time he usually has a good reason and his anger is no longer long! Characters are all very well drawn. Ben is pictured as a successful and noble man with great fidelity. The oldest son, Adam, suave most brothers and suave brothers, left middle through the series. A middle-aged brother, Hussein is a gentle giant of a teddy bear who is hungry hungry for food and a little shy to the ladies. The Little, Little Joe, Hot Headed, Handsome Commonwealth, who, in contrast, show a lot of ways with women. Brothers enjoy these three romances, but their love interests usually die by the end of the episode or for some reason the marriage is cut off. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Roberts (Adam), Dan Blaker (Hos), Michael London (Little Joe), and of course Lorne Green Principal of the principal, as Ben. I love Wanked Pukur, acting by Victor Sen Young. <br /> <br /> This is a great job to fill in Western maps. Cartwrights are always noble hero and bad guy is quite quite villainous. These days there are more programs like this liquor on TV!
