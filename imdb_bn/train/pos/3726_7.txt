With this directive of Joel Shuacha, I was not expecting the highest quality of film making, so I was surprised that Tigerland was not the complete waste of time. <br /> <br /> This method often preserves deliverive spy cameras, Danny Shots, personal royan with personal film, sometimes it's going to leave a spark - Spellberg seems to be more realistic, but ultimately than anything else. It was more confusing. <br /> <br /> Against saving personal decision, the mental element was not weak, because the characters of this film were just like the real person and the story was less narrow, not wrapped in the American flag (Spielberg got a 'F' in subtlety). <br /> <br /> Next to the first division of Kubrick's complete metal jacket, in this film I saw the most realistic script of the boot camp, and for this I think it's valuable. <br /> <br /> This is not a great movie, but it's not a bad movie.
