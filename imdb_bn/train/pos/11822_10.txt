Dick Tracy is one of my favorite movies. I have to accept those who have not seen it. You really love it or will really hate it. It came one year after Batman's success. So everyone's expectation was so much that the plot was so easy because many of them landed easily. But it's based on a comic strip ... what do you expect? Creatively, this movie is amazing! Set up, make-up, music, clothing, and impressive performances make this film gorgeous. The film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that is something rare these days. Managed, produced, and starred in Warren Beatty's big stars as the perpetrator fighting against his crowd of star Big Bury Caprice and thugs of Parrino. Madonna steals this shoe as an impressive breath-taking mahini. This Madonna sometimes played one of the best characters. He has heard one of the best liners! Madonna fans will like it! One of the coolest things about the film is that it uses only seven colors to look like a comic strip. This picture is really a piece of artwork that is sadly ignored by the public. To collect things, this movie highlights the child in all of us. This is a movie that will make you laugh at the end.
