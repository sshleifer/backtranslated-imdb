Sitting, typing ?? Nothing last "What if?" Winsenzio congratulated Natalie's proposed festival, and David Hulitz and Andrew Miller. The problem of one's relationship is that he has been spared from his job (due to problems of relations) and the police are going to find him (due to his job and relationship). The other man, who is an Anaerfobic who goes out of his house, comes with a bizarre girl guide who told his mother that he does not buy cookies from him when he is abusive. Oh yes, the police are still after her, the girl's scout's mother calls her to arrest him. <br /> <br /> People, what day <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can make all these disappear? That 'nothing' behind the whole premises. Two fools have realized, police, girl scouts, cars, lawns, roads, everything ?? Disappears. There is nothing except white space! This is an interesting idea I thought about. I also saw this time, the movie has gone 30 minutes, and I still have an hour left. 2 actors could have done this work and can keep us entertained for 60 minutes? Although the actors try, 60 minutes long and the film has a definite dead air. But two actors, who are friends with each other and long-time friend-friendly friends, have a great exhibition with each other, which was fun to watch for conversations and to visit both of them. There are plenty of miraculous elements, but their response to this material is finally able to see this movie.
