Woody Allen's second movie set in London. The Torrent Card murders murdered in London, prostitution. Aspiring journalist Sandra Pranski (Scarlett Johansson) gets a symptom that she can be Lord Peter Laman (Hugh Jackman). He started to romance him but falls fast love He helped with the stage magician Sid Waterman (Woody Allen), who does not like what he saw. <br /> <br /> I like it better than last year's fun match "match point". It was small and moved much faster. The plot was old but it was entertaining me and it keeps me guessing till the end. This is not actually a comedy, but the mystery with a very good comedic line (of course Allen). It's not the best of Allen, but it's much better than its worst. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good in most cases. Allen is bad but he played this character a million times earlier and it has become tedious. But Johansson and Jackman are just awesome - they look fantastic and give two very reliable creditable performance. Alan also (surprisingly) works on their sexual appeal - in a sequence where they are both suits lit to show off their beautiful body. The only real debit is that Allen still feels uncertain about shooting London. Although he did not have "match points", but he would probably get better as he goes along. Seeing <br /> <br /> I give it 8.
