"Heartland" is a wonderful illustration of what it really is to live on the border.

Nobody was fascinated or not seen as if they were sitting in a session with makeup or clothing department. Conchatta Ferrell is just wonderful. In the early 20th century, Wyoming came to the fore, and the example of the strong, persistent people did not tolerate any difficulty in the new living on a new field.
