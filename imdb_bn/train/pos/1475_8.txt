She stocked, sweaty, slightly cross-eyed and unstable. He stood in front of us and called himself a distorted call. He claimed that we? Movie viewers ?? Understand the screen as a toilet bowl, and all secretly willing to burst from ** ** **. He is unpredictable and scary. Well ??? Come on, you could have guessed now: He is one of the leading philosophers of our age. <br /> <br /> Slavoj? I ?? A story by Sophie Phoenix, a story writer and guide movie of a hazard. Fiennes illustrates long lectures by a feature? I am One, and so does two ways: for example the film clips and putting ?? Is the real (or reconstructed) location one of the movies I talk about? It's always good to see beautifully captivated scenes from the great movies (though Sie's revenge is also here), but the main attraction for a hazardous guide ?? What ?? I am One yourself The film makes so much fun that the impossible question is that someone can not help but ask again and again: what more amiss ,? I am Or's opinion ?? I am The presence of the screen? A documentary by Astra Taylor (?? I ?? one !, 05), the Slovenian philosopher acknowledges his fear of having a silent level. Because, he claims that he thinks that he is not present in the first place, the only way to believe all other people is to talk constantly and abusively, And he said, and how. Also a danger guide ?? Is influenced by his voice ?? Providing the perfect English in the most crazy ways, and making some wonderful point about the movie. <br /> <br /> What's that? Well, for example, he saw the reluctance of the conversation photo of Chaplin's venerable vowel fear (the symbol of external energy beyond humanity) as the Ventralcoquistit segment [45] of the deceased's death. He said that the opposite nature of the film is not intended to teach us the desire for certain things, to supply us with them. He marked Growco Marx as very arrogant, as Chico Ego and Harpow ID. He also said, one million other interesting things, and we can not close his eyes, so his proponent (and impressive) his appearance. At some time I could not help but looked at his thick, scraffy hair, and wondered how to save under any brain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said, the growing effect of the many edited clips from their respective work made their parts?

For example, he did not go to Tarkovsky's studies, on which he relentlessly applied his own materialistic outlook, which he excluded from Tarkovsky (i.e. strong religious feelings and images) is extraordinary or extraordinary. <br /> <br /> is not the question? I am One inspirational and brilliant, because he is; Whether or not Fiennes is worth watching the movie, it's the same way. The real question is rather: I ?? One opinion is consistent? A smart observation after another intelligent intellectual journey, but there is some doubt after the whole issue is over. For example: Vertigo (58) Considered ?? I am One of the states states that hidden behind the human face is a perfect void, which makes the face itself confronted only by one of the few: own money is a fraud. However, when in the final order we hear about the greatest completion of City Lights (31), as a portrayal of a man completely open, it is not difficult to ask what happened to the whole face? ? Why would we give Chaplin's face the underlying value of the real thing and deprive this same privilege of Kim Novak to two bold strokes ??? Or the post of lockan can also be incompatible?

The overall effect is being shunned by a giant, cool, flashing wave: you take the wonderful, refreshing, death, and confusion together at once. When you are watching, your head is emerging with your own ideas and you are already planning to re-watch some movies? But you share a sense of survival in a disaster. <br /> <br /> The final question is: what? I am It's lost? Or we did not even come near the real thing? Once sentenced to prison in Cinephilia, we will all meet in a big cell and eventually talk to each other (there is no movie to turn our faces). I dare you all: who will be enough to reach? I am Single and defy him? My guess is that once you look at those eyes in real life, you become a believer.
