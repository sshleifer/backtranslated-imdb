I really liked this version of 'Vanishing Point' in the opposition to the 1971 war. I found the 1971 version quite annoying. If I could get a few times from the middle of the movie (as I gave the 1971 version), it's not all big. Of course, when I came out of the 1971 edition, I was only nine, because of this. However, I've seen a lot of remakes, where I liked the original and the oldest choice. I have seen that the version of the 1997 version was more understandable and basically kept the truth in reality without the meaning of the 1971 war. In my opinion, I felt the 1997 edition was more tense and was not so "blase". (Annoying)
