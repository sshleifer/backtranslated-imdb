Not a bad martial art film. The war scene was good. Michael Kis did a good job for his first film venture without Van Dam. The story works without stupid language and excessive blood. There is a good line that works on screen writer Jeanette Francessca. It would be better to see something else from the same section. She is being liked by industry and promenant of powerful women. It was definitely worth watching. I recommend all the theater and martial arts lovers film.
