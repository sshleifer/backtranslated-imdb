This film was not so much broadcast in Greece, although it could take good actors, great scripts and photos, but in my film it was not a "blockbuster" movie. The film is very strong, it is a difficult time to spend time with a young man who is released from his 5-prison time (drugs) to return to his home village. Finally, sadly .... Muricus is trying to maintain his part and he handles it very well ... Lambropoulou is a wonderful way to look great and very sexy and of course the hatsgisvas have greatness for more than one time ... 7 out of 10 reason too Make such an impression as less Greek movies!
