Sleepwalkers are animals that live completely from the lives of living ... but they can only use virgin (this is not explained why). Charles Brady (Brian Cruise) is the one who needs to eat his mother Mary (Alice's crew). He went after the tanya (Madchen Amik) of the choice. Will he run away? <br /> <br /> This is a terrific horror movie on one hand. Speeding up, lots of blood and gore and a nice, humorous intelligence. There are lots of revelations for horror buffs (Castle Rock is mentioned once). Also Cruz was excellent (who thought he could work "after returning to Blue Legune") like Karz and Amic. But I found this image boring. <br /> <br /> It was written for Stephen King's screen and it's tragic blurry. Sleepwalkers are not fully explained. Where did they come from? Why are they called that? Why mother to feed the boy? Why can the cats hate them and kill them? After all what their power (one time Krause disappears in a car and changes the color and style!)? Why do people have to stop the vitality? Why would it be only virgin? Why is the boy having sex with his mother? None of these explain the misleading story. It's really very bad because, on one side of those questions, this is a wonderful horror film. Excellent makeup and special effects too. <br /> <br /> Fast, poor and a lot of fun. Only the script was good. There was also a fairly explicit sexual scene editing between crew and crew (you can say) to get an R rating. I can only give a 7
