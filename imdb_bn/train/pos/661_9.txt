Hello, Hello! Encouraging this in a great EC Comics horror story tour-de-force adaptation is definitely one of the best episodes of Cable TV series. Director Robert ("Future to Back") Jamkis Fred ("Cripps of Night", "The Slain Squad") has done the most from a malicious script. Decker, the harsh two-timed housewife (which Mary Allen Trainer, who played this episode, married Jimmicus), who was killed by Christmas Eve, killing a husband (a wonderful camie of her Mascell Bell), with a fire pocket. Complications arose when a fierce killer, who is dressed as a disgusting Chris Cringle, escapes from the shelter while he decides to visit the train unexpectedly and unexpectedly. Alan Sylvester's surprising, growing scores and Dean Kundy generally make polished cinematography more fun fun. And Larry Drake (sweet gentle giant Beni in "L.A. Law!"), His unclear hiking goff, created a shocking flurry of his bright green eyes, and a shocking, genuine evil green, an exciting monk, Saint Nick.
