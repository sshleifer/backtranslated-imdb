This one is difficult to see - a previous critic said. After WWII, it is amazing to consider the horror films - especially "see" of "freedom" on the right. It is clear that in the middle of the war, we knew exactly what was happening to the Jews. A "transport" shows that the sequence is animated, based on almost as an actual newsreel (the Nazis choose to record their torture). Knox brilliant as nux. He has a Nazi career course chart. Firstly, the list is specifically told when Hitler's hilarious, finally helpless, and eventually contradict the responses of other helpless Germans. The contrast, however, allows a young Nazi officer to believe in the "transformation" for anti-Nazi attitudes. It took several attempts against Hitler as a witness, especially the Stauffenberg Plot that is coming out of this movie. Effectively using a flashback, a firm film, accurately predicted that Nurmurg trails in the future and others will happen after the end of the war.
