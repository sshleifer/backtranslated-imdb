After watching the "Whip" in a distributor screening at AFM on the other night, I must say that I was completely influenced. All the ridicule was through the audience. Unfortunately, each region was already sold, so I did not have the opportunity to buy this movie, but I really believe that it is a big hit on both domestic and sea. I agree with this comment that the "whipped" man, like "sex and city", should not be separated as a "sex and city" rather than "sex and city", "whiped", it is ironical about dating, which is itself important Do not take it with you. The "whip" makes fun of the relationship that most of the sexual tricks do not dare. Also, the film that was shown in AFM was much more intriguing and stories than "sweaters," "clarks," and "sex and city" combined. "Whip" is sometimes given to the audience with a slow and non-stop comedy for a beat. Amanda Pete and other cast performances were all difficult, which made the movie more effective considering the budget.
