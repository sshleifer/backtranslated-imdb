If you love Saif-Fai of Psalm 70, then I love "Repo Man" or "Bakaru Bongai" movies rather than love you. It's a flurry of spectacular 70 senses with a 22nd century junkyard and one million years from now on Earth. This movie is pure 70's. Go to Steve Miller's "Eagle Fly Lake" or Pink Floyd's "The Dark Side of the Moon" and you're ready to go!
