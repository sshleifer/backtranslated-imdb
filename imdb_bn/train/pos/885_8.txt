I must admit that I was skeptical about this film before I was going to visit it. The main reason for this is that it is compared to a hitcoach movie. I've seen a number of movies which were thought to be inspired by the hitcock or that can be made by 'Master of Suspense', but I have not seen a movie that can stand for the test. Time. In my opinion, Hitakk has become a family name which is very easy to use for the promotion of some cheap (thriller) thriller, but on the other hand I must admit that I was confused by it because it is a European film. Usually it is the biggest studio in Hollywood who wants to abuse Hitkouk's name, if it increases their income. But this film was created in the greatest European countries of all times, and I am sure that most of the French would rather release the dead rather than accept by the English. So I decided to try this movie and I would definitely say that what I'm looking for is that. <br /> <br /> "Listen to my lips" or "Read my lips" as it is called in English, a young secretary named Carl. He is a hardworking and devoted employee, but is not very appreciated by his peers. Because of his lack of hearing, he has been given a lot of things, which he refused to raise on the company's supremacy. But when he is hired for training, he has to change everything. Paul Angeli is a 25 year old and completely illiterate former convicted. People are thieves, but Karla gives opportunity and cover for her when she needs him. He hopes to teach him how to show regular life, but at the same time he drowned him in his old life ... <br /> <br /> I still believe that the name of Hitakk is often used to describe a very good thriller To do - this film is certainly not - I will not compare with the instructions of Hitako and Jacques Audiard. The fact is that this movie really did a good job with this movie. I have not heard anything about him before, but it is true how he will build the mystery and how you can be interested in starting from the beginning. There are a lot of courses that are very fine and with original stories. A person in Hollywood who is skeptical of the idea of ​​playing a strong role instead of creating a unmarried husband with helpless husband's helpless issue (you know, the story of a common TV movie). <<br /> <br /> Playing this movie is also valuable. Vincent Castle is quite famous, but Emmanuel Devos was a complete mystery to me. There is absolutely nothing interesting about their role, but both of them have done a wonderful job with their characters, which makes them very believable and realistic. Paul may well be the average hard guy from prison and from Karla, usually helpless women, but thanks to his performance, you really believe that these two powerful men who have achieved some bad luck in both life, but who will do the best together <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I doubt about this, but I soon became its most appreciative. I give this movie an 8/10. Do not hesitate to give it a try.
