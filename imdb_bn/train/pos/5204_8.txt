I do not see much porn, but I love pornographic gossip. And I love the poor movies. So when I heard about a porn star Gore, I was really excited. Of course, that year ago and when I heard about all the problems with making movies and finishing, I never thought I'd actually get to see it. But I did it and I like it, even not all of its flaws are ashamed. <br /> <br /> First, flaws. The story is set in Ireland and is called Samhain, but it seems like to tell the story about Sawney Beane dynasty from Scotland. So why not just set up there and do not exclude third-grade reports about Sameen / Irish immigrants / Halloween? Also, it breaks your own rules that you are safe in trails, but then the cannabal mutants begin to run amok everywhere. It is not clear how much cannibals we're ever dealt with. Perhaps an ancient stone castle which is probably ancient, yet nobody has noticed it before. Self-conscious horror film references are annoying and so are characters. The heroine includes all of her dead friends a flashback montage that she does not met. There is no meaning at the end <br /> <br /> So what works? Gore! Of course I liked more, but refreshing it to look like a nasty movie that is not afraid to do more than a Gore movie. Waay at the top of two murders and Taylor Hayes has a nice disgusting scene. Two wild shoots are also given to extended shot of the DVD. I have always been strong that the mind can overcome a stupid story and Evely breeding.
