"Kennel Murder Case" starts at a run and does not stop at the very end. Everyone had the reason to kill the victim, and many people tried. William Powell Filho Vance, horrible as gentleman detective. Marie Oostar wants to marry only her Scottish gentleman, and the woman who wants to enjoy her inheritance is as refreshing as the brotherhood. This movie has been associated with "Nancy Drew, Reporter" in the DVD, which is fun If you have to rent the disc (or check it out from your local library), do it. It's pure entertainment!
