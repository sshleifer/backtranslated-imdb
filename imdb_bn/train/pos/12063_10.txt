The Woman in Black (1989) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill's modern classic ghost story, which was published just a few years before the film's production. Sadly, this movie was not released on DVD and as far as I am aware it has been deleted in VHS. Its availability lies in cheating films which are directly opposite to their popularity. The story was beginning in the early 20th century on the events surrounding the sea coast communities, where a young solicitor sent his latest dead widow, who died in his isolated Mashland estate, to finish the subject. Does he think that it can be a routine and possibly tedious task, when he discovered that the old girl was afraid of her death and her past demons could not rest. The story is said in a subtle but concise way, never self-motivated, flashy or extra-publisher. Perhaps the tight budget can contribute to a non-nonsense system, but what the story needs, and why it works so well. It does not see what you scares. That said, a particularly awesome scene that depends on the visual, and it works in perfection. I saw this image in a day, and it gave me nightmare about a week later. If you love being afraid, you will see a copy of what you want to do and copy the woman.
