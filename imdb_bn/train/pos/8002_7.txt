I have seen Maslin Beach several times - both are free in Brisbane Air TV. I do not have to go well, bad or otherwise such as well and really this is covered. <br /> <br /> I would say it is Australian. Only in Australia, we can have a movie about the relationship between nude people as a day of birth and can see it on free commercial televisions. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised to be amazed at what I have in America on our free TV compared to its own country. Sex and City and Half Just For Example <br /> <br /> Despite our government trying to make our 51st US state, at least some things must be done
