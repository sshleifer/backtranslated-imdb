This movie was very, very curious and very funny too. Actors are all real and very weird The overall "appearance" of the film was different, very, dreamy, and slowly-out, which simply added the whole thing to spasy, dirty, weird vibes. <br /> <br /> This is not for everyone, I mean, you do not call it "mainstream" but I like it. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. . . With a weird rhythm and punch line of strange, weird places. The kids are so heartfelt (and pimply) that you can help but can not feel for them. In other words, these are far from the "Hollywoodized" version of teenagers. <br /> <br /> All that, for me, makes it a good thing.
