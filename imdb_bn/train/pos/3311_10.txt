A typical platoon of movies includes major characters leaving Hostels and Hessels behind the city and finding themselves among nature's peace. In the strength of the Kangwan province, we have shown two stories of people, who are trying to find themselves by traveling on the popular Korean Parks of Mount Kangwan province. However, instead of epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose nature was just another form of escape. <br /> <br /> The speed of this movie is slow, thoughtful. We finally learn what happened in Kangwen province and we learn how they are connected. For those who want to give a definite answer for Hollywood glam and a movie, this movie will not be satisfied. But for those who want the movie, their thoughts, thoughts, influence them after a few years, despite the fact that the film is satisfied, it will be more.
