This movie is my first touch with Mr. Sica so I do not know what I can expect. But what I saw only broke my hopes - in a good way. <br /> <br /> The story is not complicated and shows us a life of boy-orphan and shows his relation with the poor people in particular, making themselves a metal plate house made of simple metal. In another town this little town is going to fine-tune the lives of its own lives and things. But one day water sources are available and a wealthy person is interested in buying this place. But as the headline of the movie title - a miracle happened. Our character gets a wonderful pigeon from his dead mother. How is he going to protect his friends and all the city built? <br /> <br /> This was just a wonderful work of natural comedy. The behavior of poor people has been shown and how money and property can speak and play with the people. There are also many fun moments and scenery included - in the light of the sun where there is a spot and many more, initially with it. <br /> <br /> So I'm not a comedy lover but you have to watch this movie. I liked it <br /> <br /> I
