They liked the kids I took in this movie (four children, 9 to 12 years old, they give 10 stars). The role of Emma Roberts was adorable. (Look forward to seeing this next generation Roberts in future.) After publishing the opinion of Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton, it started refreshing to see a girl who does not seem to see that she did. On the streets. Also enjoyed seeing a supporting cast including Tate Donovan, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barry Bostwick, and Monica Parker (with a Camio by Bruce Willis). Final Takeaway: Cute film. <br /> <br /> (Note: I do not read the book series, so my comments are based on the merits of the film alone.)
