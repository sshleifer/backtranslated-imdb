This is my first review of IMDB, I did not really want to write, but there are only 2 for this great movie, so I feel compelled to add my point of view ... and no, I'm not affiliated with the film makers any way (yes Yeah how frequently you were here ;-)) FYI I am in my late 20s <br /> <br /> I love the animated movies really, because what you are the only manufacturer And they are limited by the imagination to see that this was a very fantastic. Not so much in terms of the story, but very unique and Emo achieves fresh visual style. The characters are good but well-off and it works well for movies, it's all a metaphor-like world. But the backgrounds and the earth are generally filled with scary visuals that saw my jaw dropped several times. Blue, like a rabbit, plays a small dragon and it is easily among the most fun moments in the movie, he is already a lot as an instant classic, ice age scrat. The story is not very surprising (you have to go outside a group of anti-heroes and kill the maximum dragon that you can imagine) but if the film shows and sounds, then who care about them ;-) 1 thing to point me, emo film too Not suitable for young people because it has some dark scenes and frightening for children under 6-8 years of age. I can say, these are just a few views but Emo is notable. However, I spent a great deal of time watching it and could not wait to see it wait for it again to see it hit the stores in higher defense. <br /> <br /> For me 8,5
