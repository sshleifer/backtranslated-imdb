I think this movie will be more enjoyable if everyone views it as a photo of a colonial African film than a photo of the 50s and 60's. Because there is no real story here At the top of the others, only a small point of light on a point that does not make much money until your picture is enough. The chocolate I saw the first time I did not think it was "got it". Then I realized that there was a lot of "get", the end of colonialism that was around the corner but ultimately there was no plot. However, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Airport scenes with short showers and beautiful music were mere poetry. If you like "exciting" movies, you will not see it - you'll be tired of tears. However, some of you ..., you can thank me later for suggesting it to me.
