In Paris, the shy and unsafe bureaucratic Trailovski (Roman Polansky) hired an old apartment, where the previous mercenary, Egyptian expert Simone Choule (Dominique Palang) committed suicide. The overwhelming guard (Shelley Winters) and the tough landlord, Mr. Jae (Melvin Douglas) introduced the strict rules of behavior and Trekovsky was frightened by his neighbors. Meanwhile, he went to Simone Hospital and made friends with his girlfriend Stella (Isabel Adjani). After Simone's death, Trekovsky felt the feeling for him and believed that his landlord and neighbors were planning a plan to force him to commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Strange "Le Locketier" paranoia and the annoying and unclear story of illusion. The crazy story of loneliness and loneliness Trelkovsky is gradually improved in a night's wild environment of her apartment, and what is happening is really completely unpredictable. Performance is awesome and Isabella Adjani is extremely beautiful. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Inquilino" ("Tenant")
