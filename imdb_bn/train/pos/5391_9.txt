Life begins and ends - in the maternity / recovery ward of 1930, where we spend 48 hours in most high-risk pregnant women, Loreta Young, Glenda Farell, Clara Blondique (Anti-M ???), Vivienne Osoron, Dorothy Tree, and Gloria Shiya , They are waiting to give birth Although this film has plots that are much more controlled and restricted when it shows the plates devices, when it was born in a general city hospital in 1932, our grandmother and grandmothers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What an actor! For the first time as a parent, annoying and uncomfortable with Z's hospital staff, who thinks of closing his concerns about his wife because they can brush crocodiles from cafeteria table. I deeply felt her concern. I would like to see more of this actor's work. He was in a very emotional voice, used to have an unforgettable effect in the mass with the wind. In that film, Eric played a young soldier whose legs spread without anesthesia, who screamed "Do not spit! Scarlett fleeing horror hospital. Chilling! Another great performance is Alain McMahon, who played Miss Bowers, a nurse. Its character is the type of earth salt, like our nurse we all hope to take to the hospital, who constantly break the rules in the hospital to show the more humane aspects of medical practice. <br /> <br />> Loretta Young has done another superb acting role here as well, a very authentic and deep-felt performance as Grace. She is great among my lovers, I've actually played her praising her more as an actress for the last few months. <br /> <br /> My taste (In 1932, does anyone know that the brandy can be dangerous for children's health by swimming in a hot water bottle?) But his character eventually re-invented itself. <br /> <br /> Cast is also an unwanted Gilbert Rowland, silent movie star, as a sad Italian sibling. His screen time was short, but notable. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> 10 out of 9
