I do not have much to add to my summary, this movie is on the right side with the top quality where one of the funiest movies ever made when trying. I do not think it should be taken seriously when I saw it as very funny for one. <br /> <br /> I do not think it has brought Christopher Walken's fame because his fame has backtracked. He took the PL fiction to wake him from the sleep he was in. As Michael Iranside, he did something amazing while not trying serious film. Total recall, top guns I wonder what was amazing these movie budgets. The scene and the actors and the explosion etc. are quite amazing so probably someone loved it a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money. Because he or I like him because I love this picture! <br /> <br /> If anyone searches for Macben's information on this matter (and I'm seriously concerned that there will be a lot more), it's just a sunny movie and you should see a smile on your face!
