I understand that Paramount wanted this picture with Rogers and Heart score, but could not resolve the copyright issues, so Burke and Van Hussen who wrote the most songs for Bing Crosby among them give a very good score. <Br /> I told Leonard Maltin that the film "fit in a crossover like a glove" and I could not keep it better. No, this is not the mark of Mark Twain, it's a Bing Crosby film and in 1949 Crosby is the most bankable star of Hollywood. Once the paramount was using the technicolor and Rh√¥ne was not lovelier on the flipping screen. This was a woman whose technicola was invented. <br /> <br /> William Bendix's Brooklyn sources have been standing, but this is a good humorous effect. Crosby, Bendix, and Sir Cedric Hardweek are doing well in the three busy jobs. Bing is one of his patented enthusiastic philosophical numbers, if you place your toes on the moon. <br /> <br /> He used to sing songs for the third time and would always sing with himself and Ronald Flaming. The song was nominated for the best song, but the Baby is lost in the cold-bison. <br /> <br /> Excellent that Bing could record the score for Ronald Fleming and called with bandies and hardwie. <br /> <br /> What I like about this picture is Bob Hope without the ridiculous talent of Crosby. I like road pictures, but Bing was a comedy genius on its own and this film is well-presented to any other. <br /> <br /> This is the crucible at the top of his game.
