The film is just fun fun .... Maybe we are more fun for those young people and fans of "Ramones" got more fun while filming. I have seen the movie with myself and friends, and it is still fresh and fun. At the risk of being extremely serious, the idea of ​​being a big fan of a particular band is timeless, and high school students are always irritated with the intrigue of some classes. <br /> <br /> There are some gem lines / scenes in the film ... High School Our "Permanent Record" reference will follow us through life. (I assure you that I have been from high school, oh, some years and it does not follow me) ..... The famous "static" line ("I'm getting some static" ..... " No, "Principal Toga came forward .....) The school board member was so diluted that he was present with the nurses .... Nazi monitors" body search "...... Principal Toga announced," I am the final Facilitate Dye ", and burn the Ramon's record (Note: what happened before the record cd) ... and of course Joe Ramon has mentioned," The things have changed, since we have kicked out of high school ", followed by Togar" Your parents Did you know that you are Ramones? "<br /> <br /> Just a piece of advice ... where they do not see ... now Joey Ramon has unfortunately killed young people. The biggest hottie in the movie, Day De Young today reminds us of all ages .... PJ Souls will never go ahead in the career as much as we can expect ..... Marla Rossfield, as another student, is clearly the film It was seen (one of my male friends died when we saw the movie every time), although I was more than just submitting his performance Lam and his role should be more teen movies. And, who knows what happened to DJ Don Steel? <br /> <br /> So, look and enjoy ... Do not think ... just have fun!
