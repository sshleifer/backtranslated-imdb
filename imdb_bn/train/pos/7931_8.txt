Man, if anyone was expecting a great zombie movie after reading the title, then you deserve a retard and you be disappointed. For myself, I was expecting a low-budget cheeseble jumbo flick- and I got exactly what I got. I was not all disappointed. I thought it was a cool little movie. Zombombies have just turned right, because they were just right, so they are freshly-exposed Zombies. Obviously they did it because it was quite costly to complete the expensive zombie FX. I understand the whole thing, I have no idea how the film can be nicothed seriously. For the love of God it is "the living dead body"! Do you want to watch "Reddick Lomes" and any Uwe Bow movie and want to be really cool? Of course not! So, I am never able to understand why IMDB has some bodies like school girls. Oh and yes, there are worse movies, so stop telling that you've ever seen that it was the worst, because you know you're full! Do you ever see "zombie" ???? Or "freddict" Or "the house of the dead" ??? The worst that I've ever seen If you can not see that it's just a minimized budget Zumbi film, which is probably made by the supporters of the junkie film, but some mistakes with you. I just had fun with it. Stop from me and I want to see a seagel.
