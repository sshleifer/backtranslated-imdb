This film is not a scalp, despite links to low finance and tromo productions. A dark fable for adults If the absorption is a theme of sugar cookies, and is not a victim of the imagined theme, it is a wonderful one. A weird movie with enticing visuals: The shadows and contrast are prominent. Of course, look of a look, especially from fans of the violin and stylish frustration. Through all cruelty and wickedness, a moral, though diverted, can be gleamed.
