Just mention one more thing about Gentleman Jim. I agree with all the assessments that it is in the best outings of Errol Flyin in a career of great outings. I played this role Jim Corbett thinks more like his real personality than the swashbucklers he had cast in his type. Flin like a party creature from his memories and a real person's life was more exciting than his screen life. The extra thing I wanted to indicate was to suppress great montage, transitions and still inserted films. Although film director Ra√∫l Walsh was a frequent collaborator with Flin, with cineographer Sid Hykx, one of Montage's up-and-forth editors made Don Siegel. I never knew that Segal had returned so far, but he was correctly listed in the credits. He himself will go to a great career as the director of action.
