This movie is a perfect example of a movie that divides people into two groups. Those who do jokes and who do not. People usually attack what they do not understand. This image is a trick style and charm that has been unrivaled. This is a great comedy .. and a great romance. This is a perfect date movie. A perfect movie for anyone who wants to laugh a good lighthearted. And if your view is very intense, perhaps this movie is not for you and your counseling may be needed. This is an injustice that Paramount has never seen in the light of the DVD since the early 80's. Yet it is a good idea to think of a city version of "honeymooners". I'm curious that my twice-time favorite romantic comedy DVD is not released. The other is "The World's Greatest Girlfriend" of Jane Wilder, who has been sitting in Fox since the 80's ... Yet, "From Justin To Kelly" is almost every video store in the country. There is no trial in the world. Perhaps those who took time to bind this time will enjoy "Justin to Kelly", I'm sure they will get enough water to "get" them. Occasionally, people of the age lose their sense of humor ... or sometimes it just gets old and they get comic satisfaction in the repetition of "flower house".
