This is a film that explores the clash of culture of the people of Eastern culture of the people of Eastern culture. <br /> <br /> A tragic film about the potential for attraction of attraction due to loving main cultural differences during Tokyo. Cain, Rila Nerol Bracey, Japanese girl married Kyoto, so that she can stay in the US after the end of her visa. Marriage is expected only to be temporary, that is, until Kyoto regains legal status again. But, who seems lost in every relationship, likes Kyta and makes things very difficult to work. Despite the friend's request for dumping kites and all the promises to girls, it is bad for Rock N 'Roll, except for the inspiration to write some songs about the broken heart and all its things. <br /> <br /> But there is a rigorous traditional Japanese emergence from Kyoto, and that does not expect to get married all that long. Not only that, he is sitting at home and going back to Japan. It is not surprising that finally someone thinks that he can love and stay with him, in a matter of moments he thinks that he has found someone to feel like this, the girl is not expecting it for a long time. It's not that he likes Keke, it's just he's used in the silent way of life. He said, "I can not tell him the way he feels in English, and I can not tell how Ken can feel in Japanese." It's a sad love story with the 80's Techno-Nantendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I loved the Tokyo time because it reminded me of one of the 80's favorite movies of Tokyo Pop. And for those who have enjoyed loving at Tokyo time, Tokyo Pop (a New York singer goes to Japan and joins Japanese American cover band), without a movie with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
