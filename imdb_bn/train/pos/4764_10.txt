There are some comments about this movie which say that it is a bad and stupid and it should not be taken for such an extraordinary actor, such as Pierre Fresno to play it. <br /> <br /> I think, on the contrary, the film that is weird and has some weaknesses, Pierre Fresn's performance is so weak that it transforms the film into something nice. <br /> <br /> Its performance is probably the best in history. <br /> <br /> The film itself is a very vertebrate scene about wine debut in the cabaret. <br /> <br /> Who does not believe in a priest? Even a defrocked one ?? It can transform into Christ's blood, the scene is probably rare. But anyone who has been raised in the Catholic structure is very unexpected, but it is very emotional. <br /> <br /> The death of the little priest was suddenly shocking. But it's acting very well. Pierre Fresen works in the mad madness of his character and works for the murderer, tortured Morand who comes back to his duty on this terrible way.
