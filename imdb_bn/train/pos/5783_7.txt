I've read the reviews of Karching in IMDB, and frankly, I have not seen a positive review so far. I actually liked Kerching. Curch has set up a website called Rudby, about a teenage son named Taj Lewis, to build 1,000,000 pounds for his soil. The website offers many interesting things, if only the Taj and its two friends - Danny and Semur may refrain from publishing. I find this show quite funny and I enjoy viewing it. Acting is ok, but it can certainly be better, the characters are funny, especially Danny Spooner, Taj's friend, his stupid man makes him fun. And another friend of Taj, Samur. Carlton also owns the caf√© "The Chill" We can not see him, we only hear him. Taj's younger brother Omar and his elder sister Miss is very interesting. And the best friend of Mrs. Karsaa. Often the Taj has almost been released almost externally. Along with comedy, the love of life and the loss of loved ones, Kerching's drama makes this program great.
