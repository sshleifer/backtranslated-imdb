The part of The Greenwich was made for Jim Carrie and I was very impressed with his performance. I was not very excited, I was optimistic, but surprisingly surprised by the results. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou, who was the youngest girl I saw on screen for a long time and she showed a maturity beyond her years of acting skills. I had even pulled tears at one time! I have never read the story of Dr. Sais, so I did not know what I could expect, humor was very dark. Overall, I've enjoyed the film (without song!) And would recommend it especially for family viewing.
