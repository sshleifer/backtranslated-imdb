This movie was very entertaining. Soundtrack (Bean Adams) is simply beautiful and inspirational. Brian Adams is even more impressive in doing all the songs of the French. Scores are also encouraging and dramatic. <br /> <br /> The movie was created from a mix of traditional animations, along with the generated image. The results are really stunning. I see this movie with my kids at least once a week and we will never be tired. The story is compulsory and well described. <br /> <br /> I do not understand anyone who can rank this image less than 7 years old. A protector of my family.
