This anime was intrinsic and still. Very rarely referred to as dorky kids cinema, I came back to this 10 years after I saw it first. A release of good movies Although the animation is good, camera tricks give it a 3D feel, and even after the story has grown, I still grew up and looked like groundbreaker Neon. Genesis Evangelion and RahXephon. It's not seriously near the depth, but try to see it from a light heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not say a child's movie, it has a surprisingly sad moment and it You need a sense of humor to see all.
