Based on the concept of Gact, Moon Child became a poverty-stricken country called Mallepah. In the future timeline, the story follows the life of two main characters, KEY (head) and the show (GAKT) and their friends grow together. <br /> <br /> Despite some work may be too much or perhaps ridiculous, I firmly believe that it is a film about friendship. Even in all the hardships of each character, each of them wanted to stay with them, <br /> <br /> Contrary to most vampire characters, who represented a vampire who is killing the idea to break . A young boy in a vampire shows friendship in friendship, who is not afraid of anyone. However, some may wonder whether I see the show as a parent figure. Who Shore had lived there all his life in the past, he took care of him and taught him to live in a world where strength among the gangs control their lives. On the other hand, the show, who may be seen as a innocent youthful young man, became a man who realized that life is fun and not games, death exists and able to remove his loved ones <br /> <br /> I Love the part, where the actor Lee Home, who played the actor son, appeared on the first screen. The way they met was really quite cool. The son also has a large part in this film, it is a different nation, Taiwanese citizen, it has a great impact on the theme of friendship between filming. In spite of background difference, how friendships were developed, this movie has been portrayed exquisitely. <br /> <br /> I believe that each actor has done a good job, and it seems that this big screen was the first time it appeared in the film. Both HYDE and Gackt worked quite well and managed to make quite credible characters. In contrast to the movies that filled the movie with musician actors and movies, they did a great acting job! The moon child has really had an impact for me, it gave friendship a new meaning and consideration, which must be realized by all of our friendships in our lives. The film shows a lot of hope, despite all the bad events of their lives, there is always hope. Life may be cruel, it seems that hope does not exist anymore. The son shows a strong feeling of friendship among each other, even when the son becomes an enemy, Shaw was somewhat "funny" in their last battle. Everyone of them ultimately sought peace, despite how far they were away. The last scene showed us this.
