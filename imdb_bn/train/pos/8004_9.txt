Maslen Beach is a real nudist / dancing beach on the south of Adelaide in the Fluay Peninsula, Southern Australia. It is the name of an Australian film that uses a beach as a location. <br /> <br /> Muslin Beach labeled a romantic comedy. It can be a little confusing, because it is not a 'ridiculous' film, and it is not romantic in a traditional sense, but it has a soft heart. Life itself, there are many sad moments. It is also fully shot on the cashiest beach mentioned above and the nudity continues throughout the length of the movie. Visitors learn to learn to accept it as normal, and concentrate on the plot, not the wide amount of meat. <br /> <br /> Simon and Mersey (Michael Allen and Elisa Lowell) reached the car next to a beach. Park They take their belongings to the beach, and when they walk, talk to Simon about his confusion about real love a voice. The rest of the image is composed by a complete day at the beach, it is a search. The basic story is what is happening in Simon's love life, but there are many other characters highlighted in various letters. <br /> <br /> When they reach the beach, both Simon and Mercy are indifferent to each other. Mercy sees them as Romio and Juliet's romantic couple. Simon is just bored of it all. Later, we are familiar with Gail (Bani-Joy Lawrence), Pala (Zara Collins) and Jenny (Jennifer Ross). They are walking along the beach, discussing the possibility of finding 'perfect' people of Gayle, helped by Neolk's 'strength' on the good fortune of his throat. However, there are many interesting people on the beach, all of them are 'attractive' and young (not part of the reality of this movie). <br /> <br /> With a thin, small van with an aspect-selling ice cream salesperson to serve the beach patrons. This is Ben (Gary Waddell), who is a friend of Simon, and his unauthorized consultant. I think this character will be the main comic element. It is hard to say, because there is nothing about Ben who will ridicule you, unless you are drunk, men and very young! Although Maslen Beach has a major freedom fighter, and that it does not live a long time in any one subject. As the quality of the played quality, the scripts are suspect and everything about Maslin Beach is cheap, the lack of continuity is a positive groom. Actually, there is something about this movie (not nudity) that I find interesting. It is difficult to determine what it can do, but it can do something with its bitterness, and the fierce 'Aussie' mentality of physical factors. <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach Camera Work is worth mentioning. Sometimes it's very good, with some stunning static shots and beaches, cliffs and a sunset 'pan'. Nudity is an important aspect of framing cameras, as a major component of this film. Framing does not have any idea of ​​the gratech, which means framing so that the camera does not have a 'personal' body part. It helps to make any sense of viewer inconvenience easier and makes the movie even more palatable in the subject's personal position. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Maslin Beach genre does not seem to fit anywhere. Actors Baywatch is not 'attractive' in sense, and you see the beach just anywhere 'normal' people. There is no message kept in it and it probably will not work as tourist advertising, probably to naturalists. Alongside Australian accent, filming can have any in the immediate country. This film apparently makes Australians think that it can be worthless (film-verifiable), and just like the Australian cinema and other medium-sized national films, such rashes can consider alternatives. At the same time, there are rooms for testing to identify the identity of these medium-sized movies, and a 'flop' is not going to do much damage to their reputation. Maslin Beach is now a collector's item, it is always possible, this film can be internationally popular, but it is very unlikely. <br /> <br /> During this criticism, I sometimes see very negative words, about Maslín Beach. This is not a real situation, since I can see the film very easily. I enjoyed it as a reflection of the real reality and real people (and the problem). The problems faced by the film are like everyday, and a little less towards philosophy. It does not harm my viewpoint and I want more films to deal with such everyday. There is a connection with European cinemas and especially French movies. They rarely face major disasters or disasters, but with everyday Hollywood directly opposes this, and runs the crest of Hyper-Real Action / Drama / Angst Wave. The speed is very, much faster in Hollywood, but not the reality. Maslin Beach is not just any 'Jacks Tatti', but it also has the right track to ignore issues of multidimensional culture, equality, gender identity, and even in the right film. I'm sure you love or hate this film, with a little room for the soil in the middle. <br /> <br />
