I have not seen the movie yet, but can not wait to see! It seems very interesting and inspirational. It was one of the most interesting trailers that I have ever seen: it really stopped me because of the questions that it made and I think that the unique method of boxing game as a metaphor for "war" metaphorically ... Anyone thanks to Allah hit another angle with boxing thing . This film looks so fresh and smart. And the actors are really hot. I especially enjoyed rock clips with Rocky Films Actors, Short Clips. I thought that the matter was selected - depending on adversity and childhood attack-periodless, and God knows that many people need it. Bring it.
