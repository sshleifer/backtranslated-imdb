Pressburger and Powell's greatest movie. David Nivon plays RAB's bomber pilot, who thinks of his own death but signed the notice of Heaven when he gave a miraculous notice and sent an angel to investigate. The scene when young soldiers, men and women, black and white, killed in all tasks, processed for eternal life, helplessly stupid to reach heaven. See also for Roger Liviesy, a deeply acclaimed actor, and Kim Hunter's love interest (later, of course, in the Apps Plan Zera). Eventually, Steven Spielberg starred in the actress who acted as the elderly wife of Chief Angel (Taleenlene Byron) after half a century as the private wife of Private Private Roy, which is a volume for her movie's literacy.
