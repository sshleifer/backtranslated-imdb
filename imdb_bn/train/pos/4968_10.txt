Diego Armando Maradona, and is still the best football player, this game has been given. Not just an athlete, an artist. If this documentary is to be lived in the memory of every football fan in the world throughout the 1986 World Cup. Because of his remarkable and incredible goals, he made against his country (England). There is absolutely no point in reducing this star. Although I do not undersand the Spanish, I can appreciate the argentine narrator. She really cry for happiness, and express her emotions ... What I wrote is stupid and can be difficult to understand, but the reader ..... you will see what you mean.
