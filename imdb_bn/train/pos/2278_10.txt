Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and I'm hoping for a great disappointment. Instead, I've got a movie that perfectly depicts the poisonous depression of satire, humor, fascinating, and above all Vongut's novel. <br /> <br /> This is certainly the best preview of Nolte. He has trembled with the transparency of the defeat of Harvard Camille Jr. and the sound of his words consistently behind his eyes. <br /> <br /> Alan Orkin is a wonderful colorful like George Craft. Sherble Lee is haunting as Cambell's young lover in her isolation from reality. Effective and more effective as John Goodman's blanket's "Blue Fair Good Moodler" <br /> <br /> This Kamble's PinoCosiacoc story is trying to be its own ideal hero and unjustifiably his ideal tragedy is becoming a villian in a mature and bright look in what we humans do. And besides that, it's one of the most deep romantic films I ever came across. The incarnation of blanket is both foolish and wise love. And convincingly sastifyingly painful in movies, he finally teaches what his Blue Fairmaker meant to be a real boy as granting him his desire. And he understands that ... well, watch the movie and you will see <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful poetic story that drops deep into our emotions and it is completely trustworthy to the original author.
