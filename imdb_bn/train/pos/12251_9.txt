Unfortunately, it does not seem to take me a while to watch this version, but I do not think I'm able to rent it in the video store, only other versions but I have read it in love with it. I always had borders with another Emma. Gennenths and Tony Colette, as they are not normally English, have to pronounce it, and it does not seem to be normal to me. It seems to be. Sorry but Tony and Genneth do not do a brilliant job there. I could not be warm for a letter, but this version was more heart warmer and more like the kind of person I felt as Emma. It's definitely the version I'll be back from now. I was disappointed that Mr. Knightley did not look good, but he believed. I also like Jane Fairfax (played by Olivia Williams). I have never been warm to him in the movie version, but he is more well-illustrated in this version. Let's think, (except Mr Knightley) all the characters have played well, and very few at the top. Unfortunately both came closer at the same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity. Woe ...... I finally love the new scene. Kate is well done with Bakesynce! Therefore, if you are a Jane Austen fan, do not forget to see this one.
