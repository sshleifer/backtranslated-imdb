What was always missing with the story of the matrix was how it happened in the real world. And do not say, because this part of the story is covered in most bases. It was really political, how it was political, even a presidential administration of the current presidential shot. Fascism and violence are the only things that people can think of in a war against robotics, which are nothing more than slaves of humanity. What I used to think was interesting, and how the unknown concept persists. We tend to trap people that often, lacking logic and lack of reason because people can not believe in the opposite. Well represented and kept together, this is a true story of how an irrational man can be.
