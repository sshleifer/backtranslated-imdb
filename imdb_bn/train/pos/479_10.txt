Emily Watson's Natalia has seen on a screen absolutely the most romantic and romantic character. He is the queen of this picture beyond doubt. No, did he send the king? Internal weaving of chess games and family control, power and victory struggles are stunning. Movie chess directors just like playing games simultaneously together at one go, but weaving all the main or minor designs. At the beginning of the 20th century, this period of Italy's lake district, clothing, and imagery was nicely captured. The space is not broken into single squares. <br /> <br /> So lots of bright scenes, I can not describe them all. I recommend this movie twice, perhaps enough time for a week to see the budget, because you probably will not be able to capture all the poems in a 64-square multi-dimensional framework. <br /> <br /> I did not read the book of Nabakov, but for trying my own analogy, I am reminded of the other romantic-winning poem-game-play film Barry Levinson's The Natural. It was absolutely American, at the end of Bernard Malamud's fatalist book down to the end of romantic Impressionism. Well, the director did better one by combining them together as a retreat to illuminate the Russian and Italian ethics and morals. Here is the zero sum of true story games; Until both competitors are painted a winner and one is damaged. But, in the context of life and especially our immortal souls, we are limited only by those limitations and living, that is why we break our souls to others. <br /> <br /> Pure love, recognized by Emilie Watson's Natalia, can surpass us and allow us all to be gathered by her gifts. Only the barriers created by our fears can be cut from it to us. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie (10/10).
