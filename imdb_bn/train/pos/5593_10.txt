This image can be a silent movie; It certainly has a feeling. I was very fortunate to see this very rare version of this film. Extase, a 'love symphony', and crosses all language versions. French, which is the ultimate romantic language, seems very suitable for this very sensual and songwriter version. A young Hoodie lightens the screen of Lamar, in this movie, which is often like a sexual fantasy; But obviously away from pornography. Tech properties can be a little crude; But this image is not deviated from magic spellings. Many lovers of the first film will absolutely worship this movie.
