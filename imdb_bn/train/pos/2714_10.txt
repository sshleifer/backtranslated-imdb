This was one of the rare rare moments I wanted to keep forever in VHS. It will never wind again? <br /> <br /> It was so creative and I remember it was aired once a week and was waiting for the next episode. I want to see it again. I want to buy it. I do not want me to. Not even on eBay <br /> <br /> So, while running enough, it was the best of the 80 series. It should be considered a classic but the space is lost. At least this website and Wikipedia mention it. Sob. <br /> <br /> It was completely interesting, fun, flirtatious, and original. Although Sherlock Holmes is not the main choice, I really think Quinton has a much more interesting and rigorous and shiny Holmes than sometimes has a good chance with his leading lady.
