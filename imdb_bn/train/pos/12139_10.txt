Although this movie is over 70 years old, it is still an ongoing, strong film. Bate Davis, as slutty, is completely credible to Mildred Naughty Cockney Waitress. His performance observer is still spellbinding. He totally hates the viewer and at the same time he feels sorry. Leslie Howard's weak, obscure Philip Kerry is not as strong as acting, but an actor can not hold on to his master over the effectiveness of Mrs. Davis. He stole the show completely, he chews up the scenes of that every scene. This movie sealed its Stardom and won the Academy Award, but lost. It's frustrating for days with unknown pregnancy, multiple sexual partners and harmful language themes of Mildred, so it's a bit dated, but still a nice movie. Millrade told Philip what he really thought about him ("you are cad, you dirty swine ....") still see the scene where I've seen the film still the greatest performance.
