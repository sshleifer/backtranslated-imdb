I miss the Western company, they kept their fingers in the 1980s, in the unique and unusual film scenes. It has suddenly become very clear with the paperhouse, this is a film that touches me deeply and every time I see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Relate to his life and influence, is attractive and never disappointing. Charlotte chest at first seems quite indifferent and still you're warm for him because it is difficult for the adult to understand what he understands, because of a wicked boy. He became very self-conscious and at the end, even discovering that he "does not hate the boys" because he claimed so inhumanly for the first time. Through this we treat many sensitive moments and some extraordinary horrific things, with Hans Gimmer's grand score, all visually stunning. RCA Victor I am proud to be the owner of Soundtrack in CD during the Liberation War in the United States. During this writing, there was no DVD of the paperhouse yet (in Europe only), it is expected that one of my greetings will be true because I really enjoy this beautiful movie and a DVD of it will be very good! <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Having a fantastic job, I think the editorial comment on Amazon.com is quite boring considering "hammi acting" - I saw every aspect of the paperhouse to be happy. Even when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom looks at each other through glass doors, it is also very strong in the small scenes of brightness. Enjoy <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is enough to invite to watch the show again and I am still afraid of cinematography and set. For me, it never likes to see the same movie twice, because there are so many details of exploitation and happiness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, when I see many movies, along with movies, it will be easily forgotten and sinking at the door, what I have to do is call the paperhouse And renewed my belief in the wonderful story.
