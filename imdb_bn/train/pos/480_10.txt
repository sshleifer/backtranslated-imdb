The main aspect of this film is that most people think that Luhzin makes his life alive as a chess game. So many people have seen this movie and have not received it, and I do not understand why. I was taken to a private ride while watching this picture, which floated me. I will try to explain this without any spoilers, but forewarned, I talk about things to happen in the movie. <br /> <br /> **** Possible spoilers **** will be prerendered ****! <br /> <br /> The "small moves" in contrast to his life "big moves". She nominated Natalia as her queen, and as she did, she and her aunt described the first king and queen and their movement when she submitted her as a chess boy. Listen closely to that description. <br /> <br /> When someone asks him a question, he reviews the past, he flashbacks the past. (Flashbacks are beautifully lit.) Flashbacks are also quite interesting, because they do not just give their views as children, but also give other points of view. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even a scene is animated to understand what is happening in them. Beautifully done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I will not comment more on what happens to Lihajine's character, but I hope it will illuminate what's actually happening in the end. <br /> <br /> This picture is constantly working on many levels, so I support it. It was a treat and a joy. <br /> <br /> If you like this picture, I would recommend a film named Fresh. The only way to do this is to use chess and character characters. <br /> <br />
