I do not really know what people know about this film, but it is definitely one of my favorites. This is not promotional, it is not dirty by moral, it should not be controversial. It's just God. No possible god, no matter religion. And it's really fun. <br /> <br /> Jim Carey starred Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, was frustrated to prove himself (feeling himself a lot less) that he could be taken seriously and an anchor work Not a good job. This drive is slowly driving her beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). While cutting the straw, he can not laugh fast, but shouted out in God's mouth, who turned his throats to power. Then Bruce makes his own life better, until he is guilty of helping others, where he misses his power. Meanwhile, due to his constant tension about his life he made him more selfish, leaving his relationship with dangerous places. <br /> <br /> Well, it was too long. But as a plot, it works well. By step-by-step we meet the challenges of being God, it's far better to combine problems, and to hide myself fairly well. <br /> <br /> Since you probably heard of it, the film knows that the film is in the first place, in the role of a caring pitcher-perfect performance (which is fortunately enough), and gives the atmosphere the view and control of the film scene. They do not acknowledge that role was specially written or rewritten for carrier. Apart from him, the humorous flat will be launched, half of the humor is executed. And humor is very good at first place. But without curiosity, it would seem like an eats a wonderful life wannabe. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston is great and, whatever might say, do not act like the sole excuse for the third law. At least, if you do not see him. She gives an impressive performance and does not forget you are watching a movie, she and Curry feel very much like a real couple. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be ggooooodd (understanding the understanding of movies), a very nice feeling, deals well with the idea properly and expectedly and completely shuts down to save career career (which 'does not go anywhere') Should not be kept.
