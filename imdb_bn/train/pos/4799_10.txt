Probably more than a movie, this one is not for everyone. Some people are allowed to slow down, reflect and happen at their own time, a good description of their personal hell. Talking in some deep parts of such a system for others, they know that some parts are tall for contact with them. <br /> <br /> I think it's nowhere in my own life, but I count myself in the next group camp. I am fascinated by the pace of this movie's meditation, found to be slowly my mythological guide in some Kingdoms. It is actually a journey story, rich in our distance screenplay, we have to travel a long time if we come to the full circle at the end of our day. <br /> <br /> A lot about the presentation of Mr. Fernsworth's Alvin. Straight, though, I'm not sure that they have the words to express the impatient insatiability of despair and the subtle balance of intelligent innocence that he has accepted for us. I got an opportunity to spend time with him before I left for him to know that he was actually talking to his death while sitting on the tractor seat. I hope he had the truth and truth of his many satisfaction, he did not just "act" but with this cruel honesty brought many people to share his absolute humanity. <br /> <br /> The realities of production are economics, I have firmly given the complete credit to Mr. Lynch for the courage shown to develop the story so slowly. An outsider in film production, I still realize that there are some areas of modern life where the expression "time money" is properly described. Going deep into our hearts is an adventure which can not be left out of any adventure, and for his achievements, Mr. Leinch has understood that he is not just telling a story - he invited his audience to spend some time with his audience. No easy task, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to feel the power of film to introduce yourself to your precious part, you can spend a few hours with Straight Stories Can do anything worse than spending. . And then give yourself some time for the next little, only during the short hours of the night listening to his echo.
