For those who believe in anime, only girls are raped by girls in rape, think again. Japanese animation has completely different side. Yakitate! Japan is one of their show. It's a young girl's sweet nature story with a gift of making delicious bread. His universe is about the making of Japanese bread that matches the famous European bread. This show came as disappointing and I'm not sure that Japanese viewers will miss many jokes. However, it is still very nice to see the whole innocence of listening. <br /> <br /> In the mundane world! After eating the bread they just feel like orgasm, it seems that it is not unusual. While roasting bread and fish like swimming in a fish, you can give a wide array of super powers. That strange aspect is one of the least expected and fun shows I saw in a while.
