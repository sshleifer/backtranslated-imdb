This is one of the most fun shows I have ever seen. It really was refreshing to see and I was sewing many times. I think this makes it very interesting that there is a social awareness factor in this. If these white girls get the same reaction? Perhaps they, perhaps they will not? Characters do not know any limits (check my songs) and have fun not excluded anyone from their twisted sense! There are many fun sketches. My favorite bob is one builder. It's so talented that it's genius. If you like black-and-black comedy, it's for you. If you prefer to hold attendees, it is probably not. The non-blond is one of the hilarious British BBC comedy TV shows! It's a funny show and unleashed characters on the fuzzy public laugh at the loud! It is impossible to keep the face straight when seeing the crazy character and the response of the people! This series is easily added to the excellent comedy produced!
