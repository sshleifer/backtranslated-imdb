I personally saw most of my life's Disney movies, though none of them matched Bedbirds and Bromstics. Although I personally could not overcome live-action with animation, it was an improvement to try to dress humans as characters of animation. The film has expelled three of the world's second war criminals, who are sent to live with a silent and socially irrational woman in the country. I'm saying that the welding was bright. Angela Landberry has created a perfect Miss Price, David Thompson has created great interest in the great entertainer love. The end always surprised me and this was no exception. It was not happy if it was sad, although I do not know whether it was deliberate. The dialogue was not great, but it was considered that it was designed for a children's film, all right. Overall, I have nine performance in ten, ten dialogue between ten, nine votes out of ten, and 10 in the dresses.
