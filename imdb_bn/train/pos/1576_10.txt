It was a wonderful film. How do these women try to save their husbands? I was great at the performance of the actors. I think of the film for a long time. I think every student can see this movie so that they can think about war, relationship, friendship and love. I love this picture because it has been told to me and showed me how strong love can be. I want to be as powerful as a woman. I really liked it because it said something about the relationship and I like to see it in a movie. I think you can compare the film with Der Untergang, Pianwadi. If you keep these three films together, you are very happy about what happened during the war. We should always remember something like war.
