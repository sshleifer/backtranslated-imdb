I saw this movie after hearing the raves about it for several years. Not saying, the actual experience proved a little anticlimactic. But still, Alchev Gaines astronomy leads to an astounding astounding cast, if the formulas, roaming through the industry via WWII England. <br /> <br /> This is a familiar story about the misery of the perfect everyday product discovery. Remember to drive that car into water? Remember the promise of nuclear power? In this case, it is a fabric that does not wear, do not drink stove or even dirty! Of course, fabric makers and their staff are afraid of the possibility of getting out of business, and so the plot becomes a little thicker. <br /> <br /> Guinness makes the whole enterprise proper and shows him. Again the factory research lab is an explosion! (The Brightness ... when it is always tough, when the upper lip is on top.) The image can be revitalized like a secret discovery of Guinean, but it is also a good journey.
