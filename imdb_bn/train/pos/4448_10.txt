Yesterday I saw this photo and enjoyed it perfectly. I was a screenwriting student and when I saw a little character in a scene, little characters interfered. <br /> <br /> I was thinking the dialogue was very sharp and the scenes in the story are rather frustrating - Stanwick is openly flirting with his daughter's boyfriend at a particular time; And in ten years her husband rekindling some emotions; And two shoots with a gunfight signal and then one 'is his old shag fellow Dutch (because he moved to the city in the first place!) At the same time! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a great reason to rent this movie in Hog ​​'DVD. <br /> <br /> I saw one of the best movies of the time that have seen it for a long time.
