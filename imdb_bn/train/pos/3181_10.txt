I had the opportunity to watch this movie debut at the Applechachian Film Festival, which won a prize for the best picture. This image is brilliantly done, a nice cast which works well as a rope. My favorite performance is Yusuf Kerkur, Justin Lane and Adam Jones. Also, there is some great effect with Dragonfly and Kakroch, I was surprised to see that this movie was made in a small budget. Writer-director Adam Jones, who believes in winning a prize for his writing, works excellent with direction. The listener likes this movie Cross-eyed will keep you smiling throughout the movie. Of course there must be a must see.
