This one-minute film is the controversial first movie ever made. Other inventors previously managed the photos - such as Edison's movements photography - but Lumia's Brothers made such devices that greatly improved the media. At that time, of course, their 'Sinametograph' had disturbed their peers with their peers. In this first example, the brothers leave their factory and record employees, some of them understand the concealment of the camera's awareness. Lumieres try to make the film more entertaining by inserting a bicycle and a bike, but 'LaSorty Dos Eug√®ne Lumiere' almost does not match the cognition of their next films. The most striking aspect of this short film is the practice of the labor class known as brothers' known issues. Their preliminary evidence of their curiosity about all the people in the world of their choice, is a quality which shows their exams extremely incredible and interesting today. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 8
