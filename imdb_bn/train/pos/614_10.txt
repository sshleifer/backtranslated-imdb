<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what did I say, what would I say? <br /> <br /> When Hollywood feels that remixes and sequels are strong in our throat, "Stardust" reminds us why we go to the first movie - for a few hours to escape from reality and find other life, other times, or other planets. Surprisingly, "Stardust" takes us to three places indefinitely and with a little glin. We <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Scratch and scoundrels. It's a touch of distressed, heroes, enmity, obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms, even light-motion even girls to make it modern modern. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" is a city easily beside a wall, which separates the city from the magical kingdom. The only way to the wall is through a breech that is impressively protected by a scrappy old coder (played nicely with David Kelly). One day a young man from the Wall came out of the old guard van and went outside Ben Barnes. He met on a royal kingdom called Stormhold where he met a disciplined (and very sexy) young girl called Una. She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an obsolete chain. If away with him, he hugged Ben and sent him on his way. Ben returned to the Wall without incident and continued his life. But nine months later, he was called to the wall of the wall, where the old guard keeps him in the hands of what you can expect - <br /> <br /> <br /> The boy's name Tristan Cox) who had a girl injured in street outside her league and got married to others. Nevertheless, the young woman (known as Victoria and Sienna Millar played) once went out with Trishna and she accepted her love for him. After they espy a falling star, he tells him that if he brings him back to his star and brings him back, he may have him. He agreed and will go out in search of him, which will lead him to the other side of the wall. <br /> <br /> In the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Waul) is dying. He will tell his remaining son who will succeed him on the throne. His son's name is Primus, Secundus, Sexmus and Septimus. To see who else killed the other brothers, who want to get the throne in a ridiculous competition <br /> <br /> He tosses his Ruby twin in the sky and the voice, which takes the earth to earth. Comes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She does not know that she is now induced herself by an elderly magician named Trishne, Princess and Lamia (Michele Pfeffer). Rechena, who spent his youth get back to the heart of the stars. <br /> <br /> is complex? Yes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " But he must first get past the palace and lamia. Principles are not a big problem in trying to kill each other - and as "Caribbean pirates" - death was not so funny. <br /> <br /> <br /> Tirstin may face a wizard who makes his mother a maid (though he does not know her mother) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert Dyers. <br /> <br /> The most important character in his film and Dérono plays a tee. He firmly stole the movie and soon we learn a secret secret that lets viewers leave the floor with laughter. Although his role is small, but Dérono is extraordinary! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Claire Dances is the most appropriate as the confused and miserable Yvaine. She makes a perfect virgin. Jason Fleming, Adam Booston, Rupert Everett and Mark Strong have added perfect levels like war criminals because they come back as ghosts "Blith Spirit" and "High Spirits". <br /> Director Matthew Von, whose other experience was "Layer Cakes", enjoys a wonderful story that everyone will enjoy. <br /> <br /> "Stardust" can be very complicated for young children, but anyone 13 years old would like to watch this movie more than once. It's that good. "Stardust" is supposed to be a movie. Completely written, completely shot, perfectly directed, and fully played. In other words ... perfect.
