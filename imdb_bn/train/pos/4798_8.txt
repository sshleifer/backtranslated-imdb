This normal eerie Lynch stuff is not a movie for fans. Rather, it is for those who appreciate good stories, or have been tired of the run-of-the-mill stuff with fascination and Oprah-Isha, "It's a wonderful movie! You will definitely see it!" - Cemetics is absolutely right, once!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In addition to acting, cinematography is similar (sometimes quite brilliant!), and dialogues leave enough for viewers to read the story for details. <br /> <br /> A warm movie. Not too emotional.
