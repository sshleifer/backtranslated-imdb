Atlantis was much better than I wanted. In some ways it was a better goal than a better goal than other movies. Although this picture claims Spanish at a critical time. It was a great movie for all ages. I found a comedy in some of the young audience but expected to have an adventure. I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. Nothing is seen except for many parodies of these kids. After a short time everyone looked intensely Atlantis.
