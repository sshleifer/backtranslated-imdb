Spider-Man is the best superhero in my opinion, and this game is the best superhero game ever. Although it may be a bit easier, you have to play it many times to get all the clothes and comic book covers, which makes it easy to overtake the game. At first it may seem difficult to control, but once you hang it up, you'll be web-shining like Spiderman. <br /> <br /> Something like laser is fun, but fun. The first boss, Scorpion, can make the bit incredibly easy, which should not be, because fans of comic books can tell, Scorpio is one of Spider-Man's most dangerous villains. The second boss, Rhino, is very easy. The 3rd boss, Junoom, who in my opinion is the simplest boss in this game, that should not be. Fourth year again Junoon This time, he beat a little harder but still simple. 5th boss Mainsterio, I think the most interesting boss to play. She is one of the toughest bosses, but again, still fairly easy. The next boss is murdered, who, you guess it, easy to beat But murder is actually fun of war 7th bose doctor octopus, who is easy to sit with others, but not as easy as others because he has a shield. The 8th and the final diameter game is exclusive, not a comic book or a cartoon. I will not spoil it for you who do not play it for you, but the only boss in the game that is not very easy to boss. During my first or second attempt, I beat 4 or 5 attempts, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave it 8 out of 10. Because I'm not going to 9 or 10 numbers that once you get all the clothes and comic book covers it will be annoying (though it can take all the time), comic book or cartoon shows it is not very correct, bosses are very easy, And they used Hobbswillin and / or Green Goblin as a boss, I think someone would love to roam the air! They are not using them to sag this game! Well Greene Goblin is the upcoming Spider-Man film villain, so hopefully they will create a video game based on the movie.
