When I first read the plot of this play, I think it is going to be sex and the City, but this play is nothing like this. The stories seem more realistic and you express more feelings with the situation. The drama is similar to that, while four 30 women show us the way through our friendship and relationships with problems and problems. Katie GP is a dark and awkward character that is very difficult to relate to you and a good friend with a widowed tragedy. The character of trudge is heart warming, because he is related to the problems of the mother as well as the mother of four. The Jessica Party girl is very single psycho and knows what she wants and how to get it. She is a favorite character and nearer to the bride's husband, who can not help her husband completely turn around when she is in love. Wonderfully addicted to all the plays and it can do better if the BBC series continues. It sounds like sex and the city, or dramatized cast other ladies as depparet housewives. This may be the next cooler foot playing right. Plus men's cast is not very eye-to-eye.
