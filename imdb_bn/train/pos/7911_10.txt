As a kid, I like computer animation even though it was very limited and the tools were almost incomplete. In this movie, I sat in fear and saw amazing images and almost mesmerized music, attracting my wishes to create things moving on the computer. This is a complete package agreement, music and video, which really packs a couple punch. If you know a child who wants to be involved in computer animation, then this must be required. <br /> <br /> I have rated this movie as my top 3 favorite one after almost 20 years. Originality, I think, most of today's Macmovies are clearer. I want to see if I want to recreate my own; If the simulation is a striking impressive form, then this film is worth a ton of imitation) =
