This picture is amazing and I likewise recommend children and adults. Animation is beautiful, characters are rich and interesting, and the stories are impressive; Better than the time the American studio was produced. However, there are several quotes in this statement. Disney designer studio Gumbly was shocked to buy back catalogs and then took it to Kosai. In addition to being really impressive with the original English version, my main point is that Disney again dubbed the movie again. The new cast with van der Chek et al has destroyed it and took away a lot of characters from the characters. Paju and winter went from brave companions to lusty teenagers. The original music score is much better than Disney's remix. Q: Why is Disney so changed? I think Disney can earn more money by casting van der Cheque et alk, which is fair enough, but in this process they cling to the picture. It's still a beautiful film and I still recommend it to anyone. My main beef is to destroy a movie from Disney Childhood that I like and still love. I'm lucky enough to import a Japanese Japanese with the original English dub, which I'm going to protect my life now!
