To know what did not have to know about this movie, I tested it in the video store and saw it as I enjoyed it. Little-seen multi-genre flick from director Bernard Rose (Candimon, Immortal boyfriend) Great stories and characters. As a fan of Glenn Heideli, I was surprised by his British accent. The only exception to this photo was the end. However, it is worth the rent.
