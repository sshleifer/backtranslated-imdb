I did not know the actual facts of sitting up to see this incident, it was true that it was based on the true story. After the child's death, Ro√±a tried to help her daughter Desirie (... who actually gave her descendants name) cope with the loss. This is really made for children, as is often done with "family" Flix (It has been said, stay ahead and stay together to see, even though I keep teenagers away, until you are sure that they buy the idea ), But it does not reduce a sting that a parent dies and does not speak to a person. The plot is quite attractive, and comes along as well enough. Unlike acting, Boston's colleague casts, with the exceptionally outshining Burstyn, follows that beautiful, and barges at Ferland and his colleagues (with some exceptions) at least believers (and, frankly, they are annoying; then again, the intended audience for this thing is really No). Editing and cinematography standards, and of course not less than that. Although humor is limited to a fun funny line, the tone is not unpleasant. This is an intense scene or two. I recommend this kind of movie fans. 7/10
