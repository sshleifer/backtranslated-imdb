When thinking about "The Great Account", I allowed my mind to return to this little jewel of the movie from my childhood. When I read an autobiographical novel from 1949 and re-inspired what inspired it, and when it was the only movie that actually showed "foreign" movies (we actually did not really use that word), then I was the first to get my ticket. <br /> <br /> With the emergence of war criminals and promos in WWII, I was interested in exploring the reality of that conflict, which was reflected in the lives of people and reflected in human stories. . Later, year after year, he became interested in buying a book from this book and reads equally compulsory novels by Hans Helmut Kirst and Eric Maria Remark, which gives more depth. The film versions were, however, unlike that they rarely supplied the goods. <br /> <br /> In the middle of black and white films they were not full for years. I have never seen a technicolor version proven as "true" The Wooden Horse "proven as a deep cheerscore of movies." If it is true that we are always going to be captured in our childhood images, then I accept it freely. And Leo Gane's symbol will never be the hero of the British War, on film, even Sir Alec.
