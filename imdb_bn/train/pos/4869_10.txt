Without a strong mind or without the blood drop of the child, it is not for the people. If you do not have one you can not understand it. And if you do not understand, you can not enjoy it. :) For example, if you think that a car named Picasso Citroon, you probably walk through it if you see a picture of Picasso, it's a trash-work from street artists. :) So do not judge, before trying to understand it :) Ultimately I think it is necessary for everyone with an open mind. Still the secret of my N1 Shawshank release! And remember that all things can not be framed. Because there are things in this world, no frame will be okay.
