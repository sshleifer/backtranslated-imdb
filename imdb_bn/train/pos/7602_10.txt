The first episode was amazing, their whole idea of ​​the island consistent with it, when the mysteries were discovered (and seen) were simply extraordinary; Tales of mysteries, sculptures, and filled with an amazing plot. I mean, I just love seeing the whole idea of ​​seeing them on their island. And then the first episode smoke giant first really caught my attention. Since then, the second season I was hooked in was equal rights in the first season, just a little better. I like the idea of ​​absolutely hatch and religion initiative. Season 2 was full of mysterious, terrifying, and exciting whole plot and sequence. I like all mysteries surrounding others on the island, but religion stories really make season 2 wonderful. <br /> <br /> Season 3 was not as good as 1 and 2 ... but nevertheless, great. I love seeing stories behind others, watching their camp, and exploring more of the mystery. ("Tricky Thanak Is Dead" is one of my favorite episodes). This season, though not good, was still exciting and fun, but most of all exciting! Now, the 4th season. I was hoping for this season, and the first couple of episodes we got better, but then it started to get really annoying and monotonous. I mean, I really hate the new "rescue" like Miles and Daniel. The first couple episodes and the maximum ... after the plot became old ... Season 4 has broken off from a thing which has lost a perfect series: mystery, mystery, comedy mix (Charlie is gone) and overall tension. Also, there are some left of my favorite characters.
