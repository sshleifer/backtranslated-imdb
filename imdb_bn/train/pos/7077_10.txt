The best science fiction works of all time, such as the Blade Runner or even Gilliam's own dream-like and worried Brazilian. Willis gave his best performance here, but he made an outburst of incredibly phenatic turn with Pitt which is different from any earlier or any part of it.

Scenes of mental hospital are weird and still funny in their own way. Here's a lot of dark humor on the show. Excellent production design and suitable seamless cinematography. My top ten
