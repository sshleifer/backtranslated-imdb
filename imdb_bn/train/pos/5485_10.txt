One of the most timely and engrossing documentaries, you will ever see. Although this happened in Caracas Venezuela's capital, it provides a closer view of political mobility which is strong in the Western Hemisphere. Basically another chapter of the "American-supported, Latin American coup" story, what can happen when this film is armed with real-world history, when the poor people, unity, political perception and courage! <br /> <br /> The political insight given by this photo is priceless. Explicit examples are available in the private media, as a powerful force for the public deception and propaganda. We see the poorer people of Caracas "the brutal reality of American politics". Someone gets clear ideas of impeccable condemnation, if people fail to deal with extremist oppression, which suddenly and illegally, conspirators impose on them. We also see CIA-supported, personal media, plutocrat and generals' arrogance and fascism, who planned to bring Venezuela back under Washington's domination. Although non-partisan, led by President Hugo Chavez, the people of Caracas were forced to work against him, Chavez was forcibly abducted by the generals. The ambition of their reaction film. To find an excellent portrait of everything from the US government, Hugo Chavez and Revolutionary Venezuelan, this movie is all!
