I have liked all this movie in my life. It's such an intelligent story, with a lot of classical emotions. Such as The ship that was lost decades ago was called Bellerophon. Well, in this scriptural mythology, this person killed Chimera, who composed two or more other creatures. In the FP, Walter Paddy is definitely Chimera- himself and his id giant. <br /> <br /> I like movies where the authors explicitly gave credits to their audiences with intelligence, in contrast to most modern blockbusters who spent $ 150m on special effects, but spent $ 1.50 on a screenplay. <br /> <br /> Cheers
