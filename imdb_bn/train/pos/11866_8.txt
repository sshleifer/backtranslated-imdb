Most people think that this is the best film ever seen in this film. I disagree but this movie is very very good. Tony is a bad ass guy and he knows that he is scared and uses it to get ahead. This is about him and how he takes a large room and a cocaine from the bath and takes all the desks in an office. This is not the way to if you want a family movie, but if you want you like it, then you will like mobsters and vengeance and so on.
