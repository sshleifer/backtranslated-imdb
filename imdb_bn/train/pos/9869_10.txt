She usually has some fun to say throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The great voice of rom romano, the big character of the film, literally, Dennis leary violent bad guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger <br /> <br /> It's not just a comic and beautiful color but a small, A beautiful, emotional story that makes the little baby gentle how strong it is.
