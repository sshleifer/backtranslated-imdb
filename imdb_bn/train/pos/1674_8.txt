Lisa Bamar (Ida Galie) is the wife of a big businessman, who died in a plane crash during a business trip, inherited a $ 1 million life insurance plan? She first suspected her to be responsible as her husband. Has changed and so is a thorough investigator Peter Lynch (George Hilton) and an interpreter agent on his tail. Gauss Athens, Greece traveled to his heritage cash, but the cash is being emphasized ... on a dangerous turn of events. Link's identity is now known that Bumar is trying to protect her against her boyfriend Lara Falakakis, yet her pregnant Sharif tries to kill both of them for the fate of their money which he thinks he possesses. And this is where our masked killer starts his / her brutal assassination. The lancet was traditionally suspected by the first Greek police with our hero, and he was warned to leave the police inspector Stevros (Luis Pistil√≠), a known detective of Gaiolo and Spaghetti. Lynch was assisted by a clerk named Clio Clup Dupont (Anita Strinberg), a local journalist who helped him investigate the murder. Anyone who does not see this movie can make the movie worse, so much good for red heroin and enough to say enough of them to keep the story of the mystery / thriller fans happy for Gylo. No submissive DVD has a great transfer with both English and Italian soundtracks. This is a very interesting score for Bruno Nicolaei's good measurement which will remain on your head for a while ... First of all, Guialo's first rate.
