I would not release a movie like this today. It takes time to present the depth of the character and is not full with twists and turns to keep the plot at the edge of your seats. <br /> <br /> But, this is what the image is: a fun deal with the family sorrow. How the language leaves us mute for healing and excessive impending damages, and we rely on raw emotion instead. Sadness and anger due to patience and patience without even hatred. And unfortunately, the lead character in the movie (a small boy who accidentally killed his brother by killing him) killed more than his fair share. Eventually he left and went with his grandfather (Wilford Breamley), who made it clear that it was an accident. I think this young man knew his heart, but his parents needed to hear that word and apologize to them. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie: The lack of conversation. There was an emphasis on physical reactions, facial expression. And the gradual dynamism of the film enables you to see the responses of actors. We can not do anything with today's movies. <br /> <br />
