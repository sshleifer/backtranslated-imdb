Buddy is an entertaining family movie that creates "human beings" creatures at a time and makes them beautiful so that they are an acceptable way to be interested in them. <br /> <br /> Based on the real story, the body shows the main characters for animals and for each other, and they love to do something for each other that great love. <br /> <br /> Although not a perfect movie, animated gorilla is mostly fun for most of the time and the illusion that happens in the house. <br /> <br /> This image misses the chance of confronting the wrongdoers to bring domestic animals as domestic animals, but shows the problems. <br /> <> A proposed first movie for Jim Henson Productions.
