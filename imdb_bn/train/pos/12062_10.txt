This picture shows me the fear of me from the very first day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I was awake in the middle of the night, my father helped me save him from the stairs. <br /> <br /> She says something, "Do not let me get her" or something like that. I asked why he was so upset? She told me that she saw a black woman. <br /> <br /> So perhaps I wanted to see him and although I was only 11. It's *** *** out of fear. I have been watching awesome films from this observer!
