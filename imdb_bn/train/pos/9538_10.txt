Why are more films (especially American) not like meatball machines? <br /> <br /> This is my first official online review and my first attempt is to blame my "Electric Exstacy" after choosing "Meatball Machine". This is a review, so I will only try to hold reflection and intestinal emotions. <br /> <br /> I mean, this is a creative piece, but it is now clearly inspired by the classic Tetsu! So if it's all original? I am the owner of these two films, and although Titu is a strange son of a bitch, but the metallic machine is very much characteristic and can make the brain change for the brain to change the brain, without the strong desire to change it. The meatball machine is like a story, because it is in high blood flow to blood and gore. Thank you for the Japanese film! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm in my dreams at the end of the week A tongue can come out of the telephone. This time (on 31st) my dream was delightfully inspiring. <br /> <br /> In this picture, human bodies are hosted by the aliens, whose sole purpose is not to fill the never ending curls for human flesh and blood. Humans eat meat eating cyborgs !!! There is more !!! Fight the scene !! Great song !! Great point-of-view shot! Fancy played by the female Cyborg (less good than her male opponent). The war seen in the end is worth ten or even ten times. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I forgot to mention it a love story! Wow, I hate the story of love but this cake! <br /> <br /> I can not wait to see this picture, just once to see their facial reactions. Sadly, I took the time to write this review because I was afraid that most friends and family could not understand the meatball machine. Verily America is not fully prepared for the Metabol machine. Finally, my wife finally saw the scene of the climatic war and she was speechless. Normally he said something like, "Why are you seeing that junk?" This time he was saying nothing. I was happy! <br /> <br /> This is not junk. It's just SPLATTER (Splatter for Splatter is also great). This is my friend of art. <br /> <br /> <br /> Chacho
