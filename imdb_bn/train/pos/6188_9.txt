Vanities are performed on an unknown audience, on its opening night, when a murder investigation goes back to the stage. The strange combination of musical and murder mysteries is a costly look for its cast, its production numbers, and the perfect innovation of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wicked actress intended to stop marrying Gertrude Michael, starred in the show's star, Kitty Carlisle and Carl Bryson, as well as the infamous "Sweet Marriage" (which was also the album of the 70's Bate Miller album). So when the chorus girls roam around behind, the stupid detective Victor McLaughlin leaned towards the girls, when she tried to solve the murder of an unknown woman behind the murderer. <br /> <br /> We quickly know that Maid (Dorothy Stikny) loves Brisons far away, the Woman of the Rise (Jesse Ralph) Brisson's mother, and the Stage Manager (Jack Okee) bits everything. Plots twists in plenty of musical numbers. The show's best known song "Cocktail for two." Kitty Carlisle, this hunting song "Where do they come from?" And there is a strange chaos that exploded in the number of a Harlem specialty featuring Dark Elington! Pretty cast <br /> <br /> Here are some cool acting, especially Gertrude Michael and Dorothy Stickney. Kitty Carlisle is good as well. Brisson though total gross. <br /> <br /> Playing Charles Middleton Homer, Toby Wing Nancy, Donald Make Doctor Doctor, and see if the girls can spot the ball between Anne Sheridan and Lucile.
