A good film (especially two Leads) with strong performance. This movie has detained eight American girls with a 6 kilo heroin at an airport in Thailand. They were both jailed and one of them confessed to the confession. Bill Palman strives to find those lawyers who try to find them. All they have to do is Nick Parks who keep drugs in a bag of two girls. So far for the story that is not real (it is very similar to the good return of Paradise). <br /> <br /> The beautiful photography of Newton and Thomas Siegel is valuable to watch this movie. 7 out of 10
