Tea Leononi Nora Wilde, playing through a serious divorce, plays a serious photographer. He wants his freedom but it comes at a cost. He wants to do legitimate photography but is hired to work for tabloids as a misdemeanor. Her boss is wonderful and played by divine Holland Taylor. The show was well written on most of the time. T's Nora started to develop in a remarkable character, but the network did not support comedy only, and they still did not do it. Even when they bring George Wendt from the cheers, they make unnecessary changes in casting and characters. The program was fine at the beginning and it was being used by the audience, but then the network closed it like bad plastic surgery.
