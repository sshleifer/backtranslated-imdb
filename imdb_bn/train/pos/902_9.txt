I thought this movie was really true because in today's Indian film you will see skin, music and bad acting ... In this film you can see some heritage, ethnicity and at least some modesty ... although some parts were a little dramatic, guess what? This is Indian movie! After watching this movie, at least you loud music, or any violence, it does not just get headache from the truth, it teaches love and certainly takes care of your whole life ... I think it was an amazing movie. Children can see it without any doubt and enjoy the availability of adults which is used as a guaranteed depth of India ... Sana this whole rap hits, miniskartasa and skin showing a part of it.
