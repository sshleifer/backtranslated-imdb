At first I do not think Ben Affleck could really pull a funny Christmas movie, the boy was wrong, my daughter invited me to see with this and I was not frustrated. James Gandolfini was funny, I really liked Christina Appelagate, and Kathryn and 'Hara was very good, what the story really sold me, I mean, say ,,,,,,,,,,,,, but probably once or twice a year, and probably Take anyway, you really need a lot of wine, because the system can stand up to dealing with Christmas, so I thought that primais was good. The family of 2,50000 dollars was a little far away, but it continued to do a good job for me, because it was a riot that shows the struggle of different families. It has a lot of fun moments, including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a sport boy. All this will look again if I like the movie and next Christmas again or like my daughter too.
