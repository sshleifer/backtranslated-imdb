I think this movie has received fewer ratings because it has been judged by its worst moments. There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nuts-scratching scene, but there are several moments that make me laugh loudly. Jason Lee is performing some extraordinary comic comedy in this movie and Julia Styles herself has been very funny to play. Besides, this movie behaves like most romantic comedies, after about 40 minutes you know how you are going to finish it. (Which is the best of them, where you already know +/- 5 minutes later). However, look good movies but definitely the worst choice ... cheers
