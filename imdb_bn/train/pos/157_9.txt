"Jesper" (2005) together with "Yella" (2007), and "Jericho" (2008), director Christian Petzold's Gaspenster-Trilogy, no doubt that creme-de-la-creme German film director <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, never seen Then, when the age of the current age is for women, with the help of timely photography, whenever the soil is likely to travel to Berlin during the probability and search. When we heard the movie later, the mother had long been convinced that she got her daughter's dead. However, this time, when he showed Nina, everything became different. <br /> <br /> Without resolving the film, it is frustrating rather than solving solutions. If we are still alive or not the actual girl, we are not equipped to determine if the mother is really mad. The most frustrating end. After what we saw in the film, it is a ban for the audience that he left alone alone. Simple walking is the symbol that has changed nothing, it can be a powerful influence of dramatism (f.ex. in "Umberto de"), but "Gespenster", it is deported. <br /> <br /> I have highlighted Freudian's motives in this film from critics, let me give my own efforts: why do not the same kind of people know each other, especially not those who know the same person? It is an insane question, agreeing, from the perspective of Aristotelian reasoning, which holds the ideas of a person. The person is a person who does not share his defined characteristics with anyone else. So, in my question Aristotlean's answer is: They do not know each other because their similarities are by pure change. Everyone who is not insane believes in everyone. However, if these same people share other similarities, what can happen in this case, which may be rarely by change, e.g. Under their right shoulder blade is a heart-shaped birthday on their left or scarfs under the ankle? The intermediary interface of creating this movie is, though I'm not sure whether the director has also realized it. In spite of our modern, Aristotelian world, it is protected in mythological stories from all over the world, that same person will also share their personality, and therefore the personality is somewhat uncertain, but not changed, in order to open borders among people, such as beliefs and beliefs, in spite of strongly reasonable thoughts - most interesting The kind of Gespenster is an illogical one despite the source Trust the creation of strong backgrounds.
