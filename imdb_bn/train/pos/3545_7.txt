Broadway Music Big Splash Film. Nathan (Frank Sinatra) loves playing place roll and illegal play. Blonde loving Adilaid (Vivian Blen) gives her craps if she wants to marry him. Sky Masters (Marlon Brando!), Who grew up, decided to make a last game in the city. He told Skye that he could not go to Havana with the mission activist Sarah Brown (Gene Simmons). It may sound like a strange plot summary, but the film too! <br /> <br /> This is a real mixed bag - here are some extraordinary things. The songs are all good and incredible dance. The real show is at the end of the holiday at the end of the game. Brando is also very good here - it may seem strange to sing and dance, but he closes it. I met big, confused Brando was so much fun pulling off some tough dance patch! Also Sinatra is quite good and Blen is just as wonderful as her long-lasting girlfriend. Significant highlights of his songs and dance numbers here. <br /> <br /> Now for the bad parts - Gene Simmons is a wonderful actress but she's stuck in a shameless colorless role and can not do much with it. The movie is too long in the 150 minute - the drag and drop scenes should really be seen in Brando and Simmons. Also most of the letters speak very specific English - contraction is never used. Maybe it's trying to make fun of gangsters, but I got it jerking and it has pulled me out of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is worth grabbing for songs and dancing but you can get it after a while. I give it a 7.
