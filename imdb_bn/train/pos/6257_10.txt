This documentary by Marie Cooper is absolutely amazing. I saw this tonight at the Toner Classic Movie Channel. I would see if I can order a copy of the DVD. The footage of the film does not appear to be obscure and sticky, which may seem like 1925 B and W. silent film. Set in 1925 in Iran, terrified tribes in the documentary left their desert house and crossed a warm river, men, women, children, animals ... then passed all the bayfuts over a snowy mountain. It is sink or swim and climb or die. Find grass for their animals. They have cows, goats, dogs, horses and mules. In one scene a man carries a mule that is very sick to climb up the hill. Documentary children are all happy and healthy appearance. They had such a difficult life. I wonder if the horror tribes of Iran are still living this way. Makes you appreciate the modern life in the United States.
