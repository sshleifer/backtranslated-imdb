I just saw this movie in Santa Barbara. My friend knew anyone who worked on it, so I thought it was like I checked out. I think it was really a beautiful film and can not wait to look again. Actors were really good and I loved all the music! There were not many conversations in the movie, which initially felt a bit weird - but once I got into it, I thought the story and acting was really emotional and meaningful and it seemed that it had done a lot for imagination. I want to see the film again because there are so many things that I forgot a lot of small things, but know that I did not think of this movie, I left the theater. It was shot nicely and the whole thing was really unique.
