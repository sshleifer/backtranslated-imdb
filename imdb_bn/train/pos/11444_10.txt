Watch this movie for an excellent picture of Andy Goldsworthy's sculpture and consider yourself completely open and comfortable. Music is perfectly footage footage, but does not draw attention to itself. Some commentators have called the snippet of interview with a weak spot, but consider this: Why would you extend it to a movie, if you can read Andy's songs at the length of his book, or join his excellent lectures? This medium is more suitable for showing the harmful nature of the artist's work, and is used efficiently in this regard.
