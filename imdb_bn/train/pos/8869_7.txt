In this small picture we have some great characters but a very shallow plot. It's really nice, because Schnalton did a great job in presenting confidential conflicts and interpersonal relations. It forgets the obscure reality of the audience that the film is supposed to be. In fact, what we have here is all possible clich√©s and stereotypes placed in celluloid at higher rates than soaps. Of course there is not a deep movie (even if it wants to be), but better than average college movies.
