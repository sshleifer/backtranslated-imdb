We often watch movies about the unreasonable things in politics, but I still recommend "City Hall". He was born to play the role, as a mayor of Al Pascino New York, a boy had to cope with shooting. But it turns out that he has nothing that really nothing impacts. In this movie, the characters are great, as we would expect someone who is involved in the political scandal. Why do not you believe any politician, you may have doubts after seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can not mention the name of a specific example like this film, but not the point. If we have an ideological impression on top, then this film tears the idea. One of the obvious things that I encourage you to see. Also starring John Cusack, Bridget Phunda, Danny Aylow, Anthony Francesisa, and David Parma.
