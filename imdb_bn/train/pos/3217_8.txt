Cart Russell is so trustworthy and closes the process in such a way that it can think later that the important themes of goodness were [the passing of newborn fear, learning to rise above the primary conditioner, the power of love and friendship, etc.). This is very rare for a 'man's action flick', even I [liked the most A / A violent pop] liked the movie and I know it is recommended to every person ... it is shameful because it's done by authorities One of the biggest action-adventure box office hits should have been - it's all about without some credibility or almost non-stop action The moments may lose. I'm not frustrated that being a hit means that adults did not see it. Anyone under the age of 20 has not only seen more violent activities in their video games, but it's probably not about multi-layered, multi-themed beauty or is not concerned about it. This movie can convert someone who can avoid A / A as the absurd violence. If a person takes his lady [or it shows it in rented or wire list] to see the film, he may accompany her as she goes to other activities.
