Snobs and pseudo-experts find it a problem in connection with this masterpiece who enjoys a serious lack of solitude that "many tears from the best of De Sica". De Sica speaks a very direct way. Modern Italian filmmakers of his Italian, or Pietro Germi's bitter self-parody, Mario Monicelli's deviation, Visconti's gravity or Antonioni's cold observation are confident. De Sica told us a story like a father sitting on the kids' bed before we went to bed. There is no effort to make intellectuals. Combined at Miracolo and low degree Il Giudizio Universale realistic fairy tales, or today we call magic realism. A gem and Tito from the beginning of the movie to the beginning of a character that you take with an open heart but naturally must have your heart. The movie is its pure form. Great.
