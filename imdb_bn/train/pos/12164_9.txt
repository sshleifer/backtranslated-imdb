A film born from Charlie Kaufman's own selfishness, a movie that was quite hard to see, but almost three times the most important ugly kid, like "Snyndachhe, New York". The "frownland" crew, the love of the actor and the filmmaker's love, has been shot by friends for years. It marks a person who can not completely communicate through the real true world of Brooklyn. The person you see is a "mammalco" movement style even a step. They are real people, painfully trapped in their own spontaneous neuroscience, unable to change, unable. The real world is their own set of confusion and because it is a film that is beyond human being so sensitive, it is very difficult to see. It is the perfect light, money or any other reason to make a 16 mm film, which will "make a copy" of a film, but its integrity can not be separated, it is a house that should dismiss it and give it a reward for the linkage to Richard, such as SXSW Did not. It reminds of movies like "nude" or "mumbler" This is a film that is not for everyone, but it challenges you who look at you and challenge you to be prolonged on you.
