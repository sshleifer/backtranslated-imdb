Take a tour with The Devil, such as Ang Lee's next Brokeback Mountain, a movie of aesthetic and historical significance. Its artistic nuance is worth understanding as film lovers dare to see it at least twice. <br /> <br /> Wonderful depth of humanity is the perfect part of the industry. I do not really think of another war film, so you will capture, change your existing concept of history and politics, restore your belief in humanity. Seeing many killings, after many hardships, you do not feel silent yourself, instead you give more importance to the relationship between people. Actor 'performance haunt your heart, music moves your mind. Some shoots, not just some pictures, they cross themselves, get a glimpse of the soul. This type of film is actually a section of art. <br /> <br /> Such a movie does not require long comments or reviews, which it says itself by itself. Toby Maguire, Jeffrey Wright and Jewel Killer, film painter and beautiful and lyricist, what a achievement!
