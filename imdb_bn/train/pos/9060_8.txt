Today my 8-year-old has seen this. I thought it was nice. I agree with another poster that there was nothing like the one that could remember the book, but we still enjoy it. All of the kids are pretty beautiful and all pretty beautiful. Billy is a new child who gets courage to eat 10 worms a day by school phobia. If he loses, he will have to walk down the hall in his school with a worm in his pants. At the beginning of the movie it is seen that bills often have very poor stomach and ponds. Hilarity insects ensues with a bunch of different ways to cook. Bullies and of course, the good message about standing up to the teeth are happy.
