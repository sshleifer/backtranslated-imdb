I'm not aware of any comic book (or graphic novel I really do not know), but hearing about the agent / hero movie, I must admit, I'm quite different, from what I actually got from < br /> <br /> <br /> It was surprising to see at first, but it was nice to see this step along. You never really could tell where you go (some twists were already available, but in general, you can never say it will end). Cast starring from lead actors and really good support is more than star performance, this is an enjoyable watch. Not as packed as hoped for hopes or hopes for something like a movie, but a really good mix.
