This film shows a kind of sensual work for each movie. Barbara Bain and Donald Sutherland (who plays husbands and wives) discusses "family business", such as a grocery store or dry cleaners. Messi, Campbell, Woolman and Rater are also excellent. They play with each other as members of a top-dramatic throttle troop, who realize that a quality product requires each actor to support others unselfishly. And finally, there's Sammy (David Durfman). What a wonderful performance from a child ... and what is unusual about Uleman, whose son he plays! <br /> <br /> We're treating a unique story on "Panic" and this is a rarely tired formula shit this day. The dialogue is sharp and smart, and this relatively short film has the ability to express full range of emotions from viewers. There are places to laugh, to be frustrated, to suffer, to awaken, to be angry and to have love. This is not a movie that jumps you for joy, but when it's over, you're more than happy to know that you've seen a good job of last 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Go to more theaters in us if we are treated as good quality fare. When will the power of Hollywood wake up? This is a real shame, when some good festivals and failing to get exposure outside lucky families of the house.
