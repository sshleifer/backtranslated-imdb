Main speaker !! To see this movie, who is watching this movie !! The critics of the film touched the main theme of "Honor" and compared a lot to "Brahheart". I will highlight a few things about this movie that I have not seen other comments by touching: <br /> <br /> This movie has decided to abort. The first character to be pregnant is the villain (chariot) girlfriend, and when she suggests a cold abortion, she said that it is too late for it. Shame in her condition ("I have a pain in the pause.") Later she managed to commit suicide several times later. The second character to find her pregnant is Mary, the wife of Rob, after rape (and at least one sexual scene with her husband) after rape. Rob going for the final clash with Roth, finally, in the movie, Mary asked what to do with the vowel of abortion, during her pregnancy during a suspected source. Rob responded in a noble voice, "It is not a child's fault" and then he thinks he should be a name, a girl, or a boy. I think this "pro-life" view is very non-Hollywood in Hero's part. Rob is walking around from the dark of his home to this commentary on the outside - not a joke. <br /> <br /> Another related theme is that the character of Roth is frustrating, some do not know who his father was, and there are some types of words for his mother, although he wears a picture of him in a case hanging from his throat. Is it logical that the chariot (excluding family stability) is a definition of a cycloped walk, and Rob is a powerful husband / father figure and of course the protagonist. The battle between Rob and Villain (chariot) in the final sword, deeply on the chest, on the left side - on the left side of the chest, in the heart. The character of his employer and pseudo-paternal character (John Hurt) puts the image of his head and puts it in the gaza before hijacking it from the body of the street. <br /> <br /> I also found interesting that the scene of rape was not quite a graphic, but it was not close to the camera. Mary is a little surprised to see the characteristics of some people going through the stereotype and the terrifying stress of the next post (as we say it now). My point is that the rape was not excited, not just meant to be, that I could find an interesting middle road for Hollywood. <br /> <br /> In the event of the final battle, I must correct the previous commenter: the weapon was a rapier (or perhaps a small sword), chosen by the chariot, was a Claymore selected weapon rob. Nobody really doing this in their homework in full view. The chariot will be at the top of this position, but it is obviously a spot in the classroom, the Scottish arms. More interesting to me (after studying something about a fan and the subject) that this final sword war is one of the most strong beliefs of any film: Actors are actually trying to kill each other - - We are mostly opposing the movie shoots Do not have a normal slash to see the blade. Even more true than history, Roth is used as a rape weapon several times, which is its purpose by design! (The capacitors were flammable, but a sharp weapon with the ends used to parody an opponent's arm.) Rob Broad Slash uses it as a design purpose. I go down fighting as it expects - the chariot win effectively. Although Rob Roth occupies the weapon (more symbolism) and wins him with a powerful slashing cut and wins the day. <br /> <br /> People are eager to see the historical accuracy of this level in the war of the sword of the film. <<br /> <br /> I also think that, for any reason, I remember 1995 (release year) as the time of the government's disbelief. With the release of both "Rob Roy" and "Brevevert", Hollywood has clearly met it and I think the anti-government conflict is why both films compare so much. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is encouraging movie fans from different perspectives, not tired of the same age, hidden messages from Hollywood.
