I have not seen this picture in years, so my knowledge is a little harmful. I think this picture is the picture of the double bravery. It only has more realistic and more credible characters. Ravi Ray thinks Rab Roy thinks that Rob Roy looks like a simple dress, dirty hair and beard. Also Liam Neson has a Celtic look about her, She looks like a Scott and looks more like Rob Roy. This is a comparison that stimulates some people, but Mel Gibson compares to William Wallace. Gibson thinks that a legend, who described the legend as a 6 foot 7 giant, though Gibson was almost a foot short. The story contains a little romance, conspiracy and a sabotage story. Some words like brahhart? But instead of filming "freedom," a cry of nationalism and independence, we get a movie that is called honor, love and justice. It makes a more interesting movie. Many like Gladiator. Cast Fantastic and Liam Nesson are a very strong leader in this endeavor. Great about how the story deals with heroism and humanity. Mary was raped and with the face of true Scottish power she went out of the burning house, then she washed the pannies from her crotch to the extreme pane. Brahherart's heroine will not do this work. Overall it is a stunning and almost flawless watch. Go and see!
