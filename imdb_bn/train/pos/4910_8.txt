This crackles with very good movie excitement. Of course, the parties will be superior - police and wink, public health doctors, criminals who arrest criminals who do not know that they are carrying plugs before full graduation? But the little intrigues elements give a breathtaking introduction between each scene - between Badminton and Police Captain, among the bad performances by Palenas and MÃ¶stel, between Pauline and a deadly plague-deadly man in which Paul believes in error is a matter of manhunt. The underlying question about whether Wimbarks and his wife smuggled some valuable items, and provided information about public dangers, or concealed the situation, or served the public well to avoid the full graduation panic. The image is shot nicely by Czon, which takes a long shot on the position of the beautifully danced New Orleans, and it ends in a stunning measure where the slant escapes like a mouse from its followers, through the city dock and warehouse. The commentary is fantastic, perhaps what I've heard is a insightful seminar on cinematography, photography and shots, production designs, castings and parallel plates of non-professional artists on small land and platinum, good film techniques and movies silent in the 1950s. Watch it to enjoy the movie at once, and if you are interested in making a movie, then to learn the second time with the speech.
