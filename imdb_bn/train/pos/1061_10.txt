All the acting of the first season has really been amazing. Max and Jach's first appearance is through Geneva Lock and Chris Lodger, or I'd like to call their moments. Minis are the best performing act that I've ever seen kids Major actors and actresses such as Jessica Ala Michael Weather, etc., have forgotten that you are a fictional t.v. Watching. They seem to make this show alive. All this is the best show I've ever seen
