I'm a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw it playing in the movie, I could not help myself. I wanted to see how Allen would look like his great film match point, because it was one of his most recent films, G.B. (Which is unique in Allen's work) thinks his new music scarlet Johansson. Scoop MP's much lighter and humorous scoop's most enjoyable aspect. The plot revolves around Johanston's character (journalism student), who gets a hot story from outside the grave. She falls in love with a suspected serial killer (Jackman) and she must determine whether she must find the truth. Oh and all this is done with an explosive magician turned detective played by Allen. <br /> <br /> I must say that I enjoyed Johannes's performance perfectly but I leaned slightly, I could see three hours, with Jahnson the film always remain framed and enchanted. He is a variation in the character of Allen's Stereototypical Neurosis Stryton character, playing a ditsy, Yappy, bumbling sweetheart game. She adds appropriate body language for comic effect. It does not seem to anyone who thinks that Johansen's character appears to be uncomfortably beautiful and it's a plus. <br /> <br /> Allen Allen ... He is still playing the same character as Chaplin and his Little Tramp character. However, something happened in this film which I can see again in the neurotics little hypocentric. He is not in his next film custard and is spending more time behind the camera ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > I can not say that Jackman is doing something especially to create his role but he is not less than his character. <br /> <br /> I can not help on the terms of the plot but it seems to be fresh ... it actually stinks of Z Scorpio Curse. Johansson and Allen are some more intriguing-like But Allen must be congratulated for his completion because it is even more clever than the ordinary Hollywood version of your film. Instead of black and white things, gray colors are drawn. Being completely innocent is nothing to do with it and there is no illogical crime. Although the plot seemed old, Woody still has a knack for a fishing. I thought his last picture was interesting ... Come on for a laugh, smile and be glad. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Allen's work, keep an eye on it. If I do not see anything ...
