An excellent example of the Man of the Castle pre-code. It really involves realistic phenomena with usable and imperfect characters. Spencer plays Trecie Bill, free soul without dime in his pocket. When he is doing a living strange job and traveling to a new city, he gets bored around him. One night, he met a beauty trina, by cold and alone by any standard. He has refused to adopt prostitution, so he has not played for several days, but two of them love each other and build a relationship. His free spirit rebukes him for leaving him, so life is rocky, but there is a real spark between them, even if they are bound to the river. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The silver screen. Its characters are amazing and related. We can see his thoughts in his thoughts, easily identify him, even if we believe he is behaving badly. Young pre-code film is great. Since its character is very sweet but much better, making all its favorites. <br /> <br /> pre-code elements include dipping skinny, pregnancy before marriage, and crime.
