Victor McLaughlin's performance is the best in film history. <br /> <br /> I think we all can think of "zipo" because we struggled with all and what was not wrong. This is one of the first art-house photos released by a large American film studio (RKO Radio Pictures). <br /> <br /> Joseph H. August's cinematography is very good here. However, the stunning parts of August are mostly ignored; He is not eligible for the Oscar nomination properly. <br /> <br /> This is a psychological drama, thought, philosophy, sadness, understood as little as possible.
