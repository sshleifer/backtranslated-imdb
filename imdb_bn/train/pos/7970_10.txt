This movie is definitely my top 10 darling list. Voice for animals is amazing. Sally Field and Michael J. Both Fox Sasie Fairy and young are both inexperienced as brilliant, but the original standout is Don Ambec as the old, trusted golden proprietor. This movie is a great family movie because it can be appreciated and liked by children and adults. Ridiculous and suspenseful, and every animal lover is sure to cry! (The cry of happiness!)
