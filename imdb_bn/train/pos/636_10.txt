Why is such a great preview for a movie so blah !! Everyone will know what it is a wonderful movie. It's one, original, and engaging from the moment of good acting and fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Robert DeNiro is violent. Relatively new comer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes are always as pretty. Michelle Pfiefer is quite splash with his recent back on the screen. There are even many wonderful moments from even the smallest letters!
