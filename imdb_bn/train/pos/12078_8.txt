My name is Julia Ross Joseph H. Lewis's 1945 B thriller, which is one of the best directors of Hollywood silent films. This 65-minute Gothic curiosity in Colombia came after Louise's long training with the String of the Poverty Line, the East Side Kid's Humor, the Awful Meldramas (with incredible seamless Lugosi Shawk with the invisible ghost), and standard studio B products. Secrets of a CO-ED, bombs across barma, Falcon in San Francisco etc) - all of which were beautifully set up for the coming of the highly talented and inventive Mr. Luis. My name is Julia Rose (as well as the next year from Tory Dark Dark) who played a director with rare and fine art that does not say quickly and efficiently in the delivery and fine industry's most common budget. Later on, such as Lewis Productions, the song Cragee (1949) and The Big Combo (1955), despite the broad scope of their narrative structure, rely on impressive, transparent camera work and functional low-key lighting. And very modest resources. <br /> <br /> My name is Julia Ross, probably the tradition of British mystery (it is set in a studio-bound England) is more than the silence and traditional trappings of traditional movies. A young woman (Nina Folk) agrees to take place at an elderly woman's (Dame My Witch) home. Two days after his arrival, he woke up in a completely weird house and mysteriously enough, a new new identity --- the daughter of an old woman. He said that he has been a nervous breakdown victim, he struggles to understand the utterly and unexpected disappointing nature of his accident. But long ago, he began to combine strange and troubled truth behind this dark mystery, that his "husband" (always catastrophic George McCurdy) probably murdered his real wife and was convicted of losing and participating in a terrible plan. Otherwise this is the difference between modest stories otherwise, Lewis is one of the toughest touches that can be produced by filmmakers as its true serious effort.
