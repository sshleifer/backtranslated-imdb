Well documented by previous posters, Rockstar's real star: InXS - and actually its sequel, Rockstar: Supernova - Paul Mircoovich, Rafael Morrea, Jim McGorman, Nat Morton and Sasha Krevtsov. They do not know who? They have a great, tight, rockin 'house band whose musical intelligence and talent make this shot more than a sad American Idol clone. <br /> <br /> Remember the "night"? I saw it that there was musical precision and perfection. Sunny McNeil's epic presentation of Queen's 'Bohemian Resposi', a memorable cover of 'Taylor's Stones' You Can not Live ... ..., JD Fortune sings "Suspicious Minds". Here the general index is an extraordinary house band. Since <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As the INXS was their main head, they sadly shadowed their previous shades, although JD's live performance breathed a bit in their music, this event was all about Habee. <br /> <br /> The producers' memo: season three (if we are grateful enough to happen) should be Rockstar: House Band. These boys get a good lead singer and they are going in space.
