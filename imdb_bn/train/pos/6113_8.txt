After seeing "Marying Mafia", I lost almost my faith in the Korean film business. But this one brought back my faith. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> She is actually the female character's age. Through some ridiculous quarrells, these two end up being great friends. <br /> <br /> I am glad that the new advance did his job with Kaawan sang Woo Excellency. He was such a revelation !! Actress Kim Haque Null was also charming as usual. <br /> <br /> This film usually worked hard to avoid clips that can be seen in romantic comedy. And it did not show us any unnecessary naked, sex scenes. It's bright, lovely, fresh, I want to see it again. <br /> <br />
