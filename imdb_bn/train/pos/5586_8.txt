I saw "Extensions" for the first time and my first commentary is that of the VHS, which is only 75 minutes in length, and it seems that the film is used in various reels, compared to the VHS terrible quality of Brazil's distributed video network. Some parts completely damaged, and the other part is very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the pictures obtained by Brazilian viewers, if it could find this rare VHS for rent or sale. The film is indeed a silent movie, the story is very dated and there are only a few lines. As a result, the letters are improving badly. However, this movie is very brave, with current exposure to beauty of honey Lamar beautiful nip and nude fat body. Another interesting point is the use of poetic and metaphorical flowers, which symbolizes the relationship between Eva and her lover. The way the director managed to show views of Eva's needs and personalities is very clear. The non-final finale for the 1933 film is very unusual. I liked this movie, but I hope to get a chance to see the 87-minute recovery version. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "xtxtase" ("Exstice")
