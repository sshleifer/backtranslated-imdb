I think I usually communicate with the Film Festival Comedy about low expectations that they will always be "playful" and any funny comedy will be made based on the simplicity of the characters in complex complexity. What was exceptional about the Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in the film and after the scene, he found a laughing smile in the scene. There was a sophistication, perhaps in part on DP's intense work, I have rarely seen in an indie film, even rarely seen in comrades. Here's the special note: Maggie's teacher Emmy as well as Peggy Brucher's turn. After seeing this performance, I did not understand why Bruister was not "discovered" by the larger audience. He comes with the necessary mix of anger and preference in the role that helps the film reach its potential. It's a terrific job worthy of a big audience. I'm looking forward to the director and more from this cast!
