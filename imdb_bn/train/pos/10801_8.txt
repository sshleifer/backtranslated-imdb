Verily, when I saw this movie years ago I immediately wanted to stop it. I sat there for 10 minutes or more, I realized that actors Naveen stole this event. His facial expression and humorous inconsistency shook me with my head Why did not he have more humor? His "Marty Feldman" thing is going for him but there is nothing more than a genius ... Marty. The film really did see me close to Zarac, but then it was much more. I really believe that if this film was released first, and I saw Steve Martin II, then I think the second was a cheap rip-off. I know it sounds like a BOLD statement, but it's true. I actually like Steve Martin a great deal, but his performance is an actor in The Jerk. I'd like to get a copy of it for my collection. If you can find it, I want to see it.
