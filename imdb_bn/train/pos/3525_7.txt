Man, this is a hard DVD come by. I can only find it in Spanish, import in Spanish, and it was expensive. <br /> <br /> Was it valuable? Yes right Although curated by Cydad Mack (IMDb.com's credits are managed by "Robert", but the DVD's Credit List Cart), it is not an excellent creation of filmmaking, because it contains some familiar statistics about the mystery of another murder - Alice Cook, Jr., and Thomas Gomez - but my film The decade-long curiosity has finally been satisfied. <br /> <br /> A respected but self-appointed engineer (Alan Curtis) has stood up and married his wife and found himself in New York Bar with two show tickets in his pocket. A woman with an odd cap is anal beside her and she humbly invites her to join the musical review. He took a little gently. Mopi Bartender gives them both eyes by leaving them. <br /> <br /> Notice that this lady in the stormy winds is wearing the same hat and exploded offstage with anger. The band, drums in drum, leers at silent lady but gets no response. Curtis takes the woman to her house and asks her name but she will not give it, and she does not want to tell her. If he was a longfellow fan, he would say something about the ships that were sent at night. <br /> <br /> All right, Curtis went home to find out that he was killed in his absence. Chief police officer, Gomes, Dr. His only alibi he was with a lady lady who does not think of anyone else - not a bartender, not a Latin star, not a cab driver ("Al Alp"), not even of drummer - and disappeared from the woman himself, it is It is impossible to dig up. <br /> <br /> Curtis has been convicted and sentenced to death. But Inspector Gomez has thought about the issues and probably decided his innocence because no one in the brain would make such a stupid story. He officially joined Curtis's loving secretary, Ela Reyns, in the re-investigation of the case. <br /> <br /> They again visited the supposed witnesses. The evil Bartender is probably driven by a car, perhaps accidentally, so he's out of the picture. Hot-tempered Latina is gone because the program has been closed and she is unaware and unknowable since the source of the hat. Elisha Cook, Jr., is terrified by the actual murderer but before he featured a scene where an improvised jazz group pounds drums. His sweaty face estimates an expression which intense focus but does offer a monstrous, orgasmic madness. His eyes roll on the roof, gapes his mouth, his hammering becomes frenzied. I laugh loudly <br /> <br /> Someone's performance is otherwise outstanding, but everyone is professional enough. Thomas Gomes is always reliable. The best performance, though, is probably by Franchot Tone. He is a real murderer and he fakes his alibi. She is reserved and artistic. Even when she is decorated, she is handsome. I do not know how to put this precisely, but the tone seems to think just as it played in its part. As a clean engineer, Alan Curtis is at Kevin Scale, near zero and in a B movie. <br /> <br /> I do not know why it is considered as classic. It's not really as basic as its other, by mystery kill mystery Kernel Woolrich. But Sydmak's direction is sensitive. A man gets on the wind and winds in a gutter with water running around his hat. His use of shadows is quietly effective. <br /> <br /> Glad I got it.
