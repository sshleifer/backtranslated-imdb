Small Spaulards <br /> <br /> Alison Parker (Cristina Rains) is a successful top model who lives with lawyer Michael Lurman (Chris Sarden) in the apartment. He tried suicide in the past: for the first time, when he was a teenager and deceived his mother with two children of his father and then Michael's wife died. Since then, he left behind Christ and Catholic Church. Ellison wants to be alone in her apartment and with the help of real state agent Miss Logan (Awa Gardner), she finds a wonderful decorated old apartment in Brooklyn Heights for reasonable rent. He saw a strange man in the window on the floor of the building and Miss Logan said that he was Father Francis Matthew Hallran (John Caradine), a dark pastor who was only a supporter of the Catholic Church. Alison went to her new place, and once she got a visitor: her neighbor Charles Chaezen (Burgess Meridith) welcomed her and introduced her to new neighbors. Then, he invited Elijah to his cat Ezbell's birthday night. The next day, EliZone would be doing strange things in his apartment and with his health. Alison sees Miss Logan and says he is alone with the priest of the academy. Another investigation shows that the person he knew was a dead criminal Faced with the situation, Alison again hugs Christ, when Michael investigates strange phenomena. Allison realized that he was living in hell's gateway. <br /> <br /> While IMDb is included in the user rating, 'The Sentinel' is one of the best horror films ever. In the movie theater for the first time in the 70's, I saw this movie at least six times. On September 07, 2002, I bought this imported DVD and saw it again. Yesterday I saw this movie once. Even after many years, this picture is still awesome Surprisingly and the story of the Luradha is scared even in the present day. Cast they stars stars and starlets. You can see many actresses and actresses, who became famous in the beginning of the career. Supporters of the horror film must worship 'Sentinel' and I'm one of them. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'A Sentinel Dos Malditos' ('The Sentinel of Demand') <br /> <br /> Observer: 02 September 2007, I I saw this movie again.
