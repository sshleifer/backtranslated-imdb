"Dick Tracy" is one of our family's favorites - the actor is superb - the direction of the industry is exceptional - the music is magic. This is not supposed to be "killing Markingbird" - it's a fun experience. <br /> <br /> The songs of Stephen Sandimim are: "back in business" energetic, "hear or after" OK, "you can lose" Hunting - even the sounds like "live alone and like it" <br / <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />> Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Tropper, Charlie Coursmo, Mandy Pattinkin, James Kane, Dick Van Dyke, Villeen Supporting. .. the list is too long. And, yes - even Madonna and Warren BT are excellent. Written by laughing in a minute (many times we saw each other and said, "Wait a minute - I think - it's gone!") However, the only thing to say about this movie is that everyone seems to be having a good time while engaging - and the above which adds to the enjoyment for the audience. So, if you have not already done so, why not give a chance to "Dick Tracy" - for this take it - a Sunday comic strip life has been brought - and in a great way !!
