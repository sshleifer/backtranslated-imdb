This is a great game! Well maybe it was not some of its features, but it was the digital anvil still brought a good game. There is a definite match with Elite (you can trade, withdraw arms and stop the destroyed ships, go to missions) but this game is a huge scripted mission. This is a great mission. Control system is different than it uses the mouse! You basically fly a spaceship around a system and work your way! The game has some pretty good graphics, it was created even in 2003. It should even run on a decently fixed PC. This story contains some great voices from John Rice Davis, George Taki, Jennifer Hell (he's present in every computer game). The story looks good and gets better as it continues. There is also a race section where you and the opponent must definitely run your spaceships (you're going to give them rings). This section took a while to beat me. It adds a variety of games. Some sections here and there are a little hard but overall you can beat this game. Game Net has an active mod scene. Pick up some mods to extend the game. I have not played any of the mods yet. <br /> <br /> Sadly this one was canceled, shame!
