This is often seen over the years and we can see that they are actually big stars. As a French film critic, whose name escapes from me, he said: "There is no garbo, there is no diarrhea, only louis brooks"; And there, thank you sky! Louise Brooks! This is the third of its European masterpieces. But to follow a script written by the famous French clear, it was also an exceptional movie, not to be the first French Tuckie, to finish the end of the sentence (which was the command) and Edith Piaaf to include his voice! Works so much talent in a movie, how can it be the best creation? And that's what this film is about. Shame Brooks is on the shoulder of Hollywood, when he returns to the state - so much talent is so deliberate proud! It is very good to see the pictures of Paris as well as Paris in the film. I heard the small voice of 1930 and Piaf. I did not get tired of this film!
