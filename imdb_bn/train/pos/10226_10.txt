I saw this movie almost 7 years ago. It was not so special, but after a few years I saw it again and at the time it's fun, many things :) <br /> <br /> I think the best parts of the film are: the body language of the pilgrim and 'special effects'. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie do not wait for a Hollywood blockbuster, even this movie was made almost. 1000 dollars :) <br /> <br /> I got a copy of it. Movie and video versions (but I do not think it has ever been shown in the film) <br /> <br /> Watch it, enjoy it!
