I recently saw the Murder in the new published universal pre-code set vansities and I finally enjoyed the end of the car. Most other commentators have covered the story of a murder in a musical instrument, but I wanted to add a few extra notes. Bryson and Carlisle are less happy than even younger players, and do not think the exact word for a song song (low-paid opera singer, Carlisle Bryson, has some high and somewhat hugged him). Great Victor McLaglen and Jack Okey play well with each other, knowingly is a wonderful idea that keeps the ball rolling in the musical numbers. Yes, Lucele Ball and Anne Sheridan Vanity Girls, but do not forget the fantastic jazz singer Ernestine Anderson on the number of "Ebony Disorder". Gayle Patrick makes one of his early appearances, sounds like Eve, Eden; Patrick Perry Mason will be the TV producer of the TV series. Then Jesse is in the role of Ralph's clothing - you can find him as David Copperfield (as Annie Pegotti) and Bank Dike. Music is very good - Bryson introduces two different visual values ​​"Cocktail for Two"; "Sweet Marihuana" with barely clad Peyote button girls in the background (a chorine's white leather blood vampire was a wonderful cooler); Dook Ellington's orchestra and "black colored", mix "ebony raspsy," with beautiful black dancers. And I believe this is one of the only original musical instruments - and the clothes do not leave anything for imagination.
