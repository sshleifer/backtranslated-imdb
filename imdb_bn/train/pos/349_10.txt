Call me a fool, but I absolutely love Valentine's horror movie of 2001. It was very good, well written, well played, well managed, etc! Everything was amazing about it! There were parts that were relatively routine (Lily's death), very interesting (www.bled-me-Dry.com), completely awkward and unclear (death of Pijes), and simply plain heartfelt (first scene). I think the whole cast has done a great job, especially three leads: David Borrius, Dennis Richards (during filming of this film - I'm very sweet!), And Marley Shelton <br /> I am very sick to say this movie is another scramble clone. This movie, in no way, is a scramble clone. In fact, this film runs around the ring to run around. It actually makes sense! Scrum was not the only movie featuring it in a masked killer feature. Forgive me, but it seems that the scramble was also a clone (Ahm ..., Friday 13th, Halloween, and many other scary movies also show masked killers). I think the novelty of the Kapid-Masked killer is brilliant. These terrible things are so weird to see the sweet, cupidish face. Another novelty (nose bleeding) makes way for a fantastic finish! Finally when I saw it cold gives !!!!! So, even if you do not like it for the first time, then again see Valentine and give another chance! <br /> <br /> PS- Keep an eye on my new website (WWW.LOVE-HURTS.ORG)! Coming soon ...
