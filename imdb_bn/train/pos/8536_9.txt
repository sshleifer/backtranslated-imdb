Recently I got the chance to see "Waterdance" and it liked it. I do not really understand why it is said that because of no dancing there, probably for the strip club dance at the end. We are introducing major characters across the film, invalids into a hospital. The story shows a love relationship between a physically unhealthy person and a healthy woman, which is a very sweet story. Unfortunately, you will not see movies like today. I'm not "stuck", I'm not saying that in the early 80's and early 90's, everything was better than today, but I really think the film industry is getting worse and we can learn a lot from the older movies - old films Something from 1920-1998.
