This was one of the most moving movies I have ever seen. I was about 12 years old when I saw it for the first time and my eyes covered it whenever I was on TV. Acting and plot is amazing. It seems so true as reality and it touches many controversial issues. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama.
