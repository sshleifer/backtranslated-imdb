Extreme, every month, this movie is perfect if you are in good mood. If you love jazz music, it will certainly see. You enjoy smiling laughing laughs, tears in your eyes, and this movie is for you tomorrow. If you analyze and analyze an intense, deep, heavy piece of art, you probably find something good about Darren Orphoscope (in other words - the critic Doshen gets lighter, you do not know the best time when you see it!) My only complaint The movie was rarely small. Guess I'll see it many more times to get my fill.
