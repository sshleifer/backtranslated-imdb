This showtime movie is worth more than 4.5 rating points. I based it on a 10 story and two starring it. After reading the audience's opinions, I was surprised to see how many people expected this movie to be a comedy. Yes, I see that comedy / drama listed under the IMDB genre. That sure, is not confusing? Thankfully, I did not expect the movie before I logged in to this website. In fact, based on the summary of what I had heard, I totally guessed it to be a drama. I am disappointed if this frustrating movie is not due to such a low vote, <br /> <br /> Another reason that may be the reason for low voting is that The movie is 'Character driven'. An example of another character driven movie, 'Driving Miss Daisy', comes to mind. Someone's previous commentary complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scene was confused with the film's original plot. That is, how he or she will climb your family upstream - or her personal force, if you want. However, they worked to establish credibility and support as a right to remove Greenwich and remove the world's "up". <br /> <br /> He proved that he would not stop nothing to blend in the white surroundings. His black color was not due to skin color when another black person moved next door. It was because of everything 'interlopers' represented; Tom had left all that. Originally, Tom had become a cookie too: Black on the outside but white inside. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> I realized that the end of the film did not happen at the next door (it does not want to give away). The final word is oral and hyper is distributed to it. When Tom tells you that Tom Too is going to a college or when he publishes it in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Yet, the condemnation is great. You know that street life will never be the same. <br /> <br /> My favorite type of character is: People do not have problems, some pain, they do not dance, they grow, they change, and they get life. As a member of the audience, I may learn something or be inspired.
