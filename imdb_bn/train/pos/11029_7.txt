I am far away from Sylvester Stallone fan and I feel that I was really fond of his French cinematic taxi 3, which was almost impossible to play a small role. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For almost a year he has not set a food reserve, but he returns. Immediately after returning, they got an urgent call from a group of haikas trapped in a snow storm. At least, that's what Ranger believed In reality it is a robber who has failed to crash with their plane in the mountains after a brave plan to steal money from a flying government plane. The cases spread over all the reserves and they need the help of professional rescuers ... <br /> <br /> This is not one of the most intelligent movies, but it is enjoyable in its continuation. I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the leader of the evil intelligence and robbers. I know him well from the TV series "From the third rock to the sun", but I also enjoyed his performance in this film. Overall acting okay, it had lots of steps to propose and of course a one-liner, but it's a very nice decoration. This movie was impressed in a fantastic natural environment. I liked snowy hills and valleys, mountainous rivers and forests ... Perhaps that's why I gave this movie more score than an action / adventure movie. I give it 6.5 / 10. If you do not expect too much, it's an enjoyable movie.
