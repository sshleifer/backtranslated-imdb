In April 1965, CBS Barbara Straussand made the first broadcast of the memorial television specialties. The show was not only a runway rating success, but as well as 5 AMI rewards garnered. This is one of the most memorable moments of the 1960s television and (unfortunately) the special kind of television they do not produce anymore. Wonderful songs and Barbara are filled with a spectacular performance, anyone who is interested in this special Strassand fan and primary television will definitely see.
