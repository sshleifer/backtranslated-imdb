I am glad that someone has made a movie, how difficult it is to make your heart a second time risky. Or third. It is sure that this movie can be fine - beautiful, colorful and it gives this good feeling around your heart after finishing it. This plot may not be very innovative, but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not yet been used. Though Cast is completely elected, Scott Wolf's aged eight-year-old father is not even seen, even when he is in a lawsuit. So, sparks are in the right place, supporting cast supports well, and even though you probably can predict the whole movie, you do not want to switch the channel. It's just the right kind of entertainment on Sunday evening.
