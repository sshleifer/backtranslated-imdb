Sudden Impact is a two pronged story. Harry is noticed that Harry and Harry are very happy to return to their side and show how it has been done by a crowd that wants to kill him. This little war suspends Harry, which he does not take care of, but he goes a little longer. Now the second part of the story. Some are killing some crazy people and drag Harry into this situation where he hides Jennifer Spencer and meets a woman who wants to stay calm in the small tourist town. The police chief is not a fine person and he warns about not being involved in Harry or creating problems. This Harry Callahan problem follows him. The people hold him in this town and Harry goes to war, then the hell goes away. Meanwhile Vigilant strikes again and the gang is ready for him to find out. Jennifer Spencer was caught and Harry came to rescue him during the film's climax. Suddenly the Impact is not a poor Harry, but at the same time it gives us a Harry which is a very anti-hero hero ready to fight for justice. Again, not the worst, but with the most memorable lines. Go ahead and do your day.
