* !! - SPOILERS - !! * <br /> <br /> Before starting it, tell me that this movie has the advantage of seeing this movie on the big screen and seeing its "approved version". This movie was produced by Stephen King himself in 1997. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A huge fan of his work, the rethinking of this story of Stanley Kubrick is more compelling ... and SCARY <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kubrick really knows how to express psychological terrorism directly to the film. The film's direction and the art of painting itself earned the title "Magus" on its own question. Kubrick's talent is like magic. Movie World became a great director after his death in 1999. Other outstanding credits include: Aye Wide Shot, 1999; Flower Metal Jacket, 1987; Barry Lyndon, 1975; A Clockwork Orange, 1971; 2001: A Space ODC, 1968; Spartacus, 1960 and more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jack is appointed as a caretaker. During the severe snowfall for several months, the responsibility of maintaining the hotel is restored until his appearance, until his spring is visible. It seems that there are many rich and elegant tourists who will flee to the Colorado Mountains for the summer summer ice. <br /> <br /> The hotel was a great part of architecture and staging. It reaches the atmosphere, by the dark, but at the same time in the "welcome" environment. Upholstery and furniture were always (in the late 70's - early 80's) and the landscape was highlighted in the hotel's opening scene. It not only gives you the opportunity to enjoy your views, it also lets your mind decide how restless and isolated from the rest of the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You get the whole story of their past, the story of Danny's "fabulous friend" Tony and Jack's album turned into a beautiful, balanced introduction scene. There was no need to spread the history of the past for more than two hours; Clearly, Kubrick saw that from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Close the day. Again, the mountains moved towards the hotel (this time, with family cap), the interaction between Jack and Danny was very laughable and it depicts a very boring exchange. Through the primary touring aspect <br /> <br />, it is very exciting, even "workers" are going to move things, even if you have the chance to see firefighting fire places, high cathedral ceilings and expensive furniture, dormant and crown modes in Argentina. "They did a good job! Pink and my favorite color of gold." (Wendy Torrens) Even "Staff Wing" is well-designed and well-designed. <br /> <br /> The sculpture was a fantastic touch, a sculpture of sculptures, which was the Minotaur Guard of Crete. When Jack Nicholson stands in the manger's scaled model and gets trapped in the center, when Vendée and Danny enters, this is a magic moment; That tells you immediately, there is plenty of energy in her house; Already starting, serious things are wrong. "I did not want to go there until I had at least one hour to find my way out." (Hotel Manager) <br /> <br /> Scamman Kruthar as Dick Hollaran was original and open in his performance. Her smile was natural and her performance was surprising. You really were in the hotel and believed in the kitchen tour with Vendée and "Doc". His conversation with the child about Tony and Hotel, his interpretation of "burning" Danny was very well distributed. It was trustworthy and sincere. <br /> <br /> Hotel cut and pan scan, behind hills, walks in the cold air, adding a fog from the warm roof in the snowy hotel. So much of the movie atmosphere. It can also mark the "half-way-to-hell" point; The twist of the movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (So, if he played olive oil?! It shows its amazing diversity!) Actually, in 1980 I watched the movie on the big screen, I said, "what? Olive oil? * Lull * (popped out) in 1980.) But I took it as soon as the movie started, he is great, according to the find, this is his best performance, so far! (Although I was in Steve Martin's "Roxanne" in 1987 </ Br> <br /> Once you have established a pearl bit of quarantine information, you must be with the observer: Torrents past; Danny's broken arm; Tony; The history of the hotel itself; Danny is not actually a "psychological" but rather a change And the hotel's general layout, which you will find in the first 3 series, the movie never scares you. <br /> <br /> Previously two supervisors of two daughters, Delbert Grad (The girls appeared in Danny several times, before going to Tony's home, the family has never gone to H. Otel) Danny can identify with which the icon, and at the same time, which he was afraid of. They were hunting (and spectacular), themselves and Danny to show them how and where they were killed, rather than graphic and material ways. <br /> <br /> Kubrick's Tony was written as a spirit of service as a spirit guide, which he often closed his body with his own father. She was ... "The little boy residing in my mouth." After talking to Dani, at the end of Danny's fingers, he physically spoke through Danny. Not like the book, I understand, where Tony was, Stephen King tried to save his father, Danny wanted to be projected in old age. Kubrick left that little twist and made it more awesome anyway when Tony "took ... Danny ... over." The idea of ​​returning Danny's old self to her little temperament ... is not terrible .... <br /> <br /> The scene of "Shower Women" as Lia Beydan (about which I can not find any other credit), as young ladies and Billy Gibson (who seems to be suffering from lack of credit for work before or after) Already or something to do), was deliberately objectionable and totally hateful. It was dramatic, and scary. Hateful and frightening Nicholson sees the mirrors and sees his body decomposing his pussy down; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Reducing the mental state of its character is carefully and thoroughly documented by Kubrick. Jack's immediate friendship with Lloyd the Bertender (such as alcoholics, brain patients, and drug addicts) shows his continuous uninterrupted atmosphere of the atmosphere that Lloyd enjoys. Namely, alcohol ... "dog hair that bit me." (Jack Torrens) Jack, Jack has no charge, it's Bourbon on the stone. "Order from the house." (Lloyd the Bertender) sounds beautiful game. <br /> <br /> Finding Andy Jack's "Playplay" is nothing more than a page in the same line, although between 8 or 9 different creative styles. When he asks from the shadow, "How do you like it?" And Wendy whirls and screams with baseball bat in his hand ... so stupid. This is the point where he realizes how the whole situation has accumulated ... how Jack is involved. It is very scary, dramatic and a strong presence is distributed. Danny's attitude by admitting the hotel lobby with emphasis on Jack and Wondi's scenes, and with the ending of the clash with this scene, it is likely to create the strongest picture in the film. <br /> <br /> "REDRUM" view. How nice. What i say Standing on them with a small knife, standing on their heads with their little knife, will not the mother wake up? Even if it is not meaningless, it will still be scary as the 7th level Hell. It can all (and there) remember (ed). Talking in a memorable scene ... <br /> <br /> The final attack on Nicholson's ax with his family was probably one of the most horrific scenes in cinema history. His Ed-Libde line, "Harey Jonny!" Brightness was a stroke and one of the most memorable scenes in horror history. It goes down to scary movie history too. <br /> <br /> end? Kubrick's last perfection was. I felt it ended beautiful. No punching, no platitudinis whining, this movie ends up unhealthy stupid. Only epitomized perfection. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rent it, see it, buy it. It's a classic in horror genre, and for good reason. IT RAB !! <br /> <br /> * I am ... ... take this movie and put it in your Stephen King collection and perform the "Approved" version of 1997, and keep it down the Kiddie section. It's that where it is. .: 9.98 rates from this movie Fiend:.
