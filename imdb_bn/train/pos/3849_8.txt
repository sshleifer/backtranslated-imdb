This last Dutch speech of Veronese's movie is well-laughed at me. For all the small details and cross references etc. as a film movie, I can assure all the senses amuses in this film for anyone interested in film industry. I did not read the book, Gerard Reeves, based on this film, but I still believe that we see some unfamiliar poet / author unknown photo that has got him (in this way - there is no harm here). An anti-hero surrounded by letters that have their untimely purpose, he has. This is a nicely packed film painter, Paul Verpovan managed to turn into a suspenseful film-noar setting, rather than the tricky "gesellich (?)" Dutch suspense setting, impressive work!
