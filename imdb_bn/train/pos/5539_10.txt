When I first saw this image, it was a taped copy and the title was a cursed Terror. I still own the tape, and I admit, I saw it once from the beginning to the end! The film is extremely low budget and dialogue is often funny! I got some friends to visit this and we got some great smiles from the terrible scripts. The film expresses concern to the couple (Remember it is as basic as the 70's, so they are very hip people!) Who go to the end of the weekend camping trip, which I believe is going to be NY New York. After fishing and eating they have some delightful dialogue and the girl gives the reason for the death of the fish and they eat it! The man came with a little stupidity about how the fish had eaten, and now it was a part of them, and he went away; "And that nice man!" Heavy people, really heavy! Ha ha ha! However, along with a couple of vets in Vietnam, who plays one flute, I believe. (At any rate they are musical companions!) The boys definitely draw the girl and when the couple is found immoral, they finish their terror at night. The guy ends up caged up in a chicken fog, and his daughter will see the boy being kidnapped by two boys. Actually, at the end of the night, it seems pretty beautiful, and when it comes in the morning, the boys leave and the girl and the guy leave. It is thought that the man learned how to treat the person, and the girl has a smile on her face! :) Anyway, I would recommend this film to anyone looking good smile! Because it fails to laugh at me! If I find it on DVD and replace my old tapes copy, but I'll really buy it again, this classic camp! You will love this stuff!
