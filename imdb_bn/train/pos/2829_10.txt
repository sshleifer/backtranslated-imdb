Without any doubt, Private Lessons II is the biggest movie I ever seen. A Japanese import (weak) translated into English, it's a joy to see. It makes much sense, but does not matter. Sometimes deliberately not funny, it is the greatest comedy <br /> <br /> The video is uncommon and unavailable on video, but I delayed late in the night several times. My taped copy was seen in dozens and dozens of times as I introduced slowly, person-friendly, and the world of this movie. <br /> <br /> Joan Pakal is playing our hero who tuner / lover. (He was apparently working for his check.) He played by GOPO Inagaki of Japan's pop band SMAP, who gave everything through this film and has a pretty good hair. "Man of the Men" fame Stacey Edwards also appeared in the film, and perhaps he was happy to find another film. <br /> <br /> At least three views of it are plots. While repeating, you can enjoy an unusual amount of ingredient ingredient (at least 50) of his house or at the end of the film wearing a shirt with Kain Kapoor's underhand husks. <br /> <br /> Predictable, but highly quoted. My friends and I reenact the whole scene. Yes, it looks like we've been shy and we ... but we're seeing Lum's victims who have "personal lessons II". Become one of the ten people in the world who have seen this movie. You'll thank it for me.
