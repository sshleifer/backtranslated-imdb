Very likely one of the world's funniest movies. Oscar material Tray Parker and Matt Stone are ridiculous and before you see it I recommend one of the most fun cartoons to create "Funny Park". Buy it, you will smile every time you see it. Talent pure stroke If you do not feel funny then you have no soul or humor. 10 out of 10
