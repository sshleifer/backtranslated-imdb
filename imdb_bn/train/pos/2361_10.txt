I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses and I also work with intensive care services. For many years I have seen man die of blood transfusion from hemolytic reaction, took numerous conferences on birth-borne pathogens, and many patients have been seriously ill from patients caused by transfusion blood. I have also told many of Jehovah's Witnesses that if they refuse blood and I will never die after 26 years of death, they will die without question, "Rejecting blood circulation or for the community is really beneficial from the battle of this unreasonable big problem? "The matter for Jehovah's Witnesses is moral. "You must stay away from blood" is not a hesitant statement. Thank you for this movie and allow you to comment on it.
