I have to admit, I did not expect too much to see this movie in my Japanese film class, but this film has really thrown me away. The director did a really nice job with the title of his movie, really crazy picture taken. I believe that this movie combines silence with the likeliness of madness, allowing viewers to experience characters in the internal world rather than the world outside her mind. This movie has added to my feeling only about foreign silent films and Americans, foreign movies work much more for you to practice your mind, and you feel more than just going for a holesome film with happy endings, using imagination very little.
