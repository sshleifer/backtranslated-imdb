Yes this movie is predictable and definitely not the award element. But then it does not try to do anything. A fun-filled romp with real fun one-fishing devices, a star by Peter O'Wowel and very interesting acting, the role of Joan Ploher and under the world's performance. The band had performance performances, each one playing their role in a fool, ridiculous way. Although the song was not good, but the movie was nicely filled. From some negative comments I have imagined that some comedies have gone over their heads. A good example is the comments about "strange baseball-like games", good my favorite American, which was the baseball that came from cricket - and it was very interesting for the unnamed US band to know who knows cricket. Also, when Carl broke the window you did not think; Lord Foxley said, "Oh yeah!" To get more money for the breakdown and the manager at the same time referred to the meaning of "no no" and at the same time. Jiz, it seems like every curiosity should be explained to the people ... I enjoyed everything and got a little smile! See good prices
