I admit that I am a vampire addict: I've seen many vampire films which I've lost counting and that's certainly the top ten. I was very impressed by the original John Carpenter vampires and when I discovered there was a signal, then I went straight and bought it. This movie does not follow the same rules as the first and it is not very dark, but it is quite close and I think it is basically nicely designed. Like Derek Bliss: Its performance was remarkable and it was difficult for the viewer to believe that he could actually survive in any country of the world. One of my favorite parts was after meeting with Joe and after getting dressed up in the diner's bathroom, he could see that more than that. His comments are nicely overwhelming and yet modestly practical, which is in contrast with scenes with other scenes. <br /> <br /> Other cast members were well-selected and they were nicely woven for an entertaining and original film production. This is not the only re-release of the first movie, and it has also grown in Night Street from Night Night II in the same way. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like Vampire movies, I'll recommend it. If you love your movies less bloody then choose something else.
