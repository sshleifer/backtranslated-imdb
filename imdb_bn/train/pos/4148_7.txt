Let's set one thing straight: This film does not want to redefine the genre, it is Dr. Strangelov and Young Frankenstein are not. It's an intelligent flashing, three wonderful female Leads (can not remember any other comedy with similar characteristics), SLOL and RED Drach and Amy Poehler from SNL and Indy Queen Parker Posey, as ever charming. The story is basic: the three goalkers were "lost" in the college, and still it is after the ward. Poehler was not touched by a dog instructor (who could not even get a date with a blind man), a man from Posey (who was in the office of "Clinton" ... "One minute later ... I was a little slow, OK!), And Drech has a gay fianc√©e (Seth Meyers from SNL, funny). To annoy him during the spring break, the senator's "Akolo" daughter (always the beautiful Amber Tamblene from the TV series "Arcadia Joan") has to be stopped. So he must keep an eye on him, and some bliss ensues. All in all, a light, simple comedy, quite short, and quite enjoyable
