I am always surprised at how many times you will see something about World War II on German national television. You might think that they do not like to open old wounds, but there is not a week left without a documentary or a movie about the horrors and tortures of this war. Perhaps it's a way to deal with their past, I do not know, but you can not blame them for ignoring what happened. And it should be said: Most documentaries are really a watch prize because they do not try to shine on the truth and likewise they can be said about their movies (for example, "Der Untergang" or "Downfall", you may think it is) now Very realistic <br /> <br /> One of these films is "Rosenthal". It tells a true story and discusses the issue of mixed marriage during the war, although this film starts with a family in the United States. After Hannah's father died, her mother suddenly became a religious believer, though she was not very religious before. He does not know where his mother's strange behavior came from, but when she started digging her mother's annoying childhood, Hannah realized that she never knew about her mother's past. <br /> <br /> This movie is already quite surprising considering the issue of mixed marriage during the Nazi regime. As far as I know, there are no other films with this film. (Those who still did not know about it: because of being married to so-called pure Irish men or women, many Jews were meant to have not been immediately sent to camps, but they had to work in a factory). But it does not say anything about the problems of mixed marriage, it is often seen by their own parents and relatives that it gives a good idea. How difficult sometimes they were at the time of the Nazi regime, and how these people, most of the time, were able to do everything with the power of freeing their men, once they were captured and for example, Rosendrastas .. <br /> <br /> The acting is really good and The story was written very well, although the way it was presented in the beginning did not really do it for me (and this is the only part you can see trailers). Probably this is mine, but I missed a large part of what was happening in the present day. At least part of the part in the United States as Hannah goes to Berlin and works immediately after talking to her mother about learning more about the past. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is something to do with World War II, and if you do not necessarily seek many shots of workshops, it's definitely a movie that you should see. This is not a movie that you can see in a war or a gunfight, but it is certainly an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea of ​​an aspect of the war which is only known only. I give it 8/10.
