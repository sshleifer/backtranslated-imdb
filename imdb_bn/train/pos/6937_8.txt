This growing western spins was coveted by one of the first and most famous rifle stories in the West. James Stewart is a cowboy who won private Winchester in extortion, only to lose it in robbery. Stewart's picture shows the details of the rifle and a specific person. The time change after the time of the rifle, as the owner is fated to lose through violence. Stuart has lots of actions and mysteries in the pictures as close to his queue. Steven McNally, Dan Durriya, Millard Mitchell, John McIntyre and JC Flipen are here to support a great cast. Shell Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of his role is rather vague. Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson, in the following years, have a hearty, brief but concise role in the years.
