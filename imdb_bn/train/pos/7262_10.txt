My daughter, her friends and I saw this movie repeatedly. I bought it twice and some little girlfriend covered it. Then, I hired it many times. It just gets old !!! Blockbuster is not even in their list, and I have tried to find, buy it for more than 5 years. Without any doubt, my daughter's childhood was my favorite movie ... it's all! We laughed, we cried, we talked about real life and how difficult it is for some kids in the world. There was nothing pretentious about this movie. We are related to every second and every line bill! One million thanks for the recovery of our faith in human nature. Sincerely, Sheline and Keilin Vandermany Crayven, Saskatchewan Canada, hey !!! :-) <br /> <br /> updated August '07: <br /> <br /> Who is the judge of the rich woman of love with a rich woman? Or love loves to raise a child to a child, which is not his own. It can not be mine or your life. It is not only believable, it happens every day. Thank God! I believe in human nature !!! Celebrate !!!!
