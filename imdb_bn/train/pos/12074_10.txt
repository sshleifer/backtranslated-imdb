Joseph H. Luis was the best director of Film Noir. It must be its best. <br /> <br /> There is no standard feature that we call silent film now. Although made of American, it is completely set in England. It lacks gangsters. It lacks a femme fatale. It's not a crime. <br /> <br /> The title character gives an answer to an ad. He is happy to earn some money as a secretary. Instead, he wakes up as the next day in a terrible plot. Only a very strong person could survive such a horribly unsettling ordeal. And Nina Foke gives the feeling of a strong woman as Julia. <br /> <br /> Coming from the casting against the kind of exciting part: Miss Foch has an elegant way. He is screaming, cowering the victims He is actually a bit ice and petikian, though overwhelming. This makes all of its character's disaster more credible. <br /> <br /> Of course the single most interesting element is Dame May Wei Waltz. She was (and is) most famous for the charming title character in the probably "Lady Vanishes". She has a sweet method and a harmless, little dithering method. But here he is far away from a heroine. <br /> <br /> George McRae is excellent as his extremely painful boy. Completely cast, in fact, pretty. <br /> <br /> It looks like this famous and brilliant movie was created accidentally. Undoubtedly the director knows exactly what he's doing. But he did it in a low budget. The silent and original film of the movie is exciting and fascinating in Noor: it's small, strong low life and unforgettable in this case.
