It is a film that was a very good job. When I was in production I heard mixed reviews and was waiting for her release! Director and Cheers of All Actors What is the need for supporting actress Eva Mendez to take it to the top? Everyone here said, the next part of the film is writing. Katie Cassidy did an extraordinary job with her character, although she did not do much work while making this film. Most of his career is ahead of his career. I was surprised by his performance. I totally enjoyed the film, I asked questions about my values ​​of life and priorities, and for that a good person! A great message lies in the film. So it can be enjoyed by all!
