A beautiful film, deeply humanity is easy, yet touching the divine aspect. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost perfect, and seeing nothing in this world can be really perfect, it's pretty good. The only minor thing that I am materially aware of is pacing some points in the middle of the story. Acting is very good, and all actors are the top actors in high profile films easily. It seems to have been well thought out by the actual instruction, and the script has been amazing. The moment of some real excitement moments, and a pretty good series of stories. <br /> <br /> The moment of the movie when the main character gets the feeling of being in heaven, a really bright yarn.
