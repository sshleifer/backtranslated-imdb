The Bible teaches us that the love of money is the core of all the temples. Love of money leads to greed, which can destroy pride and end up in the end. Two brothers, Andy and Han, will discover how much money they love and who they love most. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> does not have to be more different. Andrey enjoys the success of working in New York's real estate market and is married to her beautiful wife, Gina (Marisa Tomomi), who sometimes conceived a trophy wife. Han, however, is a divorced person who finds himself in the mercy of his ex-wife, his daughter's expensive school bill, and endless child support. A man who has good and good intentions, Hong Kong can not survive on the surface of his head gradually, no matter why he is swimming to stay above. <br /> <br /> Andy, he hides the problems with his differences between him and his brother. He has been fraudulent against his company and is widely involved in drug use to protect him from fear. Thinking about the pressure of her life, and lying to face her appearances, now she is thinking of running away from the country with Gina to start her again. Of course, like Han√ß, he needs money to do this and believes how he can get it. How? By robbing their parents' owner and jewelry store. This act of betrayal will be destroyed because of Hanson's brother, their family, and other life, greed, pride, and fear. <br /> <br /> Before the W.K. knew the story of death, the story that was told is the story. After the robbery went wrong, and Hanson (Rosemary Harris) dies at Nanay, mother of Annie and Hanak, the story is called before and after various tricks of different days. We knew more about the reaction of his father, Charles (Albert Finney), not just Andy and Hannah. The relationship between Charles and his two sons, especially Andy, was discovered, and after discovering another possible motivation, it was discovered that there was little love between the two men. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the greedy criminal with the lack of morality but from the opposite side, we can be sympathetic as a man. Ethan Huq also makes Hans alive as a living, but really a man can quarrel as much as he has left. Andy and Han have been transformed into reality that it is easy to think of their not just letters but the true images of lost and confused men, which can now face the consequences of their actions. <br /> <br /> The Devil is a moral story that leads to the consequences of our actions, which we do not expect to face otherwise. More than that, our choices may affect those around us who we anticipate. What should be the best picture of the year, we see, how to make money easier to make money online becomes the ultimate pursuit when life is easily broken. In other words, there is no easy solution or answer to our problem, and trying to find it can only make things worse. <br /> <br /> 10/10
