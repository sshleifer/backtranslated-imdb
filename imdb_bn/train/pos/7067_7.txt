Although he is very well known today, the most popular star of the 1930s Diana Durbin was a perplexing personality and the voice of acclaimed operatic songs. This was his first major film in 1937, and it was proven at the box office office for the unmistakable Universal Studios. <br /> <br /> There are concerns with the three daughters of the three divorced couples who believe their long-awaited parents and parents believe that she can soon be resurrected - with the strong intention of reducing her gold digger and returning her mother. . Although the story is slightly, the script is malignant and the expert cast plays it with a well-decorated screw-touch. Wonderful happy voice and interesting personality such as Charles Winarr, Alice Brady, Luisial Watson, and Mischa Ai, and played this enjoyable character actor. A super-entertaining entertainment for fans of the 1930s film fame. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, Ur GFT, Amazon Reviewer
