I saw this image last night and it's awesome. I love it most about it that is different in it and less original, but deeply impressive. Henry Thomas' (he played the child in the E.T.) acting skillfully with neutral (he is considered to be a man a few words). David Straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. And miraculously (here we are talking about a Hollywood product) a child works as a main character, but that line does not work or line, rather rather IS (and brighter). Notes that are interesting to Thomas' mysterious relationship. E.T. That film was original; When his bond w The child acts as the main part of "good child". <br /> Then there is music - Ah, what music !! Gillian Welch's tunes are wonderful and the overall score is gorgeous mountainous country music. <br /> <br /> This picture is amazing atmospheric. I highly recommend it.
