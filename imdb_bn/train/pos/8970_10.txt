I did a little research on this image and discovered a web site that claimed it was actually a victim and posted an insult about the world of lesbians post WWII Greenwich Village. Without the exception of Stewart and Novak, Battlefields and Dikes represent alternative lifestyles. The stage writer John Van Dutton was visibly gay and was very familiar with this Greenwich village. I thought it was ironic because when I took my parents in the first 5 or 6th grade, I saw Bell, Book and candle in the theater. I found it hard to find a film that included horses, machine guns, or alien monsters, and I planned to get bored. But, remember, when Jimmy Stewart embraced Kim Novak at the top of the Flatine building and threw his hat, the camera burst into the ground. With the rise of the magnificent George Denning love theme, suddenly I feel like feeling in love. The first stirrings of romantic / sexual love did not allow me to leave the theater. I'm sure I'm not the only child of the pre-teen, who is inspired by Kim Novak's amazing, direct eye. It was a satirical event that a gay parable was able to jump-start heterosexual puberty among many of us. I am now in my late 50's and saw the movie again in the evening yesterday and after touching the hat fifty years later, the same feeling has become excited. . .
