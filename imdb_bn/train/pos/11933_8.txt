I think this is a lovely family movie. There are plenty of sunny scenes and heart-warming moments throughout the movie. The actors are great and the effects are executed across well. Danny Glover plays George Knox, who runs 'The Angels' of the terrible baseball team and is full of films around. Young actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Milton Davis Jr. are fantastic. Christopher Lloyd is good like Al-Angel, and the effects of this top New Disney movie are great. A touch and heart warmth movie which everyone should enjoy.
