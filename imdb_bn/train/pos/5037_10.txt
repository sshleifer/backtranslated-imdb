It could be the most inherent movie of its style. I do not remember to see any advertisement or commercial for this, because it might not be so good at the box office. However, Frailty is a wonderful and really original horror movie. I rank it in my list of the top 10 most horrible movies on my list. <br /> <br /> The photo starts with snapshots of photos and news articles, which tells itself about a murderer, who calls himself "the hand of God" And then a man walks in the police station and tells the chief officer that he knows that the murderer is his brother. Both of them must go together, where there is a conviction anywhere that can solve the case. During that journey, the man started telling the story of his brother and when we started the incident we returned. Fenton and Adam are two young brothers living with their rigid and religious father, who one day claimed that he received a divine message from God to kill the demons in the presence of regular people. He will destroy a list of the names of Gods and request his son to help him run this divine mission. <br /> <br /> This is a completely awesome and suspicious movie that will keep you on the edge. Your seats The excitement is high, innocent people (or demons) are questioned and killed in religious experience. It's one of the many but not very twists at the end. If you like this style I highly recommend Frailty for you. I own a DVD and it's one of my favorite horror thrillers of all time.
