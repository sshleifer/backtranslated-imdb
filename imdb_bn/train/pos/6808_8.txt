In 1967, the cold blood was probably like "the real thing" (think about this: do we really want to see the real thing?), But it was black and white in a color world, and many people did not even know what it was, and There was an opportunity to recreate it for television. Plus, if you recreate it, you can show some elements that are not shown at the root. The cold blood was first "non-fiction novel" in truman copoos. The real true truman book was 100% true. I am Canadian enough for a TV movie mostly for Kansas. See sex, medicines and rock 'n' roll elements: Dick Narrising, Perry an aspirin junky, playing Perry Blues guitar.
