Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the talent played! The episode was a great one! The script gave us a little more than usual, yes, I was still "I'm not your father - you and Ogogod your father deceived me!" Rubbish but these scripts do not actually allow the actors to feel the real feelings and express them in reality, but what would they think if we think of them as our TV shows. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Photographed! <br /> <br /> There was nothing dramatic or madidermatic, real realistic realistic realistic people, There was nothing in the theater and was completely relevant, so much relief to see our actors being genuinely open to realizing the real role of our country and giving real script, true opportunity! Thanks Tony Tees, Sam Miller, Channel Ten and All Cast And crew-wondrous work !! Please continue doing what you are doing, your efforts are greatly appreciated And do not go unnoticed!
