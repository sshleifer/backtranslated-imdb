"Yes, Georgio" is a light hearty and enjoyable film / comedy that holds beautiful settings and beautiful music. This is not my favorite movie, but it is a movie that I enjoyed watching more than once. Some reviewers recommend that if one wants to enjoy a powro, then perhaps it will be well served by choosing an opera DVD. However, there may be a good presentation of operative gifts of a full opera Powerto, sometimes, an opera needs a dress and a story line that completely hides the appearance and nature of the person. "Yes, Jerryji" allows Pavaroti to use his spoken voice and displays any personality and character without doing an opera. <br /> <br /> Many critics think the story is incredible; I do not agree. To maintain an intelligent and beautiful man, enough talented people can be both self-centered and charming. In addition, those who are different from each other, often get insight on themselves and expand them by increasing their direction as well as taking them in their direction, they can not choose themselves. Both Georgio and Pamela have become open to relatively close parts of relationships with others. <br /> <br /> Be calm and go to a visible and comfortable award-winning movie with Pavarotti at the top of your vocalisation. The last scene of the pond of Turndot is valuable when going there.
