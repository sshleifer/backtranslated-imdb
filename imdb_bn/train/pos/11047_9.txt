Finally, I was waiting a few years before the film was released in England, but eventually I was very happy to see it. To start acting, there are many cool things in the film. I do not have anything that is very much needed for a horror film but all of these movies work well. This and constantly hidden and attractive scripts, Lovecraftian with a beautiful sort of feel it, give the film a real solid backbone. Add this to the supernatural nightmare imagery and occasionally shocking ghor and the winners of the movies. This is my favorite kind of gourd, supernatural and splattery. Also, Marcus, the anger bodybuilding transsexual and daisy, mentally impaired lover / sports items, real strange and unwanted, and far away, Morrison refers to large frenzy that works well with Freudian overtones. . This is one of the most fascinating recent horror films, which is far worse than Hollywood's production. My only persecution was that I wanted to finish the tunnel darker, but it still works, so completely I would seriously recommend it to the horrible buffs.
