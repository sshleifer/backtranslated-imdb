I'm going to scale a bit here and say I enjoyed it. However, the cartoons are really going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. It is obviously something that most people will not get, as the nature of irrationality. <br /> <br /> Animation is awesome, but yes, that's the point. The main character fouled mouthed, violent, and stupid Whatever the redeeming virtues, whatever. His wife shrieks and wails, apparently just the most basic communication skills capable of little. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, you're going to love this. <br /> <br /> It's really small, so maybe I'll rent instead of buying.
