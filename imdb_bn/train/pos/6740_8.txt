The character of the full role of the main role of this movie, being hijacked by its past and the spectacular way to the audience, is unique in its 1950s. <br /> <br />, along with hunting music and well written plots, the film is a prime example of the best silent photo. Expressing depression in the blindness of the wings, Carl Malden was as ambitious as his boss, who did not send any fool, but in his earlier case, who had compassion for them. <br /> <br /> Otto Prummmer has made such films about her own. If there is any flaw, then it takes the beauty of Gene Terni, which stays in a strictly uninhabited place. Cafe their view, however, wonderful and true ring. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Great lighting and mood setting. The building where the deadly activities are very atmospheric, I love the old woman at the beginning. <br /> <br /> 10/8
