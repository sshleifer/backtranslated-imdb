On the night of his bachelor party, Paul Coleman (Jason Lee) met with amazing dancer Beckie (Julia Styles) Bar, they drank together a lot and he woke up in the morning the next morning. Her future mother-in-law called her and told that her maternal uncle Karen (Selma Blair) was coming to her apartment, and she suddenly asked Becky to leave her house quickly. Soon, he saw that he is crazy and later, preparing for his wedding dinner party, he realized that Bcci Karen's cousin In this ridiculous scenario, is the start of a very funny comedy. The first attraction of this film is certainly the actress and actor Central Trio. Julia Styles and Selma Blair, excellent actress and extremely fantastic, and Jason Lee, who has wonderful fun, has good performances. I laugh a lot along stories, but some scenes are really delightful. For example, when Paul finds Becky in his bed; When he finds his color; His imagination in many situations; Drugstore tries to buy and interpret about crab medicine; Most of his neighbor's views, minister! When Karen calls on the department store; Or when police finds a suspect in attacking Paul. I can take a number of other scenes, but stop the reader's rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun. My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Hide Por Elas" ("crazy for them")
