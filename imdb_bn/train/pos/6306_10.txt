Idiotic hack crooks, a babe, a safe, a plan and a baby. Add them all and you get the best comedy you've ever heard. <br /> <br /> The star power of some non-list (at least one-plus ... OK, B-plus?) This movie has received very few promotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This soft professor is not down to some waterfall in the comedy. These fewer lives are bad guys. They speak less life bad people and they do less things in bad lives, but they are for your entertainment and entertainment. It does, and they do that well. <br /> <br /> One of the best comedy I've ever seen.
