This picture is one of the few quality films of 2000 and of course my seratum. The scene is based on the Vladimir Nabokov novel and the transition to the big screen is absolutely brilliant. <br /> <br /> The picture photography is excellent as both Tarturo and Watson. Turturro definitely proves his best performance in the date that he is much valuable than what he thought. Watson also brilliantly played. <br /> <br /> The story is about a phenomenal chess player (Turururo) that is very bright in his daily life. The film is presented on a non-linear basis with multiple flashbacks of Luisen's childhood. Through this, Luizin's complex character has been described. <br /> <br /> I do not have to say anything else, but to somebody this picture is highlighted.
