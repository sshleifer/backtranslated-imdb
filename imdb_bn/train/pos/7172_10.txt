Gruveyman2 (comment below) is a complete foolhardy ... You have the promise that blind ignorance by the city. It's a gross arrogance, that you are wondering about the film being concerned about SF, it makes you think of it as a general LA A ** hole! The only reason you felt that this film was so congratulatory about SF because you are jealous. Of course you do not know it because you LA LAXED. First of all the pictures were completely realistic about the beautiful city; What has been filmed there and what has been done by some of its famous locals It's nothing bad about L; And this managed director chose to live in a beautiful city on LA. They acknowledge that they went to the film school in L. and are probably proud of this issue. They acknowledge that near SF LA is an advantage. It is said that the only negative thing about the LA, was about studio officials. When the same studio officials first saw them, these boys hated the film, but then those same films grew up for poor films worldwide. So why would not they discriminate against the establishment of the studio executive and the studio system? This is the only man they are trying to "isolate" and for good reason! Do not be so sensitive! How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is "so-called" San Francisco Director? How is he not considered? And what did Godfather mean? Coppola did not. This is his view which won the best awards for the story that the story said on the screen. Then who gave him a job? He admits in the documentary that he does not want to do the film too .... What is your point? And if Sofia wants to live in LA? And how did that prove your points? And tell me when they're actually not free when financing their own movies. Now the movie that is considered classic. And, when they made the movie from the studio fund, one, it was the LA that came to them and said we want to make you two of these pictures, they use these pictures to make money for their own financing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is "<br /> <br />" Wicked "and" Confidence "can suddenly become" air "of confidence and confidence ... if they do not come again? What a stupid and stupid comment! You inserted some big words there .... and do not use them! And, anyway , They did not claim and they also have the best say from LA! So if they were in New York Who gives a prize to L. ... What is your point? So if they go to LA or New York, are they hypocritical to live in SF? <br /> <br /> San Francisco makes himself and her heritage proud and Today is proud of those who make it ... This film focuses only on one aspect ... Making film. You take time and type such nasty comments about the city ( Not the film! But the city and its people) only prove that we are lovers of LA in Northern California! This is a great documentary ... very interested, especially if you came from Bay Area ... but I recommend it to anyone.
