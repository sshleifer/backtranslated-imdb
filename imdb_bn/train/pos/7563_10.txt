An independent feature can now be seen as both film art and a video resume. Broken Enter, and aggressively promoting, encouraging with style and encouragement twenty minutes short. But is it as good as a movie, or does it only serve as a demo piece? Ah, there are rubbers lying there. <br /> <br /> The break is the story of Bonnie Clayon, "Wonderful Stranger and Its Colorful Intrusion" (quote from the video box) after waking up from a nightmare nightmare in one night. He was held as a prisoner, it becomes clear that his abductors knew something about him even that he did not know about himself. While they question him, a black clad soldier is his way in hiding his attempt to rescue his gun. Moeem ensues. <br /> <br /> Fortunately for us, director Alex Ferrari thinks he is doing well, at least he is very good at faking it. Broken visual flash does not suffer from any lack, especially considering its budget and all inexperienced people involved. What it suffers is weak and derivative type of writing. Think Long Kis meets the Goodnight Matrix, written ten minutes after reading the Little Club. The good news for Ferrari and producer / writer George Rodriguez is that story material is easily ignored for display on the eyes of the eye. Does the plot really mean one minute twenty minutes to show the technical skills of its creators? No, not really. <br /> <br /> It would be unfair for me to ignore any negative aspects in the film budget and length of light. Any styles broken are classic. The biggest problem is that it actually worked as well as the full length features. The final "packing" does not build up time to be embarrassed enough. Ferrari was allowed to keep the required feature at a slower pace, plot elements would seem to be less random and the film would be more complete. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I have not heard of such a small feature such as aggression. The matrix inspired soundtrack is very rich and deep, gunmen have punch and even the dialogue gets in the surrounding influences. Everything present on this disc, is an audio that praises modern independent DVD production. Also included in an equally impressive Dolby 2.0 neighborhood track, which is the default menu. <br /> <br /> There are literal hours to create additional features on this word. Actually there are many additional, I think it's unrealistic to list each of them here and describe, even though my readers are still expected to continue reading. There may be any real short-term flaws, the DVD is unprecedented in its informative resources. Those who have enjoyed this movie can learn about the production from everything from the conceptual industry to the promotional campaign. Those who have plans to create their own indie films can learn about everything they can tell from these features. <br /> <br /> Additional categories are split. These include: pre-production, production, post-production, after-brief, and cast and crew bios. From a critical perspective, some sections that I saw were very small. When editing a menu option, they were less frustrating to navigate, the cursor is defaulted to the top selection with each return to the main menu. It must be nyopotiking, but perhaps the filmmakers will accept my advice for future DVD releases. <br /> <br /> It's six audio commentaries and interviews, hours of interviews and talented people, and salesmanship, despite consonance, do not shine through their true colors. <br /> <br /> This DVD is quite generous in the desire to share their secret with anyone making the film. What I learned from the extras and effects software is the most reliable and effective, the camera creates the most professional look for the lowest price of any brand, where even the cheap air to get soft surgery. In this case, if I was unable to identify a product used for this particular product, I had been given several alternative alternatives. Wannabe film makers are unwilling to read a book about this issue as well to be good to see this DVD. <br /> <br /> Overall, I scored a real short score of 10 out of 6, but an option for feature length was potential and effort because I scored 8 or 9 scores in this field. I recommend it as a perfect example of what can be done with DVDs for its features and a single eight thousand dollars. Those who purchase DVDs can think of themselves as a ghost producer for a big project, the more attention the people get, the feature-length version gets as much funding as possible.
