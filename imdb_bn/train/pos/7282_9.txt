It was a very good film and it is absolutely inappropriate to judge without considering the time to be released. There are some movies that are not outdated, but it's quite old. However, when I was a boy and saw this photo for more than 20 years, the story was unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could be grateful for the DVD again. Actually, I think this movie is a matter of several chat and meeting issues where old boys talk about our opinion. Therefore when we finally had the DVD was frustrated and even had a little sense of sadness. First, there was a theory that how our generation was innocent. Second, I think there is more to it. I think this movie should be attractive to some modern filmmakers, especially those who pay attention to the worst kind of damage. This separation, the idea that gives logic to the film; The incidence of human rebellion creates a deeper horror than death and torture. I think how sickens the sensation was, when the giant rip cart's arm was out. And to the end; When the animal bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his vein. Another amazing thing is that the Morbid atmosphere that continues to lose intensity through all the scenes, even if there is no work done in a secret lab, in a lonely street where a male man's body is found, a stripper dressing room, and so on. Because it is not a good film, it can only be a reason for tech issues. For example, accident scenes and people may preserve their screwed head more accurately, created for others and modern second unit directors may be attractive. The same thing with all the action scenes including the cart's arm. In addition, the giant's make-up can be anything to do with. Some remakes have been good; I would think it was time to make an effort. However, black and white tones should be stored.
