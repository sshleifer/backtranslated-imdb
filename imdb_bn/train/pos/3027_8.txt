I see many movies, good, bad and lacking; Usually it is set in design, or a good character actor has some of the specific interest on the credible labor, or the ridiculously smile that arose from strangers watching forever. <br /> <br /> However, I was surprised to see this picture, which I have never seen before. Graham Greene must have translated the movie several times in such techniques as "The Man Man" and in fewer vehicles. "Secret Agent" is one of the few vehicles, but it leads to the adventurous aspects of Bacall and Bayer painting, in spite of the growing (inevitably) British and Spanish imperfections and almost complete existence of any chemistry. Lead two In some ways, this last "problem" actually begins to work on the film, why can love really love the death of a person involved in fascism and capitalism? The most compelling aspect of the film is directly derived from Green's complex and criminal psychology, which influences the film. I know some of the neutral passings as dull here, and I can understand that. Yet I found that instead of being separated from a clostrophobic globe, placing accentuated. By acting (though the boy is as unbelievable as normal, fatigue, sorrow, hope around the world, and directed for his great voice and directed to be excited by the desired eyes), I looked down and said, a quarrel with the people of a soft expectation against the world of persecution and money . What a thief What is good love in death? Where is the end of profit and the exploitation begins? The film is not promoted to the level of the industry and thus can not answer such questions, but it is more than just entertainment, and its murders and caves are drawn very seriously. The lack of the glitz, the story of "Bubble" helps to make this movie very effective with the help of "bounce". <br /> <br /> And finally nothing ends up happy, because history has ended.
