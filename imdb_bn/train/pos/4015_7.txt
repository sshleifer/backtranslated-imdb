Multiple Satellites Western All'Attiana, Johnny Uma is a novelty of many of the WiAIs created under this genre, and it is highly recommended for supportive or off-the-counter supporters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Johnny Uma, in most cases, is not a terrible root, but it does not actually count against it. The success of a series film depends on how well the audience fulfills the expectations and provides astonishing variation on these expected elements. Prior to this, the delightful experience is revived, but with the obvious (or major) twists providing the key interest. The execution value is, of course, important. Visiting visitors will be less successful in a tedious repetition than sincere efforts of moving. <br /> <br /> Based on this criteria, Johnny Yuma has been successful. The elements of the previous films have a lot of revisions. Setting up 1964-1968, the "Gothic family" of 1964-1968, like the Tempo d'Assassination (1966), was divided into many fates in the West, in the fierce semi-feudal marine world. This plot is a combination of the original Feast of Dollars (1964) plot and Rango movies, it is not surprising that the scriptwriter Fendio de Leo was both involved. In the 1960s-70s, popular film writer Lei was a popular singer to come out of Cinematography, and her work helped in continuation and continuity with continuity and continuity (some actors, directors, and screenlines with some individual personalities of some personalities). In the FOD plot, drama comes to the city, creates an acute situation, then dies through death, and after the resurrection (in some films such as Quilla Sparka Stella Nel West (1968) it is fully crucified). The Catholic initiative of story and symbolism is curious, especially for filmmakers and their underlying public / clear socialist bias. The Ringo Plot, a series of grilananojamera films, which is more fully developed by screenwriter Ernesto Gastei, a proud hero likes the interests of his community through the medium of interaction with a member of the community (a healthy dash of natural uncertainty). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Carrenne and Johnny is clearly dependent on Dollar Mookco / Martimar (1965). The gun belt exchange provides two views to understand in a clever dialogue and two. Various films, including The Umo a Umo (1968) or even El Chancho, Queen Sabe? (1967), use this relationship as a central dynamic for the plot, between an old and small man (father / son, old / younger brother, Anglo-Advisor / opponent and peasant revolutionary). In addition, there is a focus on hype and misdirection, brushed and mirror, that is the best repeat across WAI. Almania's canons and pawns have literally been brushed, through which the hero and head caps and head plays the game. <br /> <br /> Another WAI arranged together with the intelligent process of scripting to forward the plot to Johnny Uma, who uses distinction / psychological space. The dialogue was not very important at WAI and was often unreasonably unknown (I think there are exceptions such as Danojo (1966) or the Fazalis Faxia (1967). The emotional depth of the character has been almost completely economical. Through illustrations, it is logical and it describes the overall descriptive situation. See how severely from the ceiling or the retreat of action What is the presence of feudal feudalism? Feudalism and Pedro, by their confidence and confidence in their power through their discipline, hotel, or even the bedroom (this is again a theme from the FOD), finally, keep an eye on the search for information. Borrowed, which is ultimately based on the hard-wired mystery novel Red Harvest It sought posters, exaggerated conversations, surveillance from windows, false wings through contextual contacts, wrong identification and movement through waves made by T., or Pedro and Samantha works, the realization that this real and strange reality came forward in its conclusion. <br /> <br /> What was this movie significant for the time? Violence is felt as too much. Of course, these films were less violent than many American westerns. It was different from the mental intensity of violence and its causes which were blamed, which say that it was not cruel, but that means that has changed. Johnny Uma is the screenplay of unique and interesting and violence for his use and another interesting aspect of this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Artifact itself can have any internal value? A prehistoric site, a shard of cruse pottery, or some flint debit from a welding piece of leather and rusted metal ?? But it was noteworthy presence, life, which was only significant in the existence of which they existed. Although Johnny Yuma is the underlying value, most of its interest for me arises from this connection and mystery. <br /> <br /> Top Spaghetti Western List http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=21849907 <br /> <br /> Average SWs http://imdb.com/mymovies/list?l = 21849889 <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/mymovies/list For Fanatics (Below Below) L = 21849890
