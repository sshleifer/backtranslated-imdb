Last November, I had the opportunity to watch this movie at the Reno Film Festival. I say it was a lot of fun. As well as some technical errors, it was a great experience. I like writing and acting, especially the person who played the main role. There are many hearts in this movie, very intelligent. After doing this some of my filmmakers got the chance to talk to me, and they looked really nice. All of the movies were just a positive experience, and I'd definitely recommend it. The story was entertaining and cool, I'm going through similar problems like a woman, and I really understood her problems. The film has done a great job to give us sympathy for the people. The film's friends have been really well-written, they are realistic. I know such people, I just want friends of friends and when we talk, I can calm down like these people. The whole movie is really good, I hope there are more movies there. <br /> <br /> - Join
