I came with the worst expectation in the Nessie draw ... Someone's bad reviews. I thought: Although I did not read books, which I heard nothing like Nancy Drew. But I was wrong. Sure, it was not a carbon copy of the book, but when you create a movie, you need to fix it to entertain the big screen. This plot was a lot of fun and exciting, and I thought that Emma Roberts is credible on her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several fun moments, and unlike many statements, Nancy did not come as a dude at any moment in this movie. He was intelligent, conservative, humble and genuine. The film also worked together, combining the whole thing with the combination of comedy, romance, suspense and heartwarming moments. I like this movie. What a flick, what a flick! And if you are wise and agree to believe me and go see it, then be ready for some SCARY because I was disappointed, for example, I was disappointed! Watch it or a left-hand side and let other people decide what you think about this movie for you ... I'm almost mistaken. I love it, I own this movie! I still love Emma Roberts. He's like a mini Bree van de camp from the DH. Love it, love it.
