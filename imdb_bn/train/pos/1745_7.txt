Truly friendly, charming and sincere is this unpretentious old serial; I'm glad to see the old Luogsi. It is undoubtedly friendly and lively. Is it a long Lost lost craft documents. (Today's best TV series can compete with this old middle-order good serials.) Chandu is deeply, deeply optimistic and disciplined. It refreshes the mind. It's not stupid; Those stupid people who do not get the posts of those who work in the serial. Chandu has a strange, neutral and friendly funny idea. <br /> <br /> Not too much? Chandu is an unknown sorcerer who also goes through this past name and who loves and protects his brother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The poor sexy girl is actually abducted in a sarcophagus after sleeping with a flower ?? Abduction from a boat almost; By a stupid police; Lemuria Temple and its strange, weird events are similar to Kingong's images ?? And it's a brutal sunny RCC show and events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, he is a prototypical drunken uncle, naughty and cute and oblique. Could it be like a ugly respect instead of a logosi? Yet Borton Biopic Wood has left me this impression about Luigosi and it is related to a strong sympathy for the diminished actor. I enjoy the acting 'Lougosi'. <br /> <br /> This serial is hanging unjustly.
