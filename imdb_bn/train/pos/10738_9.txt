Speaker 9/11 is a very good and very realistic documentary about the attack on New York's French filmmakers in New York. This event is facing and most of it has been created. 9 ago / 11 gives something even really more like a movie scenario which really happened. It's just an overwhelming day on the attack day, but it will soon change. A filmmaker is going on the road with firefighters, he runs the first crushing flat film, the only footage of the first impact. He went to WTC with firefighters and went inside the building. In the second plane accident, people realize that it is not an accident. Later, we plan to save the firefighters as much as possible to save people. Meanwhile we hear the sound of playing, the words of these people who jumped from the tower and fell to the ground, this is the most serious moment of the documentary. Then the tower collapses and our French friend runs for his life. When he is out of the building, listen to a madness like a madman. Then there was a lot of storm and black screen on him, he was lucky to survive and now he can take pictures in downtown New York's empty streets. Because this documentary has received so many historical footage and because this movie was considered completely different because this documentary probably will be in everyone's memory. I have seen that these attacks were in the house because I was in the afternoon, so it looked more realistic. 10/10
