A few years ago I followed a soap on TV. So I was curious about this movie, and I was rewarded for getting it. It's a great ridicule of soap, jealousy, insecurity of normal actors, and all kinds of lovely over-the-counter types. But more than anything - an amazing welding and an incredible script. How did some of the leading actors playing in this kind of silly type movie? And how does this small movie writer get to write the perfect line? I did not hear anyone speaking about this movie or even hearing it, but it is incredible and I highly recommend seeing it. Occasionally I sit at home, and sit on the sofa, see, smile and enjoy the wonderful marvelous. Many congratulations to those who made it.
