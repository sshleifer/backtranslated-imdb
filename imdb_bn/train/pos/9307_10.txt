Not a movie for everyone, but this movie is my top 10. I'm a black comedy lover. The lines can not help but be dry, with a cast including Richard Dreyfas (vik), Jeff Goldlum (Mick), Larry Bishop (Nick) and Gabriel Bairn (Ben Bras Bell's London) Leeds. Support cast dead center around Counting minor flaws in the film: Allen Barkin's make up has rubbed her face; Joey Bishop and Richard Kiar were some of the Kyoyo, which did not work for any purpose and Michael J. Pollard's screen time was too short. Above all, cast was incredible without egos to destroy a good script. If you have seen Larry Bishop's (writer, director) movie, underworld (a dark crime flick) you will enjoy it. Hell Raid with his next guard (writer, director, actor) Michael Madsen and Quantin Tarantino.
