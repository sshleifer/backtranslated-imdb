I mostly do not see a movie or show, but this show touches a nerve in other sounds. I found the whole series at mysoju.com and thought that I was enjoying it in love so I could see. I was not frustrated at what I saw; I have been removed. This story is by the side of the tailor as the main character moves us through the scene. Sumi Iwaya, worried by Kwaki, has shown the nature of man, because he wants to prevent it from showing. Someone really wants to give their spirit in front of a perspective partner. So instead he replaced a man played by an adorable Matsumoto Jun as a pet. We will consider a pet like these pets in other pets. Difference; He can take revenge in the same way, all moms are a man, or a dog. He is behaving like a pet, he responds to situations in situations of how a dog responds. She spent time with a new boyfriend, momo got jealous. When he realizes that his pet is not just a pet that starts sexual activity between two people - Momo is a dancing force. His thoughts change gradually when we start to look at his own thoughts. Matsumoto began to see a character which is very rare at the beginning, two-dimensional when we see that he is a dancer, we look at three dimensional characters when we start reading him as a man, not as a dog but for his master. In my opinion, this character is only valuable to see this story for development. Plus Matsumoto playing Momo with such softness that you were almost one of those. Do not want to think about the future and how their relationship will change, but not like Momo (name will give him new dog name in his name)? We both knew that this would not be able to finish this. Watch this show with open mind, it's valuable.
