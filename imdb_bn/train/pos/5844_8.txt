This was my most favorite movie in 1948. Betty Grable's costume was so violent that I wanted to be big and dress like her. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., was a stranger to Hungarian Hunger Officer. This movie may appear for the first time, when I was eight years old, it seemed important to me about the relationship between men and women. I saw it again another day; I was surprised that it was still.
