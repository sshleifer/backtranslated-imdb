It's a written story of Mackin 's Batman City, and actually renews our heroes in a grand expedition and offers their TV show history. In contrast to Bradley and Patriz's family documentary films, we can not only look into the past and present life of Adam and Bart, but we can see them again. Adapted with Capo and Catmoney and Ridler, Batman returned in a good way, the story simply does not stop satisfactorily for our Batman series, but all the Hollywood tales fill modern fans that have heard them for 35 years. <br /> <br /> Quds !!!
