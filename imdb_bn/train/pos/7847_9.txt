Do not believe, within 12 minutes, the film (for 1912) is a full-length movie. Very few movies were more than ever before, but surely this strange little film does not distinguish them from others! No, what's different is that the actor (except one frog) is a bug ... Yes, bug! This simple little domestic comedy might have seen many backgrounds like Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy or Max Lindner, but instead, this Russian production uses bugs (or, think, models just look like bugs). Chaplin and Lorel and Hardy have not been discovered yet and I think Lyndar was busy, so perhaps they used the bug! Using stop-motion, removing bugs and dancing and fighting surprisingly - and 21 years later, a hack more real than King Kong! <br /> <br /> The picture is m. Begins to spend a good time with Beatles. When he visits a Buddhist club, his wife is supposedly waiting at home. But, unfortunately Mr. For Beetle, he was caught in camera by local film. Plus, he does not know it but Mrs Beetle also carries a Bohemian grassroots painter. Of course, there is more than this domestic comedy, but the plot is old and entertaining for adults and children. <br /> <br /> Strange but very amazing and worth watching.
