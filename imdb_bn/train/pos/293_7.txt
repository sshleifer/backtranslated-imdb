Do private detectives realize that they can be more confusing than being involved in spying on women? And most of the written conversations are completely inactive. <br /> <br /> But the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense. You can see the real people behind the real line. And the instruction is wonderful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Enjoy the friends very much
