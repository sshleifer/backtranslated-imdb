Before I hit the theater, this movie was getting very well trash and I did not have high hopes for it. I had another beautiful dance moves and a movie "Terrible Got Served" with awesome acting. I was in the theater and decided between and saw and loved Spartans. Acting for my surprise was not all bad and the movie was actually quite good. The fact that it has a lower rating than you've got to serve is absolutely ridiculous. Instead of hearing the rubbish posted here, I recommend to show a matinee of this movie so that you do not spend too much. I think that you will be surprised at how wrong you all have made. When it comes to dancing, it is certainly one of the better with a much better performance than the others. Go to the movies and judge go for yourself. I hope the ratings will increase after it's released in DVDs and more people will check the movie based on the comments before the movie's release. <br /> <br /> Edit this movie is now moving closer to the correct rating. More than 1000 people rated it 9 ratings, slightly more, but at least it helped to offset the ridiculous 1 vote.
