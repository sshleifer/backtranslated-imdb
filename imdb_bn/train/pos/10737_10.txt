If I did not know anything good, it seems almost like a stage, but it was not. It's perfectly set up, and amazing how they got all of that footage! The unfortunate events of September 11, 2001 are well documented and well-documented by a classic footage that makes it an unfortunate classic. It must only be seen for any American or person touched by the tragedy on September 11 in the history of the footage.
