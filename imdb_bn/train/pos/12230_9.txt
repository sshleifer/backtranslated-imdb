Mailing Man ... A tragic victim of the Space Race, he spoiled the gathering ... Never was this nation understood ...! <br /> <br /> A man (Boo Darling) burns his hand in the kitchen oven. Instead of shouting a little bit, a common man shouted, "Ayatech-koh !!" This movie you pop in ... is not a normal movie. You've taken your first step in Incredible Maling Man, a great 70-odd film with the amazing makeup effect of the famous Rick Baker. Baker was only on the verge of being a superstar, and at the same time did his famous "canteen alliance" Star Warse. For some weird reasons, Star Wars became a family name and did not have great mailing man. <br /> <br /> This image is simply mind-uncensored. From the opening credits ("Acting as an incredible mailing man in Alex Rebbe" ... which is really speaking!), Going through the glass door to a running lean nurse, going from the fishermen's head to the waterfall, and scattering a little graphically, this film is merely an ignorance The moment is available, provided. "Why are they ... but how he came ... why are they ...?" After a while, you are surprised, why not look at it like this and see it - a very entertaining piece. <br /> <br /> An astronaut comes back to Earth in molten, radioactive conditions; She ran and began to break her mind as well as to spit her body, a mad molten killings. The authorities quickly decided that the molten man must stop, but (perhaps not want to make "panic") want to hold him as calmly as possible. So they send a guy with a guitar counter after him. Wow, <br /> <br /> <br /> During the story, surprisingly little happens. The molten man wanders around killing people. A doctor searched for her with a geiger counter. Different characters are introduced, ask questions, and leave. Finally the doctor caught the mugged man, but for some reason the securityman shot him dead, he explained that he was "Dr. Ted Nelson". The melted man flew away and finally Gobe floated in a big Padma. The end <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is so intelligent that it is a lot of fun and ultimately end up till the end. Note that a WideScreen DVD release is planned. A very special movie.
