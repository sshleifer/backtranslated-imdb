Today's sci-fi thrillers are more powerful than giant-space ramboos, special effects (words like explosions in space vacuum). Although consistent with today's standards, the special effects of "banned planets" were very interesting for their time. Even today, they keep the suitability. Nevertheless, the best part of the film is probably the reason for the appeal of Radio Thrillers. What was happening most of the viewers were left to the imagination. (What was the appearance of the creature of the chelle?) None of the structure of the story became divided or finally, tensions and terror were covered throughout the film. The finishing was very thought-provoking and satisfying. In my opinion, it is still the best (if not the best) advertising films made.
