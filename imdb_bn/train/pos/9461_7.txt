Steve Carroll has acted as a person who can be related to real life with Dan, a movie that I do not like to like but I end up liking it. The movie does not smile funny smile, it's just a big heart. We all are like Steve Carroll, do not expect office fans to see from him, but you know, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Carroll star like Dan Barnes, a widowed father who does not really like girls. One weekend, he and his daughters came to see his family. Whilst there, he went to a bookstore and read for a woman. When he returned to his home, he wanted to know that his mate (driven by Dan Cook), this woman (driven by Juliet Binoch) is dating. <br /> <br /> Dan in the real life. A bit incredible. Are the Barnes family really a kind of person who exercises together and plays board games together and bunchs of other family items? I would be extremely suspicious that. I do not know any family. Is it stopped from a thumbs up to me? No. <br /> <br /> Dane in real life: *** / ****
