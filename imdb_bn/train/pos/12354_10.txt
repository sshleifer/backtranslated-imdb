A wonderful movie to watch the wonderful scenery and talented actors like Messa Shimizu and Nagiko Toure. After 15 minutes of observation, your eyes are locked on the screen and nothing else except breathing in the film's atmosphere, fate will lead to the character. This movie lets you leave your audience as an ideal audience, it accepts you, it makes you a part of the story ... clothing and settings are bright; Especially the Okayar district is built efficiently. It is certainly not very kurosa, but it still gets much from the master, especially the stylistic story saying that we are a landmark of the film that is far away from the Holivi≈°tis Flabbans.
