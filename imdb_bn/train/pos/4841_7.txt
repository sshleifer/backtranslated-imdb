In colonies we are not all familiar with Arthur Askey, so I often excluded this movie (which was recently its TCM preview), which I hope is very annoying because of negative comments about the presence of "ghost train" here. Instead I was pleasantly surprised to find myself in strange smiles. Asking what you will get if Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen have a child, Assye's comedy and the physical aspects of its period line up. He can not be compared to any other general complementary of this band Abbott or Comic Relief. Someone may think, moreover, 30 years after thread the connection to Askey from the British comedy; At least it is clear from an American perspective that he is here with the Monty Python Troop more common than any of his opponents. For the rest of the film - the more movies you watch, you'll guess at the end, but it's still pretty and atmospheric and waiting for the next look.
