I think it was a child as one of my favorite books and I wanted to read my 5 year old girl for some time. I knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and next day they passed our preview! We go home and read books in the afternoon so that we can compare. It was not necessary. The only thing in the book and film is the first name of the protagonists, it is a bet, and a whole lot of insects eat. Oh yes, I almost forgot that the child who cooks most of the worms likes to present their pronunciation with the French accent. How many kids are familiar with each other, how many children are involved, how to bet, how much worm will eat, what to do in the time limit, what to eat insects, how to cook, friendship progress, measurement view, etc., nothing is the same. But somehow, it does not destroy the movie for me. Characters are all enjoyable, and the film does not disappoint me. A word of caution for parents, one moment when you can breathe together in the room and Billy's younger brother referred to his dick as "Dili Dick". The shameful part came when my daughter started asking the people sitting around us, "Does anyone know what a dick dick?" Hah hah As foul mouthed as that and a temporary "silence up" this film gets. My daughter thought she could be sick around insects 3 and 4 (and in the case of empty pots only), but the pests were fine by 6. He and I both really enjoyed this movie and got excellent time sharing experience.
