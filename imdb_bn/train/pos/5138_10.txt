In 1994, I had a long holiday near July 4th - something like 17 days a day, which gave two week holidays, holidays and holidays. I used to stay in town at that time, hanging in my father's house <br /> <br /> I did not have my TV in my apartment so I would see my parents' tube. I ran to see a segment of xx files when a program called personal xx is called. I was immediately hooked. I was always fascinated by the things of my house which was inherited from my parents' family and relatives and was often surprised by their history, price etc. <br /> <br /> After my long holiday ... <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said that the series is being rebuilt and once the renewal is completed FX has been notified that personal information will be back in the air. <br /> <br /> It never happened! Personal FX was the first and the best of the collectionable show. And disappeared from the wind! About fifteen years later, I'm still tired. <br /> <br /> to go, FX
