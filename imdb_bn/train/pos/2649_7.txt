Walking with cavemen hosted by Alec Baldwin, for the last 5 million years, all the hominids (who are!) Looked at the species: who they were, what they were and how they died. Despite having a very interesting scientific point of view on the information we have on these species, walking with Cavannon tests makes us human. I waited a few weeks to see this, and I was not disappointed.
