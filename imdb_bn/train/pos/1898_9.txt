Hu's alcoholic drummer, Keith Chand's father, Arthur. I found a lot of similarities between Dudley Moore and Keith Moon in this movie. Liza Minelli, who was often surprised, did this job well and was able to turn Doodle Moore's cheek every time. Yes, I agree, Sir, everybody stole every scene. It was a very "different" movie, allowing viewers to see a glimpse of other lives. We often try to repeat this movie on satellite. God Dudley Moore rest; This was such a enjoyable movie. Many satirical and rich and snobby / rich thumbs down. Moore and Sir John's close friendship are rather respectful.
