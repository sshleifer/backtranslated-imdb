Cipher is a good film because it's not run-of-the-mill-si-fi flick. The artistic outlook is drawn in a dark scene and with a macro scene of what is happening. The close-up camera view keeps the manager confusing. The impressive aspect of the movie is the medium of movie plotting. The technology used in the movie is not very impressive, but the director uses Props well. <br /> <br /> Character development deliberately shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decided to immerse yourself in the world of spying. To the audience it is to portray its spiritual character and it is an indication that the audience is very interested in the end.
