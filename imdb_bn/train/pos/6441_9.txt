It's a great human drama that sparked my emotions and my imagination. <br /> <br /> It is a parable that revisits the life and death of Christ. Daniel is a highly gifted musician who has become physically and mentally tired of his career and has to leave it. When he joined as a singer in his church as a canter, he brought a transformation in the life of choristers, just as Jesus did in society in the first century Palestine. They smile, they begin to speak openly and truly to each other, their faults are exposed, they take each other, love each other, become an important community. The mentally challenged young man (toh) among them, as well as their <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I became laughable When stigge fires Daniel, there is a rebellion, and stig is crushed. Stig represents the Jewish authorities on the day of Jesus, whose strong demand to abide by the Jewish law, by the "golden rule" brought by Jesus, completely contradicts the new life. <br /> <br /> In a dramatic scene, someone announces "Discovering the Church Sin". Through the film, there is this contrast between the moral and the vital (living). <br /> <br /> True story of Christ, Daniel is killed by Connie, when he beats him, he drowns in the river. Next scene, we can not believe it when Daniel's (resurrected!) Body is in a white linen sheet (short!) Dragged into his chamber (covered with three women) in his cell (three women keep track of the cross) of the Gospel In). <br /> <br /> Daniele Lena is closely grabbed, the hot young woman who has been betrayed by a man of her love, and who is now extraordinary (who makes a close relationship with Mary Magdalin) - probably a high-class courtesy / prostitute Was). Through Lenara, Daniel loved, for what he wanted, and now finds fulfillment. <br /> <br /> Music by Gabriel Music by Daniel leads to concerns about sin, moral purity that leads to sin, and what is right and wrong. <br /> <br /> The final scene is like a mantra / singer / glazing together, grasping the big audience, illustrating our true human destiny and interconnection.
