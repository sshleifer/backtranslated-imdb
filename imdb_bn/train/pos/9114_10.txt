Considering the lack of industry with African movies (or black American movies). Idea hoods and vendor offers a multidimensional look to a community. But the fun thing is not all these focus or even the shorter things. But this is the unanimous claim of independence from these themes, which is the highest sticking The genre is unique and not usually expected. This is almost the departure that holds the eye first, so it is critically important to see twice. The film is an aesthetic quality that lends itself to the true art of the film itself. <br /> <br /> And it is a real art which is extremely rare with an African voice. The film does not duplicate its message, it invented and provokes fine alphabet (not ethnic but character-based stereotype), from the point of view of the film, the film is bright. It includes a very quick character development which carries multiple messages. It is important to remember that this film is less than 10 minutes and it instantly moves the character to set. Color textures and music are appreciated. But 500 years after director Oven Alik Shahadah, after the last attempt, think of the song. But from a theme point it seems to be a departure, but the irony eludes indirectly from a social problem ?? Bright things!
