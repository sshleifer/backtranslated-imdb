I was frustrated and confused when I saw this movie, and ultimately, I want to give this film a difficult 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and in all places and too much. Even my ADD can not be kept. It felt like a little acid trip. Everything looked flat, there was some level. There were many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the film midway and wanted to break my burned copy of this movie. But after watching this I went online to read the film and before watching I should have done a little research on this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A small boy, Brendan, has been given the task of writing new pages set in the greatest ever book of all time. This book will contain information that will help "change the light into the dark". Brendon lives in the village of Kells, behind the huge stone wall. As a result of the 8th century, Brendan's uncle, Kells's Abbott, is trying to build a wall to keep the Vikings out. Brendan's uncle said he would help complete the wall, but a traveler and guardian of "book" secretly trained Brendan for his artistic skills and firmly believed that he would complete the "book" and complete his term. <br /> <br> When I saw the whole movie I thought I lost something because I did not understand what was really happening. I think I was just missing a piece of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me the need to know about the original book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion about the film has changed drastically. <br /> <br /> Copy of the first few books of the New Testament written in the Latin language by the Galic fans of Ireland in the 8th century of Kells. . It is nicely illustrated in paleographic and inward scripts as well as in vague art, an artistic artistic form for its complexity, complexity and miniature images. Most of the books in the book of Kells were portrayed because there were plenty of art in the time, plains and levels challenged without any perspective. But the Kells book comes out of one of the most basic pieces of art that uses a lot of colors. <br /> <br /> The mysterious mysterious color of Kells. I basically thought the animation was flat and annoying. This reminds me a lot of cartoon Samurai Jack, who was looking at a flat and "Amin" looking at it. Once I was able to know about the art style of book kelly, it is obvious that the styles of the books matched the film. There are different shapes that live in lines and swirls and Brendan's minds. Whenever he goes to his imagination, the filling of the curtains of the circular shapes of the sun, the cows, the clock and the wheels starts. The screen edges are created in running triangle or circles. The color of the transformation, and the Celtic knot are filled. From tree to floor, many things in this world are covered in size or design. Clocking to the debt of less than 70 minutes, the Secret of Kells is a little boldly thrown into a funny little history lesson and people interested in silliness (probably just children). I think one should generally dig half pieces of art, half of the film about history should be excavated open from the Kells of Secret. Despite showing it looks like animated with Adobe artists, it's a very nice looking movie. But based on 20 films submitted for Oscars consideration, I do not think Mary and Max are eligible to be nominated. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com
