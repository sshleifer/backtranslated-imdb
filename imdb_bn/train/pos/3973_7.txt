It's an entertaining "history" FBI, but it should look as fiction, because it's exactly what it is. J. It may happen when Edgar Hoover personally had a reduced role in personal approval and production. James Stewart is excellent, as usual and supporter cast, good except for miles without dazzling dull. Murray is a partner in Hamilton Stuart's partnership and a helpful role as the best friend is particularly good. The FBI achievement that highlights the film is undoubtedly all true. <br /> <br /> The most shameful part of the film is the depiction of the murder of John Dealing. It is portrayed as much as it happened, but the head of the Chicago Bureau, who headed the operation, Melvin Purvis, all mentioned nothing. Instead, the operation was illustrated as the fictional chip hardstick was playing it. After Duler's death, Pervez received the news that Hoover was envious of this campaign; Purvis was later transferred to a remote postpost, and soon after the rest of the FBI. There is no doubt about why this film of Parvez has never been mentioned. But at least, this viewer felt that if this behavior is done with Parvees, then what can be said about all agents operating in all other activities described in the film. They are completely ignored and replaced by the legendary hardstyche. <br /> <br /> At the end of WWII, this film is probably correct in the FBI's illustration of activity. However, at that time, the film will believe that the only threat to facing America is from international communism, which there is no doubt about Huawea's belief. Do not miss the mafia. Do not remember the lynchings that are still going south. Do not be afraid of blacks to vote from most southern voters, do not remember. I did not know whether FBI Martin W. Luther King was wartering during the film's creation, but if not, then it was not long after it started. <br /> <br /> I said, at the beginning, it is quite good entertainment, but it should be seen that it is as sanitized fiction.
