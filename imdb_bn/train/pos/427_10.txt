One of the best ensemble acting films I've ever seen. Plots do not have much, but acting - incredible. You see the characters change so subtly ever, Renting Villa in Italy, and love down. And the feeling of happiness The film carries a messaging spell on you, as much will of the will of all women. Really "enchanted".
