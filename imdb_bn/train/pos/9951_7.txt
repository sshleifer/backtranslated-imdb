If you ever wondered why they are not obsessed with a plot, then see Dream Quest. On the one hand, you have to give Armstrong credits to try to capitalize on this concept and use this powerful strong cast for some name strength. On the other hand, it is very quick to see why most of the pornographic tabs do not interact with sex scenes for more than 15 to 20 seconds. These people can not work easily (and the story, unfortunately, hair until the humorous degree). However, I gave it a 7 because it was an excellent effort and did not feel much more than an attempt to cut corners. Also, I'd like to see more effort like this. Maybe someday I'll see the perfect combination of pornography and plot.
