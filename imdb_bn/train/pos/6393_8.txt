It must be seen for an independent movie fan, but it also highlights the mainstream films. I think our next Woody Allen is ready to wear <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And yet this movie keeps you holding and never lets go. The screenplay is a bit bizarre, yet the actor and the director shut it down with complete reality. It has humor, it has conspiracies, and it has pathos, and it all works together. <br /> <br /> No description of the details. If you want to see a freedom <br /> <br /> Masterpiece, see a virtual lesson for creating a low budget flickr that really works. <br /> <br /> - Oh yes, it's also really entertaining. <br /> <br />
