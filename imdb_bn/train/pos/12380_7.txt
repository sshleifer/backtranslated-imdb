NYC model Alison Parker (Cresina Renaissance) rents an old brown stone room where she meets a few of the wicked neighbors and gives some terrific confusing experiences. Lawyer Michel Lurman (Chris Sarandon) went on to investigate on behalf of him, struggling to maintain a toll on his physical, mental, and mental health, referring to his affection (not referring to his wishes). <Br> <br /> I do not want to waste good moments for the unexpected people with this mental horror film. The story is interesting and entertaining, but the film does not offer much for real horror aspects. Or, in that case, any atmosphere. It's calmly uncomfortable, but it's not like the traditional horror movie. It is a story of a problematic woman's effort to deal with increasing inconsistency in her life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a scene with Beverly Di Angelo which will be believed). Show some gore, but not too much. An unexpected music score by Gill Mellel joined the frustration. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers will complete without evaluating this movie without evaluating it for the collection of valuable actors. Many of them are not able to do too much, but it's exciting to see them all together. Eli Wlach and Burgess Meridith, respectively, make the biggest impression as a hard-nassaid detective and a polite neighbor. Other legend names include Jose Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy, and Awa Gardner. Future stars such as D'Angelo, Christopher Walken, Tom Berena, Jeff Goldblom show a brief appearance and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbatch, Silvia Miles, William Hickey and Martin Barsamsam. Anyone who was a casting director for this film, would like some kind of award. <br /> <br /> Written for the director Michael Winner's screen, perhaps famous for the "Death Wish" series with Charles Branson. Jeffrey Convitt's novel. <br /> <br /> I will not consider this really awesome horror thriller but its moments and proper entertainment. <br /> <br /> 7/10
