When the gundam 007 became the movie trilogy, most of us were familiar, most of it was mere steps and others were few. This is the opposite of the opposite of OVA. Although there are only half a dozen episodes, it is not full of action, but mental things. These two main verb sequences, I believe, are enough to satisfy me. After watching many Gondam series, movies, and the OVA, I was fully prepared for the Civil-Esquier film. This is the movie that did a fantastic job. How this film stands is the good and the bad people on both sides of the war. It seems that Geun is more humane than actual movies where they are portrayed as the second emergence of evil Nazis. Most people who do not like anime that I was forced to watch this movie (LOL), liked it. So, I'll only recommend it to many people for anti-war stories. If you are a fanatic fan and do not see it, you will not have to read it; You should already be watching it at this moment.
