When this first came out, my father came home - we were surprised at it - different from what we saw earlier. I was looking for a specific movie last night, and I found out again "Minds Eye". The box is completely broken, and the tape is still working! Although this is not a 'Nemo Finding' quality graphics, it's still very good. They should be sold again - it's a landmark for computer animation images. Highly recommended! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Came through. Travel exciting day and future in the wonderful world with exciting computer animation images. <br /> <br /> Fantastic, original music soundtrack with more than 300 imagery of the world's most talented computer animation artist. This unique collaboration brings you an incredible ride on "Minds Eye".
