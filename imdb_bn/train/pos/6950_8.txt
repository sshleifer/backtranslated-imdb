The President of California, from midnight to 1:00 pm on the preliminary day, spy Victor Rovner sent a message to Kuala Lumpur from the US to the United States. Meanwhile, the Federal Agent Jack Bauer in Los Angeles returned to his family and was in trouble at his home in Kibbler's house, who blamed his mother Teri for throwing Jack out of the house. Terry and Jack have decided to have a serious conversation with Kim, and they discover that the girl has fled home. While trying to solve his own domestic problem, Jack was called by his colleague Nina Mairers to meet his Chief Richard Walsh, his Counter Terrorist Unit, who expressed his adversity against Senator David Palmer's life, who is running for President and they have to find the shooter. Later, Walsh had a personal conversation with Jack and said that the agency has a conspiracy against David Palmer, and ordered to find out the conspirators. When an airplane explodes in the Moï¿½ve Desert, Jack is concerned about an additional problem. <br /> <br /> The first episode of "24" is a promising startup for the successful series, which introduces Jack Bauer. The first time I saw this show and I admit that I liked what I saw: a complex and dramatic story, with multiple and realistic characters. Caiaphor Schuurland is the role of a family person and at the same time perfect as the perfect agent of three difficult missions: Find a killer to protect an important politician; Find his agency a traitor; And finds her teenage daughter, who is trying to save her marriage, when she is suffering. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "12:00"
