This is one of my favorite martial arts movies from Hong Kong. It is John One's first film and one of the few traditional martial arts films he has directed. You can see its effect from working under the Chang-Cher in this film. The action is good, the war dancer is displayed as one of the bad guys in the film which is directed by Fong Hack. It is a full-fledged web of "Five Genome" fame and known to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers Productions. The story lines are interesting, there are some decent conspiracy twists and the characters build up and their relationship with each other is done cleverly. This image only releases a VHS in the UK. Media Asia has released a Region 3 DVD and has a version of the DVD available from the United States. The film is beautiful to watch in its original language or its English dubbed version. I highly recommend this movie.
