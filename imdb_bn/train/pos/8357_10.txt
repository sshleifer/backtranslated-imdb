A wonderful, free-flowing, often popular songwriter, who shakes with you, can ever smile, even if there really is a frustrating thing along the way. There is a Gospel on the way of women's behavior and finally they seem to come very well and it has a lot of credit to all concerned so that all the potentially crispy scenes work very well. This is probably Depardieu's best performance, of course its most natural. Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly at least what will play strong sex scenes with at least half of her age and have a very solid role to play. Miou-Miou has to play lovely and again very difficult to play. Initially it seems like a down and messy misogynist rant / romp but as the story and characters emerge a much more flexible and honest picture emerges. Ultimately this claim to respect the inconsistent and brave film.
