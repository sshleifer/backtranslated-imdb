Wow was a great Italian "Jumbo" movie by these two great directors Lucy Florchi ("Jimmy") and Bruno Mattie ("Hell of the Living Dead"). Lucio started the film and got sick so that Bruno took great and it turned out. If you get shocked by the "Live of the Living Dead" directed by Bruno Matty, you will look fantastic and if you have watched "Jhoomee" directed by Luizi Flori and have chosen both of them, you must definitely see the "Zumbi" makeup wicht look great " Zombie "is a great" zombie "flying head! And "zombie" birds throw acid on you and you "zombie" (it only stops people in two), but they are mainly poisonous dead bodies like "bruno matis", the toxic "zombies". So if you like an Italian "zombie" movie or just "zombie" movie, then it's a great Italian "Zombie" movie!
