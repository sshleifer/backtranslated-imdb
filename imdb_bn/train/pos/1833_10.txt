Here the original story is that Aditya (Kumar) is the dear son of a millionaire, God (Bachan) who is the owner of the toy industry, in his eyes Aditya's mother Aditya can not make mistakes, Aditya's mother Sumitra (Shefali Shah) warns to bring God before it is late In the responsible office, because God is lung cancer patient and he survives only for 9 months, when his son becomes stricken and marriage to Mitali (Chopra) God easily apologizes to Aditya, but happy couple Aditya and Mitali return from honeymoon, Mitali becomes pregnant, and forced God to blame Aditya outside of this house, Aditya does not know that his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he does not even know That his father kicked him from the hose to make him more responsible, God himself is hungry and pregnant Up wife, adityake can not make long. It is a nation against time, so Aditya can do whatever he can to prove himself to his father, and at the last moment Aditya gets a break in the film industry and his father tells him that he is dying. <br /> <br> This film is absolutely brilliant, Bollywood industry needs this success of Indian cinema, Shah's guidance is almost shameless, but there is no error in the movie? If this film is the best film, then the father is the son-in-law of Tierjekar. The song's interconnections have been fixed at the right time, the scenery is good, only in this part where the film fails, the jokes in the bombshell Iranian and Rajpal Yadav are too long and later they are boring, but overall it is a brilliant movie, I read this review and regardless of the other reviews I would advise anyone to see it. 9/10
