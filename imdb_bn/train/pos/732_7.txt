Well, I've finally figured out "Rock NN Roll High School", almost 30 years after it became the first midnight movie sensation in 1979. (I'm going to look at this new documentary, "Patty Smith: The Dream of Life" Near 2040!) And no, the movie does not feel a bit, and yes, the price was worth it.

Besides, Ramones was one of the most powerful bands in the concert I've ever seen, so I was very happy to get along with English subtitles for this DVD's hearing of the film. There is no need to punks how old this subtitle is necessary, I wonder ....
