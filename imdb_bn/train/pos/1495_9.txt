It's a remarkable Amicus horror math, with 3 great stories, and superb acting !, only the last story is frustrating. All characters are awesome, and the film is quite cool and suspenseful, plus Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee this is simply amazing! It is very underrated and the third of my favorite stories will be "sweet sweet", as well as all the characters are very desired. Its a little predictable, and the last story was incredibly frustrating and rather soft, but the end was really cool! It's an extraordinary Amicus horror bibliography, 3 great stories, and superb acting, only the last story is frustrated!, I'm sure it must be seen! <br /> <br /> 1st story ("killing method"). This is an extraordinary story, with great suspicion, and the killer Dominique is really vague, and it has played very well! This was the perfect way to start with a story, and in most cases it is unpredictable, plus double packaging suddenly, and quite annoying! Grade A <br /> <br /> The second story. ("Wax action"). Along with the wonderful performance, this is a strong story, but the end is quite predictable, but it is still unclear, and quite a bit mysterious, Peter Cushing did an extraordinary job, and I could not believe how young Jose Auland was, I really enjoyed this story! Grade b <br /> <br /> third story ("sweet sweet"). This is the best story here, because it is extremely vague, and unpredictable, it also has a nice twist! Christopher Lee has done an amazing job, and Cloe Franks has done a wonderful job as a young girl, plus the last end to be surprised! I do not want to waste it for you, but one of the best horror stories I saw it! Grade A + <br /> <br /> 4th story ("clock"). This is a terrible story that is really weak and vague, Jon Pertwe bothered me, but till the end, I was a little surprised, and Ingrid Pete was always cool, but it was only vague, and long ago and where was the creativity of the plus? Grade D <br /> <br /> Directions are great! Peter Duffel has done great work here, great camera work, great angle, adds some obscure environment, and holds the film at a fast pace! <br /> <br /> acting extraordinary! John Brian is great here, as the narrator, he had some great lines, I just wanted to have the time he was in the screen. John Bennett was as good as Diet, and was quite intense, he was especially good at the end!, I loved him a lot. Scarlet Eliot Charles was as nice, he was weak, scared, was very liked, and I liked his facial expressions, he shocked! Joanna Dunham is stunning fantastic !, and with the wife as she wanted to do, she was great chemistry with Denholm Eliot! Tom Adams was incredibly vague as Dominic, he was looking obscure, and got the job done very well! Peter Cushing is always as amazing, and amazing here, he was liked, focused, charming, and as always, had a ton class! (Cooling rules !!). Josh Ackland is always fantastic, and I looked so young, I rarely recognized him, his pronunciation was not so thick and I played a different role that I liked it! (Act of the Act). Wolff Morris is unclear here and did what he has done. Christopher Lee is always as amazing and amazing here, she was incredibly intense, very attentive and always had that kind of sharp look on her face, especially at the amazing end! (Lee rules !!). Come on adorable as the daughter of Franks, she's a bit unclear, and one of the best child performances that I've ever seen! I liked her. Nairi Don Porter was nice and nice as the babysitter, I liked him a lot! Jon Pertwee bothered me here, and was quite bland, and completely unfunny, he was not chemistry with Ingrid Peat! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful, and its normal vampire thing and it's good! <br /> <br /> Fine the rest of the cast. Overall a must see! **** out 5
