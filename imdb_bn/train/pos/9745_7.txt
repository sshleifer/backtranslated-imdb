Someone else commented, it's a feeling-good movie. It got glorious scenery and the wonderful voice of Luciano! I have seen this movie many times and seen this afternoon again. I forgot that Nawuan sang Dwaram's pawrto and I had to get out of the CD! It's a great movie just far away when fun and engrossed in reverie. Eddie Albert is the agent and grand as a bit at the top, but all the agents are just like that. The Italian countryside is gorgeous but nothing is the top of the balloon ride for the perfect view. If you need to play Olivier ratios, this movie is not for you. If you just want a flight fancy and some wonderful music, watch this film. Just have fun
