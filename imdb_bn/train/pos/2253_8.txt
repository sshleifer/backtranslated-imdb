I hired this movie because of my interest in America's history, and in particular the strange story of Mormons. Trying to give some idea about this image can make Joseph Smith turn his "vision" into a major world religion. This first focuses on their settlement problems in Eluyut in the first instance. This is Joseph Smith's trial image. During that trial, Brigem Young spoke about his transformation towards Germanism and Smith's faith in spiritual messages. Then Smith was killed, and the young man must confront his new doubts whether he was elected to the Mormons leadership in a new land. Despite his serious doubts, he perseveres, and eventually has a vision (that is the place for Utah for his colonies) which gives him confidence on the accuracy of his leadership. Later, after the crops were destroyed by the cricketers, he again doubted that he was truly elected - but a miracle happened that cemented his place in history. <br /> <br /> I see to move towards performance, and the story is believable and interesting. I want to know that Mormon believes that this is an accurate screenplay. A part of the plural story, but it is not raised why it is not the center of LDS. This issue is not stressed. <br /> <br /> I'm sure people from this movie should be away from their religious content, but it's a great cast and will keep your interest in it.
