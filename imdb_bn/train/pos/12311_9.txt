"Chinese Ghost Story" is one of the most amazing Hong Kong movies I've seen. It's a brilliant mix of imagination, comedy, romance, horror, and martial arts. This movie has some amazing scenes and amazing fights. I especially love to watch the thighs between the mother and the tree's monster tongue. Essentially original and refreshing film and other embalmer's fine recommendations.
