I enjoyed this movie for quite a while. Firstly, it gives insight into the world of North Island's loyalty, which is rarely treated in film, most of which tell about our democratic struggle. The second reason is that actors played. I thought they gave a very honest and strong emblem of the honest Underworld that many people did not listen to me outside my local edge. Finally, it is an entertaining genre film that stars stars from anyone. North Irish cast cast It can not move the world, although it can open the eyes of some people in the scary world of obedient domains.
