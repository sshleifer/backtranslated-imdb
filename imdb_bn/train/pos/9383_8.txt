Filmmaker 'Last Seduction' and 'Kill I again' director Noor Styles came to another movie. John Dahl created a special place for himself through blackmailing in the early 90's by making movies in adultery themes. Although I had no opinion about the last temptation. But nowadays, Mr. Dahal has used to conduct television shows. Shame from him was the talent of the people. <br /> <br /> *** Spirir ** This is a fascinating movie that walks around a drifter cage), which comes in Wyoming town for work. But he was not lucky and proved to be wrong for Barcelona's barther JT Walsh's hit-man in Texas. He was given the task of killing his wife (Boyle). But the cage decides to split it after receiving upfront payment without doing it. On the way out of the city, he accidentally hit a man in the street, then he returned to the local hospital. At that time Cage eventually eventually met Walsh, who seems to be the local Sheriff. After that cage escapes from his clutches but being really Dennis Hooper that is combined with the people who hit. <br /> <br /> John Dahl has co-written and directed with this movie. Therefore it shows that a project may be appropriate when a director keeps his mind on the screen. Good quality, but while watching the film I got ready for the TV movie. The frame was very close up. But it does not prevent the movie from being an enjoyable experience. The movie was in good speed and the structure was perfect. The script was written by Dahlangghat for a good time. <br /> <br /> The cage actually portrays the role as a drifter, although I had some moderation in its performance. His face was the expression sign. Lara Flin Bowle was hot and fully operated her part as femme fatale. Her hairstyle was too far and any guy on her knees could go. Hooper played well in his part. But I think he was miscast for this role. He did not convinced me that he was entitled to the qualities of Hit-Man. The role was not kept in mind with his personality. <br /> <br /> If you see a person, you will find the latest films 'The Hot Spot' and 'Perfect Murders'. That is the reason that some sub-plots are similar. Overall, if you're a silent film fan, it's for you. Valuable recommendation 7/10
