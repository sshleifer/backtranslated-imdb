I hate to read reviews that say, 'Do not waste your time, this film falls on the ice.' It's still not that critics for me, it can be some kind of naive charm. If you like the other 'Wisler' series of films, it will be a watch. If you like the 40's silent movies, it will be a watch. <br /> <br /> This picture has been played as a hero of Richard Dix as a series entry as before. It is too slow, and the plot is trite. You've seen this same spoken device used in other similar movies and generally better. <br /> <br /> But the performance is good, and the light and the dialog are also so. It is only due to the lack of energy and the fact that whatever you are doing will come out properly and eventually tell how it is going to last. <br /> <br /> 'Hosteller' series is semi-silent, and character, mood, light, camera movement, and corners are more important than stories. But this picture is not new. It's very light weight and innocent Hollywood for that. In previous films, Richard Dix's character or any of his women did not end well. You just did not know until the end. <br /> <br /> However, I still recommend this for a visit. I saw myself at least twice, and got it in a reasonable amount from both times.
