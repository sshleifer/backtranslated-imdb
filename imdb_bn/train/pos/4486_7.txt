SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Tom and Jerry are a classic cartoon, with a flawless idea, and a gem of almost every single short. Although I would certainly say this is a inferior short compared to this other classic Tom and Jerry shorts, there is no way you can hate this cartoon. Of course, it is understood that this is one of the first Tom and Jerry mountains, and I can say that I agree, but this is Tom and Jerry's episodes, but some are better than others. Well, this "fit into others." <br /> <br /> Here is the plot of Faridi Cats. Tom heard an old scare radio broadcast, and became scared easily. Jerry sees how much he is afraid of, and is even more afraid. He created horrific hesitation for Tom and Tom was frightened by his wit and his life. Jerry then puts a sheet on a vacuum cleaner and controls it, thus making it a Scratch like vacuum makes. Tom finds out that Jerry did all this, and behind him. Tom then accidentally bites the maid at home. By the end, however, Jerry was finally scared to see his reflection in an Ace Cup. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's far away from Tom and Jerry, but it's still fun and time-consuming pieces. It was more cartoon like me. Tom and Jerry are famous in this slapstick and gags this short as well, but this feeling was missing. It felt most slower than Tom and Jerry shorts. However, this is a good summary that many Tom and Jerry do not live in cartoons, but it's still beautiful. <br /> <br /> 7/10
