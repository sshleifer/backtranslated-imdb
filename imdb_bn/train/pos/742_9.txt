The age of the movie is quite normal these days. "Fox" really gave its money for 1980. Jodie Foster plays her character directly. As he did "taxi driver" four years ago, he has a strong character in his film. She is a high school teacher who was a lot of laughing and she seems to be coming out of any situation. Brad Bio plays Brad Way before playing "Happy Day". She is considered defective by other girls. Cherry Curie Annie, hanging with the wrong crowd, followed by his police father. Jenny and her three friends decide not to live on the wild side unless they go to a rented house where the party comes out completely. The other side of the track may be fun or dangerous to explore life. Whenever he was lost, Jenny and Brad were saved all the time. In fact, an accident happened where he died. And one older man gets married. Growth is not easy, sometimes how we find life. In fact, you have to be cautious about the people around you. For me, I was my own person, and I tend to stay that way! Great music, great plot, this movie is a jewel! 4 out of 5 stars!
