This is my most favorite movie in the world !!!!! I enjoyed it at the age of 4 and I still enjoy at 16 !! This is an absolute masterpiece! Any video collection is complete without it !!! I enjoy it every second and only the film does not have any special effects, but it gives a great message to the audience of young people who can actually be seen, but actually this movie is really curious! Although Michael Jackson has now acted in the previous movie, people still do not see him as an actor. Actually I know the most talented actors! He's so talented! She is incredible !!! Mowwalla must be seen !!!!!!
