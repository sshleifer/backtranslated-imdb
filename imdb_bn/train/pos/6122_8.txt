This film is absolutely delightful. Originally, the plot revolves around a serial killer, in some way the B-film becomes a snowflake through chemical accidents. Then he heads for the city and started locals terrorists. He tried to stop him by trying to get the local police chief and some other characters. It is made in a grassroots budget and it certainly shows, but the great thing about this movie is that it knows its junk. Due to the development of staphofoam and polystyrene, demon killer Snowman is a classic, and it is clearly intended - this is one of the few movies that can be seen as the main selling point of his budget. There are some funny comedy moments alongside ridiculous accents - fear of death of a father in the beginning of the voice and fear of death of a father and the right-wing rape scene is committed in the film. Excellent tacky fun
