When we decided to join a movie festival in Boston, I and I were returning home from the North East (mainly Massachusetts) travel route. Now, I do not know much about the film so I thought it could be a little lesson. The first movie we saw was this, Romeo Department. Now, I do not know about you but I thought it was great! I'm from Texas and I do not see where we come from, so we can not see a lot of motion picture, so it's a wonderful surprise. My mother insisted that it was very violent, but said that I did not know much about what she was saying but that was a great picture. I was great shocked by the sequence of battles. Also, when the good people win I am a big fan, so Romeo women are thrilled to kill all the bad guys. This was true brightness. I'm not sure when the video is released but if you get the chance you will have to test it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. Although a word to the wise, it is rather violent and very playful words so that you do not want to see your children. It's more for adults.
