Well, magic works in mysterious ways. The film was about 4 prisoners, tried to run away with the help of spellings made by other detainees a few centuries ago, a wonderful ending and a fantastic secret thriller with many mysteries. Even if there is something in the theater-game (almost everything will happen in the cell) it is not boring and it played very well. In the "frequent" practice you are trapped with letters and even if they were criminals, you developed some sympathy, only to change your mind through the stories. Some events catched you off guard and madness in the air was always a touch. Fairly intense and entertaining and I did not expect anything (a friend hired it), it was a positive surprise!
