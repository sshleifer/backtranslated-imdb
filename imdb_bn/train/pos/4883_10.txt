We, as a family, were so happy with 'The Last of the Blonde Bombshells' that we bought a copy for our home video library. <br /> <br /> There are many favorite actors and singers in the cast A1 and cast. The theme is unusual and the script is well written. Music / Songs are timeless and come back to our youth when we sing songs on our voices. To plot the story here, the 'plot' will be confiscated because it is really nice to sit down and enjoy the story to enjoy the story. <br /> <br /> This is the most full of the most enjoyable and raised product and we sincerely recommend that anyone is looking for a belly-smile and lots of music.
