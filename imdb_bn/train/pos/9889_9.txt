Read Eric's review again. He totally described my own feelings for this photo that I could never do. I'm here to encourage you to see more here and see here. <br /> <br /> I have seen on TV several years ago, IFC thinks I This is a unique movie that I do not hesitate to compare. It was portrayed in North Mexico somewhere in the uninterrupted islands of Coquila / Jacketcas / San Luis Potos√≠. It's a real starcraft and wild location rather than a Sadona-like Durango, Mexico (John Wayne films). Now I need to find the novel to test the actual location of the story. Like the location, this movie is not weird and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not everyone. It's a kind of production that often inspires me to read the film. <br /> <br /> I did not really forget this movie, it's impossible. Yet, for several years, I forgot its existence. I do not know if anyone saw it, it was never read, or it has not seen any reference. Erendira such an unusual name, I even forgot the title. Well, I want to buy a copy now. <br /> <br /> ** The above post became a huge fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and so sorry she never read before. <br /> <br /> related to Messith's comments; The film was filmed in Mexico, but the writer did not comment on Colombian and Mexican or Mexican history by any means, although still living in Mexico for "political" reasons. This story is universal. <br /> <br /> I'm still trying to find a copy of this picture for my library. Love the movie You will read the story and then wrote all other Garcia Marquz. And, however, the main location of the story was in Colombia.
