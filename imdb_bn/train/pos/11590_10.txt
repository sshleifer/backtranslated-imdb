Oh, in the sixties. There were some interesting films. I was more than movie gear then. Instead of going to the theater now I enjoy renting movies and entering into my house. I saw this little film, "The Legend of the Boy and Eagle". I have been searching for this film over the years. It was really inspiration. Surprisingly, I was finally able to gather more information from your site. Thanks ........ I was surprised that this little picture was open for a Disney photo. I did not think too much of Disney film. I did not even remember that it was an opening film for Disney. I really want to show them at this time on TV. Do you have the right to this photo? Is it available on DVD? All of these generations must be seen !!!
