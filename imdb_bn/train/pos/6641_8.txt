On December 28, 1852, while writing himself the history of the film in the Grand Cafe in Paris, Louis Lumiare showed his short films, all solo show exhibitions to the audience. 'LaSorte des Eugène Lumiere' was the first movie and I had the desire, not only to watch the film but also to the audience's reaction. <br /> <br /> We start with the closed door Lumière factory. Apparently, since the image appears to be a picture, people thought that they were going to watch only a slideshow, not something they expected. But then the door is open and people are streaming out of the headline, home. The first woman, then a man, and a man with a big dog on a big dog. <br /> <br /> This is not the first picture (some say, 'El' Archie de a Train à La Quatat 'was the first movie Lumiare Record), it's an impressive piece of the first movie. Bored by this is going to be impossible for many reasons. A simple reason: it's only fifty seconds long. But for those who like special effects films, there will be something interesting here; You do not get to see historical things like this.
