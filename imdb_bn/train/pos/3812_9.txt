This is a real eye candy. A world of floating islands and flying ancient cities is a world made. The giant monsters who are trying their best to attack the cathedrals on their opponents ... who can resist? An ancient prophecy, a bunch of excited heroes and a cute princess in search of his hero ... the familiar word ...? Yes we heard that song before. But looking at the spectacular philosophy you will forget <br /> <br /> After leaving the movie you will be interested in a little more story. <br /> <br /> What's behind the circle of 30 years? What happened to the night mad? Who created all these fabulous monuments, castles and cities ... and why are they falling apart? And where is the man besides a bunch of farmers? Really, this picture seems so impressive, but it's no lord of the ring.
