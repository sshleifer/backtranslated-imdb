Characters and stories line love. Very fun with lots of action. Thomas Ian Griffith and Tia Carr gave amazing performances. I enjoyed Griffith and Carrier dynamic and humorous interaction. Donald Southland is a very likable, and surprisingly sympathetic, hits people burned. All three actors made this movie in my favorites and for a special behavior being them. A great addition to my extensive DVD collection I highly recommend this movie. If you want ... Mr. and Mrs. Smith, The Replacement Killers, L.CoPony, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Abyss and the Hole Nine Years ... you like this movie.
