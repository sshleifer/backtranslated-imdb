This film shows from the point of view of a French French girl from Cameroon in North America, whose father is an official on the colonial (French) government, and whose family is one among the few white families. It refers to what was the same for both the colonizers and the negative ones related to them. At the same time, I have a sense of conformity with another film about Africa (Afghanda Africa (2001)), but there is no way to know any realistic or ideal for me. This is not just an impression - things happen in the film - but the plot is different. Instead of compelling him, filmmakers left the viewer to draw his own decisions, although as a woman, the story provides some perspective on the story as a flashback from a woman tour in southwestern Cameroon.
