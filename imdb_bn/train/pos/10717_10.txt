Nice show Rather than looking at the same old sitcom type, it shows the same old stuff, just "seperate", this refreshing show provides incredible entertainment scenes of office situations. We have been away from watching television for 2 years and after returning, all the programs available, we look forward to seeing this show at the W Shame On Global A Visit. I will be the winner of this one. Let's make things realistic about it, some Canadian shows made it. I talk to everyone to enjoy this show and I believe it was stupid to go global. I think they want to stop it from being behind the Canadian-made show, but with the sample models of the American Ideal Standards. Do not make me wrong, I enjoy many shows on TV, but, come to the people, let's be different. This unique show has provided a very ridiculous view of the little exaggerated realistic aspects of office life and relationships with the unique characters you can not see in a set of days or in the past. Too bad that this one globally, it was foolish to say the wrong.
