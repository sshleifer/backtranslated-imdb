Louis B. Despite the mayor, the contract contractor is not interested in signing Garba Garbo, the first American and MGM movie for actress looks pretty good. It is clear that the film has been set up to produce some amazing talent for producing matte paintings, because it has all the nice polish and skills you can expect from the best images of the studio. 84 years after it looks beautiful - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> Although she was fully recognized, her makeup was a lot easier than a year later - giving her a less serious look and humility about her which you could not see in the next film. I would like to keep such look, but considering how famous he might be with the look of the trademark, who would say that they did not go that route? The film is about Garbo and how and his family are forced to land by the landlord unfairly. Zamindari, many respected Donna Bernarda claims, because the bank has demanded payment, because her son has fallen for Garbo - and better way to get rid of them than to force them on the street! Excellent female, huh?! Year pass and now Garbo has become a new singer sensation who is world famous. When he returned to his suburbs, his old boyfriend (who promised to marry her, but his mother, Donna Bernarda, was disbanded when he refused to allow him) saw him. Her new love has been examined for another lady now - does she want to marry this lady, the heir of this great ghost fortune, or does she want her old flame? And, more important, would Garbo take him back even after so stupid behavior? Meanwhile, hit a huge rainstorm. The land started flooding and soon the houses were washed by waterfalls. Cotage and dash like a friend's demolition demolition! In a scene where he clearly made his boat high on the cascading stream, he was finally alive and at home where Garbo is now living. They welcome them inside and pass the storm until they stay with him. Then, he admitted that he still loved him and was able to make sure he was safe with the storm. She tells him to go lost! Later, you see Ricardo marrying his second choice, daughter of Poker King. He probably has little encouragement for this - and he's sorry for the lady, he's not anything wrong. Soon, Corsage revolves around Gorbao's house - he loves-sick and needs him. In this scenario, Garbo is quite bright and can not talk about leaving him - as they break each other's arms. Again, she talks about her love for her. <br /> <br /> When Donna Bernarda learns about this, she will not be happy. Obviously, a poker queen is better caught than an internationally known singer. Due to the intercession of this nasty old lady, Garbo leaves - unwilling to come between her mother and her evil boy. But, the cortez is going on - he must have declared it and he will not rest until she is his wife. After this announcement, a family friend talks to the cortez and believes in him for leaving her for his career and fame. By that time she "will not rest with her wife", huh? Despite a jogging through courtesy and through him, he can not hate himself for some reason. And so, he married the pig's queen and lived a very dull life. After years Garbo met Coetze again, he was a uninterrupted middle class man - when he was as beautiful as before. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this light, , It's astonishing that they let the cort√©s play such an unlikely character. They are the usual confident Valentino-like role instead of giving him, he is a reluctant wimp - a huge wimp. And, from here, his career had a gradual downward spiral. For Garbo, the role helped him to establish a star - because he was the center of the film and played many characters like those following him. <br /> <br /> It was very nice to compose a new song for the film, although a tad is repetitive. The print was almost perfect without the weird, interactive cards - which could use some recovery. <br /> <br /> One of the most enjoyable movies - skillfully created, cautious and valuable. And, in a few times, I can think of this, I have no real allegations in this wonderful movie.
