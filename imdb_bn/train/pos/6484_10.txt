I remember this in the 1970's - I've seen recent episodes of our public library. <br /> <br /> With a nearly 30-year break, I came to another conclusion. Most principals have long gone in interviews with some of the principal of TradlejJ (Hitler's Secretary), Carl Donets (Anthony Eden, head of the German Navy) - some of the centers, but their first account survives. Generals and Admiral Sergeants, Russian civilians, survival of the concentration camp, have all the records here. <br /> <br /> I can remember Lord Mountbatten's interview (killed in the 1970's) <br /> <br /> This is really a jewel and I believe the series producer Queen Elizabeth knit for this work. <br /> <br /> <br /> I wanted to buy some sets of these libraries. <br /> <br /> This is just "10" I did a review but I have discovered a fine wine bottle, it is more appreciated for a little while ...
