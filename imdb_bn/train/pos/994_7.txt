I once saw this movie and can see it again, but if the film is good in Jamie Fox, I think they could use a 'less funny' character like album sanders. Fox's views are very interesting, for example, when facing Edgar Kartin (David Morsch). David Morse is a wonderful painter again in a police. Her tough yet perfect feature is perfect for her role. Again, Doug Hutchinson (Bristol) met at the Morese Theater. The end of the morsie ending up on Hutchinson. They are perfect for each film this scenario is both. I personally love that quality in a film, where the actor ends up in the same situation as the previous movie, because these two were in Green Mile. Overall it was a fantastic good movie.
