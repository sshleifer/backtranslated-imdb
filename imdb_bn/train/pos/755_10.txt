Dante Sanchez is more extreme, the British version of Jacques, which leads to huge lengths for the loss of four boys (Prechard, Dinton, Jaisi and Pancha) to each other. This display is better than Jacques because most of its stents are not designed that make the reaction more fun. There are 3 series of shows, the first one follows them and takes longer time for their life. There is an episode about their love life, jobs and so on. The second series sends boys to try different jobs. The third follows their European tour. Looks like boys get more and more courageous as progress through the series. In my opinion, the third section is the best, but when I say, the stomach does not remain in the week, but you can see the perfect amount of blood and dry amounts of each episode.
