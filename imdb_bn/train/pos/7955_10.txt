This is one of the greatest child-pet movies ever made. I shouted shadows every time I shouted, "Wait, wait for my peter!" The family car is pulling away. It is a must if you love animals! The best movie ever! The movie lines are sometimes stupid. When Sassie says the Chancellor; "Cats Rules and Dogs Duel!" Without the line, I could do it, but when I was six years old, I liked the line. The storyline might seem some stylish, but I like it. When he goes away, as an old dog shadow, he is prepared to take the chancellor when you are thinking about it, it really is going on. This reminds me of my childhood dog. I think everyone can find themselves a piece of "homeyard embankment".
