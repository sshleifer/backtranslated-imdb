Quickly paced and funny taunt about that original "reality TV", soap opera. The script by playwright Robert Harling is packed with one liners and ridiculous situations. The best of them is Climax, a live broadcast which is bad in fast impulse and is bad in brain replacement. Because Kevin was wearing his glasses due to his glasses, his glasses were not wearing, ridiculous. "His brain will explore later in the next few houses." Bright throw is on the same page as the cine. Sally Field, Elizabeth Shue, Kathy Mariah, Robert Danny Jr., Hooper Goldberg, Terry Hatcher, Gary Marshall and Kathy Nazimi are all right. It is a treat to see a cast click like a movie. This is a classic that has exploded through cracks in some way. <br /> <br /> PS An added bonus by score by Allan Sylvester. It fits soap operas with its flamboyant and melodramatic air.
