If the filmmakers have made any attempt to present the reality in the plot, then it will be much more waste of time, money and creative efforts. Fortunately, by spreading all the publicity in the air, they created a wonderful surprise. Who can pass a film, in which an alien pilot spends the whole film, acting like Jack Nicholson, which is complete with the Lakers T-shirt. Do not dismiss this film as a trash.
