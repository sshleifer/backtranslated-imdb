I thought to myself "Gong Ho" like a child with my mother, and wondered why she would cry in the last few minutes. I, of course, did not find the whole movie pleasing, especially the approach of letters. It was until I was old and saw it again that I realized how deep the show really is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton stopped to be amazed with its real-life line-up delivery, and adds humor and stones to the mix of Watanabe. I thought that Pati Jasut (Umki) was just fantastic in his role as a joke for the joke. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the 80's most acclaimed films. We can learn a lesson from American and Japanese workers gathering in this movie ... Sometimes you can really "make the best of both worlds". And now I understand why my mother did this last moment. I'd rather have one of those cars.
