I like this movie. My only disappointment was to change some of the original songs. <br /> <br /> It is true that Frank Sinatra can not sing so much songs in this movie, but it is also nice that it is not another Frank Sinitra movie. I really thought it was good to use Marlon Brando's own voice because There is a voice out of her fears and I could not meet this great voice of gangster catching anyone. <br /> <br /> "Put, you rockin 'bottle" a foot-tappin ", the song is long that I just love it. It's a difficult task to follow its version and I'm still <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I could not But after seeing him in the part, it became sensual. <br /> <br /> Michael Kidd's choreography Kalimukhele. If it was resumed in 2008, I would not be able to change anything. <br /> <br /> I have seen that the movie version has lost some time in the movie version but it has made the feel of the stage though it was in the picture. I thought the movie was well thrown. It is performed and the time one of my favorites.
