It's all very easy. Jake goes to jail, and spent five years with Cons and chess master. They are hungry about the history of losses and failures, and express regret for the way they are alive because of their belief in the principle of minor skills and control of minor strategies. They decide to give Jack the ultimate freedoms: from his intimate fear, which he believes in himself. For him, they take him to a journey where he can give up all fear, all pride, all hope - his will to be resurrected as the true master. <br /> <br /> This is a cute movie flicker, an infinite gamble and games that we do with ourselves and inside. 10/10, there is no doubt.
