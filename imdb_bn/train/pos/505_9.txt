A very good start. I was surprised to see that the appliance is not so advanced: we should have been a crusader because we met in the original series. Cast is interesting, though the Valkan lady comes with a little more people. He is the model for this race, after all, those who need to school on Spock. Very bad they could not pick Jerry Ryan. I like Mrs. Park, Korean (?) Lady. Doctors have the possibility. Without the black guy, other men did not sort out. She is really liked. The bakula has to find his niche - his strong point in QL was humor and his desire to try. He, of course, is big enough and mighty for heroism. He was heavy, though I did not like their makeup.
