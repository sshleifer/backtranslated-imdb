I thought it was a very long time I saw one of the best movies. It was a great story line and shows that people are all complex in different ways. All my friends have to recommend it !! I always enjoy a good story line and most of the movie I have seen long time ago. I could stay in a girl myself and doing the same thing that Natalie learn more about her life and love. It has shown how we do not live with our families; But there are some parts of our lives that we do not share with them - because we can not be proud of them to know all the proud details about them, so we are proud of it. <br /> <br /> I look forward to another movie, and keep an eye on me.
