This is a film that makes me feel strongly about making films. Generally, I'm a fan of movies based on a true real story. And this one is great! As well as the performance of Marill, he has gained many recognition and praise, the greatest story of the film is based on this story. After feeling enormous emotional pain in the unexpected and brutal death of their couples, the informal story of the victims of social and legal repression is a real-sighted incident that reveals the inhuman aspect of the colleagues and exposes its brutality to a very sophisticated and legitimate society. It is interesting to see that those who consider themselves as kind and intelligent (for example, the psychological jury in movies) are nothing more than a selfish couple, who close their brain for their religious beliefs and ancestors for any consideration. And even even very thoughtfully against their views, even the thoughts in light of all incidents. The film that publishes the other person in the so-called "civilized" society is indifferent to the pain of fellow workers (it is very common, although this particular story is published in Australia), which goes far beyond becoming a true cruelty. You must see if you are willing to take some serious and perhaps thought-provocative.
