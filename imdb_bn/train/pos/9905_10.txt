I wrote over the memory of how many reviews count lost. I've read a lot of bad things and right now I'm going to say it's a fantastic movie. Simon Sch√ºdmauer earned his fame for his famous suicide, and although it was his only film, the movie was so big. At first I did not know Simon about until I read a review about his suicide. Then I discovered the current webpage at www.imdb.com because he was born in 1957 in Dayton, Ohio. Simon might have played the most kind character known to humans, but his real life must of course have hardness and weaknesses. She works in a good acting, who can not agree? I was always amazed how he himself was nude in a movie. At least say it would be quite embarrassing. When I was in the first six categories, I saw this movie. I agree with some pointers that the girl will not bathe after the girl is killed, and that high schools can not be bathe! I think Caroline Munro was another star at the age of 36, who was a congratulatory actress and, unfortunately, she did not make any future films for Simon's death. The reason for his suicide is a mystery, and hopefully it will be discovered in the near future. In the mathematical webpage, it tells you that he was 29 years old when he did his higher education. She looked like a teenager. I made two thumbs up this picture, made the best horror film. Probably because of their terrible acting, others did not get fame in movie business. - Jacob Young
