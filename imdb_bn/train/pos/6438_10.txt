"S mommy hemelen" .. so above the top .. so that's the special point where the Divine and man meet. I appreciate this photo! A gem Yes amazing grace! <br /> <br /> I moved so deeply by very human quality. I laughed, through the whole article, the feeling of a lot of feelings. <br /> <br /> Michael Nichigwist Brilliant as Daniel, enthusiastic performance at first rate, taxman and strong. Each view at its meeting, its inner light and exceptional talent shines through every interaction. I was completely mesmerized, enchanted and caught up in the story, which is our collective story, stories of life stories itself. <br /> <br /> The film also has many archetypes, Messianic, injured children, magical children, artists, teachers, pastors, abusers, torture, torture, rape, divine idiots - all the characters are so real and true to the truth - everyone is great among me Love and compassion awakens. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of thinking which is still quite enjoyable, entertaining movies. Oh .. angels do not forget the heavenly singer and breathtakingly beautiful words. <br /> <br /> Thanks to all of you - this Swedish film will surely make people globally impressive. Brilliant!
