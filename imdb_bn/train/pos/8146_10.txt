I'm not saying how much this movie likes. This movie is the lowest known and one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. This film follows the exploitation of a rap group, NWH Hit (with the hats of Ni # $% RS). It starts from the beginning of the group after the disappointment of the group. Nina Blackburn, the next documentary producer of the group. <br /> <br /> This movie is in a decorating budget, but it does not matter, it is a very well made, well-produced film and all actors and actresses of these actors are excellent The main power of this film is writing, this film has a lot of bright lines and rap-shaped rumors, it's unrealistic. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " , Etc.) Rusty Cond√©f has created a nice movie. He played rapper Ice Cold in the film. The film does not exits, it's fun from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> The movie works so well, since it has become odd for the occasion, but it hit the line where it is fun to go far away. Try to talk about what kind of philosophy to listen to three leads, one of the best parts of the movie, such as a Tone Def, to a record producer? When you take the bus, you go there, and the producer responds? That deep! <br /> <br /> The group NWH illustration has some natural chemistry in them. They work very well together, and they manage to pull this movie where it does not have a moment in the week. This film is so good that for some time in this movie how many true truths are. Many rap groups had problems like violence, sensors and NWA, this group became popular when the establishment started making a big deal through controversial songs. <br /> <br /> I like this movie because it is objectionable. There is something here in every way objectionable to the way of a good nature. Most of the people in the film are outside the rap, Spike Lee's funny. I can not imagine where they came with this dialogue. The movie is the line after the line that you will be rolling on the floor. Before writing I said that it is nice. <br /> <br /> I am not surprised to see this movie with this wonderful Liberation War. This is an intelligent, controversial and even excited movie. It's too much for mainstream, though it's ridiculous and its production is almost shameless. There is no big star, but there are many familiar faces, including Mark Lawrence, who plays Tone Def. Check out this movie, at least you certainly will get its opinion.
