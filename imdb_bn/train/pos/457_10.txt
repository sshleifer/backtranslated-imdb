This program is so much fun and title song so interesting that I can not find it outside my head. The old wrinklies I pulled out of the things I find out as old are drawn, and these four are excellent in their efforts. What they do is humiliating but bright, that with our PC world we can never do this in real life. I always learn something from the show. But if you like mystery, drama, comedy, and a little forensics, you would love this show. This reminds me of Quany, me and Barney Miller another way, in order that they work and interact with each other. They screw up a lot but they worked, and counted that key.
