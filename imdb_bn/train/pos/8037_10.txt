"One shot, one murder, no exception." You will see if you are in marines or snipers. Two big thumbs up! Great overall story, great camera work, good play, action, details and more. The real things are pretty near. But it is not a film and editing fault broken. This is to sit back and have a good 99 minutes. The plot has some depth but this movie really does not make you think about it. It's about sniper lifestyle and enjoyment of action. Sniper 2 and 3 are pretty good follow ups but first is still the best overall movie. Tom Berenger does a great job of playing his character and showing the side towards sniper life. Plain to deal with death all. Sniper fans must see for sure.
