This incredibly well-established Flickr on "Walker, Texas Ranger" squad has some incredible scenes that can sometimes be seen in a TV movie. In addition, one can predict results from pretty-go results. However, this is a fun small movie that completes the work: it gives entertainment. That was all that meant and it is so. Stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot is not bad at half. The acting is also decent, which does not have much of a surprise, because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal. If you are a fan of the section (and "Walker, Texas Ranger"), you would certainly like it. If not, do not waste your time. 8/10
