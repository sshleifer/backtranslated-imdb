Perhaps my all-time favorite movie, selflessness, sacrifice, and dedication, but it is not promotional or annoying. In the last 25 years, I saw it 15 times or more, although it is not old. The performance of Paul Lucas is tears in my eyes, and Bate Davies is delighted in his very few sympathetic roles. Like kids, kids say that "clothes clothed" is more than children, but it makes them more fun to watch. And the slow awakening of the mom of what is happening in the world and what is happening on her own roof is credible and surprising. If I had a dozen thumbs, they would all be "up" for this movie.
