I only saw two films of Pang Bhai, I and I are the only one. When I saw it, I was frustrated with the two of them, before whom I had heard good news about them. That movie (I) has a really bad script, especially the end (little, little, and very limited in my opinion), but it's still good in photography and experimental images. So I decided to take only one and I never get frustrated again. Still amazing photography, stunning images, MTV-style editing, cool music, and this time, most of the senses in the story, logical and beautiful, you'll see some small plot holes, but it does not create any problems. The only problem with this image is that I get a bad DVD.
