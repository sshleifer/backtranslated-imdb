I've enjoyed the Criminal Intent series of laws and orders for a long time. Catherine Array, Dit. Alexander Eames, the female detective seems a bit bitter in a series of rather tough and criminal campaigns. Look at her side in this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the extraordinary soft side of this talented actresses and if you are a criminal intention fan, this movie is a wonderful event in her acting and you will find a fantastic puzzle. Southern Family Trouble Yarn <br /> <br /> I do not like the role of Albert Finn in this film because he has done a strong acting role in the old Southern colleague who is tough and intolerant and unacceptable of change. He reminds many men from my young man and the picture is divine, but you may find it difficult to love this movie. <br /> <br /> Katrin Erbe in this movie is easy to choose and why I recommend it is a criminal motive, as a 10 star for law and order supporters.
