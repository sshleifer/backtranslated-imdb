This movie shows fantastic cinematic tactics that draws attention to the camera, drawing details of how it is displayed instead of landscape, how a woman is wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet. Husbands can wear a hat and socks and shoes and her lingerie and both feel so completely at ease and comfortable. How the woman is encouraged is another feature of the film, which the director likes to tell us that she enjoys the free sexual spirit and whether she wants to enjoy the sensitivity of the person directly or without any special sensitivity. The relationship between wife and husband is unique. It is an open, in which she does not get anything back, she does not feel any shame how she behaved and wants to share these events with her because her primary focus is always the reality of their marriage. Nothing and nobody can come among them. The possibility of fate can only interfere - during the war, what followed his prison and after his return to the long end. A very playful film which is completely absorbing.
