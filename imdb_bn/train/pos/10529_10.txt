There is no point in my favorite Austin novel, Paltrow is not my favorite actress, but I thought the film was almost entirely joyful. Paltrow works well, and playing comings, Stevenson and 'Miss Bats' is absolutely horrible. The details of time are not disconnected; The film's feeling is really right. But the real 'search' is as Jeremy Northam. Nightly Can not be more perfect welding, IMO I hated Mr. in the novel, but in the movie he found surprisingly human and human. There is no barrier to the good of Northam and to enjoy the sunny eyes, is it? Highly recommended. Anar
