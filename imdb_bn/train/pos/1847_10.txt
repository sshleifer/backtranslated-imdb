Whatever you do in your life, you will never forget that you have the roots. This is the real story that was made in beautiful and moving movies! I think this literature is very limited underrated. It shows the reality of our lives ... the worse turns around you, becomes a good man. Believe in your wit and know it's ideal for life ... without fools, without being alive "under a rock". The idea of ​​film is more interesting ... connecting conversation with real life events ... by making us aware of everything ... bless these people and make everyone happy! See it, I recommend it to all young people. It is not about racism how it will live your life!
