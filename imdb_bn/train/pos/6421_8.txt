"Honorable Men" - The proud and permanent Black Navy Diver (True Cuba Gooding Junior) is a great movie that is both a touching and entertaining, and it is a part of the new creamy film's cream of the new millennium. Wonderful acting This movie is really a special and beautiful, enjoyable experience, the main reason for something to do. Charismatic Robert De Niro is a rough, deadly and audacious master on Sunday as a Sunday - the role is actually written for him. Superb "15 Minutes" (2001) Besides this, the film is two new evidence which is still one of the best actors of our time. On the other hand, "Main of the Sun" has a better performance than Cuba Gooding Jr., the most anticipated young black actor from "Boyz ni Hood". "Men of Honor" goes directly into "Jerry Maguire", "It gets as well" and "Institute" company. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skilled and fantastic actor and I'm ready to get more awesome movies from him. "Main of Honor" is an excellent storyline and probably the most exciting diving sequence in the history of the movie. This is a great, impressive movie and I can only recommend it.
