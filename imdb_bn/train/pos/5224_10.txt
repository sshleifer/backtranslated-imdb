Ione should look for "Jean de Florrett" on how to tie this movie or not have a plot. Hello! This picture was made as a Comedy's Random Act, and in no way has a plot included in shape or size. I want to remind these whiners that if you think you will be going out of this movie, it seems they have lost the point. This film is clearly designed for people who do not appreciate the so-called "American Humor", which I think is only a stack of smoker strap. The point is that everyone has an opinion and you should be a little more grateful that some people may not be compatible with your own before closing the face of humor. <br /> <br /> Thank you
