BASEketball is indeed a really interesting movie. David Zucker moves us all to rotate, really stupid, but many smart, comedy <br /> <br /> The main actor of this photo, two of South Park's producers, played very well, surprisingly well, but I see their first time as actors. The picture often reminds me of South Park - one of my FOV shows. <br /> <br /> This is a really good and funny movie, so do not miss it. <br /> <br /> Vote: 7.5 out of 10.
