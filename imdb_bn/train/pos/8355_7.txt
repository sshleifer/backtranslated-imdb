The movie has a distinct (though stupid and rough) humanity for its infinite barbarism - the zip / female score points to their unfortunate comic side and even when they are the most cold (such as terrorizing the woman on the train)), a semi-critical weakness Lurks away far away (Dewere sucks her breasts like a baby). Diparia can be used to kill Blair from a scene that could be related to Dvayer's rape, so we are not sure how to express clearly the homeopathic view of their relationship - in both ways, this phenomenon is the beginning of their relative humanization (hence the film must be read as gay, although it is likely You may read as something you want). The film has many objectionable scenes and sexual politics points, and perhaps both folks are accepted as general cartoons, making the whole concept of sensitivity and honesty into drugs and harming multiple potential benefits based on it. If you fire close enough shots, some of them are bound to hurt.
