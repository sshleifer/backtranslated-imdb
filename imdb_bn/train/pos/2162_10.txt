I'm so surprised when I saw this movie so low ... I understand why you dislike this movie. Slow motion, a feature of Japanese film. However, if you are absorbed in movies like me, you will not find any problem in it. <br /> <br /> I must say that this is the best comedy I've ever seen. "What are we doing?" Often Japanese comedy is considered as a best composition. It is different from Hollywood, eg Austin's power or horror movie, which is confirmed by a spell every few minutes. Rather, it is a light heart, a movie that makes you feel better. <br /> <br /> I love the movie because it makes me feel "real". The plot is still available. I was very happy to see that Suegama (main role) found the meaning of life in a dance life. Before seeing the film I was a little sad because of heavy work in school. I felt lost. However, this picture has made me think about the bright aspects of life. I believe I was in the same boat in Suji. If he finds himself in his hobby, why would not I? It reminds me of "exploring my own future" and discovering happiness in my daily life. <br /> <br /> It is important that dancers are not professional dancers. Although you can not get some dancing scenes as perfect as you expect, I like it because it reminds me that the characters are really "alive", learning to dance like a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Above all, this film is passionate and heart-warming. As a comedy, it does its job perfectly. It definitely deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br /> And yes Aoki funny: -D
