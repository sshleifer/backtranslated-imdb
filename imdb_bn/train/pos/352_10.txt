I just saw "Valentine" and I would say it was the best Slasher movie I've seen for several years. Contrary to recent trends in the horrific Felix 90s, this film is more concerned with shamelessness than being self-ludicrous. For those who hate "hate", there is no mention of "horror rules" in this film (though the rules of old slash film are applied here). <br /> <br /> It's a terrible mix of 80s and 90s. You played well in style, cinematography, and the 90's movies and got an 80's sparkling stalking-slasher crazy. I guess year 2001 was finally going to give the kind of movies they wanted for the horror fans. This is definitely a step in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Dennis Richards stands here as a funny character. You can like her role in him, and that can stand him out. I liked her in this movie.
