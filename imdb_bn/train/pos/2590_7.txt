Those who call this movie as bad are those who can not start with the movie. These people love movie blockbusters and the opposite of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Weddah Napalm is a lovely little movie that may seem to be playful and probably stupid at first, but how it is more than being made for substance. <br /> <br /> It affects me especially about the movie, it uses music, which plays a large part. Students of the film music will see how important it is to both Vida and Wilder's life, and both movies in the background. The themes of the theme of the twitter, the theme of Vida, and the Wallace theme were all heard at the beginning and it is interesting to know how some songs are out there. For example, where people are singing "Dukes of Earl" to men, Vida is with Wilder when men sing "Like My Girl", and then she goes to Wallace to give her something to give something. The songwriter, "He will be my daughter", shows tension between the two brothers in the shiny, and there is such a small complexity inside the film and it can look like a flop outside, but the film is really good to see how good the filmmaker will look.
