The Cipher is delivering a clever, effective and eerie film. Its good foundation is well presented and its content is distributed in a functional way, but the demand for the same Although someone can immediately label this science fiction but this is something else. It has clear science fiction, but the film is similar to a detective / intelligence that is not more than a story. <br /> <br /> This movie plays as a nightmare overall. Thus creating and maintaining a good atmosphere. We're not sure exactly what's going on, we're never sure why something is happening which is actually happening and we're definitely not as sure as a dream. Reigns ambiguity on us ?? The hero included and I did not see Bar Terry Gilliam's Brazil Bar, before a film pulled off like this. Going up with the boldness described earlier, Cipher presented himself with fears, intelligence, silent and science fiction, feeling that there is something for everyone and it uniting his elements. <br /> <br /> There is also a secret feeling for the detective side of the story. The only mystery surrounding it is annoying to say the least and I have found the truth that Rita Foster (Liu), who is believed to be like a fatty breast, her character can be seen as a threat to everything else. Around the hero: Those who appear as friends are not really those who really say that they are actually using it and those who seem to be damned are actually worse than seeing them. In spite of switching a lot of things, the plots have been removed several times and arranged the following commands so that they think that the world will end without end; Which romantic link or connection to Lumi Liu's character is one of the most dangerous sounds ?? And he is trying to help! (!) Has kept the movie against the feelings of two parties, the war of espionage, its espionage, and its employees and opponents. The whole thing can play something like a mini-cold war; Some words that correspond to the sounds of the words of the USA and the USSR. It is really black, silent, often pulled by the CGI shrink screen that I had glued. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Moving away from controlled life and making him branch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> its content is consistent and has all the elements of a good film. Not saying that this is the same as Jason Bourne's film, only set in the Sci-Fi style, it is not being cut in enough but you can see the similarity; Despite them being released in the same year. As I mentioned earlier, this movie seems to have something for everyone and if you look at some disappointing end, you can see that some people can predict successfully, but you can enjoy this movie yourself.
