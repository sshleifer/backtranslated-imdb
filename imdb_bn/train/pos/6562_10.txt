Quite simply created the best reality show. The first two seasons (only the issues) are in hull. I see the first three episodes of Season 1 and challenge someone who does not like it. I guarantee the season will end in watching. Then I guarantee that you will see the season 2. <br /> <br /> Another quick reason to see it: 1. Anderson Cooper Sunny European locations are great 3. The game is mentally challenging 4. It is very interactive 5. One player in one episode responds to the disappointment of another player, "I'm trying as hard as I can!" With an equally frustrated, "not necessarily." <br /> <br /> Can you imagine ... who is thorns?
