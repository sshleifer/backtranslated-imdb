A good movie right now! One that is severely underrated I felt their pain in the songs the children sang in the movie, but their hope for the future also Huley Goldberg has a good performance here, but the best actress of the whole film is the actress who manages the title character. I wish she was more in the movie. <br /> <br /> This movie should have a high rating. I pay it a 10/10.
