"Half Truth" is the best film ever made in Indian film. Directed by the great director Govinda Nihalani, this is the most successful hard-working parallel film which becomes a commercial success. Even today, half-truth is an inspiration for all the leading directors of India. <br /> <br /> The film is also called the real-life scenery of the Mumbai Police of the 70's. Unlike any other police force in other cities of India, Mumbai police combine a separate system. Govinda Nihalani has made a very practical move about the real-life aspect of the Mumbai police environment. <br /> <br /> Among the various police officers and colleagues, this picture describes the story of Anand Bhalenkar, a young hot bloody cop coming from a poor family. Her father is a strict police constable. Joy itself suffered from the pain of her father and her mother's suffering from the torture of her father. The intention of every intention of immediate action against the offense, an evil desire for satisfaction of his own work. This image has been reviewed here in a plot where continuous attempts of crime against pleasure are severed by its seniors. This causes frustration, because he can not achieve the satisfaction of desired work. As a result of frustration, his anger gets reflected in excessive violence in the remand rooms and bars, and he also leads him to drunkenness. <br /> <br /> The soul still lives in it, because he constantly beats the system. He is aware about the Metro system, where the police and politicians are linked by an underlying distance. His objectionable negative towards unethical practices. Finally he was suspended. <br /> <br /> A master piece of instruction and thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand rushes to the house of underworld gangster Ram Sethi to arrest him, then brief conversation which is pretty cool. In many scenes, the film is in a hair-raising moment. <br /> <br /> The Practical System of Script is a main punch. Drugs, corruption, political influence, courage and deception are all part of the Mumbai Police today. These aspects are treated brilliantly. Finally, the films related to one-of-one show, Om Puri Anand Vellankar, is perfectly brilliant with all its emotion.
