The filmmaker Andy Goldworth's quest for the art and the intensity of land and water, and the feeling of his feelings - and so we breathed a nicely for the rest of the film. "River and Tide" loves Goldsworthy's work and joins it as a visual concert of the world's time and human presence, which is a world which secretly conceals its power. See this movie!
