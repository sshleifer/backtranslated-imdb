This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen recently. Any film on top of any movie goes up. I really wonder why it has not received the recognition it deserves. The Sonali Kulkarni National Award winner is perhaps the only comforting event. Renika Duffadar was surprised to speak volumes only through her eyes. Here are some scenes seen: When Gauri came back from Krishna's wedding town, she and Krishna met for the first time for many years. Krishna noticed a change in Gauri, but the single line of dialogue was not even mentioned. Emotions are expressed in the entire wide fine way and through the eyes. In the end, on the other hand, Krishna instead requested Kulkarni, the explorer to marry Gauri. If you are not moved by that scene, you do not have a heart. <br /> <br /> Watch this film for the brilliance of filmmaking and the power of acting.
