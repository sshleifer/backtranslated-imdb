I grabbed the last half of this film in one night and got hurt by how shocked it was. Even when one of the two falls into the worst condition, the camera continues. Linking shots of his body are being uncovered and his density-camp painting hanging between body bags is both moving and depressing. Do not watch this movie if you are already frustrated. Then do not see it again if your feelings are really good.
