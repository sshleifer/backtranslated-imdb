I bought this DVD at first because it was SRK and Aishwarya Rai's cover and I thought, Hey! I do not know that Aishwariya will be present in an IT number at the end of a movie which she will share with SRK and introduce her character, which is about 15 minutes for pictures. Energy is a film about the love and patience of a mother. It is a film about transformation, ignorance, age, engagement and embrace of the harsh reality of life. There are items with the movie items present in SRK and Aishu have nothing to do with the movie. It is actually a dream sequence which occurs when SRK's drunken character is knocked unconscious by dirt. She dreamed that Aishwarya Rai was a sexy street girl who one day saw her favorite hang out spot, she wore hardly to wear and began to inspire her. The title of the song is 'Ishq Kamina' (translated little "love anxiety!") And it is only hot smoking! Do not miss it.
