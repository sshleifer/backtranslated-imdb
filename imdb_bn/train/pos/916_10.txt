My comment for Veve: - It is a beautiful, idealistic love story to play with Shahid Kapoor and Amrit Rawa. This picture returns our little joy, as the bride and bride are sleeping on the floor of the family, playing games together, their friendly humility and mutual respect. Viva about the importance of commitment between marriage and two people. Yes, central romance is naively fantastic. But sticky moments between romantic moments between their married couples and their strong resistance to modern curiosity games make you wish for idealism. The picture ends with the wedding night on the wedding night, on the wedding night, to his new bride, "Let me dress your clothes" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The beauty of Indian culture, the beauty of Indian women, at least one of the great couples waiting to be married, is a great example .... Simple yet beautiful; Such a simple story .... no plot ... no villain - in case of most cases of sun barjatya movie. Suraj Sir, what is he coming back well? He made movies with full conviction. This is a very sweet film - which teaches a lot of good things to the current generation, married marriages and family members of 2 families. I think America Rao - looks very well and she has played very well. Most of them are good scenes - although I think the last half hour was completely with Shahid Kapoor - who gave a very modest performance for change. I like acting for all the others for the former. Chaity means Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, brother and father-in-law of Shaheed. It almost takes almost as real and recognized. There is another excellent family picture of Siraj Sir after Maine Pyar Kiya, Hahaq and Humathth Hain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Get all this and more shawcade in Vivah. There are still some good listeners who are going and enjoying this film. Some people / listeners have already been excited to see, they think they are married - married) If you ask me to succeed then be successful. It looks like Amitra Rao - our actress-Viviya (Result for Outstanding Performance) has been awarded the honorable Dadashab Falak for 2006 !! Heats him for this achievement, although Viva, Shahid or Amrita did not get any film rent and other awards; @ At least it's CHEER's news! Congratulations to Amir Rao- To show us the best way to showcase our Indian Bride-to-Prayas and Suraj Barshat syllabus :) Shaheed Kapoor and others who do not forget the Viva as sweet and today's legend! Imagine, share the same pain like legend Dilip Kumar ......... No achievement !! Congratulations to Amir Rao - To take his career in another level with this award .... I personally think - he must continue shooting with Shahid Kapoor !! They create a beautiful couple and remind me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla} on their on-screen chemistry ................. <br /> <br /> Some of the points I have seen are: - # 1 If you notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because the saash always has a traditional dress. He gave every bit of the Indian female entity - in this film !! Perfect Fit # 2 Shahid Kapoor is among us the most - not ready for marriage or early marriage .... But since Prime Unmoder has full faith in Kher, listen carefully to the step given by his DAD. Finally, in the words "honesty" and "trust" he reflected his first discussion with Amrita. Most people will think that this person is not enough to judge a person for a limited time with this first meeting with a stranger. But according to what I saw in this film, I remember - two people who are made for each other can join the 1st meeting, this is possible !!! # 3 In the whole film - there are 4 or 5 sections where Shahid and Amrita are together - or they are shown together. This is one of the most romantic / wedding-based films where heroes and heroines are always singing / dancing or nowadays - unlike the outstanding things. But the beauty of these five sequences: - Restraint, innocence and respect for others! # 4 I really like the relationship shown between uncle Nhat and Amrita Rao. Such a movie will inspire the indifference shown to girls / girls in some parts of India. # 5 Between the lead couple has been shot very nicely in the romantic scene - no cheap scene, the song is beautifully depicted !! The word "water", the word "praise" etc. All the girls who love this image are going to be buzzwords :) Personally, I really like many conversations in this movie. # 6 Last but not least - The entire hospital scene where Shaheed keeps Amrita "Sindu", while struggling for life - it is horrible. The dialogue between the couple is so sensitive and I can not do without love; Feeling off of it a hat !!! <br /> <br /> *** In many ways, Vivah me, Maine Pyaar Kiya, DDLJ, Kayamat she Kayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuk Sanam - reminds me that the fresh / on-screen chemistry of Lead Pair:): ) *** IF USA Me: - Among the best films made in 2006 with films like Rang De Basanti, Lej Raho Munawai, Door, Corporate and Kabul Express, Chavay films. FACT - I think Vivah offers more good dhum 2 or more business / business than Fana or noise, always pass / Fazi / Style / BRAF movie !!
