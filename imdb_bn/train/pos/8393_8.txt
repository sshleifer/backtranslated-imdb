Mariah Brown's Wedding (MMB) is a German girl (Maria) who is married to only one German soldier (Harman Brun) at the end of the war. After being married half day and one night, Harmon was sent back. To finish, Maria began working in a bar mainly for American soldiers and a black soldier. He died in front of Herman and something happened between him and the American soldier. Hormon revolves around their beds and after the clashes between him and the Americans, Maria killed American. Harman admits that the prison is over and Maria swears by waiting for her. The country is snail; One man left everything that is busy for cigarette. There are food shortages. It is short, a time of survival. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> For example, there are the following conversations with Maria Pedellar (Fasbinder himself played); Pelella tried to sell him a nice copy of Clost and he commented that "Clest quickly rushed out, it does not provide enough heat for cold". Pedalla's Answer "Another way to see it. At this time, maybe it's the right way." <br /> <br /> She met Karl Oswald, a French / German businessman on the way to the first French train depot. He decided to get involved with Carl, "You do not have any relationship with me, I'm having a relationship with you". He also took the responsibility of the company and after a while he firmly believed in the conviction. Carl says, "I think we just have to wait for a miracle job," he replies, "I like to do miracles. Then wait for them". In his own words, he has become "mother of economic miracle". <br /> <br /> In many filmmakers, he tried to publish mental processes behind social processes (see Freud); In other words, he liked his camera by indicating bullsh * t, false social process. Mar√≠a has succeeded in expressing this ideology directly in the film. For example, he phoned Carl, and when he picked up the phone, his request was directly considered as "the need to sleep at the point". Fasibinder said, "The emotions that were felt were not all that existed and there was only one kind of feeling that we think we needed to work properly in society". He commented that his pictures are mentally opposed. <br /> <br /> I especially like the scene when Karl and Maria meet at the Munich restaurant (apparently, Hitler himself visits). Maria comes under control and a bit beside Karl, as Maria's 'cruel honesty' defeats him, as if the situation is not completely finished. Carl says, "I have to speak on myself and I love life". Maria replied, "This is not life, as we have signed an agreement to enjoy life, so we go out to eat and talk." I guess even about the Fassbinder attitude on this relationship, no one is completely submissive. And why do you say about the central theme of most of his films, "There is no love in this society ?? a product, an instrument of energy, a weapon." <br /> <br /> It has been commented that there are scenes with walking with expensive wheels in the ruins after the war with Maria and Betti Fassbinder usually - this dress is essentially a wrong time. I think he wanted to illustrate those feelings that when you feel bad, "you can always make yourself and face a great day". However, Fassbinder was not interested in perfection. Any mistakes in a movie can be corrected in the next project. Since he's finished filming (approximately 4 years), the way others cigarette is rolling, so it's not uncommon that there are some very bad scenes in this film. Peter Marthesemar, who wrote most of the script, noted that the Rashibindara dreamed of the whole scene with Maria and America overnight at night. <br /> <br /> Hana shaigala is as bright as Maria. In most cases, he just hides in the camera. Maria's own words "It's a bad time for emotions, but I like it". <br /> <br /> There are different opinions in the end. Harman finally saw Karl after heart attack. (After leaving Harmon's prison, he went to Australia, "again became a man.") After marriage (his and Hermann made between half), Maria forgot to stop the gas by lighting up his cigarette. , And blow up her and Harmman. For me it's just that he worked that by accident. At the same time, he must be rattled when his dream finally seems to be true. He would have felt as he had never been himself. She thought she had surrendered herself.
