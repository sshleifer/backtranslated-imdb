On my work line, I have occasionally contacted independent filmmakers who are trying to publish their movies. When I can, I keep an eye on these low-budget films and often they think that Hollywood's future is going to dogs. After a while, a movie that produces genuine emotions and desires, as well as good films that are still designed to remind the film industry, are still possible. Brocken in a small film directed by Alex Ferrari, a real surprise and a second look. <br /> <br /> In a 20-minute clocking, Broken is trying to tell an amazing (but miraculous) story, back story. Visitors are being thrown in the middle of the verb without any sources of what is happening. A young girl (Samantha Jane Pole) wakes up to hear a shot from a dream and later abducted from her house. When he wakes up, he is surrounded by a group of tenants' disguise, which they seem to be in the comic book house. These nasty boys and girls are bigger than life. They are all guns and knives. There is no way here. <br /> <br /> Here, Kakima says it does not play a game despite having a low budget movie. From the very beginning, the feeling is that BRK has been shot, edited and produced by E. N. professionals. It seemed as if Quantin Tarantino was going out of his house when he jammed with the Wachowski brothers. The picture is sharp and cool, it looks good and it seems something big. <br /> <br /> Acting is better than acting in this little movie. Pollole and Paul Gordon (who played the head killer, Duncan) are well selected. As a strong role in the film, it depends on them to carry the film. No special effects, no matter how good, will save this film from bad acting. Thankfully, Pole manages to express real fear and Gordon is stopped as a true psychologist. Some more restricted roles seem to be filled with less talent, but it rarely shows up. <br /> <br /> It's only 20 minutes long at the bottom of the BRKEE. The story ends with a twilight zone twist which seems a bit dull and it is less fine. Seeing it, I felt some of my epiphany was supposed to stay, but there was only one feeling that it was much more than I was dolly. The film works hard to be one of the puzzles released at local coffee shops for a few hours to talk, but it gets annoyed. I think this is the first 20 minutes of a long film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10
