In the name of violence, the murder of a detective (Dana Andrews) kills a suspect (Craig Stevens) in the assassination and then trying to cover it. The film, directed by Auto Prumming, has a lot of atmosphere, but the story is lost when the deceased's wife (Gene Tearney) falls for Andrews. He was digging himself in a big hole and outside, but he was very mild at the end of the tunnel for a silent film. Gary Merrill Schulze is awesome, who has covered the offender with depression, and the tension in it gives a scene in his film and drive, especially in the Merrill, Andrews and Neville brands and evening bath rooms. The time outside of Belvu Hospital, which should make it the conclusion of the film. High marks for the atmosphere, Andrews, Merrill, etc. ... and the general depiction of the underworld, although the love cops and easy-to-be good police bad police elements do not help the cause.
