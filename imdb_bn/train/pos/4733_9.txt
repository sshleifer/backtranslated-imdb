Again, Jet Li starred on the movie screen in his black mask movie. In this film, Le Susu, who is a shepherd of a super-soldier program, who plays the program that has attempted to resurrect humanity from it, plays it. To make a normal and peaceful life, this Tuis decides to be a librarian, but fate claims that he will solve the problem from his past before continuing to seek peace. Other members of the Superintendent's program escaped at the same time as Tui, but they want to get even closer to the world than to find inner peace. This is the only thing that prevents publication of information from his former teammates who can spend their lives on many innocent people. This image screams across the screen at a great speed and does not allow its audience to go. The martial art is amazing, but it is not as appreciable as it deserves as much as it deserves American audiences because it uses wires. If you like action movies, it's an interesting story and good performance performance because it deals with mental and physical conflicts, but black mask for you. Jat Lee's movies have finally released the main stream in the United States and I'm waiting to see how the requirements of this release are necessary (things like dubbing and soundtracks) will affect this movie. Come out one of Lee's best movies, and watch it on May 14 after being published in America.
