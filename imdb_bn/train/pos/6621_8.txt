I came back from watching this fantastic sci-fi film Noire Pre-release. It's style is definitively unique and very well made. It is illustrated with real actors, but transforms a black and white comic-strip style you have never seen before. It goes one step ahead of Sina City, and it's good. It is a successful combination of French comic and cinema culture. The story and the mood reminds the blood runner, and if you like it, of course you also like it. The storyline is intelligent, annoying and has some nice little twists. This film must be seen for a sinefil, but perhaps those who do not like seis and b & d.
