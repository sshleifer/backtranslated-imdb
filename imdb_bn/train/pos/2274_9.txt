Although I like Cart Vanguette, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I do not even know it. The only reason I noticed that one of my favorite actors was Nick Knolt, "Champions of Breakfast" and "Hotel Rwanda". But the film brought me a wonderful surprise. Of course Nolt was great, but so was the plot. There was little political conspiracies and there was even more attention to moral questions: By reading anti-Semitic radio speeches with American secret messages, he actually contributed to German's general attitude (and, later, Americans) to Jews or Hitler . Which carries a lot of weight, its service to its country or its subconscious contribution to semestism? These words are never spoken, even frankly even as hesitant to describe even more prominent. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolt) was a person who had learned to hide his feelings so completely that he would not even open his memory. It is almost impossible to portray the internal contradiction of such a character - but with the help of excellent acting and photography, this film is managed. There are other topics of <br /> <br />, such as comedians or romantic clich√©s (such as the White Christmas song), which makes it different from the average American movies. I recommend it to everyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movie.
