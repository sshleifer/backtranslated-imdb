When I was shown first time in CBS, I saw it, I was a little skeptical. I was a lot who was in NYC that day, I'm going to school at Hunter College. I did not want to see all the debris and killings again, but like many people, I saw what all these were. Tears came to my eyes and saw this documentary. All my memories came back and only the intense image was incredible. I bought the DVD at a year's anniversary and saw it a few times. It was incredible how these guys can capture this footage. If you have not seen this documentary, do a favor on your own and test it. It must be sad and tears in the eyes, but these countries are incredible hours of incredible documents.
