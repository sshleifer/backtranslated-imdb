Great carousel Mario Lanza displays unique talent He shows great acting abilities and top form as a lyricist, Dorothy Kirsten, associated with Metropolitan Opera Soprano. In fact, I dared to say that he performed some songs better than Karusor (check A'Wichael from Rosinar Toshi and La Danza). The MGM Art and Music divisions also did a good job. This movie could be perfect, it was not for Anne Blyth's peculiar presence; We see that he is trying his best, before the style of the style of the fifties - incompetent. Lanza deserves a good leading lady, and Blyth should produce less needs. Also, with Mrs. Kirsten Lancer, most of the opera singing the Doat song, wrongly convinced that there was a permanent leading place in the carousel.
