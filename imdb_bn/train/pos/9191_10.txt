Okay, I did not get the first thing to watch this episode for the first time. It seems like I can not touch my fingers. At this time, Costa Mesa attracted my attention by setting fire to the TV - and it helped me write that I was just writing an infotech! But to see if I have not yet talked about it <br /> <br /> One tweep review mentioned that there were 7 stairs in Tony due to Tony Lift. Yes, 7 significant numbers for many reasons, especially religious, but here's another one for ya. Did I discuss Wikipedia and guess what is the Dante divided into 7 levels? Purgatorio Ex-paralyzed and excluding Paradise (In the lower part of the stairs and ... Tony can not get it.) <br /> <br /> The accused "Random" monk-snap scene. As soon as the monk appeared, Purgatory with Tony tried to find fit perfectly. When you came to Christianity (death, disease, and sin) he was worried and he was even more disappointed because the Christian heaven was becoming kind to him. At that time he met the monks and said, "Can these people help me?" Which sounds like the opening of other religions (eg Buddhism) and some other way can lead him to "salvation". Tony is not necessarily thinking of becoming a Buddhist, but it seems the Phanti tried (and objectionable). That slap in the face is basically no quick fix to say Tony- as, no, you can suddenly hug Buddhism and get it from here. <br /> <br /> Tony was not very worried about going to heaven first. But in the "conference entrance", he realizes that it will not be so easy for him. At first I saw the problem of vs driving license, such as how Tony had led a double life, how he slept with the murderers and kept secret from most people. He feels free to have a relationship with Kosi-Malfi because "He Kevin Finnt" He acknowledged that he could fool some people with the KF card like a hotel receptionist, but it will not take him out of Pygari. The helicopters - Heaven helicopters? - Keep an eye on him and everything he has. <br /> <br /> After reading the "Finally" theories, although it seems that the identity of the KF is infinite reminder, Tony can take many different ways in his life. The potential car involved in Infiniti with the fun which otherwise would not have any ideas for me. At that time my brain was stuck.
