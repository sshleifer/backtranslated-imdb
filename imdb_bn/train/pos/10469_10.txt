I came to see the promotion for this event before coming back in 1993. I was eight years old, and now at the age of 22, the civilization starts and looks at the end, it looks strange. All of 90 seems to be so far, what a great decade. Anyway I used to always see MonsterVision, I'm a huge fan of monster flicks and horror movies. This was the 90th edition of Chiller Theater. Why Joe Bob's show of MST 3 could get DVDs, at least the MonsterVision was more interesting and informative. Joe Joe Bob's comments and information in the film were much delighted. Most of the movies shown on the show were B or C Grade, but it has appeared in many House movies and England's Hammer films, which are at the top with Harhausen's stop motion glory. Many were the weird football that is familiar with elsewhere and independent films like Metal Storm and Motel Heal, which would not be seen anywhere else like Japanese Saifai films without Goujilila. In the new decade of film-saving and more individual-minded managers, I think Monstreisan will be a good show for IFC selection, because they have already been hurt in the IFC Green House show. I'm sure this program will be taken again for some days because of nostalgia, I guess and see. Until then that "that great television"!
