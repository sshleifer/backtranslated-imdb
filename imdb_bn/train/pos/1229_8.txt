I have seen before this age before I read these reviews that it was awesome! I rent it to expect the worst, and there are very few sandler movies there, even worse, there are worse! Sandler frequently talks about the camera and the movie does not take it seriously, but it's a fun part! The afternoon is a great way, and even you can laugh twice! Rent a good film, good value!
