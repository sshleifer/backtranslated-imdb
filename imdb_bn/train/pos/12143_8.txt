The next best film of the Brilliant Film, Drunk Master (Jackie Chan) I recently bought this original VHS and did not watch this movie for 15 years but it was as good as it was before. Acting was terrible and dubbing was even worse, but it created features that made the movie (and many other old Chinese Kung-fu movies) awesome. Drama is awesome and storyline is basic. I have never seen the 36th Chamber of Shaolin but I know it played the same movie but Gordon Liu Sun played, but Sun played a different role in the 36th Chamber's Thrush Return. It has many comedy values ​​and bright kung fu.
