The first time I saw this "film" I liked it. I was more interested in music and dance at the age of 11. I grew up, I became more interested in acting. The first half was just before the Michael Carrier (from Jackson 5 to "Bad"), it was still entertaining to watch. The "Badder" sequence may have left out, although the kids were pretty good. "Speed ​​daemon" and "leave me" were fun, especially when the police officer told Michael, "I need your autograph here after stopping him for dancing in dramatic areas". But it is a "smooth criminal" that is icing on a cake. Joe Pesci did a wonderful job as toughie (and that hair was wild). Dancing is perfect, and so special effects. The spider was not without the only thing. Any fans of Michael will see this, if you are not already. I give it 10+!
