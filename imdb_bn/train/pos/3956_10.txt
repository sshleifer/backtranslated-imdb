HUSBANDS BEWARE CAME is a remix of classic bridal grass. At the beginning of the film, the new cooking scene of the movie is great. Stooges are always fun when they cook. But after the first few minutes of the cooking footage, we cut the original footage of Bridal Hills. I noticed about the remix from 1953 to 1956 that they fit in with a new story. If old storyline does not match the line they do not have an insert shot. <br /> <br /> HUSBANDS BEWARE has a new end, but I do not want to wonder who would give it. <BR> <br /> **** 4 star out.
