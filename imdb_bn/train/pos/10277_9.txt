It's almost a perfect film The ideas of the mammoth will be repeated, but not so brief. This is really about human condition, belief failure. The film thinks that we are all criminals, none is innocent. Is anyone alive today who does not see this game in our society, every single day? The film is much more secure as a hitchoch thriller. There is no innocent character except. The world is now completely contaminated, destroyed and everyone is participating in this conference. Can anything be true? <br /> <br /> Do not miss the soundtrack. It's nice
