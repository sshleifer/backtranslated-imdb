Warning Speaker This movie was just right. Goldie Haun and Chris Stern best two. All right, so the buffer who was foreign businessman (speaker here) had fun with the biker for his clothes. This guy's boss was very good. But the film really belonged to Sarandon and Haun. These two screens had a lot of time together. They were great chemistry. Bathroom View-Ooo! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Talk about Sarandon to give away a lot. Spinner is a rather unusual romantic / political comedy, and it is a bit more satisfying - political aspects are more than romantic. It touches on political issues, and only in scurm in romantic areas. <br /> <br />
