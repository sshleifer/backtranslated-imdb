Okay, the recent history of Star Trek did not work well. In the next few seasons the next generation has collapsed, the DS 9 has been brave there, where no one else lived, and Voiger started very bad and never lived in his promise. So, while declaring a new Star Trek series, I did not have high expectations. And, the first episode, Broken Bow, has some problems. However, overall it was a strong trek element and a good rope. <br /> <br /> I'll get out of the street first. The open theme is dull and I'm not looking to sit regularly through it, but that's what the remotes are for. What was really bad was totally unrealistic lotion cracked scene that just happened to my wife in the room. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Although still new, well rounded and always does not seem to be what you expect. With the little little theme of Volcano, clearly being represented very differently than before. I especially like linguists, the first star track character I could not face in death, but had to work with its fear and fear. They considered Track Lower to be true, which has been a significant issue in the past series, although there are some things like shielding them, instant innovation of technology, and travel stories during its inevitable flood. Does anyone want to start a pool before showing the class? <br /> <br /> All of them have huge potential in the series. They are watching the universe with fresh eyes. We have the opportunity to learn how they got the next series. How does the clueless just go from the insult of war? How did we meet Romulan? How to charge the federation form and the world is OK. Why the main guidelines are so important? My favorite line: Jeffram Kochran says, "No man has ever gone before" (nor "nobody").
