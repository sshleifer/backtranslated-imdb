It's a great film of 40 and well-produced. The film is full of dramatic scenes in the film, which is completely surrounded by jap wars between John Garfield (Al Shamid), "Force of Evil", "48 and Dan Clarke, "(Lee Diamond)," Last Rites ", '88, WWII. And only with a machine gun. When Al-Schmid was able to go home after being hit with a serious injury, his problems started with his family only and started to start with the girl's friend. Dane Clark Lee has contributed tremendously to Diamond Diamond, who helped his friend to live together again. There is no complete victory in the war and all the war and our current Iraq vets will not forget all the brave soldiers in the hospital.
