I really enjoyed watching this movie really! First, seeing his poster, I thought it was another simple romantic comedy ... but it's more than just that! I personally believe that this idea (which was a sure part of the audience, was sure of seeing the movie) it is still another important part of the big idea of ​​this movie (or its marketing strategy)! What I mean: Nowadays we are the slave of the image! Make impressions! I went to see this movie on the wrong impression, the wrong prospect, and finally I felt how much I could be a god! For example, it comes to my mind that Sidney has bought an aircraft ticket to return to the airline's ticket to New York, and signing it for the ticket has been said to 'sign', he believes that he has received television because of the scandal in the scam now what kind of celebrity he is now. And this, I believe, is the measurement of this main theme which revolves around the movie. On top of this, I believe the movie offers to resolve with Sidney's attitude with us as well as being pictured throughout the film: Do not be too serious about yourself or anyone else ... "Even people were at the beginning of the day" ... Once Sophie once in the movie Said. The moments of this moment are big. We call them the fulfillment of eternal happiness 'Aura', but the reality is much lesser than that. Even the ideal models of how a person can be treated, how to behave, and how to live your life. Even they were not for real ... after they died they became 'for real' and we were looking at them. And who is caught: We need our Saints! We need our big! We struggle for them so that it is not for them or there is nothing to fight for us. And the way to create and capture our striking television and all other media. We require benchmarks which measure themselves strictly. And we got to see the first movie in the film: whether we can fit Benchmark, or if the benchmark for us is small. This time we were bigger than expected.
