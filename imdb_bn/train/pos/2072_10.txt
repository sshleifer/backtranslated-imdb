This movie came out of television when I was thirteen years old. It's much more effective than most movies. Martin Shane is excellent, and although Nick Knollet has a small part, he also provides excellent support. Fantastic like Victor Moro Villen <br /> <br /> When Shin "checks water" at his '34 Ford (COOL) side of the mountainous road, it is spectacular! <br /> <br /> The last grand. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this low vote. I think this young people are more interested in most of the generation that is coming nowadays. <br /> <br /> Good taste enhances people!
