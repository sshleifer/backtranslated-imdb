'Where Sidewell Ends (1950) is the name of Dan Andrus and Gene Ternes' empires on the right, as dirty water flows between bars of a sour grout. Pedestrian Represents Honor, Honesty and Morality ?? Only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter. But even the most respected man of man sees the tendency of being misled on the occasion, and when the roadway is suddenly over, sometimes its shoe proves impossible to avoid being wet. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) was born, his father is a professional criminal, and his entire life turned to the pathway, on the crest end, he was always balanced. As a police detective, Dixon does not want much more than to show his father's lack and honesty, but there is a strike between him that he can not escape. When suspecting his death in suspicious death, Dixon considers himself to be a father, whom he despised, a cheap criminal who will deceive and lie to hide his crime. <br /> <br /> 'The End of Sidewalk' was the only film of Dana Andrews, Gene Terni and Director Auto Premiere, after the great 'Laura (1944)', although two films, where Noor left, could not have been more different . Although the previous image was a strong intimacy in the story of a country-house murder, this movie is known as a minor police drama. Given its incredible memorable performance as Laura Hunt, it is unfortunate that Tierni is a perfectly helpless, appreciable, helpless romantic man. {As she did the same year Jules Dasne's 'The Night and the City (1950)'} On the other hand, Andrews has rarely been good, has expressed a strong and unconditional anger that I did not expect from him.

Good character is perfect; I did not understand it , But Conte just appeared in Preememar's 'Walarpul (1949)' a year ago. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dixon's ambition Is it trying to cover the crime, so what? Of course, in the most suspenseful sequences of its era? Though I think the situation is still not fully utilized, the taxi driver is the only person who could arbitrarily identify Dixon as a criminal, but to move Simson to the stairs At the moment, Premimmer quickly makes the scheme. Dixon Apartment Prove Sher was re-introduced outside its own movement, we could have some genuine phayaraoyarka. And why, the taxi driver murder suspect testifies immediate jigsaw Taylor (Tom Tully), who was unable to drive? Such inconsistencies, such as the extraordinary screenplay, from Ben Heck, that breaks the disorderly criminal underworld with hard-hitting police and wise-cracking failures. Andreyas's rebellious and provoked law-abiding proprietor, persecuted by anger and regret, rarely did Nicholas Roy's "On Dangerous Ground (1952)" Robert Ryan did equally well. '
