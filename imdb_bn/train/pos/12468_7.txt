All right, this movie has started like a Chess Lifetime movie and it's not better until it gets better through the movie. The script 'cheese' and 'fluff' are not well-directed and well-directed for the most part. For the first half of the film, the little girl poured into my nerves. I do not think this is one of his best performing acts. The only reason for buying the film was that it was sold and it came in Berlin. He is awesome but this is not one of his best performing gigs. The story is based on true facts and that helps the movie. Actually, I did not like the movie at first and when I saw the balloon trip steel, I was saying that ... where it seems to be going and it will be done with it! But it is forgiven by time of reaching its destination and the story comes around. If it does not tears in your eyes, nothing will happen! It makes sugar and predictable but you feel better about the world again.
