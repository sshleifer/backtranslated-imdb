I was a fan of the book from the third grade, so of course I saw the movie, read the segel, and then saw the television show. It was a good show in myself and now as an adult I still enjoy the show. It was my only real problem that it did not follow the book. The first time I saw, I was very disappointed that I stopped it. But that's coming from a girl who owns the first addition of the book. But after that I decided to try again and ignored the book (what you have to do with Harry Potter films). I found the series surprising! It was a clear cut and something that everyone could enjoy, just the right amount of comedy, which everyone was leaving. It's really enjoyable! Clean and wonderful!
