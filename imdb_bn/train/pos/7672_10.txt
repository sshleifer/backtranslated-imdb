I acknowledge that Holly was not on my watch list for the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, the film's artist director, especially the film, decided to look at more than 200 viewers to suggest to the audience before screening of any other film. How nice! <br /> <br /> This image is working very hard on child prostitution and without any compromise. I cried several times during the movie and saw the smile of others. Talking about a mental roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The main actor (Thu Nguyen) was the new arrival of Vietnamese (who was only 14 during the filming) and had to deal with this incredible complex and difficult role. He reminded me of Hello Rider's Kesa Castle-Hughes, but here's a role that she needs to play a small prostitute. It is likely that he will win many awards. <br /> <br /> The main story is about a girl who sells her prostitution by her family and is considered sex-slave in a prostitution in Cambodia. He is an American (played by Ron Livingston's strong dramatic role, which is not used to see from him), after spending some time deciding to help him. Until that time, she was sold again and she was looking for Cambodia around. The story revolves around and the audience can not predict what will happen in the future. <br /> <br /> The acting was strong across the board with very interesting international cast. Udo Kiar (very convincingly as a sexual traveler), Virgin Ledovane (touching as a social worker) and Chris Pen (one of his last movies). The Asian cast was fantastic too. <br /> <br /> Although the film is directed at these difficult issues, it is successfully targeted to tell a compulsory, powerful story. It was shot in Cambodia (some scenes in real operating prostitution), which seems to you that you are watching almost a documentary. It seems that the DP used cameras and close-ups in many hands and overall it seems to be right as part of the story. <br /> <br /> After screening, I was hearing the other person left the audience and thought that they were all surprised. It's not an easy movie to watch and I salute the filmmaker for not making a "Hollywood movie". <br /> <br /> This is the best movie seen on the Edinburgh Film Festival. Opinion shared my husband and some friends.
