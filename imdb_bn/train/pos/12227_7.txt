Perhaps I found it out of the hilarious and linguistically challenging "Quoices" (1995), probably the best known attempts of Alicia Silverstone, from the beginning of his film career. Kevin Dillon is among the "True Crime", which should be helpful in the development of most movie projects. Actually cast everyone does a good job. The only frustration I think is that the movie is for me, it's a painful "feeling" for some scenes, which starts to be a part of the most incompatible, growing theme school. /> <br /> Alicia Silverstone is quite good in this one. She carries on deadly encouragement and growing insecurity that affects Mary Giordano because she leads to the truth behind a series of murders. I count the mg's its characteristic, it has very few mileage. In the context of the story line, he went to a law enforcement career. It can be really interesting for old silverstones to review Giardano during the crisis after the officer's life. Just a thought! <br /> <br /> "True Crime" shows its director in a good light. Pat Verducci also has writing credits. I do not know PV did any other film work. <br/> <br /> Like most of the productions, it has mostly unknown support cast, although Bill Noon (Detective Jerry Gin) rarely finds it. In the last decade, he seems capable of securing an impressive number of screen appearances. I recently saw him in "Careers" (1998), which is made for a TV presentation with a military theme. Bill Nun played "Captain Arends". Essentials of classic US TV comedy exhibition "Where the Boss" may also have interest in "carriers" because leading player Judith Lite, remembered with affection by many because of his long association with the show. <br /> <br /> "True Crime" can not work easily, but it's OK. I think it's a entertaining story to see.
