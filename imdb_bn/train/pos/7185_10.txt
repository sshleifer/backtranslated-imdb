While sitting in the balcony of her Barbal's house, Ted Mappes told me that she and Rid Haddley were wearing uniform clothes in every item of clothing except for Hat. <br /> <br /> Ted, one of the most stunt men, every time after Zoro's mask, he was one on the screen. <br /> <br /> There was that impossibility: Zorro was probably Reed Hadley, but in the stunts we were able to be satisfied that it was Ted. <br /> <br /> What a stunt! "Zoro's Fighting Leagin" Here's one of the most common serials, as the opinion of the opinion. It's exciting and usually very well made. <br /> <br /> Reed Haddle was a good actor, and someone else commented, he made a very good fawn. <br /> <br /> But, confession makes this movie so big that this image is created. <br /> <br /> And what we can expect, that wonderful team, Witney and English, uncommonly acclaimed William Lava (The list here was unknown, but it was wrong; the other composers listed here were actually unknown and I I do not know if they are writing a song - it sounds like lava), and among the others, with great Charles King, and dozens of bits with villains? Also, Radio Tarjan, Jim Pearce, who was the son-in-law of Adger Rice Burroughs, also noticed. (I tell you to read his mini-bie.) <br /> <br /> <br /> One section that frustrates slowly and slowly gradually moves slowly and slowly <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And thanks to everyone involved, we should know that this is a section - Playing as game or serial and not as a re-cut feature.
