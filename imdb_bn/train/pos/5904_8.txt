I was waiting to see this movie for a long time. Its promotions gave a fair idea about the content and I finally saw it, I really made it pretty well. Most traditional romantic movies end up with lovers, after getting married, starting with a happy marriage or starting a happy life, the new relationship from old life and life is really a great adjustment for this transformation. This movie is related to that time, when the newly married couple Fardie and Isha marry and married through married marriage and start their life with honeymoon. Acting really is really a binding though I think that Isha was a little quiet and she could use some lines for herself. The story was well stocked and the dialogues were less or less suitable. The performance and direction were also good, Meghna Gulzar did really well here. To sum up, I would say it is a good addition to romance, which is a true addition to a clean entertainer in Bollywood.
