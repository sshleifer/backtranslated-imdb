What is "freedom of action"? This is an easy and unique experience for South Africa, and black people in that country were suppressed by white people. The main character of the story Donald Woods (Kevin Kline), editor of Daily Delacch, South Africa's editor-in-chief Woods wrote several articles, where he talked about critics about Steve Bike's (Denzel Washington) opinion. Soon Woods met Boko and he changed his opinion about him and he began to understand what South African black authority (even from the top of the authority, even the top police) officials are doing it. When Baco dies in police custody, Woods decides that he must write a book about him and release any topic. But to publish that book, Woods must flee his country and he must keep his family in second place, so the world can find the truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Black and white are the same main message, because we are all people. The story takes us to South Africa and is a great way to learn about what has happened to the whole world, and I am disappointed that only 3200 people have rated this movie. We all can learn from this movie. Even though it is a bit more, this story can not be presented in a short way, because the director wanted to tell us how hard it was to Woods to publish the book after the death of Biko. <br /> <br /> The relationship between wood and biker has been shown, just like the families of the two families and the problems they are facing. But sometimes the sacrifice must be made (borek death) so the truth can be reinforced (woods book).
