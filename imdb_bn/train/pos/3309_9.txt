This is a great movie. If it is a hint rather than Hong Kong Sung Suo, then "the best secret secret of Asian film". It is very similar in style to Ming-Liang and Hau Hoesio-Hassian and they add the same ground to them, but I think I really enjoy it in any of their movies. The very simplicity is pronounced here more clearly than their work, even though it still fits the style completely (the camera can never run at all), and the way I am the less "slow" of the film Tasai Ming-liang or Hou Hijiyo-Housian, which I I think the reason I enjoyed more. Plus, it does not keep most of the matter working as Hu. I think the film was more "complete" and less open-ended (only barely) than their work, even though it was not meant to say that it was something like a forward-moving plot. Sophia Coppola believed that "Sofia Coppola" was directly "lost in translation" (she had no scenes in her own surroundings and was not seen in her hotel room, but it may seem familiar).
