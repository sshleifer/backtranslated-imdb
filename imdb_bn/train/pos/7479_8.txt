"Sweet is not sweet without smell." This quote was basically theme for movie in my opinion. Tom Cruise plays a young man who handles everything in his life. She takes things for granted and it comes near full swing of this great movie with a fantastic twist. This image will keep you involved in the plot and unable to stop it for breaking a bathroom. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that really lags you down and looks at your life and how you live it. You can not appreciate the love of love as good (sweet) in life, until you get bad (awkward) experience. The theme will really get you "open your eyes". <br /> <br /> The only complaint is that the movie points are too thick and really difficult to understand. I think the end though is perfect. I recommend you see it and see for yourself.
