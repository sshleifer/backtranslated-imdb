This show has been my escape from reality over the past ten years. I'm sorry to miss it. Although the Atlantis fill the hole a little short <br /> <br /> The last episode of SG1 (however on television) was done nicely. Robert wrote something that was felt around reality. Although he was trying to explain what the show set looks like. (Everyone who works closely together for so long time is bound up and down. But for years they have become a family). I was a great way to end it despite some other criticism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> SG1 was something special and time and time again to take me to the threshold of mysteries and wonders. Wonderful characters, stories, directors, writers. From the episode one I was hooked. Action, science, drama, and especially the comedy blend have done so well that makes me want to do more. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am just thanking those who kept this event so fresh and entertaining for years. It inspired me to do a lot of things as impossible. <br /> <br /> I'm waiting to watch movies next year and I really hope their numbers will be there. I do not want to die of grief. <br /> <br /> Stargate SG1 - 1997 - 2007?
