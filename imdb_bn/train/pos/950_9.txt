The settings and the actor made this television movie the best presentation of Dickens' classic story for me. George C. Scott is quite credible as a custom. To the very end of the film, his screws were cruelly, with a lot of odds. Then change one of its characters that are truly repentant. The 19th-century English city was selected for this setting, which is suitable for Dickens and it is feasible for this movie. This is a movie that I have with real Greens of every Greece and it's a wonderful life.
