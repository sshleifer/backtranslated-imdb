The Gahst Train praised the general humor of 1940, and a treat for them. It connects World War II with the plot, but I did not believe it as soon as it was, and the letters are a unique mix that drives their roles well. Askey, who plays the role of Tommy Gander, brilliantly or shines stories for the part that can be portrayed as "dragging". <br /> <br /> The story of the spectacular station is even surprising for the fact the day is of value. It is unique and the way to communicate with characters in every way is the Hoist Train which is superb to enlighten the mystery. Gander is basically a concern to other members, the rest get fairly well. He can always be dubbed as the center of attention and "boring" but it does not appreciate the humor of 1940s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> My opinion
