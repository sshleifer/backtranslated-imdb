New York I love you and power is full. <br /> <br /> It's like Shiite La Bauuf (Transformers, Destobia, Charles Angels, I Robot, Indiana Jones and more), Majzi Q, Kevin Bacon, Black Lily, Natalie Portman, and more many things. With a star-steaded cast, this movie is without any doubt, bright. <br /> <br /> From the top managers of the world, it fails to influence. One diversity from one story to another is creative and unique. <br /> <br /> It is safe to say that New York Eye Profit you should watch a populated movie, and an Big TV! At the moment, believe IMDB rating, because it's a nice movie. <br /> <br /> Shanghai is waiting in love I love you in 2010. <br /> <br /> See NY Yi, you will not be disappointed.
