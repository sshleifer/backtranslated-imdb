Both the invisible ray Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi have an excellent display of their talents. Karloff appears to appear before his relationship with his wife, even with his scientific success, who pulls his unexpected performance as a sullen and contradictory scientist. <br /> <br /> Logosi is a Consumer Professional who is enthusiastic about his work but has still found time to maintain a good position with everyone, but seems to be no real yet. Close friend This is one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays very well. It is difficult, but listen to his pronunciation and believe he is French. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the movie was that it was based on "Junk Science", but in a similar way, junk science even works well. Since the ideas and the theory are completely stupid, so they are "relevant" as they were in the movie today. And they are forward-forward as well- and will always be there. <br /> <br /> This is a completely fun movie to watch again and again. I saw this weekend 5 times and I could easily sit through it five times. The acting is extraordinary and science is fun. I highly recommend it.
