Think of Pierce Brosnan and you think civilized, dapper, cute James Bond. In this movie, Brojan plays against type - and it has lots of fun (like viewers). This is a movie about a tenant murderer who is friends of a persecuted businessman ... and it works! <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie, with a very good view (a writing, front broon and a good, consistent "off" -but Kinnear has some good lines). My only cavilage is to play Hope Davis, a co-tolerant wife ("Can I see your gun?") Is not seen more often: he may be a wonderful foil to these men. <br /> <br /> This movie is like Matador: It played with viewers, when "going to a murder". The end is extraordinary because a story (with a positive moral!) Appears: This is a frenzied, satirical and fun movie, which deserves a wider audience.
