Characteristic of Jeremy Northam starring, Light Mannid Booking Morgan Sullivan, and under the influence of single malt scotch to see him and his original identity pieces are brilliantly designed and presented in a glance under the presence of Lucy Liu. The idea of ​​his cigarette in the bar was of old habits, without questioning and lost in his face, neck and lip. No matter the brain's smoke, there is a way of persevering in love. Love can not be "intelligent" with two fake women. Gradually, he began to debate with glasses, began to walk and talk separately, and despite the face of progress of the film, his face is different even after his appearance. The music is superb, hypnotized, sexy and is appropriately driving at times. Using a variety of black and white and gray tones, it is almost the result of most classic thrillers, it is almost a scientist who makes "film silent". I liked seeing more weaknesses in the film of Lucy Lee, whenever she saw him in her different shades, the person she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith, there is some flaws in her weakness and genuine sympathy. Its part of the concern has created a less one-dimensional performance. He did not find a match for Northam's competition, but in the end, I enjoyed this movie perfectly and would enjoy learning about the other screenplay written by the same author.
