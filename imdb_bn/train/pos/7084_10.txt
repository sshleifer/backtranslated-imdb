I can not determine whether this is one of my favorite movies. It's a good thriller and a mental core but I still can not decide. I definitely like it. This is Terry Gilliam's first movie I have seen. My first impression? I was involved till the end and it's not all complicated (to be confusing). <br /> <br /> The movie is set in the future. To get some information from the past (to be specific from 1996) a James Cole (Bruce Willis) is sent from the future. A virus killed 5 billion people. She is sent to get some information from the future. Also included here is a Psychiatrist named Catherine Rail. The story of love is beautifully illustrated and you can actually feel the desire for this love and longing for regular life. Loose ends in very interesting method at the end of the end. <br /> <br /> What I like about this movie is that unlike other post-apocalyptic movies, the movie is a boring social commentary and instead focuses on this person and his desire for regular life. "You want to see the ocean, stay with it", especially a mad line in this movie. It's the focus of tension and confusion between the person's mind. Therefore, it can be described as a romantic Saiffai movie, not with the post of the appropriate Creator, which relates to the different images from the time of the journey with the theme. This film has made a special film of the 1990s. Complex plots flowing smoothly without adding too much letters. <br /> <br /> Performance is quite good. Bruce Willis surprised me here because he did not play a regular man here, but he gave a good performance of a confused person with love. His disappointment in specific order is beautifully portrayed. I have to check out his other movies. A treat to watch the fantastic Madeleine Stowe watch. I have been so disgusted with him since this movie. She has given a woman a great performance, who is sympathetic to her patient and eventually falls in love with her. Brad Pitt is really amazing, though with a crazy person named Jeffrey Guynes. His Oscar-nominated performance seems pretty surprising that he does not have many critics who use soft words for him. <br /> <br /> The last one is quite cool and another reason to see the movie. Length or complexity is not a big problem because the film is running very fast and there are enough events for interested people. And every event in this movie has meaning and there is nothing unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Good thriller 10/10
