This movie has really stirred me up, as it sparks the heroes of this bold film from its sleepy life. <br /> <br /> This guy John (Ben Chaplin) led Nadia (Nicole Kidman) ordered by the Russian e-mail in a small provincial English town, which led the safe life between his banker Telar, who is surprisingly fantastic, wild, girl- To die, John plans to join his life as his beloved wife. However, an error turns up - Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language. While outdoors quiet and emotionless, John is so interested in Sunder Nadia that instead of using the full return policy of the mailing service, he bought a dictionary to start the communication process. <br /> <br /> Now, the idea of ​​deciding to make Clerk's decision to really make the poor feel sure about the poor feeling of this conspiracy has been relentlessly given the viewer a supernatural message "You've probably played similarly". <br /> <br /> Kidman, Castle and Casaviet have created a great team to play Russians and they often become almost obscure from "real" because of their little pronunciation in Russian dialogue, but to surprise a local Russian through hard work Done enough to get the correct word of little sound. Nicole Kidman again proved her talent by playing a completely different character from the cultural background of the previous roles. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> My advice is to go outside and get this film immediately and see it and enjoy it. To add it, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and there are ideas below the surface. Like the "rude awakening" concept of the artificial safe routine of the wheel on the Society's machine, members of Fight Club were very interested to give up life and Pin Floyd is the machine that is welcome to the machine! "). I said to the end, Sophia was accompanied by Sofia as soon as she went on an unknown route than meet him. <br /> <br /> Writer for the great writing, thanks, and everyone else's awesome movie for this! And you can alternate it in phases and mention the name of the place because the place's authenticity is irrelevant to 99.9999 percent of the potential audience, I'm sure T
