A great underlying black comedy in a series of Grand Guinagly movies to follow 'Baby Jane' Reynolds and Winters are the mother of young convicted killers (called 'Obedience'), who escaped in Hollywood. They run a school for mobile phones, a group of sunny incomparable kids attended by horrific moms. Debbie, her blonde wig-in ('I'm a Harlow, you're more than Marion Davis, she tells Winters) took the thorn in her concert and a rich father wrecks the Waver. He gives a deliciously fun tanos and all, an outstanding performance, gives something unlike anything he has done before. A fine mixture of atmosphere comic and eerie. It looks wonderful with great time detail (30's). Lots of lovely swipes in Hollywood and gorgeous movie totems. There is a ball in Michael Mallian's playwriter: 'Hamilton Star', he purrs, 'but the prediction of two r'. See it and love it.
