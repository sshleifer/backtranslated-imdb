Among the breakdowning / hip-hop films released in 1983 and 1986, the film bit streak of 1984 is the perfect one. This story follows a winter by a DJ, his little breakdancing brother, a graffiti artist and a winter showboy promotor, where they try to stop Veto from using their "street" genius. Acting is not always equal and characters are not fully drawn, but they are more than compensated by down-to-earth conversation, a possible story, a fantastic dance sequence and a timeless hip-hop sound track. It must be noted that this movie was shot in Breakdesign's birthplace ("It's not New York, it's Bronze!"), And Breakdesign, dance troupe rock studio crew and rapper Africa Bambatta's parent features. Rock Stady Crew provides the best view of the film while dominating a dance war of the first breakthrough of the first 80s. Look for a hip hop lovers.
