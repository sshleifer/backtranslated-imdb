Bishf stopped him and requested to stop. Stephanie cited that Triple H had once told him how Biffech said there was no talent in Triple H and there was no charisma. Bisff said he was a young man and he did not know what he knew, but Stevey had many more experiences. Until the Triple HT came in step with its microphone, the two continued behind the back. The game said it would be easy to say "screw you" in one of them. Tripal H. Half of the hand grabbed the hand, but pulled it. He said that he did not know rather than go with Satan. Before going further, Shawn Michaels came out to stop some. HB told that what he wanted to do was creating a problem.

Shortly after, the ticker left the ring and exploded with The Rock Angle. Angle rock gives a superlexion to be cut, but Great One takes place through a DDT which is operated in two ways. As Baker's life came, there was a war outside the ramp and wearing Angle's clothes and repeatedly stopping the rock. The ticker and rock returned in the ring, and threw the ticker The Rock with a sidewalk slam so that it could get two times. Rock rebound, grabbed the throat and chokesmmed him! The rock title given is probably the corner attempt to break the corner. Revenge by latching the cart angle on the lock of the block.
