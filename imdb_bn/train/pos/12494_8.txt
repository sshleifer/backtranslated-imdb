Finally, an indie film that actually distributes some great scares! I'm going to see the most horrific films ... theatrical, straight-to-DVD, cable, etc. ... and mostly suck them ... some see ... even rarely ... The dark residues are one of the better ones. I got screening of this photo at the South Padre Island Film Festival ... the audience loved it ... and my wife and I like it! Actors do not have the name, I think the budget of this photo was quite small, but you do not know ... the movie looks amazing ... the acting works entirely for the film ... the story is good ... and the scares are great! While most filmmakers only pay attention to the fear, they often forget about the development of stories and characters, two things that help to deliberately distribute them efficiently. Brian Avente-Bradley must certainly be character and story important. He develops both points where you care about the letters, you know the characters, and they are so much more afraid when they are in danger. <br /> <br /> The horrific films that cost anywhere from $ 80 million to $ 5,000, I find there being one of the "dark residues" of gems. Check out this film!
