Finally I saw the notorious "Ice Age". Maybe it may not be funny, as I expected to see the bright teaser, but I can not say bad about it. Of course, this is not as fascinating as a Disney production (it is also the first attempt of Fox's full-length CGA film), but it has not found itself in the infinite heart and on some occasions (we saw his past sight of Manfred's eyes in his eyes) I could not find myself in the tears of tears. But when they rejoined their father with their father, I could not hold them back. A movie that does not have any problems in walking on a thin line of tragic and clich√© and does not bring anything better than that; The end result is one of the most sensitive animated creations I have ever seen. The great fun-looking characters that are growing rapidly to you (and great voice genius), and many interesting memorable scenes, especially on Scrut's side, make the film even more than enough to let the film go. As well as the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene 2002. <br /> <br /> I do not really get it, but for some reason it really seems that the Cgi animation will take the future upwards. . But if this only means more such films (and may forget Pixar's creations) then I do not think at least now. 9/10
