Starfucker (which falls in my box to Starstrak) I've seen the most amazing movie. I saw it that it was one of the best movies. So why not 10? Nothing is right. Why is he one of my favorite actors in this fascinating view of Jamie Kennedy Hollywood? I forced some people to watch movies and they all agreed that it was an outstanding flick.
