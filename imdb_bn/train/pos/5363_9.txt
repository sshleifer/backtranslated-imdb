This is one of his most memorable performances by Anaard Schwarzenegger's classic Action Flick of the '80s. Set in a future police state where the government controls everything with the television network. One of their most popular TV shows is "The Running Man", where criminals were convicted and millions were killed for entertainment. It's set up like a game show, where the audience voted for their favorite "STKs", trained killers who hunted and killed unfortunate "competitors" of mourning. The members of the audience will be killed by the winner of the prize for accurately predicting whom. And none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson is played on the host, who makes the game show experience suitable for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) was accused of genocide of false charges, he was forced to play this audacious game. <br /> <br /> This film is shining like the classic Arnold One-liner, with its famous "I'll be back before coming back" he got fit. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower "how a light?" I used to go, but I do not want to ruin the movie. That's funny! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> In the meantime, there are many programs that show a lasting pain and humiliation to the public for entertaining the audience and even in the court, they are broadcasted on television for their "entertainment standards". Running Man shows what happens if the reality TV hit rock bottom, and it's a terrible picture. Anyone can expect that the network has a general idea that it does not allow it to go so far. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fun movie and I highly recommend it. 10 out of 9!
