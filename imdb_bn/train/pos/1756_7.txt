"The 40-year-old Virgin" ridiculed me. I do not think it's too sexual comedy, I enjoyed many jokes and scenes appearing in this movie. Steve Carroll's virgin dance is perfect as Andy Stitzer and I think that Andy is removed by her hair one of the most beautiful wax, especially because it is real. Many of the actors and actors present in this film are well-known or already famous, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a little weird and lots of toys The collection, but seems innocent. One day, playing poker with his friends, they discovered that Andy really ... virgin! And she is 40 years old! After this amazing disclosure, all his friends are trying to sleep with a woman andyie ... The problem is that Andy is in confusion, especially now she really started to like Trish, when she bought a woman, she was filled up to the store A dvd player.
