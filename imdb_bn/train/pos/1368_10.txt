OK. At the age of 14, it has become a favorite. It is estimated that I can not see it more than once a year, but ... this is not a movie for an old generation that wants a deeper meaning or a great message. This movie is fun. It is beautiful, almost passages, but Parker Posey is so incredible that so bright. If you fall in love with 90 minutes of Tefans' 90th breakfast or love, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, do not bother.
