I heard that the "Secret Victor" was an enjoyable quality picture ... probably because I had no expectations on this film ... though, the film is the plot hole ..... I thought, I guess you could guess that behind the whole project, the movie was very late .... At the beginning, it was Robert Ryan, using the same method, like "gasbite" where the husband is crazy to drive his wife Tries , But I was wrong ...... the main problem, with the movie, they run at a completely different direction, which gave no clues to the beginning. ..... I thought, Robert Ryan & Claudette Colbert carried their part well ... Plus, Vivian Vance, a fine actress who smiled this scene ...... who like film, You keep in mind, like this one ......
