I always liked this Frankenheimer film. It was not just another thriller due to Alomor Leonard's good script and Frankenheimer. His short instructions and little detail makes all the difference in the attention, he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant! You can make a lawsuit that made her last best movie Ray Scheider. I always said that Robert Trebor just gave an awesome performance. Clarence Williams III has received all the promotions on her scary performance and she is also excellent, but I really thought the trayer was standing. Frankenheimer can not be proud of this image, but it is a full thriller of blackmail, murder, sex, drugs and real porn actors. What can you say about any film that is being shot with drug and rape? At least say a guilty pleasure. Vanity makes a real lazy role and an early look of a very young Kelly Pr rest. A classic exploitation thriller that should not be forgotten
