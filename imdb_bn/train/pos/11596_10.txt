I saw this movie about 7 years old - which was 33 years ago - and I have forgotten this movie ever! I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and beautiful eagle. And I just could not believe the eagle when she thought that she was dying in the theater ... <br /> <br /> My sister was in the movie with me and I recently asked her if she was a boy and We remember the movie by watching the eagle and she says that she thought that we saw yesterday. So it's not just me. <br /> <br /> This movie must be seen !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
