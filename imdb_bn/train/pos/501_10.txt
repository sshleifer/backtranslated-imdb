I still have the potential to be the best star track series, I think it's possible. We all say that they will release the ball and come out of the ideas ... but I do not hope! For those who did not see it .. SEO IT! The boring "head straight" can be great without being floating on their heads while they are in competition. And Scott Bakula is a great choice for the captain without any doubt, and Vocaline was very hot in the house (see the synthesis scene). I gave it ... all the other batsmen dropped out of the series .. I hope it will last for more than 7 years ...
