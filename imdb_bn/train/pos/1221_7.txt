For the longest time, I liked this movie better than the original Career Bear's movie. Well last summer, I saw both of them together and I decided I was wrong. The first is a good Care Bear movie (you can be guessed if you read my review for it). It's not a BAD movie, it's just ... very strangely. <br /> <br /> Firstly, as some people have mentioned, it totally denies any knowledge of the first film. I can not think of another sign that is vaguely reversed (especially some character genders and how they all get together). When I was young and watching it, I was a little confused and annoyed. I felt it the same way to see it as an adult! <br /> <br /> Why is this movie really good (if you disconnect it from the first movie). I can not remember other movies for little kids! Now I'm not saying for a minute that the evil spirits who want to steal the campers and the beer of beer beer are good, I just calm down and see that a wonderful movie has happened in a movie for little kids! You hear the Santa Claus vs. Satan movie from Mexico. <br /> <br /> However, the giant's name is Darkhurts and he wants to help him get his care as he gives his special powers to this chick. Very dark for a kiddy flick eh? And I mentioned that the darkhart most often seen the cute 10-year-old woman in the girl ??? Obviously! Meanwhile, there are some other children with care-at-lot after the care of father! Oh man Demo and children are rear !!!!! Not saying, everything ends at the end (but we can not see DarkHarts before trapping the souls of Care Bears in one [surprisingly] scary chandelere thing in a deeply annoying scene). But I went to the question of the visitor, the title of this movie has become so rich in viewers. I could just see it myself again.
