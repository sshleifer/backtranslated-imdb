Someone knows that James Earl Jones Waiter who is serving while Hagertie's wife says she is pregnant at the restaurant beside the lake. I saw this video in a video that I had closed the television. When I saw this scene, I thought I knew Jones's voice when the "waiter" laughs at the end. When the camera was dragging back, the tape hit again as he looked at the waiter. When Hagarty looks as if the waiter laughs closely and tells him to have a baby, the scene is slow, fast, even when the watch closely or camera waiter shows up.
