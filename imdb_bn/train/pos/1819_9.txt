When I first saw it, we borrowed it in our local library almost a year ago and it has seen about 3 times. We saw it again and finally I saw it so I liked it more !! :) :() <br /> <br /> This movie is known mainly as four dogs, Charlie and Itchi. (Dame Deloise and I love Dom de Deluge!). Charlie Half Gangster and half goody, which I like. Icici its lateral Charlie is killed by his friend (not) and sent to heaven. When Charlie came back to life, it started an amazing adventure. <br /> <br /> Why am I completely surprised about this image, its five major reasons: one: I like the characters (except the curfaces). My favorite three are Charlie, Ichchi and little girl Anna-Marie who came a little later. Two: I like the history of this movie in history. It is set to prohibit the United States during the time. Three: Dawn Blue Animation (as usual) Fantastic. The background is very good. Four: The strange tension of this movie kept at the edge of my seat. Five: This song is beautiful. My favorite song starts with "I need Brazil, throb, thrill ..." <br /> <br /> So, when you can see this lovely movie, you will not be disappointed! :);) :()
