8 Simple rules are a fun show but it has some life lessons that after losing a special reading that Paul died, was the first episode that I saw at the ABC show. Hennessy's descendants - mother Kate (Kati Sagal), daughter Bredgate (Kali Kuoko) and Kerry (Emmy Davidson), and son Rory (Martin Spongers) - Paul (see each other for guidance and assistance after John Ritter's death)), family patriarch Kate's parents (James Garner and Susan Placey) handed hands. I was happy after the second season of this event, they decided to design David Spad in this show because it was done with the NBC series, Just Shut Me! But all and all these shows are quite good. This show reminds me of a number of classic family situkums of the 80s and 90s that are used in ABS.
