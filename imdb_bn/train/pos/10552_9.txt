Nothing is not superb! That's as easy! It's a film that should not work, yet. Natalie is in the state of Saifai, but this film is a comedy. The cipher was in love with a big budget for Natalie ($ 7.5million! Woo-hoo!) So she again scales nothing. This is a low budget, best film making film. An effort to create a film for artistic talent as a simple, good old fashion conversation, and the most common cause of Hollywood financial reasons for most financial gain. Nothing about nothing and before you ask a movie, nor is it something like Seinfeld! Originally a couple of damages to Andrew and Dave They lived in a strange looking house at the bottom of two freeway. Andrew is a Telesales travel agent who is the best companion of Agropoobic and Dave Andrews who is free to help him. Dave is tired of her and has a pretty girlfriend who wants to move with her. Unfortunately, Dave finds his girlfriend embezzling huge amount of money from Davis's workplace for the murder of Dave, and Andrea is wrongly accused of sexual abuse of a girl scout (Canadian humorist!). As Andrew's house was destroyed as well and as it is building the house he could not make it, it should not have been constructed. Andrew and Dave are both inside the house when the police and the debris are coming into the house. They are frustrated and can not escape, and panic and confusion such as burglary in all the fades of police white. what happened? Dave and Andrew die? They wake up from their sleeping in the house and not just calm down. No police, no devastating group, no angry girl's mother scout! Dave and Andy discover that they have the power to "desire or hate". As it turns out they have hated the whole outer world. They are left alone. The house is surrounded by nothing, which is portrayed as pure white. So what this means is that setting a house in the movie setting and then just white. The film is an interesting aspect of human isolation and mentality, and of course they spend more time together with no food or water, they begin to tire each other. They discover that they can hate hunger, which is useful, but certainly things come out of hand. I can not publish a lot, but I can say a lot of eyesight in the head. <br /> <br /> This picture is playful, fun, funny. Though the effects are simple, and together with the comedians, David Hewlett and Andrew Miller, the two buddies of Natalie film lead. They have chemistry and work very well. They should have 90% of their own film and it is in a pure white background, but it works. I hope to get the same type of amazing treatment as the cipher, and it should be present in the DVD in a year or two of the state. Nothing is proven as one of the top quality and unique film and although Cube or Cipher is not as good as it turned out again as Natalie and comers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I am a victim of God's proposed Necropolis, Written and directed by ADD sufferers, never shit Paul Anderson. Vincenzo old friend if Paul comes round your pad, run !!! Like the wind !! I hope this guy does not come to Hollywood, like Alex Tryy (it's enjoyable, but still pussy-foot, sugar coated, helium light: I'm robot!). Keep your eyes peeled for this person. ****
