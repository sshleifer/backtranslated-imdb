"The Matador" is a dark comedy starring Pierre Brojon, an elderly adolescent who is a direct hit to American friends of merry American businessman (Gregg Benner) in Mexico. Although the scholarly Julian (ironically "Nobel") seems to be a "strong man" on the surface, under it is the mass of neuros and uncertainty, a person who realizes that his chosen profession has left him almost the world and the friendless. On his birthday, he reached Danny, a person who lived his life by the rules and was curiously excited by Julian's "unusual" lifestyle. Indeed, both men find each other that they can never be but they want to become their moment of neutral, self-evaluation moment. Although this film is a somewhat memorable "Analysis" and "Midnight Run", to fully refresh and feel original, "Matador" still earn points for the complexity of its characters and its performance quality. Bronjan was old and often used, his tooth was thrown in Julian's role in such a way that he had never been before. A man who is constitutionally unable to establish a serious relationship with other people, is a moment of brosnan flip and roam, then genuine and later sympathetic He always keeps our balance off so that humor does not ever become animal or barbarous. Kineya is also a regular Joe businessman who has dragged herself further into the Dark Side because her relationship with Julian deepens. Davis is doing a good job as "Bean", Danny's loyal and loving wife, who, like her husband, worries herself with this mysterious and "dangerous" image from this world, far from what she knows. <br /> <br /> Occasionally, we feel ourselves that "mathadar" keeps us somewhat, does not encompass its circumstances and depth of the premises. Eventually it seems a bit lighter, its effect is very rude to register. This could be because it is the debut of the debut film for writer / director Richard Shepherd, and he is still not taking his film. Yet, someone realizes that he does not always go clearly and he keeps a close watch on the two main figures in pieces, seldom settles for the trick setup or simple laugh. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "The Matador"
