I really enjoyed the first episode and looking forward to more. The crime front was a little soft (it was almost a thought and not terribly suspicious) but the romance angle was surprisingly charming. Surely meet again! <br /> <br /> I hope they play a big role for excellent actresses and this time it was almost unused. The actress who plays the Assistant / Waitress (also thinks I think Vibes) is very sweet and bubbling and is beautiful and silent and boring which is so beautiful that comes off so beautiful as dorky and sweet. <br /> <br /> Check it out.
