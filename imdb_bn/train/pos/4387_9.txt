It is a powerful movie from a historical and epic standpoint. The story is simple though it is pure and straightforward. In fact, this is an ideal story of a common, respected person, whose respect comes in conflict with more educated and wealthy people of this period. <br /> <br /> Good story by making poor, honorific versus disrespectful, not a classic but mostly hollywood glitches, without tucking up in school. <br /> <br /> Additional points are just because you can smell the people around the screen. :)
