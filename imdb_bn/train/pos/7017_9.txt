You are thinking about this two-hour movie "What is the story of lead character?" <br /> <br /> Smith, as a small key "Ben Thomas" will keep you guessing. Last 20-25 minutes when you find out, and it's a shock .... but you know how you're going to publish some dramatic. Until then, Smith, it's mysterious, almost plays the people stalking. You know that there is a good reason to do this, but it can never be explained, again to guess us at last <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some viewers have become frustrated with Rosario Dawkins ("Emily Pasa") or want to release this movie ... but this is not the reason that the last final piece keeps all pieces of this puzzle together. <br /> <br /> This is not a two-hour movie and generally action-packed macho will not Smith Smith film. Indeed, Smith's drawn, sad face throughout this story can be the most frustrating aspect. It does not look like a number of shots around it. She is losing weight and looks sick. Smith portrays a man carrying a lot of depression. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
