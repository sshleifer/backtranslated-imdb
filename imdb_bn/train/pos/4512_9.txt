I have seen this movie today and I have to say, it was a lot better than it was before watching it. Personally, I had some superstition because of its language, but it totally changed my mind. The movie was surprisingly in most cases with the biggest actor and actress performance. It was a story about a boy who had a dream and who did it to reach everything. It really touched me as a movie, which is based on the real story, it believes me. A new school, a psycho headmaster and a new boy who is familiar with a new teacher, is a little different than the others and even if they do not work, they also fight for the fight. It shows how many small things can make a huge difference in many things, and sometimes there can be a difference in difficult situations. Also I think the selection of actors has been completely successful. It really happened when you were such a person when they happened to see episodes as an outsider I admired this movie before I looted this image and admitted that there were some things and situations that were not realistic and were not realistic. The headmaster of the school defeated Fritz Ubera. At the end of the class in front of Martin, at the end of the movie. He was seriously seriously injured, but the only one that happened to him was compared to the first sabotage when some blood was coming from the nose, when the fract got a bit. I think every movie has its own flaws, If that's where I find the DVD from the shop from somewhere in this store, it's sure, I take it with me.
