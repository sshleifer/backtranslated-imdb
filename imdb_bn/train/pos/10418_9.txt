The story of Bagdada's son Chor (as told once) was drawn to Rahel Walsh's filmmakers in 1924, who first performed Douglas Fairbank in the silence, "Chor of Baghdad", for more recent efforts. Best, however, the 1940 version was finally a wonderful, high-end special effects witch panoplane for its time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The beautiful princess and evil gentleman sought by Ahmad played by Jafar, a gentleman, Conrad Weedat. Giant Zina is played by Rex Inagram. <br /> <br /> Ahmad was kidnapped by Zafar, and later he and son Abu, who are clearly victims of helpless discrimination while being arrested by the treacherous snake. Ahmad alaihis salam is recited and Abu is a loving mockery. Through their Hollywood Hollywood Backlots, their adventures are fun and special effects. <br /> <br /> The two people were responsible for the Garangantuan gems coming out of all the bottles from a witch flying carpet. Tornado-Like Black Cyclone: ​​Lawrence W. Butler and Tom Howard. (Howard, incidentally, the 1961 edition of this film had special effects, both men had a long and distinguished career in the technical wizards.) <br /> <br /> Dupless calls for extraordinarily beautiful and serious acting. Justin Ahmad is a driven but romantic romantic project unimaginable by the boyfriend's passion. Sabu is the central actor of many scenes and he is very good. For children as well as for adults, appropriate violence but bloodless types for a film. Yet I do not think anyone under the age of eight will see "thief of Baghdad." <br /> <br /> This photo appears occasionally on TV, but today my teenage son and I have seen a number of young people in the theater present in the youth It is very good to see computers-isolated kids in a wealthy community, especially to respond to cheers and applause, especially to respond to them. <br /> <br /> "Baghdad Thief" is a former-fight Hollywood classic. The time when the strong production value results in permanent and interesting release. This is one of his best. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
