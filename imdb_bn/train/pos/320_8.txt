I was one of the biggest art-house hits Cujias (yellow) (a movie, near the symphonic rhythm, it is said that both WW and Blue are available in the beginning) that was the first major sensation in Sweden. A big scandal / reason-celebrity in the United States is printed by a print and it goes to the Supreme Court. What impact there is in today's picture can not be offensive by what is expressed in sex or nudity - the director / actor Wilgu Susan has illustrated the scene in such a way that there is a great deal of meat and genetics and sometimes graphic bits but it is always much more Better than intellectual expression - but dare to try a pure 'metaphilism' And also make true statements about Sweden's statehood. In general, in a peaceful country (such as foreign issues and neutral in war) who knew such things? At least, it is part of Sjoman's goal here. <br /> <br /> Some of his works, such as WR (if not strange and unrested), or a small amount of Bartoluc√≠, like sedition politics, like a movie like Duan Macvazeve come out of sexual intercourse (most of the politics and social stages) On embodying a character in the film it is about to leave a comment as well. Two characters, Lena, and Boarze have a hot-cold relationship in the story of the film, where Lena is "the weird" socialist-Wangby who is seen on the street for non-violence in the street and 'train' in the jungle cabin. To be a fully functional, while at the same time selling his car is very strange about boyfriend boyfriend. And since it's going on, which is enough for a movie, Sejmin inserts herself and her crew in time to create this story (even in the middle of one middle, as in rock concerts, title cards that fill the time of throwing time using zero credits! ) Then retention gives a complete performance, since Sjoman gives a real performance, only "Hey, after me Do driver manager "bits. <br /> <br /> No one can get this frame first and I'm curious (yellow) is a film where Lena is a documentary interview, class, socialism, Spain and Franco, and once we see Lenn's father. But Sjoman makes some interesting: the structure is so pale as the one on the structure so has to stay on the feet; Along with the dramatic story, documentary, film-in-in-film, even Martin Luther King, being frightened by a serious interview, the film can be astonishing for so many years that it acts as a kosher for Lenara. . It may not always be completely politically analyzed, but it is also not with the feeling of cheating or even ironic programs like gadard photo; After rebel Sjoman is like a cattle but there is a whole other wavelength. His anarchy is curious but can not be fully loaded with semantic or tricks, which could stop the lesser initiated spectator. <br /> <br /> If I'm curious (yellow) standing as an intellectual initiative and the whole swelling to explore how sex is shown and how comfortable it is for the actors to feel like sex, it is a psychological experience I think I'm not completely successful. While Bergman came in a tee with full-fledged emotive films with de-structural tendencies, at the time when working with the actors in a big or fine view, it is better suited to connect with specific ideas when not always giving instructions very well. Sometimes actors Lena Nyman (mostly spectacularly played here that works for him as an aspiring but confused child, even to ask someone sympathetic and risky) and Borje Ahlstedt (a great realistic counterpoint to the emerging Lena), but after about 40 years Completely connected to everything that could happen to Lena and the indoor pictures (possibly deliberately) of Boraz RA difficult. (Boorez has a girlfriend and a child, will he leave her, how will she be? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Exhibit nicely as an artistic test to test what it can be for ridiculous use. I might even go as far as it is dominant, and then perhaps it is copied or imitated in more ways than one of the rituals (a particular technique has been used, returning the film to the end, echoing the poor use of fun games) , And anyone should be interested in creating an avent-garde or meta-film. If it is W.R. Or is not as outstanding as an artistic jump as Last Tango, it's close behind.
