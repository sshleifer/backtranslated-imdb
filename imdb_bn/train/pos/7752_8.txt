Berman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. As easy as that, and he succeeded. Not only his goal, but especially in the form of a wonderful movie. He knows how to use pans, slow sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. in a nice, smooth way. It makes the movie very comfortable. <br /> <br /> This story is about the life of eight different characters, which is nothing together: a group they all are present, go either the Turnpoint of this movie.

Beauty has various details of different experiences which are people who make their life or break. A little experience illustrates that Baranya is very successful in saying short stories.

Music is sometimes hot and relaxing at the same time, which contributes to the lovely, smooth feel of the film. Other times we hear Phunkie Pop / Rock-Melodies, which give them the necessary strength in some scenes. <br /> <br /> There is only one error, and it is the last half hour.
