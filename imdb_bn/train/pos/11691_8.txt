When I saw a great movie. There is always to say one of my favorite movies. I saw 8 times in the theater and got the DVD. As I grew up, I realized again that the film was average. Famous comedys advertising that advertised, this is nothing to do. I said Rock was ridiculous in the movie and the complete switching with ethnic content broke a little big barrier which is great. Also thinking about how to go movie goes a nice way. It is like most of a movie, but a little twist that is very nice touch. I love the movie as a whole, so I can give it ... <br /> <br /> Still good for me 7/10
