After abbreviating "Batman Dead End", I did not know what to expect from the best worldwide. Courses, Superman and Batman All of my world's seratom comic books have their teamwork. <br /> <br /> After watching this three and a half-minute trailer, I wish somebody will create a serial fan film for the finalists of the world, if there is no actual real-length movie. Sure, some of the superman stuffs were chessy, but movie trailers are always teasers in theaters, which give you only specific aspects of the entire product. It seems like a complete product. <br /> <br /> Playing a pony Perry White, unlike the director Sandy Cholera's other relative, most actors were unknown. If an actual film is made then the bill will be fit for the actor's film, although I believe that Nina Kakorosaki will create good lace lanes, especially if close-up conversations are given. <br /> <br />> It is good to see Clark Bertam, wearing Batman dress from Dead End, but it should be updated a bit more and 80s-90s should not be like the 40th Batman with a leather cape and collar. He lacked like Batman, but I still amazed the legitimacy of white communication lenses instead of showing his eyes through the mask. I believe that the film was aimed at achieving this by comic characters rather than personality. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael Hehren can not play Superman's duration. She simply stands around with an insane look on her face, "slap me." And line delivery seems to be a problem with her. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would like to see a complete story and film based on this impressive piece. There were rumors about making the best movie in the world and it could be with the correct addition to the script. Hope this is made more like this.
