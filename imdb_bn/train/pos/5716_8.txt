No one has seen the Japanese grudge, but I really enjoyed it. I rarely get SCARED while watching movies. I can jump if the effect and the word are quite amazing, but fearing the movie is rare for me. But I was frightened and frightened. Maybe I did not expect anything when I saw it. I was not expecting fear. I do not know anything about it This was probably a good thing. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you apparently love, hate or hate. Most people seem to compare it to Japanese grudgeons, but I did not see them though, I believe that it is not right to compare a movie. This picture is standing on its own. <br /> <br /> The story is weak, most people say. I do not agree. The story is simple, and so on purpose is done. Used story-telling techniques - for example broken time frames - are done perfectly. He knows exactly what the director knows, and I believe he wanted his point of view. <br /> <br /> I gave this image 8 out of 10. This is a movie that you enjoy watching or hate. It's as simple as that.
