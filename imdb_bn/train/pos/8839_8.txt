Thank God is not based on this true story, because it is a story. Hateful characters who do not know the limits of public barbarism before, people become misleading, which can be ridiculous (and sometimes, even - or perhaps because of the jumped trip in disaster - the tragic demise of the whole human disaster) By such fantastic, not too strong faith is carried with. Kelly Mason's excellent script and no one other than Sydney Lumeet does not hurt great direction. Here is a family nature of the main disadvantages, two mainly screw-up brothers (Philip Simmur Hoffman and Ethan Hawk from the bright scripts) decided to loot their parents' jewelry store, which has become widespread. <br /> <br /> The story has been told with time-shift (which is mentioned on the screen, such as: "Charlie: Two days before robbery", so nobody should confuse); Some people said that they did not like this device but I think it worked perfectly, adding the skeweredness of the whole thing, the two brothers in question are rarely playing with decks - considering that you have a decent pocket between them to save your life. Throw this chessy to additional tidbits: One of the brothers is a drug addict, married to Gina (Marisa Tomomi, also extraordinary), who has a relationship with another brother, tosses some talented siblings and says that the drug addict hates his father (Albert Finney From a wrench's performance), who apparently has become the cause of past pain and your haw The Shakespeare / Greek Tragedy received. Proceed with caution.
