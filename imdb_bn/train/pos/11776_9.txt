Chuck Jones 'rate conditioner' is a fast, often funny cartoon. Giving a bug against a weird, yellow-spotted apartment store manager, who wants to stuff him, 'rate conditioning' takes full advantage of his multifaceted setting. This is followed by the various sections of the bug and its followers, which leads to an inspired gag, after which any clothes are added to that part of the store, they quickly depart from different departments. This awesome gag, though inconsistent bugs as a lift boy, by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators, cheats the store manager to turn it on or off immediately in the wrong manager. It's a brilliant climatic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a very funny final pushing. However, by that time, 'rate conditioning' bursting with wild energy, made great marks on her as one of the great cheezes film. When the bugs became more sophisticated in some other cartoons of this time, 'conditionally conditioned' shows that he may still be as attractive as the more anarchic character.
