OK. I favor I live near Schrubby, England, where this wonderful film was portrayed. It still looks the same now. I think most of the painters are pictured here, and on the last day fake ice in the street. Often, when I walk through the screwbirds I see a street or a house and it will remind me of this movie. <br /> <br /> George C. The Scots Scroll is more realistic than many other screen versions. . His physical appearance is not usually unfortunate. Scott's big and imposing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The book is one of the most complete works in English. And I do not believe there are many parables that will say that people are not worthy of change and release. This film version portrays that pretty pretty all. George C-Scott may be American, but he plays the part of the anger of the English with excellent skill. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. If you have not seen this version, then I will firmly say what you are doing. It is usually available for very little amount ... or what do you mean?
