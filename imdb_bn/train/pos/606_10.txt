Iberia shows a better solar, deal with the idea of ​​multimedia and more contemporary ideas of dance and music. Another thing that draws my attention is, in this movie, dancers and musicians, dance and music, equally important: The camera shows different aspects of explanations of music, does not test technical issues, but examines the psychological experience of the game. Solar Interest on the Bridge between Classical and Contemporary Music and Dancing; More Than The Elements to Make The Movie Most Beautifully Exciting Among Other Things That is why I love those who love good movies, good music, good dance, great art.
