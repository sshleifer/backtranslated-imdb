What an outstanding movie this is not the word I describe. I do not know the movie rating should be between 7.3 to 9.3, however anybody else can not make this film, and only acting in the Akshay, the second half of the film will cry to you, and the film is a really unexpected ending which makes movies perfect. You will see this movie once, I think twice to make it up to you. Anyway I love this movie and it's not just sad and funny, but it really gives you a good meaning and what you should do. I think this is the best movie in Bollywood. But I know people are so liked to lose. The music I like about this movie is good but background music is good but the songs are not good enough. I think music will be good if ARA Rahman is the music director but whatever we can do nothing. So ya about that
