I understand why some people like this movie and why some people do not. For me, though, I really like it, even if I've noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bit. Animation was really nice, like Charlie's dream. The letters were mixed mixed bags, the voice of the best junior barbie, the Anne-Marie Best. (I was sick when I was physically sick), Corfes is a very believable villain, especially the voice by Vic Tayback (I especially like "Morons surrounded by Mornons") and Rasputin and Warren T. The ratt is probably the most memorable of the Don Blunt villain. Charlie and Ichachi did not have the same spark, but I liked King Gator and his songs. Little film hunting, such as Anabelle's "You Can Never Come Back", which still scares me. Unfortunately, some bits I did not like much. The story had a tendency to be suddenly and stagnant, but Black Claudron of Disney was suffering from the same problem. There were also some dark scenes, the children would be boring, but the end is very tragic. But the biggest mistake was rather silent songs and the way they sang. Apart from the exception of "Let's Music Music Exams" and "Love Survivors", none of them sticks out, and Burt Reynolds can not sing and Dam Dewis has sung a lot of good songs. After all, a visible movie, which may be more, but of course it is memorable, and I certainly want to see it again. 7/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
