Last night I was going to bed with my GF, and when he was brushing his teeth, I broke the channels until I became known as the Max of King. At first I thought it was going to be a Kung Fu movie, so I started to see it, and then it took me immediately and I had to finish it. <br /> <br /> The little girl in the movie was absolutely adorble. She was such a great actor for being so small. Perhaps it was in Chinese, so it was difficult for me to speak English, but she really thought completely in character. I felt so bad for the girl that she was trying to please her "boss", but everything was fine. Hah hah Even when she does not give her another grandson, she can go to her art only ... It shows that the child has been abducted, so she gets arrested and lives for 5 days. LOL ... whatever he has tried to make his grandmother happy, just back. <br /> <br /> Finally, she shows how much love she has and teaches her the art of mask ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
