I have seen a great fan of movie verification and this movie because I have heard how interesting it is. I can honestly say it was really interesting. The two main actors are awesome, the film is never boring and the idea behind it (though evidently the genre of Colombian killings and homicides inspired by the killers) is really interesting. There are some vulnerabilities, such as the final 20 minutes that actually stay away from the reality shown in the first hour or in the end and ultimately they do not understand in any sense. Sometimes shaky cameras can be a distraction, but the movie is verite that is given to one. But I still think the movie is done very well and Director Ben Kokiso deserve some credit.
