This is a strange film for me, because after reviewing a new film maker (Fire Out) by Fire Out, another writer / director Ryan Jafri contacted me and asked me to see his film and heal Asked. . I usually do not review movies like this, but what's the hack - I love shorts and can not wait to see others. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, when it was turned on, I liked the cure, let me recognize the jafri without seeing it. For his achievements, he encouraged me to review anyway - it gives me an honest assessment. <br /> <br /> This movie has a tremendous style and, as far as Jeffery is guided, it is exceptional - especially the creator (especially his first film) for the inexperienced film. The combination of color, pacing, and musical exceptional choices that make the film well suited to the atmosphere is a great idea. A achievement to make that film you are really drawn into the film and However, the thing I did not love was something to write. The basic concept was great, it was very easy till the end. I would really like to end it as a wonderful or an unexpected turn-end. However, this image comes from a person who will not be able to create such a professional movie because of his experience, it is good for his future. Savash.
