The guys and dolls will ever be my favorite musical movie. It is very fun movie and nothing more to see. It is not to preach to people what is forgotten about musical instruments, but not for promotion. Nowadays we are renting and failing to bring our strong entertainment in Chicago which is a great musical and good movie but they do not connect any strings. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was Marlon Brando, the guy could not sing! I did not understand him when listening to sing and talk was very annoying. If it did not get hit then I could have given these 10 stars. Boys and dolls provide old fashioned entertainment that we rarely get this day. Have a good time to see it !!
