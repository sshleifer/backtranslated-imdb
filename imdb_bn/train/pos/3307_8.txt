Let's start by saying that the English title "The Power of the Province of Kongigan" is a complete misconception. This is not the actual shot of war, problems and conflicts in the Hong Kong Sun Sue film. So the idea of ​​establishing its power is not suitable for a province and it is not valid in the context of this movie. If we want to judge this movie by its Korean language title, "Kangwon-Do Eui Hugh" will appear as a mysterious statement about the mental instability of his young heroes. The mind is not resting. Hong São Soo has given a very effective visual document about the people's unreasonable choices in their lives. The questions are a few young girls who have their mood, curiosity and ideas. If a movie can be made as a meritorious quality of the filmmaker, then she will be honored as a brave filmmaker in Hong Kong, whose film talk about human relationships, feelings and a universal lack of life. Which one does not like it or not, this is the only fair conclusion that will be encouraged from this particular movie.
