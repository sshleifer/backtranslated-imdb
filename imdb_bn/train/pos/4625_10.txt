The times behind Shakespeare's bar were the most wonderful and delightful films I've seen all year. It's in prison, somewhere in California, if I remember correctly, where the prison has been recessed for the past 14 years and a different game of Shakespeare has been performed every year. The film follows the production of "The Tempest" from the production and in this process we can learn the most beautiful things about these men, for the most serious offenses. The fact is unfamiliar with the real story - if someone tries to adapt the story to fiction movies, the audience will not buy it, but it is real that makes it exciting to watch - literally; I gasped louder when I learned about the talented felony's crime in particular. It's like some lupe episodes of oz and more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.
