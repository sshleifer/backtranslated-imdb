<br /> <br /> An elderly person works as a janitor in a psychiatric hospital near his wife and tries to find him there. <br /> <br /> It must have forgotten most of the silent era and the curiosity of Japanese film history. If a long thought is lost, a print is available in the 70's, and the music soundtrack is added, which fits perfectly with the pictures. This may have influenced Dr. Calgary's cabinet (director Keanagas claims he never saw a German film). But in this style and it strongly portrays (and Chile) sanctuary the internal mental state. To achieve this, the movie uses the technology of each single movie available at that time: multiple exposure and focus outside of focus, perspective camera angle, fast and slow motion, publisher lighting and supercomposement among others. This is a very complicated movie, since it does not have any titles. <br /> <br /> The image is opened by a window of the hospital's windows, wind-blown air and thunderstorm with a montage of rainy shots. Uncomfortable weather converts mental patients to patients and represents one of them: a former dancer. The combination of words, rain, wind and thunder generated by the thunder acts as a music that encourages dancers to be cruel, almost hypnotic. In another continuation, the same patient is seen in other passionate dances as well as being seen by other detainees. The dancer represents "the view" of multiple exposure patients and confused them in the world. <br /> <br /> These two examples are trying to represent patient's subconscious and representative representation from this amazing film. "Sane" in the world. <br /> <br /> Three words must be seen in a course.
