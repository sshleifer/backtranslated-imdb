A charming, funny film that gets around a solid grade around. I recently saw a screener of this film working. I was very happy to see this picture that I see every tragic horror movies So, I think I want to write. Although I'm not sure if this film is going to the theater, I hope it will be. It's a nice movie to watch with friends, it's a charming, and some funny jokes. The performance was great (especially Howard Hessman and Larry Dorf) The direction was very good (no film that needed to be directed to the extraordinary). I think of how this film was actually created, it was Neil Simon, SafeFilish and the satire of the characters. Smart and it's a beautiful rhythm. As an ambitious screenwriter, I noticed them Let (i Dark). However, I really do not recommend such a beautiful picture.
