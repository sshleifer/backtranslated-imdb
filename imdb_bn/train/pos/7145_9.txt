This film is a cast of young actors as well as a great pair of adult actors who have long been in film for a trial. The guidance and editing was great. I can find the book that it was adapted from, it can certainly be great. (I liked it.) Sigarie Weaver, John Voight, and Team Blake Nelson to see an explosion! Henry Winkler and Nathan Davies were not seen enough, but they were fun when they were on screen. The camp may not have been good for the kids. (As I said, I liked it!)
