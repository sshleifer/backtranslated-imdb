This is a brief, angry animated series of David Lynch (as mentioned at the beginning), and it is a wife who follows a bad disorder of a bad disorder and a back-up with a disorderly son, an accidental son. These two components are repeatedly repeated in brief episodes, and there is no real plot. If this is easily unclear, with little MacBar Looney Tunes, with more importance, dishonesty, bloody violence, and hybridity, it is easy to find. <br /> <br /> I bought DVDs with Undeuded, before seeing Eraserhead. If you want an artistic masterpiece do not look at this series - it's nothing else. In fact, it often appears to be a statement against such things, because its rough style can be confronted with any kind of animation conventions. Lynch said, "If it's funny, it's just funny because we see its illusions."
