Tony Argentine, Sicilian Hit-Man or Professional Killer, decides to leave the business and his former employers do not agree. In terms of content, this highly enjoyable action movie does not have one; In terms of uninterrupted pleasure, is it fun ?? It is very mild, violent, quite brutal, car-driving is notable. "Arjenta" is a neutral, yet very favorite movie? Better than the current Hollywood trash that gets the same label. It came from the little floating of the 70s of Italian B movies instead of Delan. It carefully uses the personality of Delan's tough guy, which is one of the bad-sleek and coolest galleries created during his youth. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed it so much that Dellon has created this image, he played a very good urosmic flicker. <br /> <br /> Score with a good introduction song is very good. Glasso thinks of the Italian film as a synthetic work, where there is an important part of the musical instrument. <br /> <br /> The very interesting Irica Blank (31 years in '73) appeared as an unnamed hooker on Tony Argentine / big gun / no way. Meanwhile, Argentine's girlfriend, Sandra, is starring in Carla Gavina (a star that left movies after '75). <br /> <br /> <br /> "Arzenta" is pictured interestingly ?? An aspiring visual concept, some evolutionary shiny corners. The director of the film was directed by Duccio Ticci, who created Zoro (The Delaney Comedy). Note that these two films, Tony Arzenta (1973) and Zoro, are very unlucky. The first is a bloody composer's violent action movie - the second is a light comedy comedy, though it was made extraordinary and organized in a disciplined manner. Dosios Tesari kissed a movie like Kiss ... Bang Bang (1966), Shawn of Shaitan, The Bloodsteen Butterfly, Â¡Vivo la Murat ... Tuya! , Touf Guy (1974), Safari Express (1976), etc.
