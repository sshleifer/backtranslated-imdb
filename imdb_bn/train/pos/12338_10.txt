Joan Fontenay starred as Villen in this Victorian era film. She has kept a firmly married woman and draws her attention to the rich man, Michael Rushworth, who has played by Herbert Marshall. Mr. Marshal Miles is quite good as well. Miss Fountain took part in his perfect - at the same time intelligent, counting, innocent, fearful and charming. It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull off. Joan Fontenay looks fantastic on dresses made by Treviso Benton. Also in the movie Juan's mother, Lilian Fountain as Lady Flora. I highly recommend this film.
