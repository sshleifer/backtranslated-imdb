I do not think many films (especially comedy) have added memorable, quoted dialogs like MOONSTRUCK. I will not explain this - you will see an extraordinary long list of quotations on this thread - but it is amazing to me that any film that can create things like a copper pipes for plumbing purposes in a memorable dialogue can make things like using expensive copper pipes. It's not the only line that pops up and makes an impression on our memory. How does a restaurant waiter forgive me about planned wedding because it means an old bachelor's client's loss? Or is a beautiful, adult dog fancier encouraging his pack he moon? Or the promise of a youth of Perry (John Mahoney), the commitment of a female student to "moon light in martini" (my favorite line). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are other examples (OX-BOW INCIDENT drama is another example, but a misery). Chair, Olympia Dukakis, Vincent Gardania, Nicholas Cage, John Mahoney, and Danny Isle are all involved in plot and cross purposes which can test and manage the nature of love. Is it good thing to love? The chaire and the cage seem to last, but Dukki knows that the real love drives the individual crazy (and Kez gets trembled to realize it, when O'Connell argues outside the house after returning from La La. Boheme). Betrayal by men is a way to avoid thinking of death. Dukakis believe so, and (odd enough - although he is not completely convinced) Aiello. The chances of violence show - Dunky people quickly understand that Guardiania's strange behavior is related to unfaithfulness, and literally means Guardania and her girlfriend in opera (but Guardiania Chara's ILO pushes the same unfaithfulness). But the opportunity also becomes a misunderstanding: Phadro's Chilipin stumbled over Dunkys and said that John Mahnie was walking along and he seems to have a problem. <br /> <br /> There are so many beautiful moments in the film. One of the cherry observations about leading flowers is taking. He is listening to his hobby shop and its resolution. But the uncle and uncle Raymond and Rita Kapopaggi of Louis Gass and Julie Bovos, and Rita are best as Raymond's impressive and kind comments in the light of his moon. This is the sweetest moment of the whole film. <br /> <br /> It's near a flawless film. After seeing it over a dozen times for many years, I can find only two points that they do not seem to be. When Chay is in Unemployed in Cage, his assistant Christie (Nada Dzototovich) mentions that he secretly fell in love with Keiji, but was afraid to tell him. Before that he had a little sniper on the terrace, who quickly put him in his place. Yet think of nothing with this potential challenge. At the same time, Chair forgot about submitting the daily business profit of his uncle and aunt, was immediately brought within the last seven minutes of the film - but quickly went away. Apart from Chir and Vincent Guardiania, a plot line was abandoned, besides working in the shelter of a homeless man? It's a little annoying, but I think it's only made to see more of this movie because it's great.
