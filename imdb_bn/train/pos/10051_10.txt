Family problems are huge in real life and this is what the movie is about. Combine the love together with judges and trials and what is this movie. A man, dad, has the maturity and consistency of family maturity, facing the hazard. Whether the children are growing up or not, absolutely understand that regardless of the age of the child or the parents, the parents still love their children and they want to provide a cushion during their fall. All the actors portraying their characters have outstanding performances. Yes, I had a similar experience both as a young adult and later as a parent, with a way of learning to throw a tear hole. This is the truth of life that every young adult, and parents, will be good to see, even though no one can understand it until they are parents. One will look for those who care for their families.
