What a moving film My favorite friend who is in her sixties and for the past 15 years I have been told that people do not see her again, and she waits for music. In the late 40's, I started to see what he had been complaining about. You are no longer young, beautiful or sensitive. When May say ... "The stick of the body ..." Wow. How our body changes and how it is said that it is no longer beautiful. When I love him he loves me ... colorful scarf ... and painful wife <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a tragic and surprising picture. Sadly, betraying the faith of her daughter ... is beautiful that she finds herself in trouble with difficulty, and chooses to run and eventually gives her own life. <br /> <br /> I love this picture for most of the time because it is ultimately a picture that shows the complex nature of relationships, whether they are family or not. We see the weakness of the village, but he will get everything he wants ... (when he tells his mother that Darren should have his child, whether his mother wants him or Diaryan does not ask why his son also wants). Identifies how the film can change relationships and reveals what has happened so far. May has stifled his own creativity to raise a family in May. A family that he really did not want, but "when you did something young". When Daren called him an old shaft, I love the scene, and he laughs and says, "I have never called it before". It was really a gem of a movie <br /> <br /> and Daniel Craig Well, I just love her. I was pleasantly surprised. She is not just pleasing on the eyes, she is a real talent. What a handsome role. She is much more confident than 2007 and I look forward to her to play more role in this nature. The scene where he is enjoying the match and the look that he sees in his appearance is wonderful, that this woman has such control over her and it is also a view of the joy of being able to give it to her. She is actually enjoying giving her pleasure. A wonderful view. Love scene with Bruce Bruce. Bruce is completely absorbed with his own pleasure ... two completely different men. <br /> <br /> Hey ... I wonder where my Darren is?
