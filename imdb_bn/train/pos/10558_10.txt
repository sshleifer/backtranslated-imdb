<br /> <br /> Charlie Kaufman has made the weird spiritual fingers popular, but this Canadian jewel makes funny. Like most curious films, the plot is more pronounced about the plot but let's set the scene, since childhood two friends Anthony and Dave are together, they can not deal with the world, and this does not mean that they are no more. . But more problems started from here. <br /> <br /> I like this picture, it lets me laugh a lot after the final achievement, and they do not make "nothing" by breaking into many maths. <br /> <br /> <br />
