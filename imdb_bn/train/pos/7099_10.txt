Terry Gilliam's remarkable, disconnected story destroys a few people in the world and forces them to be transmitted to the underground, and this is a pretty, disrupted and highly romantic movie that tells Bruce to send time to people to gather information about it. Willis's greatest performance of all time. <br /> <br /> What is the setting of 12 monkeys in most of the time-travel science-film is that the character of Bruce Willis is actually related to the time-travel psychological effects, which do not know what the real reality is: The time-traveler comes from the place Or goes. Also, the film acknowledges that past issues can not be changed and in this case, in case of prevention of a catastrophic event, in this case the virus can not be stopped or changed. Willis says, "It has already happened", when he is in a psychiatric hospital, the film enters a huge contradiction that is not a thirty, extra plot for the preservation of the world; Instead, it can only survive Willis's internal struggle. It's a fresh, innovative idea, and it's a nice thank you for a unique written script of dementia's unique brand of People and Gyilium. In addition to <br /> <br />, the story of the 12 monkeys is completely non-linear and instead distorted and indicates how to efficiently combine the sequence with a scary of different times: flashbacks, dreams, memories, present, past, future and such a The scene which took place from Hitcoo's Vertigo was lifted. Serve all the visitors serve in the annoying cacophony of insane and madness. Apparently, Gilliam is a master of obstacles and shadow obstructing team Burton in his terrific disappointing scenes and imagery. With cold, ample, and submerged painters, Gilliam plunges into the colorless surroundings of her character and the dark. The scenes are often dubbed in strange antiseptic, dead Sadda, and often help in contrasting against wild-on-crazy characters. According to the performance, Brad Pitt mostly stole most of the scenes and filled them. Patent loony, off-the-wall performance that garnered an Oscar nomination gains. As mentioned, Bruce Willis gave his career best performance, did not return to his heroic clich√© and cardboard hero, and instead portrayed Cole as a simple, mad, sad person. Madison Sto is equally good as a Willis psychologist. He puts himself in his hand, with the energy and energy of his character, in addition to the injection of what he believes, due to the weight loss, it is a false religion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Its rich, well-thought-out, complex story, and comical cinematography with the whole cast, with the spectacular performance, makes it an excellent parody of insane. All the time in my top ten ranking, the spectacular shiny scenes of a great surprise of 12 monkeys. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10
