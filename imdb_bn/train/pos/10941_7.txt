Thinking about Sir Silverman's own ceremony first started worrying me. The movie he had played was not very funny and his humor is a bit off. However, I was very surprised to see this comedy Central wax brighten its true colors. I could probably keep Amy Seed's choice among strangers with cancer - the character of Sarah is the true psyche, comparable to the Zeric block of the semester. <br /> <br /> The fall of this show is that his co-stars His sister's character is good; Funny at times, but eventually did not mean stealing Sarah's show. However, very sub-par compared to the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> I am glad that the comedy Central gives Sarah the opportunity to show her unique and crazy soul and humor.
