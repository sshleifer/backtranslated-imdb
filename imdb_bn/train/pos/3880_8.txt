Well, for beginners, it was actually the most elegant choreon movie of this date. <br /> <br /> People have always had a sense of character with humor, but I think in this movie he added that he had created a dimension unrallel before. His work - very black n 'in white words - has been accepted by broad but critical viewers, and we always appreciate the power of mixing humor with its ideas and human problems and the individual way of farewell to the audience. Asked what he is saying <br /> <br /> "Villa Parnoyia, for the first time, was surprised by an invisible knowledge and respect for minorities, not only ethnic but also ordinary people. Lack of love brings lasting problems, but it shows you the intimate and sometimes brutal and focuses on you. Laute manages ****** D! Really ***** D, who wants the right thing but there is no way about how to get there, and therefore people suffer. <br /> <br /> I will say This is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and I'm looking forward to it.
