In the foreign movie section of my local video store, "Shower" occurs and it seems to be often or comedy from its cover. Then I purchased a copy at lucky price and was happy for my fate. "Shower" story of three (3) men, a father and two (2) adult boys, each one is coming to terms of life changing because the world around them is changing in modern China. Like many "foreign" films, Chinese culture itself is one of the most interesting aspects of this movie. <br /> <br /> The setting of this story is not limited to the characteristics of local, Chinese paintings, it is difficult to relate to the story of the male and the only woman associated with the story, even though it is standing against the village baths. <br /> <br /> The family story has gone away from understanding and made me happy, I know these people The main stories are added to many small characters, bathhouse customers, and their individual conflict and friendship. "Shower" goes away from a movie smile and touches its warmth and humanity.
