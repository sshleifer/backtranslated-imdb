Scott Henderson (Alan Curtis) met a mysterious woman (Fe Helm) at a bar and invited him to see a show with him. He agreed on condition that they voluntarily take any information about each other - not even names. Sometimes this is the best kind of date. However, when he returns to his apartment, Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) and his team are waiting for him. Scott's wife was murdered. Her lewd mysterious woman, but no one remembers seeing her, and as a result Scott was executed for the murder of his wife. His secretary Kansas (Ela Reynass) is not sure of his crime and finds him out to find out that he can protect him from the death penalty. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie and the audience tries to get 100% behind the truth in Kansas. We follow him through some memorable scenes, for example, Cliffordic venue on the night of Mac Burterender (Andrew Tombasse) and Clostropophobic Venue, where Clif Drummer (Alice Cook Jr.) jammed with friends, jammed, drank and danced. . A vague illustration of this sexual orientation is that it is a stand-out part of the film because the frequency of the scene often happens to sleep frequently with everyone. Ela Reyns is a good role in women's leadership and Thomas Gomez makes a likable police member. Alan Curtis began to get confused, innocent people as well, but once arrested, his performance took a left turn because he was completely unpleasant in Kansas for some reason. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In fact, it adds to the tension and dramatic development of the story, because we discover what is happening to the cancer and then to find out the hell! This is a good movie with some great scenes, but Elisa Cook Zoo has a memorable role, I do not like to see him anyway ... Someone tie me around the neck ...
