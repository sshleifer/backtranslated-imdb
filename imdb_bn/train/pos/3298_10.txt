This is definitely one of my best movies - it has everything - a truly sensitive screenplay, fine actors that are beautiful art to look at a beautiful art, really silver romances (it's embarrassing that those romances do not seem to exist anymore), beautiful songs and songs (Especially the final song), an artistic score, and the dress and set which you want to stay among them. The ending was simply a cause of disappointment that I was expecting a glorious movie to finish brighter - but it was still more surprising that there were a large number of movies. Definitely check this movie - again over again. There are many details that you miss for the first time that deserve a second look.
