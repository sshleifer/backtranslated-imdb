I just saw this movie and would say, I was very impressed. It is very dangerous and many moments that will force you to get out of the seat! To calm my nerves, I had to wash a lot of "emergency" cigarettes! If I had to criticize myself, I would have probably said if there is anything, but it takes a lot of time. It has reached a point where each individual scene was finalized by jumping and it gradually had a surprising effect, because of what kind of new you are coming. <br /> <br /> Although it's the ghost of every ghost, they all worked so well that it maintained a strange, fear-factor. It was the ingredient of The Shining, 6th Borrowing and Chanling (Specifically, Soundtrack reminds me of Chanling). <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone to threaten the old fashioned fashion!
