Hi <br /> <br /> My name is Jessica, I'm Italian! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw this picture a few days ago: 'For the first time', Corin is with Korky Niemake. This was the story of Michael and Mary Margaret. I want to know the title of the most important love scenes in Michael's bedroom. <br /> <br /> This film has not been programmed in Italy for many years and I do not know how to find the song. . Who can help me so much thanks! I love this picture! Very romantic! Soundtrack beautiful! I love Cheryl Pollock! Jessica
