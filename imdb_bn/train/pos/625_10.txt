This afternoon we took the kids to movies and saw the blue guyan ladder and what I can say is that wow <br /> <br /> It is very rare that I am completely amazed at anything, but it is probably the greatest imaginable film I have ever seen, even the best movies and all of them are blue guayans. <br /> <br /> Sure, I can be sucked by a nice smart dialog, easy flowing, and made characters perfectly trustworthy. <br /> <br /> I could go on for a long time in the spectacular acting, Charlie Coaks is perfect as Tristan, Bright like Claire Dennis Yevine, and Robert De Niro steals the film deeply about Closet Pirates Captain Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The pure joy has made the sunny, which leads us to funny funny, the first Shake is quite intelligent and perfectly mixed with the look of the 80's. The rest of the movie will be made in this great movie. <br /> <br /> Special effect was near perfect, it was not a LOTR or Star Wars SF ExtraVaganza, but when it was used, it was said that it is not too much to confuse you with the film and the story is completely Mixed. <br /> <br /> Then what are the stories there? What can i say Do you often come across a story that contains elements of classic fairy formula that do not come off as another cheap princess bride knockoff It is known and cozy and still operates at the same time to be completely new and refreshed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Again Blue Gayman did it, he hijacked another in my heart, creating a fantasy world that is so beautiful and wonderful that I can do almost anything to live it and only give a brief look at it. I did not want to end it, I wanted to be sucked through a reproach of the Stormhold land and traveled to his field and valley, traveled both in the market and both of its inhabitants wanted to meet both dangerous, personally wanted to meet Tristan and Yvaine. Friendly and stay forever Whenever I read some of Gayman, Sandman, American Gaudes, Correlin, I thought that when I finished reading them, I left me with deep sorrow, I could not see anything else. The world that he had created seemed to be more vibrant and vibrant, than I was forced to live and could not see Stardust. Finally, I'm sure blue is written and this film will not have the same effect on everyone, but when I say that you will not be sorry to spend time or money to watch this movie, then I saw five top movies It can be easily found and I'm sure that anyone will love it at least one soul.
