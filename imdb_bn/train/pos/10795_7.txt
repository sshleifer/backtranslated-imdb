Overall, the movie was fairly good, the plot of a good step with the explosion and battle scenes, but Chuck Norris did nothing without shooting the bomb and blowing several letters. This image was very similar on September 11th, a terrorist like a bin Laden sent a video to the President (urich) and threatened to blast it. Jadson Mills had some fantastic action roles, Rashid's compound and took the role of different kick-butt, but Chack Norris was lacking. Jeussan did a number of things in his work, keeping JAUU (Chuck) with his quay on his computer. But, overall, it was realistic and there was no lack of action, but Mr. This happened in the part of Norris. I gave the film 7/10.
