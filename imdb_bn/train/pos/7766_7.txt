Dorothy Malone has played her sweet sister / wife during the writing of Dothothy Malone, and at the time of her writing, she has demonstrated the ability of playing the match with the best of them. He and Gloria played the same type of tram - and here, in a very impressive role for her efforts, Mallon has won the best supporting actress Oscar. <br /> <br /> The picture that she has is not like the standard of the Oscars, but it is a strong enough melodrama under the able hand of Douglas Cork. The explosive opening scene has almost a dirty look and it sets the voice for one of the saudsire firewalls, written by Rock Hudson, Loren Baakal, Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone. <br /> <br /> Domestic squabbles among the residents of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama, with powerful supporting players, accentuation on the stack and Malone. Seizing the opportunity for both hand and stack in both hands, for his hard work, he should be frustrated by the weak, alcoholic brother's own wild purpose. <br /> <br /> Impressive work to make the nominal stars are less, but to do it with their usual skills and consistency - Hodson and Bacall. They play their sympathetic role with calm authority and understanding. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
