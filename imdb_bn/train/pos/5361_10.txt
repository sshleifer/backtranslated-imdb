If you are brought up on a cereal of gameshours, then you need to understand that you need a bigger and better fix. Well, your needs will be set in the running world. These game shows, the competition for the freedom of the prisoners, and the final award - their lives. <br /> <br /> I like this picture. This is a parody that we observe the mind-narrow triangle on a daily basis. This is not one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but it's a very good movie. The underlying concept that television corporations can be the "real" ruler of a day's planet is very trustworthy, and is very well-depicted in this film. Of course, Arnie has a one-liner, when my favorite game is caught in the gamezone, the game host will ask "what's the last word?" Arnie says: "Yes, I'll come back" but the host quips "just run a replay" and press the Eject button. I give this image a 10 for the perfect originality. I have seen 30 or more times. The only picture in addition to the die hard series which I have seen often !! <br /> <br /> Do not think that you own yourself for a minute. - It's owned by you .....
