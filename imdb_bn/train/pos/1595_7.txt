Although I used to say I enjoyed the show, when I first saw 'I like what I hope' I'm completely different, 'that's it' (I'm not sure if it's going to find anything about it)) But I have to say That's what I like the show and when I do not classify it as a breakthrough show, it's very charming and I like chemistry between characters as well as letters (assistant cast). ) <br /> <i definitely want to say that I'm happy to come back to the screen, Wesley Jonathan, because I really love the City geite. I also saw a woman who used to play Valerie's friends in popularity, and when I think it was right, I really do not like her character in this show because she is not just a cup of my cup but she is walking quite well.
