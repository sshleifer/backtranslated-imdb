I always think weird and guilty (because I'm a fairly well-educated teen-teen), but I've actually dressed like Wolseyn couples, and I respect the films I made, though I've never been to them. Scheduled listener "Rome in Rome" was a traditional Mary-Kate and Ashley film, full of foreign travel, pronunciation, motorbike, adult romance as "B" storyline, fashion adaptation and even a gill reel on credit. I enjoyed myself. "When Rome" and other Welsen Twin movies do not pretend to be something they do not; Most of the time, they are only premiered on the video and they do not claim to be "a citizen," or even "a matter of memorization". My point is, those who look at this movie and expect anything other than any other Welsen Twin movie, they will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> He said, those who are fans of the Olson duo will really enjoy it. For those of us who saw them after the first phase of the "flower house", it's really cool to see them play a more mature role. Does this film provide important historical and geographical information like most of their films (remember to "see London win" from 10 Downing Street and "Passport to Paris"?) As well as enjoying good, clean fun with the whole family Will be. <br /> <br /> While I still think I'm in my subbox, and as long as I can make it relevant to the movie, I have been rejecting Olsen Twin for a long time to challenge those moments: to be a fan of Olson Twins You do not have to be some pre-teen "valley girl" from California. In fact, that's not really the target audience. If it was, MK of clothing and accessories would be run by the Fashion Line Gap or in some stores like Wall Store. "When in Rome," when it shows "High fashion" and Globe Trotting and two girls in a valley in Cali, it's not really about ... It inspires young people who can take the initiative to accept it. This means that with the intelligent son in the motorbikes, the movie is set in some fascinating foreign cities, so be it. It says marketing - you take an idea and sell it up by appealing to it. At least they seem a little messy even if they are sending a good message. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < This movie, I think, just like their others. Kids - Enjoy. Dad - do the same. If you like Olsen Twin, you will not be disappointed.
