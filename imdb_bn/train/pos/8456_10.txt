I have seen almost all the bully / food anime which has been shown in the US and has so many good stories so far. His plot twists and twists the way you have been riveted. Gangadam Wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. This series follows a group of five year old 15-year-old boys, who receive pilot training in mobile mobile cases known as gangster. Gundam pilot was trained in a strong rebel wars known as Oz. With the increase in temperature between Oz and Gundam pilots, new political parties will form and old people will be deposed. The old conflict will end and the new emergence will occur. To achieve peace, the pilgrims must be involved in the events held in their world and must end all the war. However, people are willing to go far to achieve their goals. Anyone who is looking for a show I have a deep plot suggests this anime.
