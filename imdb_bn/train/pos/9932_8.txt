If you hope to go to this movie, you will be disappointed with any movie. This image has been described as Hemingway's "Ice Effect". Sponsored, only one cache of random movie clips is combined to create a movie. If it will be written in a book, it will be a short story, because the action of the film is packed very quickly and if you do not actually try to capture it, then the logic behind the plot (with some fine vision) is well passed by you. Definitely a movie you will see twice to fully appreciate. Experimental cinematography barely describes this movie. Camera work and post production add much more to the overall taste of the movie, it is artistic in some points and is open to others (as late as anything in American movies). Although, in some parts it may be slightly messy, awful and heavy to some viewers, but the film will not be completely unrealistic. The only part of the movie that I write as "improvement of need", soundtrack selection A movie is sometimes better without a suitable soundtrack, and although the soundtrack is fairly appropriate, the opening time is too long, and other rap songs of the movie are more suitable (heavy, granaki rock or psychedelic), this photo has made a real trip). Imagery and dynamic flooding ... color palettes add another "artistic" perspective to it, which combines events happening throughout the film, it's not a movie that you can miss any part and still understand. However, that makes it much more to see a favorite movie, and you will not get the skin faster. 8.5 / 10
