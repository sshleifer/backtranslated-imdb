Fight Club, Matrix, AI, Six Senses, Comparative This way never before done in a way mental approaches. In the first 30 minutes Diaz-Cruz-Cruz created an interesting love story. The rest of the movie is good, confusing, you'll pick more each time you watch it (I've gone to the movies to watch it now 3 times)
