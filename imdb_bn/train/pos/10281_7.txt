Here is my first film directed by David Mamate. Fitting, since it was its first, as well. The story is disrespectful here and it goes away from a small consonant to Big Cons to all the marginal corners, like a movie movie. It's like "the graffters", but without the level of the film's acting. (In this film John Cusack was like a vowel, but the nature of his character was.) The acting here is very flat. (I've sometimes been surprised that the Blend played by Cruise speaks of an attack on psycholysis). At least in the beginning. It does not get really good, but it grows after ten minutes after painfully reading hard lines. At the beginning of the movie, some of the lines of Lindsay Crus - how they read it - the words that they are internal or description, which they are not. Coming up with Montague's arrival <br /> <br /> The dialogue here should not be fun. I was hoping to close the tongue with the crusgack ring-no-ding-ding lines, but these are not. It sounds very read, than all the conversations. Maybe Mumt has developed after this film, but if not, then maybe he should let others know his words. He is very valuable with them here and, consequently, they lose their lathic, jazzy quality. More than that, the movie is not like a play or it does not seem like it. The camera is very cinema. My only problem with "Glengeri Glen Ross" was that it looked much like the Philadelphia theater, but the actors were not just done in that movie, but it was easy and free. Everything flows. <br /> <br /> I do not think if the characters of the movie can play characters like movie lines or even play lines - but here it sounds like characters in the movie (or even books). This is a strange quarrel in theater and film that just does not work. This does not mean that the movie is bad - it's not, it's often very entertaining. The best part is in the middle. <br /> <br /> This standard con movie stuff: The new guy (in this case, the girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crown) is related to the Seedy Coon Underworld. How he is involved: He is a psychologist and one of his patients, delivering a compulsory gambling. She wants to help him through gambling loans, so she comes to the House of Games, where Danny is the new room where Con Man works in the back room. I'll accept the setup quite impossible. (Did they just expect to come back? Did they expect that he would write a check? Was it the delivery? One of these questions was finally answered. <br /> <br /> and from here the consoles roll out I got an initial introduction - a little more than a student - to be the funest. We got a lesson as much as a con com con art. <br /> We saw the last coming, and then we were coming to the second end. I did not eat, and then saw the actual ending I did not see, but you probably did. The ball goes backwards and through the last scene of the film we realize that the second Crown went to the House of Games, he got real calling. <br /> <br I'm going to have to apologize, because there are so many good things to open, impossible bits and strange lines. If the first part of the movie seems scary Bay stuck with it. After the half-hour mark, it is a really dynamic. If you want a fun Kong movie, then he is here. If you want mameta, and "Glengarry Glen Ross" Go watch - James Foley, he has done well. <br /> <br /> ***
