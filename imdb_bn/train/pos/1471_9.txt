"The film is the ultimate deformed industry, it does not give you what you want, it tells you how to do it." <br /> <br /> So, "The Pavver's Guide to Cinema" begins, in which Slovenian philosopher and psychologist Slavaz Jijek applies his Freudian / Lacanian brain-skepel to the world cinema. This film is the second feature documentary directed by Sophie Fiennes (yes, Ralph and Joseph's sister) in three parts, and this is a remarkable achievement, a person watches for 2 1/2 hours and still funny and engaging everywhere. In terms of, it is an extended film lecture, and the best one you can ever get. Throughout the film courses, GJK directed through a catalog of passion and desire in our film history. He toured over 40 films and especially spent a lot of time with Hitcock, Lynch, Chaplin, Tarkovsky, Marx Brothers and Eisenstein. But he also took a look at "Persona," "Conversation," "Three Colors: Blue," "Dogville," "Fight Club," and "The Exorcist". Theoretically, GJK's investigation in the movie speculates on "the combination of will" in the death drive and democracy to "partial substance". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " However, if you do not fall into the theory of psychology, then the dynamic and ridiculous personality of Zizak carries this film with the importance that you can not travel in a special language. The film often cuts through the clips of Zizek * in the movie, which talks about it - that is, the original position and the set. The transit of these sequences holds the excitement and humor that it is never old. And Jijek himself laughs constantly, from a little wand or from his passionate wing, for example, "birds" is a brave Odepole explanation. And in both Phenice and GJK, it's going forward for the genre of the film and the humorous attitude. This is a sugar spoon which helps us digest the strange pigment of GJK. After all, do not we all understand that before certain points, psychologist theorists are just pulling our legs?
