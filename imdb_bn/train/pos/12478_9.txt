What a Lovely Heart warmth television movie The story says to a five-year-old girl who lost her father and it seems impossible to deal with it. His mother is very sad. Only a miracle could reduce their discomfort. Which viewers will expect. Samant Mathis is as bright as the mother of the little girl, because she was the granddaughter of "Jack and Sarah", if you love both the converging mathis and the happy, it is valuable. Blurred movie for years! Ellen Burstyn, for example, is always a delightful grandmother in this flexible and great acting movie. Jodel Ferland (slightly five year old) is the charming and most convincing young actress. This movie is based on the real story. This "clay" shows respect for human affection, which is clearly illustrated and clearly around us in this difficult world. "The mermaid" gives us all the hope, the love of many people is realized by realizing the love of many people. James Robson Glasgow Scotland UK
