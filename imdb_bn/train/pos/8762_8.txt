"What do you want to do?" A question that will prevent your mind from seeing the mental Brokedown palace weekend. It is also a surprise to see whether Alice (Danes) is telling the truth - a problem that can not be solved and exactly the same. It is a particularly well-played and beautiful shot film.

The ending will make you imagine yourself in the shoes of the lead character, which is brilliantly played by Kate Beckinsell and Claire Dances. Bill Pullman's performance is commendable, too.
