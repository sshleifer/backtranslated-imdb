This image makes a strong comment about the Italian people. The use of mirrors to enhance the letters of the letters is beautiful and I can not mention the beauty and majesty of Sofia Lorraine and Mauryanian. I love them both. Their way of interaction is so beautiful and natural that you can question whether the camera is actually there. The husband who played a minor role is also portrayed as a fascist Italian who has instructed his wife and children, but on his own way, a loving father. Piazza with the Italian scene with Hitler on Venia is incredible and really holds the film historically. I like this picture and I agree that it's not funny, it's not the most famous.
