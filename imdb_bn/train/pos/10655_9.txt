It seems like a perfect day for swimming. A normal family wants to benefit from it and takes a trip to the beach. Unfortunately, the father is trapped in ache and his wife or younger son can not help him - the tide is growing. The woman (Barbara Stanwick) took the car and searched for help. <br /> <br /> The short film on Sturgeon (69 minutes) is strong because of inappropriate questions. Stanwick has found a man who can help, but to pay for it. The movie has a double question. How far do you go to help the person you love and on the other side - see the behavior of Stanwalk's strangers - does he really love her husband? Like a good story, the movie leaves itself to the audience with questions, she can answer herself.
