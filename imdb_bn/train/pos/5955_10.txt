As the creator of "This Dark", I acknowledge that we have ignored three very important confessions in our last credits. Errors were more than places that could not be corrected after the commitments, the parties were not involved in it - who saw this movie --- mentioned it at that time. From the film's nice cast and crew, I'm asking for forgiveness. Obviously, some of the criticisms posted here are accidentally rigorous in the light of their achievements. Our production values ​​were insignificant and our "special effects" were actually quite special, but the plot was very strong and John McLeod's cinematography was fantastic. We hope you enjoy the reader, "this dark" and the efforts of those who work their butt free. Thanks, Dylan O'Leary, Director.
