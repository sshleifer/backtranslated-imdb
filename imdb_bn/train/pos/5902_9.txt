As a Western citizen, seeing the culture of other cultures and the traditions of marriage, I found myself married and delighted. The idea of ​​marrying strangers with parents through mutual arrangements is difficult, especially in this modern age. Yet this incident in this Hindi film. From humor, and from a new perspective, we learn Abhay and Ritika, who once met and now have their traditional five days in honeymoon. As it has been said, it is difficult to believe in the rich age of this cellphone that the oldest custom made customs will still take place. We see that these young couples are trying to get together on their first night and we have seen how they are trying to build ties even if they are not familiar with each other. Other couples see different aspects of marriage and commitment on holidays on holiday, some 40 years after marriage, some are still uncertain about the promise to get married. There are songs, malicious dialogue, mad moments, blend and compare new ways and traditions. The film with subtitles must lose some of the authenticity of the story, but it's still a delight to see. Some of the plot has been reprimanded and some of the events of the bus are drawn and arising; But the overall movie was worth watching.
