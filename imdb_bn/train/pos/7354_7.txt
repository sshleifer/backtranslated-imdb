I first saw this movie on British TV 25 years ago, and it was again stuck in a DVD copy purchased by eBay last week. I had to remember the musical sequence, color and gorgeous fashion plate dress and clothes but brought before spring in Plant Park Lane Angele / Michael Wilding is weaker than film and does not stand up so well in the passage during the year. But Michael Wilding is a fun, charming, funny, devineer, funny fun and above all in the film. Looking for him alone is valuable. Anna Negal shows a mother tongue next to her, and is very old for her part, but by the end of 1940, her film partnership was established publicly in public. Park Lane Spring is a top hit for 1947 and a big money-earner. Her autobiography, Wilming, wrote about her heartfelt respect for the London series's director and inspiring Herbert Wilcox.
