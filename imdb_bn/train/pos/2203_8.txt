I liked this series too, when I was a kid. I was 5 years in 1952 and my family always saw this show. My favorite character was instead of Marion Lorraine, rather than sneaking silent and very favorite "aunt" type person. I can still remember his "Ubba Bubba um um" comment because he will try something important. And then when he came back and played Ant Clara Twicechde, it was a great cast! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Huffington Post" After listening to it at my classical radio station in Southern California, I remembered the picture coming back to Mr. Pipher's camera. I am not sure whether this picture is correct in my mind.
