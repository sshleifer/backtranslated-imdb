In my opinion, it is much better than the 1990 version, but it is still not good. This is probably due to the date being felt, but it stands better than other pieces of time such as the other BBC 1980's Manfield Park and Northbourne Abbey. <br /> <br /> This orientation allows for better adaptation of length. The book and St. John's rivers are covered with less than 2 90s, but not very good. Timothy Dalton is very good as Rochester, but Jane Generated actress is very old. There is definitely a distance to a TV adaptation of this length, which is more than a tender spent on it.
