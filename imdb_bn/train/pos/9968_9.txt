My mother took me to watch this movie as a child and I would like to see it every year as my favorite of Christmas. I think most of what the stupid Devil and Santa are looking through his telescope. I waited and watched it through a TV guide every year to see what it would be shown. I would usually play it on a Saturday afternoon. I've only found the movie that took something special from the movie and expressed interest in finding a copy of it in Spanish. I love this picture in my heart and can never suffer from nightmares as others might recommend. Yes, it's a different movie about Santa Claus and which makes it special and unique. I can not wait to get a copy of this picture and see it with my children when I explain their favorite parts and memories !!
