This is a well-made documentary in the exciting world of Indy Car Racing. Photography is simply outstanding. The scene was that Mario Andrey runs the old street road along the old maple streets of New England, leaves flying by the speed of the car are incredible. The film will lose some of the beauty of the small screen, but if you like to watch the cars driven by their range, you will see this movie.
