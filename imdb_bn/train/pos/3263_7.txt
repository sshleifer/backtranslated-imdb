Naturally, I really enjoy movies like "Chance Array", but for some reasons I was not quite satisfied with this. The first half was done fairly well, Alex Fink died and the new body was resurrected (played by Robert Doni Jr.). He met his wife (Cyber ​​Shepherd) and friend (Ryan O'Ali) and his daughter, who is now grown up. Once again, the scene to meet with and Done once discovered, he did a good job, and Shefard eventually believed her husband after rebirth and had many good emotions and happiness, but the film was reduced from there. Various sexual scenes that completely blocked me, especially Donny and Shepherd are now trying to stay together again despite their age differences. Still, the film moves to finish the most satisfying way considering the situation of the plot. I was frustrated because I hope the film will not eventually become immoral. There was great possibility with this story, and the scene in heaven is doing well. A good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher, but eventually the film is not great. For a good, similar film, try "heaven can wait" Strangely, but I really like it, because I did not see it because of the second half scene. <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
