Could this picture be the usual "soap", which involved everyday life events involving half a dozen family members? Those who find broken relationships, new friendships, road-bushes, near accidents, hopes and dreams, and even some children thrown under the bushes! Fortunately, filmmakers have gone out of those everyday events and have no satisfactory answers but have taken the questions into consideration. He asked, what happened in this chaotic world, is it fate, when something goes right or takes a fatal view, it is predefined to be at a specific place at a particular time and thus is involved in the event. And its future takes a new perspective? Many of us have had these great experiences. <br /> <br /> Is it our pride that we believe that we are so important? Say such a character ?? He once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to realize how infinite he is. <br /> <br /> This is not one of my favorite movies but a good study of human relationships. Danny Glover is a sympathetic role outstanding.
