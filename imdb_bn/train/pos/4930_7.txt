"Panic in the Streets" was a decent thriller, but I was somewhat disappointed by it. The central theme of a city that has been attacked by a plug-in is attractive, but the film never searches or develops it. Its well made and entertaining, but it should not be as interesting as it is. For this the screen is really weak and brought down the whole film. None of the central characters is really mandatory or trustworthy. Fortunately, the film has been created very well so that it compensates for poor scripting. Under the direction of Eliya Kazan, the film is shocking and a lightning is running fast. There are some standout sequences, especially memorable Chase Climax. After several years when his order meets with a better screen, people can not make the mistake most of the time. <br /> <br /> Acting is also very good. Richard Wyommark was always a watchable leading man and he can do with an underwritten character. Paul Douglas spent his time screaming too much but did a decent job as well. Custom standouts are two villains. Zero Mustel, originally known for his comic roles, is effectively influenced as one of the film's final radioactive characters. Jack Palenance, vaguely, a cool villain. "Panic on the road" is frustrating but the observer value is still there. (7/10)
