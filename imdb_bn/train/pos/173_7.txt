Indeed, Goldie Hau from Washington (to Tokoma Park, Maryland), but I digress. Such a Mr Smith go to the Washington type movie, some diversity but in the same premises. I stopped this movie a year ago because there was a huge crash in my golf hawo. The story is interesting, but it is very unlikely that some cocktail waiters will get an important task for the government because they saved some big shot lives. It laughs me and makes me crazy at the same time. It laughs me because it was so ridiculous that I found myself in that situation, I had to laugh. (Potential spinner's official). It makes me crazy that our government will build an average citizen in the process of developing. And finally the speech made ... beautiful. Not many bad guys have guts like that in real life.
