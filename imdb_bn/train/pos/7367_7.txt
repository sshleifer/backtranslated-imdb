I am currently at come. Studying film at the level and "This is a Priest song" is a movie we have seen and in my opinion it is a very simple story but a complex back-story. If you dig the surface, after a massacre, the two men running from village to village will get a thriller-cheez film: - "Feeling Somewhat". <br /> <br /> But you have to dig deeper to uncover real genuine true feelings. As it has been suggested, it is a love story between two gay lovers, including lovers, betrayal and betrayal. We do not directly say "love" through this movie but events occur, for example, Hiton works on Spike, often shouting this unnecessary love in our mouth. <br /> <br /> This is a good example of why the film should not be dismissed as "incognito" for the British film, which is why it is in a low budget. <br /> <br /> is a good film of a complex story, though it is certainly not an earned taste and is probably not suitable for the average fan of Hollywood blockbusters.
