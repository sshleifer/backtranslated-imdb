I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. John Carpenter has instructed this picture to open the doors of many knocks, whether it will cool the bones, whether it is your first time or fifty-five times. The sound of Michael Meyers's fierce horror and the notorious screaming of Jamie Lee Curtis gives the film a terrific startup for the state of the instant culture and the independent era. I love music, I know the characters, yet wonderful setting, the simple nature of Villeneuve, and love it all random chaos. There is no real rhythm or cause for killing in this first movie, gave us the taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in any way just a very brighter animal? This question can never be answered, but the carpenter encourages us to be 100% extraordinary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Recently, his films were not the same (see Ghost on Mars), his career in Halloween began in his powerhouse. This is his final film. Although he was released from other greats, I will always remember this picture, which is why I would like to start all the lights, take care of the children at the time of feeding and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. This amazing power of carpenter is brought to you in the weaves of the world. With the power of the camera, he keeps the idea that you have kept pictures of girls at least in the hope that the killers are right next to you. I like every scene where we went back and Michael was there, watching from the distance, without any knowledge. That was scary, yet still brilliant. I've liked the scenery where the carpenter nearly pulled your fear from thin air. There you will have your own business mind, when suddenly that awesome mask will appear anywhere. Like the character, you thought it was just a tactic of the eye, but the presenter did not get you. Michael is not a ghost, he is a man (or at least we think), but he has strong mental skills in comparison to most of his main characters. It leads to some really bold themes and undefined emblem, but it's also a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Then, if you do not have enough Michael only, then only steamy, carpenter cool songs add music to the windows of your home. I still have piano key pressing, I wonder if the mayor sees me through the window. Finds the perfect combination of Carpenter visual frights and Chiling, which can predict what can happen next to our uncertain victims. It's deadly, and it's done with refreshing originality and more unique thrill from anything in today's horror Hollywood Liberation War. The helper of the carpenter is suddenly a breathtaking air breath in the middle of the wind, which is actually being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the value is not the same. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to say that the simple nature of opening this film is awesome and cool. Using the "shirt" mask sent shivers up my spine. Using the mask of the child, the film that scattered it spread to our own eyes, it is still one of the best horror openings! It's completely set tone for the rest of that film. You have a bbaber theme, your childhood behavior that carries Michael across the film, and the artistic genius of your vendor is rolled in one. I could literally say for hours about this film, but instead I would go watch it again. Repeat it many times! <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is one of the most remarkable movies in the history of cinema. The series of foreign films that they think will be facing face-to-face with the film, it is a continuation of the tough sellers and slashar films in the budget. This singular film has redefined the whole generation of horror movies, and still has had an impact on modern day horror behavior. The deadly assassination of genuinely murderous murderers, powerful artists of events (which is not usually much of a horror film), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis makes Halloween a perfect picture. Of course, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic to Jason, but Michael is real, he is frustrated, and he is hungry for kids' blood. What could be better? <br /> <br /> Grade: ***** out of *****
