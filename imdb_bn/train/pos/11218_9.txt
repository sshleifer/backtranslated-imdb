This Anime Evangelion fans must see a must. This is an earlier work of Anna Heyyyaki, but his extravagant, dramatic style is quite a place. Also, those who do not like Evangelion may get this release a little more palatable. Gunbuster is rather a science-anime unique that it is based on actual science. In fact, some of the short "science lessons" in this show explain physics behind some of the films. One of the major dramatic aspects of the film is the dynamic time of light-time speed. This series has done a wonderful job to work on the fantastic traumatic experience of returning to the ten-year-old world after leaving the world for ten years of travel around the pace of the six month mission. The whole series of the original character remains 17 or 18 years old when almost other characters are enough. Be warned, heavy at this show sap. It has a couple of the most completely unmerited breast shots that I have ever seen. I found it easy to ignore the Scimmy uniform and the Bo-Hoo scenes, because the series is otherwise very good, but visitors want to stay away from it with low sap tolerance. An interesting note, always, as, Gainax, last run managed to run out of several meanings. However, they managed to produce a good resolution however black and white film and still use the action sketch. The last is a little stupid, but in my heart I gave up with so much feeling that I could not help but love. Gunbuster, in my opinion, is one of the best pieces of anime around.
