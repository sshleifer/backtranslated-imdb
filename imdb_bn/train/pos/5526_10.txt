I am deeply embarrassed because I love cinema. I did a deformation in "Che, Parts 1 and 2" without seeing the film. Terrible I know. But I got trapped in a trap ... who? I do not really know, but there is a negative word that has spread like a wild fire and I'm so smart, I read it. But, grateful, I love Martin Donovan, an Argentine film director, I love and admire a man. When I said to him, I'm not going to see it because I knew that this movie failed, he saw me as if he was ready to save me from the face and Donovan was pacifist! He took me aside and told me how much he liked the movie and why. I went straight to see both parts and "Che, Part 1 and 2" in 2008 I saw the best films. This is the purity that will remind you of some great masters' deeds. Respect for his audience is something we are no longer using. We do not know if ever Riveting, without discount, and Benicio Dell Toro are just awesome. If we can see his soul, we can actually understand it. The humanity of humanity is overwhelming. So thank you for educating Martin Donovan again. Bravo Del Toro, Bravo Soderberg and everyone in this landmark film. I do not have to make mistakes that are grateful. Now, see it on the big screen
