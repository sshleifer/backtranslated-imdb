Hrm-I think that the line was from the old movie poster. <br /> <br /> This is a mobile phone that translates translator into a completely unknown language. Here's a tip: a movie that starts with a black screen and reading "the future ..." will be fun. This means that this court is so impossible that you have to explain it to them. In this case, "the future ..." means that instead of fighting against war, the nations are demon-robots and it determines the Duke, well, that's not terribly clean, but it's really something really important. Good boys (probably capitalist, meaning "us") and bad boys (Commies!) And there are big stop-motion robots. Sadly, the budgets were quite thin, so we can see a lot of 'big robots'. There are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then fight a big space near the end. The spacecraft is particularly nice because these effects are not any other purpose than the resonance of the budget. <br /> <br /> Now spent with the money spent, the climatic war deteriorated (and I'm not making this up) two guys hit each other with a stick. I can always laugh at a bar by reconsidering the final scene, the last one assures the release of any viewer from their head. <br /> <br /> I said - it's stupid. That's why I bought the tape.
