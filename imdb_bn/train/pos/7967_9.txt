This is definitely one of the best Disney movies ever. It's a real pleaser to anyone. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will put you in suspense. <br /> <br /> Basically, a homework dam is about three domestic pets who are sent to live on the farm and their owners leave. They do not know what's going on, and want to go home, they run away from the farm and try to return home through the desert. <br /> <br /> It played an Ameche in the last movies. He rendered the voice of shadow, old, wise and friendly golden retriever. Sally Field, who played the film, gave the voice of Sacy, the Himalayan cat. But seriously, this film is all the chancellor! Michael J. Voices by Fox (my all-time favorite actor), perhaps you are a dog, loving, playful, energetic and stupid, and while watching this movie I hope to have everything while cracking it; It does not end like a comedy! <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes very sad. It sometimes reminds people when they are alone or they lose their pets. <br /> <br /> A scene that keeps me always in mysteries where the scene is trying to escape from three pounds; I especially feel terrified in the part where Chance is caught on her fare and almost does not make it around. The film was at other suspicious moments, but no one seems more suspicious than me. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a wonderful family movie. If you enjoy this movie, then perhaps you will also enjoy a seagull. I'm 9 of 10 in this movie!
