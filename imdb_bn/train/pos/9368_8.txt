A few hours ago I came back from screening, and when I left it, I was very happy. It's very intense, and I came to the earliest to cry in a movie. This is the achievement of Adam Sandler, who provides extraordinary performance on many levels and probably deserves the title of the Oscar for it, early in the year it does not come out. Dawn Cheadle gives his usual fantastic performance of Adam's annoying game of people directly. <br /> <br /> There are some comedies, but mostly it's really funny than tearjerking moments, as Adam struggled to help Dawn with his loss of police. Adam plays very well at two levels ... when he is mentally stable he is funny and favorite, but when he is good, low stable he is strong and dark. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who likes severely. Mental drama about tough friendships and losses.
