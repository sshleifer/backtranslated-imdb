This is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films - I'm quick to admit it However, some see his movie as a pure propaganda, I wonder what's wrong with that? Yes, sure, the TV show is like a FBI, it is a clear case for working with some bureau-supported PRs. But, entertainment goes on, it does a good job. Plus, it's surprisingly enough when it's created, the film is more focused than spying and "Commies". Instead, it is an oldest agent and he has a myth of selected career. Now Agent is considering Jimmy Stewart, then it is quite sure that the acting and writing were good - it was a real budget and a movie with a studio that was not about destroying the stars on the third-party flick. So overall, it's valuable but not particularly great.
