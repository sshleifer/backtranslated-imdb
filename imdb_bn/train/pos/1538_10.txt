This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> That's why I lived only a few miles from the village, the story happened, and I know how this thing works in this area of ​​Sweden. Believe the movie, believe me! It both criticizes and honors the lifestyle of the building and the producer wants that more people should be nominated for watching the film and more care should be taken for your closest friend and relatives. <br /> <br /> But if you are in another small village anywhere in Sweden (or in another country) you probably know much about this movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks to Maria Blum!
