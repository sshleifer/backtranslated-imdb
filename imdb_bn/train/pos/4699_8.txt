What did this crime do for "another teenage movie" school? I warped with each other and warped between ourselves 2 laughs all the way through the inactive gang An unsurpassed comedy that uses too much curiosity and gags to keep me rolling all the way. I think the biggest scar of the whole film was never going forward before leaving the letters stuck in 30 seconds.
