When his wife is ready to kill the governor using a face-like cyber, it's up to Eric to remove his name. Vanson Van Damme gets the responsibility of pulling as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger. Why did Academy fail to take notice of me out? The Prime Minister is producing, driving, exploding cars (4 in the first 5 minutes) and firing. I especially like the van that flips in midair before it comes to touching an explosive truck. My other favorite bit involved a neighbor's daughter Dawn's simulator involving her cart coming perfect. This is the only chance to show some cheap legal effects in 1995.
