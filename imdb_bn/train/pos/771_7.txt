I met a gay boyfriend friend, together with my wife and his female friend in the movie. So I had feedback from all types of directions. Mainly, this movie laughs me, there was not really sexual tension and only spectacular actor Tedor Cheryla and Maria Popstasu Yes, I think she was not appropriate to the script, even she played well in her role. There were good Romanian actors, they just did not have a complex role. I congratulate Pu on movie business. I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I hope he's a good actor. <br /> <br /> The wife loves this movie, though it seems that maybe something like that is being played and for which I have no ear. If this movie tries to present unusual sexual behavior and their outcome in Romania today, it has unfortunately failed. There were no results. Just imagine that girls are actually a boy and girl, and the same story becomes simply an annoying, unintended plot. <br /> <br /> I do not know why these BAFTA rewards. In my book, it got the "Good luck next time" awards. (bafta = Good luck in Romanian).
