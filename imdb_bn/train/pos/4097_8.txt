Youth, sex, and in the French countryside - you're going to see one more unique movie. If you can see it, it can not be considered how hard it is to find copies (a combination of deficiencies and censorship). It is sometimes lover, sometimes annoying and sometimes funny. There is also a bizarre triangle in the middle, but you can not call it an aficionado unless you watched it at least once once seen it.
