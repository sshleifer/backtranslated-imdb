Although I am very young, my very favorite band of Beatles! I never received an opportunity to listen to their music during the war of liberation but I could remember that there is love from them. <br /> <br /> This is a kind of movie that is worth trying once. I can see why it is not released in the movie, but it is definitely a great movie to keep on the TV. I was moving through my TV guide and saw this picture, after breaking the Beatles' broken lane and Paul McCartney matched, there was nothing like something like the Jared Harris Stars. I never heard of him (he used to play John) or Eden Quinn who played Paul. They are underestimating the actors! <br /> <br /> The film started slowly, but as it grew, I found Queen, but especially Harris, played their characters. As a huge fan, I know how Lennon and McCartney looked like. The script was brilliant and Harrison Lenin's speech, personality and approach got the spot! Quinn played quite well McCartney but sometimes went into his Irish accent. These makeup artists look nice to them. <br /> <br /> This paragraph can be counted as a * speaker *: <br /> <br />. As I mentioned earlier, it has started slowly but soon developed and became quite a mental film. I had wasted the park's bit in total, and was out of character for the musicians. It is completely unnecessary for lenon's rude lines at the Italian restaurant. The last was very tragic and whenever I saw it, I started to get a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> It has been found that it is quite different from other biographical movies, where the Beatles were mixed together and became famous, and those characters who are not really good characters. For example, 'backbit' <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I would say, if you're a Beatles or John Lennon or Paul McCartney fan, then give it a chance that you might find amazing. For just over 95 minutes, the movie is waiting for the development. <br /> <br /> If anyone knew that the meetings of the 1976 meetings really happened, please send it to the 'Comment Page' for this movie. Be very interested.
