Cinderella I've never seen the first movie, and it's timeless to me. It's a lovely looking film, with gorgeous animation. There was a dress scene in my favorite animation scene - I just love that mouse. The songs are also beautiful, not as good as Snow White, but they are delighted to sing, and Tachovsky's memorable Is there a wish to have a dream and so is this love? There are standouts. Characters are also a joy. Cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mouse provides great comic relief. The classmates are doing well, as well as Lucifer. But I love the beautiful mother, she was really bad, compared to a great character in the name of the fairy godmother. It is true, the film was a little disappointed with the satire of the chit, but they were really fun, so I do not care. I do not mean it is overrated, intrinsic to you? It rarely plays on television, but the real bad trend is on regular cinemagic. If you want a great Cinderella adaptation, then wonder afterwards sometimes, or lady slipper and Rose, which is not good. But whatever you avoid, sequel, which is my ownership wrong, because you will thank me. 9/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
