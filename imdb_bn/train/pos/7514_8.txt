He is not Michael Jordan <br /> <br /> <br /> Think of all the wonderful NBA players, whose career light has become slower for any better reason than their birth time. Russell, Kausi, Bayward, Magic, McHale, Oscar, Wilt, these lists can easily travel their names with ease; But the volume for Stokes and Malone, Charles, Patrick and other big players who have always lost the title to Michael, turned the volume down a bit. <br /> <br /> I have found that in the answer to the cover article on the issue of Gretchen Moll's Carrier Flampered 1998 Vanity Fair, Miss Mole announced an inevitable superstorm. It was later told that he was hiped. I disagree. <br /> <br /> I still think that in the '97 or '98 "The Devil's Advocate", for a while, I would be confused because I played an actress Mary Ann Lomax. Was it Mole or Theron? And well! Charlize Theron was "The Day in Inn in the Valley" and "Mighty Joe Young" and Gretchen Mole "Donny Brasco", "Celebrity" and "Rounders". <br /> <br /> I saw the "Thirtieth Floor" (Mall) and "Sweet November" (Theron), I've straightened them most, but I still kept them in the same mental file drawer. Both were extremely talented, had sweet face, similar body type, small blonde hair and so on. <br /> <br /> Theron, however, got more work done. I love him all his life all the time and his beauty as Adel Ingrordon was cruelly scared. <br /> <br /> "Slow" was released in 2003 and until Oscar was handed over in that direction, all the filmmakers knew who was going to receive the "Best Actress" award. And so deserve! Irene Uranos Theron was there. The only correct idea about how to make true Isleen Uranosos more accurate will be to re-run digital video stuck in the head of a cellular phone. And for a great talent that made himself physically unreasonable! Neglect! <br /> <br /> Then in 2005 the "Notary Betty Page" was released. Mol's performance was remarkable. Maybe he was standing in the shadow of Miss Theron. The defeated presidential candidate was like a winner, like a winner for the election, no one came and nobody cared. It is seen as the continuation of an old story, once once a disappointed performer acted as a cruel part of a "B" movie once a committed actress. Hmm! No no Wrong! If you do not have any idea about the movie (and I enjoy fifty years of films), but if you pass it in, you will be one of the best performers of that year. Ms. Mol Mason was a bit like Beyond Theron Aileen. Unfortunately, the Aileen, the film's public, more sympathetic character. For any reason, a moral, homophobic murderer was less embarrassed than us, a poor, unreasonable, unmarried, religious girl, whose majority capitalist crime was fully convinced and lived completely uncovered. Betty Page was one of fifty icon's icons. Her pictures and movies are never sexually obscene, but she presents as the odd casual of all things. There was no sense of reality, only parody. Mrs Mole is very fond of character. He got 20 pounds of his geometry, usually associated with his thin image and when he came to the film's photographer, his body was Betty. Any undeclaredness of his full frontal attack fits everything properly on Betty. Cinematic nudity usually portrays sex or sex. In this picture it's all about innocence. I do not want to jump on Gretchen / Betty naked, but she wishes to protect her from all the horrors that can attack one another. If you pass this movie you will not be missing one of the best performances of recent years. However, shame on the MPAA for giving this a rating.
