First, I will give my rating for the series as a whole; ******* Ten star out of 7. After John Amos left, I brought this series three steps away for the encouraged slides. After not making me wrong, there were hard episodes, but Easter left the season after the rall and returned. <br /> <br /> In February, 1974, CBS was a fantastic sit-down (with dramatic overturns). This was a TV, a show about an African-American family living in the Chicago projects of the 1st century. Made by Norman Lee, as he closed the spine of "Mood", he again hit the right word with the audience. <br /> <br /> I have not spoken about any situation in the comedy directly from the internal-city family struggle. (Well, Fox's "South Central" was '94 'but was not renewed again.) <br /> <br /> John Amos was the father of James Evans, and he worked as the father of any father. Her family is going down from the wrong path of her children and her children <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Michael as Ralph Carter is a young but very bright young man for his age but is trapped in a school system that does not meet his academic needs. The name of his character is similar to Shaw's founder Mike Evans, who was "Zafferson" Lionel Jefferson. (Mike Evans died in December 2012). <br /> <br /> <br /> The Thalamah will have to face the danger of having a young girl at the age of 16 or 17 years of age and a young girl on horseback. J. J. As a hostage walker Evans Juniors is usually young-cracking, Javing kind of young man, who does not take life seriously. <br /> <br /> All my favorite episodes are with John Amos, Gordon / Jeanette Jackson, except the Penny story line. <br /> <br /> After the death of James Evans' character, the show has lost its stability and the spectators are gone. Easter rolls have gone for the whole year, JJ's smart-alike "Dino-Mite" does not want to play the second puzzle! <br /> <br /> He returned to the next season, even after obtaining the guarantee, the author also brought out the stuff. Florida's neighbor Willon Woods was a divorced woman, who accepted Penny Gordon (a minor girl, played by 10-year-old Janet Jackson). Penny's abusive mother, Tate Fields, starred by Kim Fields Mother. <br /> <br /> The program ended in August 1979, all were left to live a good life. Jazz Artist sold an idea to a comic book company, Michael Michael went to the campus to live in the campus. <br /> <br /> Willona and Penny, Thalma and football player husband Keith + Florida all went to the same building in downtown Chicago. Do not last most realistic but by that time it does not matter.
