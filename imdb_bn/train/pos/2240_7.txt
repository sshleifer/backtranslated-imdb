Italian actress Lusina Pazlier's love for me helped me to take some unusual unusual places to help my young girl jump in with her performance in the 1965 "Thunderball". Since 1959, this British curiosity is "F.O.'s Carlton-Brown," which presents Lucuna in its earlier roles. In this film, he plays a princess, although the film is actually a showcase for Terry-Thomas and Peter Seller's adversary, but both stars emerge at this time. In this intelligent, often very funny movie, we learn like Madira, the island nation of the Gaillardia nation, which was a British colony until 1916 and publicly forgot. Thirty years later, it became a worldwide attention and international espionage center when valuable Cobalt deposits were discovered there and Hare Mejessi sent foreign office rebel Carlton-Brown to take charge. Terry-Thomas beautifully portrays this part, as vendors play the role of Prime Minister Amphibolos. (It was the second film of the 1959 Sellars in relation to the matching Wight of a small country with the Earth, the other was "The Mouse the Rocked"). Ian Banen steals as the King of Gillard's Sue King and appeals as my daughter Lusina may have a small role As The film shows many things through very dry comedies, although some stomach laughs (reception at the Gaireddy Airport, for example, and especially the Day-Style Parade in Gailardian Energy). And the vendors' CD prime minister, with its cracked English and seemingly permanent sweat stains, yet another memorable character of this great actor's pantheon. Occasionally or two strangers, like the strict-high-lips British church, I found this picture for a winsome modest entertainment, and well presented in this Christmas Anchor Bay DVD.
