I love seeing 'Sea Hunt' again, I was in grammar school and I was going to do my homework at home and by 4:30 pm Sea Hunt and Mike Nelson were ready to see their water flow. I love it He took you to a large place, under the blue sea, that time very accessible. Although the previous 'Thunderball' or even Costeo became common, Mike Nelson was impressing the imagination of the kids. I am somewhat more interested in kids developing their passion for spacecraft or biology or watching from science. Underwater photography is also progressing, the attraction for searching is easily stimulated through watching these shows. See and enjoy !!!
