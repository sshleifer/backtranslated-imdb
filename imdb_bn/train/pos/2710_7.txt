This is not my favorite WIP ("Woman in Prison"), but it is one of the most famous sub-genre films. It was produced by Roger Rankings, at that time already several WIPs were created. It is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. This movie is held in the United States prisons, not much like "Writers of Republic of Art" like WIP movies. I'm sure it's not a wise move, but it's a change in pace. Writer-director Dame really got his job, always screwed new ways to present a familiar scene. In fact, he is a little aspiring for his own good. The filmmaker has created a series of spiritual dreams that are endlessly satirical, but it is fun to see that he hangs on this movie on your average children's circles. But do not worry, Dame still works in sub-standard parameters. There are plenty of nudity and violence, some will satisfy that hardcore fans. The film is a bit slow, but it is very entertaining. Cast well. Roberta Collins is a WIP viewer, so she does not need any role, and Barbara Steele wheelchair-bound crazy warden is just like her. Although Pam Greyay is sorely missed.
