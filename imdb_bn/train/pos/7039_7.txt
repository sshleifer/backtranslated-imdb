Battle Inc is a funny but weird film. Actor liked, the movie is also liked, but I can not describe the plot. I will go into the plot afterwards. This is a movie with some weird casting choices. In addition to John Cusack, as a hit-man, which we've seen many years ago, breaking the grayscale point, which I liked. <br /> <br /> Here is the Hilary Duff, the Russian pop star, the vagina babia or something like that. Her character is weird A scene where he sticks a scorpion down his pants. And Hauser (Cusack) hits over. There is a wrapping finish involving two letters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it's just a strange reason. The whole movie is weird But at times incredibly funny and I was not bothered. Here we have some of the best actors out there. Excluding Miss Duff He is not great But here are our Cusack, Marisa Tomomi, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley. What do I mean? <br /> <br /> This is a hit-man story called Hussar (Cusack). To hit an oil man named Omar Sharif, he was sent to some Middle East cities (not actor). While trying to deal with his personal problem, he must help with the marriage of a popster (played by Hillary Duff). And he falls in love with a news reporter (played by Marisa Tomeii). Although there is a thing about popster. The house is hateful by it. There he is singing a song where there is a scene and then he torn. <br /> <br /> Why publish the end point of the film. The thing about twists is that I like to see it coming. But that does not matter. It's a weird, fun, and entertaining comedy. I love most of the actors. So true, how can I recommend it? <br /> <br /> Battle, Inc. 3.5 / 5
