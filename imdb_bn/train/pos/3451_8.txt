After all, this film was not released in theaters (they are neutral), I said they talked about the death of hypocrite police, politicians and dedicated newspapers, just send DVDs and cable TVs> and receive money and runs. <br /> <br /> I usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. Morgan Freeman, Justin Timberlake, Kevin Specey, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is done for the death, but the life of this violent movie described above And it's actually worth seeing. <br /> <br /> As well as a dedicated young reporter for a runaway newspaper edited by Justin Timberlake Morgan Freeman, others are polite policemen, and politicians or some modest person, daughter of two female LL Cole ZJ and Justin Timberlake's friends and Doing what it requires, it is quite violent, many killings etc., not for children. This is not a great movie in any way, but for what it is and cast is definitely good, <br /> ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out 10)
