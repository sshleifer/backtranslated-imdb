I've never heard of this movie a few weeks ago, but when I heard it, her idea encouraged me: an American man met a European woman in her last night in Europe and they talked together at night. It blurts my interest, but I do not expect it to be great. Sunrise is one of the most romantic movies in the record, and before it is a great compilation. As soon as I was surprised, there was a lack of mourning in the late 1990's. It's impossible to talk too much about it, because there is no real plot, so to speak (although there are lots of interesting things that you can talk about; it's like dinner with my underwear, where there is a conversation, but it's not just an important conversation) But tell me, check it out. See it!
