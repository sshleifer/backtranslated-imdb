Well, since 1972, Clara Bowe's silent film, it plays a spin off of the rainy season, the local Pineapple King Aleve Hawaiian Wild Girl, who was in love with English engineer Clive Brooke. Bo competes with the local widow (Arlette March) for her attitude, but when her wife (Patricia Dupont) sees, both women are surprised. The hunter is ready for divorce, until he can be at the fate of a fortune. Bo settles into his fast hash <br /> <br /> The sister has extra personality and has a great view of her: her open nude bath, her throats on the grass skirt and the recovery of Bo and Brooke's dogs have made their own Stantas. Note: IMDB credit list is incorrect. Movie credits (from my DVD) Patricia DuPont is playing in Mrs. Haldane - not Magrot Tracks listed in IMGb.
