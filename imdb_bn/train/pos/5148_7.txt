I do not know what to do with this movie. But movies about history or religion are always criticized by their accuracy. Of course this is not 100% correct. Currently "experts" disagree with each other, but it is difficult to make 100% perfect films nowadays. Therefore, I want to judge a movie by trying to say what I'm trying to do all the mistakes. <br /> <br /> So I started to say that I liked this mini seri. But I agree with the criticism that his childhood years went very fast. The series was the story of three parts, being the first part of her childhood. But if they do not have more money to criticize them then who will I criticize? <br /> <br /> I have the only real problem with this movie and it has been said in a history book way. Especially in the second part of which the incident happened is only one. I liked to see Hitler more humane (more scenes where he suspects himself). Noah Taylor did much more at the movie 'Max' which I think works well. Yet I am happy to own this and make it DVD. Just remember what happened more clearly and see Karlie giving her the best. 7.5 / 10
