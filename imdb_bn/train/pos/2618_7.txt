Possible spinner: Not sure <br /> <br /> I could not help seeing the King of Lion 1 1/2, but could have mixed feelings about the whole film. It is certainly a good way to spend for an hour and 15 minutes. But there is nothing about this that will give you similar feelings to the lion king. In the story, who did not read another review, how to meet Timn and Pumba for them, and how they affected the events of the original Lion King. <br /> <br /> Actually some funny movies. My favorite part is when they show my simba raising pair. However, the worst parts for me will be when they appear to interfere with Timon and Pumbaa direct event. I can not ever see again "Life Circle" or "Can not Feel Love Today" (I'm OK with "I just can not wait to be a king"). <br /> <br /> Voice talent is excellent. Nathan Lane and Arnie Sabella did a great job, Matthew Broderick, Rafique, and Heinas. Even young actors Simba also felt sufficient for me as Jonathan Taylor Thomas. But why did they include a voice actor for Jazz? He literally had only 2 lines, and neither was very necessary. Julie Kawner and Jerry Steele's link only adds talent, though you still can not hear the voice of Timon's mother and think of Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that do not seem to be the real thing, eventually it seems to be proud. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Other visions may fit the ratio. I enjoyed the game "Who Watts to the Wild of King", even though I have ever seen the most embarrassing example of cross-promotion. Some of the questions are really difficult. <br /> <br /> Overall, a good movie, though not nearly as good as TLK or even TLK2.
