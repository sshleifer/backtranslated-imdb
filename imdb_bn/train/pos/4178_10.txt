This movie was a real reflection of Australian supplement that was needed to make this country in the last 200 years. Not as silly as the British, not like Gong-hoo like Americans. If any of these countries tries to do this, it would have failed in frustration. Either the British part is due to ignorance, or excessive faith in the superior firepower of the American party. The "true" Australians (such as non-import) are the only ones who can excel in modern military conflicts because they have to improve the lives of most adults. Just look at examples like Gallipoli; Paschendale; Tobruk; New Guinea and Vietnam
