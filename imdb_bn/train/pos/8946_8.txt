This impossible story is a woman witch who follows a mortal man in a maternal world. His "community" is open among his members, but he conceals his witchcraft from the dead. Hmmm ... this familiar sound starts. Hah hah This is not your ideal movie. Jack Lemon and Arnie Kovacce's "Campi" performances keep things dull. Kim Novak is always happy on the screen, but I found James Stewart's extraordinary (but not terrible for the story) pair. <br /> <br /> With all the new images being sinking and in the dark, this movie will be invented by the old and new audience and will be re-discovered ...... it is still a hot!
