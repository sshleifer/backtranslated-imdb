Armgadon PPV <br /> <br /> The last PPV <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I started the show with Infra Match. Cain V. MVP It was a good match. There is nothing about wrestling here. This was about visualization. Overall, this was not bad. There were a few frequent places to turn closer to the ear, but in the end, KN won the first time by MVP raming. <br /> <br /> Excellent hero. Let's go. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long has announced a new match for Team Title titles: Will compete against London and Kendreck: Rigal and Taylor, Harddies and MNM in a leather match !!!! Let's go <br /> <br /> Two deadly four ladder matches in two matches! This was total killings. Judging by three of the four groups here, you would expect chaos. The spot was amazing. Total Spot-Fest One point went for Jeff Motion Poetry and moved to London and hit Jeff Stairs! Shortly after, Jeff was placed with two stairs at the top, MNM was going to kill Jeff, Matt saved, and Jeff Toure hit "watched" on Wednesday! Mercury is damaged. Her eyes are fast closed and the open hard way is busted. Nitro goes out of the match on Wednesday. He's going to fight alone for the title! Rigal and Taylor then grab the London and face him on the stairs first! Jeff ascends and nitro climbs into a killer spot, Jeff nail by drag chick! O of non-SM-fold! In the end, the London and the Centre Tag Team maintains the title. What a match !!! <br /> <br /> It was crazy. I do not understand unless WWW has announced this so far. Buyrate will be huge increments. I'm sure the replay value will be good. <br /> <br /> Has suffered scattered noses and lacerations inside the chest. She is now in the hospital. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Will Boogeyman ever wrestle? Mies sucks too. After a mad crowd, kill these dead dead. DUD <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit V. Chavo It was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a killer superplex at one! Benoit in Germany in eight German Germany! Benoit won with sharp shutters. Good stuff. <br /> <br /> Hels V. Young-Cruiserweight title championship match It was a good match. Unfortunately, stupid fans do not care for this. Why? Helms and Young are very talented and well wrestling. I agree with JBL. She ranted in the crowd JBL is 100% accurate. Learn to appreciate or find this. <br /> <br /> Kennedy V. The Undertaker-Last Ride Match Not too much here. With a few exceptions to this, there was a slug festival. At one stage, Kennedy tossed the ground in the field of bout, tossed from the floor. The spot was fine. The response was frustrating. The last spot was heard by Baker's burial Kennedy and won the match. Unrealistic Kennedy needs this win. They both work hard. Still, Kennedy needs this win. Undertaker should lose. Creative cracks again <br /> <br /> Next to a fool Deva thing. I love ladies It's not At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. Judge from the crowd, Lella will win. WWE Ashley wanted. Consider this to break your bathroom. Next. <br /> <br /> Main event: Army and Battista V. Finley and Booker T It was not a match. The focus was on Sina V. Finley and Bateista V. Booker Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay Cena tries to look good. The finish was botched. The batsman hit a knee with a chair shot in the finale and finished the match by selling the boutista shot. Lame No major event qualifications. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon has scored less, but the stairs match was the main event here. That there was enough money worth. A few others were difficult. <br /> <br /> Last word: Getting PPV Savior good with stairs Smackdown is not a mandatory enough to be fair enough. Need to put Cena tags along with SmackDown. Let Smackdown stand on their own two legs. This show proves that Smackdown can do.
