First off I will admit to myself the top-few peak of the first scarcity itself. Maybe less acrobatic scarecrow has made this movie a lot less sugar in toned. But overall I think this is one of the best B-movies. Tiffany Shepis is absolutely wonderful to mention incredibly beautiful. Although the film has lost the miraculous nude factor, there are many movies that see him. But here he gets all the heat, especially to the end when he is running away from molten. Also Richard Elfman does a great job as Sheriff and as drunk lover. Yes it is a low budget B movie. But I saw all of them, this is certainly my very favorite darling.
