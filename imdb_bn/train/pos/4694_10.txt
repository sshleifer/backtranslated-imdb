If you want to see a fan of your air type movies! In the 1920's and 30's Johnny Dangerous, that's not just a great actor, but a great line. "Down the wall down, down the wall down and down the date # @ $% # @ $ wall." "You should not hang me on a hook mother" or "sounds like Johnnyys laid". It is clearly a spoof of old James Cagney movies and many of them have been mentioned. The twitch has a great view of the death of a priest in the death row and his escape. Read the fake priest, listen closely to his fun. Another great scene when playing Dom Dellaus Pope. After giving tips on Pope, see Jonny's reaction, without saying many words. I laugh this movie or recommend for old movie buffs.
