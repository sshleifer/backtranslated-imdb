Among Arnold's 80s movies, who thought that today's most relevant running man would be. A cool and amazing realistic story of reality TV has gone crazy. It has been brought back again but now it is not so. When you do not worry about it, At present, reality TV shows are great for scraping or bar below the barrels. If the latter is not as controversial as the last, it is a ugly. We'll really see how long the runner looks like this? How many days ago do we have an entertainment division of a theater attorney or judicial department? There is so much mockery and intelligence in this movie that may be missed in 1987, which is unhappy to see current TV shows again. <br /> <br /> The biggest message to all is 'you are lying'. It is a secret that government and media work. And the media believes that media believes them. It can take a ruthless ceremony like Running Man in the near future until it is a very dangerous situation and the true presentation of truth emerges. It is not a secret that reality TV is not very realistic. It has been edited and rescheduled before it was broadcast, and it only wants to see the networks. Generally it is far from true truth. <br /> <br /> The script is different from the Book of Stephen King (the last is completely changed). The script is usually consistent with Arne formula. Yes, he has many and very authentic laners and he is still saying that I will 'come back' (which he has never said that, as you would think about it) is still in the most satirical situation, but he still has one million Christopher Riv. Or the role of Dolf Lundgren became even better (whether these two Arne believed earlier). <br /> <br /> There is no other than Director Dave Starsky (Paul Michael Glazer). It may not be artistic, but it is still strong enough to create excitement and using neon and florescent colors, each sets a pretty cool look. Andrew Davies (a director I did not particularly like) was associated with Glass, although there is no director, but the film is still deadly by more than 80 feelings. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Harold Fultroyer's score (remember him?) robs the incredibly dated and no timeless integrity action scene. And the fashion sense of the film is too much too fast to be set in the future. In addition to the date of the date, the bug that was one of the worst things I did is pass like a climax. <br /> <br /> This new DVD is 25 times better than the original release. Horrid letterbox picture has become. A brand new high-definition 1.85: 1 enamorphic transfer in place. Color sparks and literally pops on the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtracks are also amazing. The impressive impressive effect of the channel around and the diameter is strong and strong. One of the best re-masters I've seen so far is definitely. Two confusing documentaries, a trailer and a 'meet the stalkers' gymnastic are included in this two-disc set that comes in a clean kit area.
