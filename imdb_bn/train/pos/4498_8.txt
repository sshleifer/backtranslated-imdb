Francesca Anis, Michael Kitchener and Robson Green !! Wow, what a quarter ... OK, so it does not bring anything, but it's a good love story, very good writing and well played by everyone. Some 'smile-out-loud' moments have also been mixed with some pretty serious observations on honesty, age bias, and parenting / Alzheimer's issues. <br /> <br /> The song of the Quickie Gita also added to that story. <<br /> <br /> I have been the 'Amnes' fan of 'Lily' (in the 70's) and Mr. Quinn's 'The Bakniers' and 'Enchantment April', I have recently met Mr. Green ('I and Mrs. Jones', 'Touching Evil' etc.), asked me questions - why have not I seen 'Reckless' till recently ?? !! There is more 'chick flashes' than the way a person sits, it is appropriate to see lazy in the rainy afternoon.
