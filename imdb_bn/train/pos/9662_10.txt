Bate Middleer's longtime fan, I must say that his recorded live concerts are my favorites. Bette thrills us with her joke and tears with our ballads. Emotions and talents show a literal sunny, Bette gets good on her hard show, and new songs from the "Bate of Roses" album. Generation Generation He offers something for everyone. The one and only Divine Diva proves that he is the most distinguished genius.
