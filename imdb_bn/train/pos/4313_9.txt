The Grand Canyon falls under a very harmful category: it is very shiny film, very cute dialogue and food for thought everywhere from start to finish. I think it's not going to make it worthy (and never) its worthy ranking due to availability. This type of glance requires sensitive observers. It is sad that IMDb lets me write ten lines because it is not necessary in this particular case. However, to fulfill this request, I would like to tell you that if the weak point of the film is in the acting, it is not bad but it can be done better. Kevin Kline was perfect for an exception. Go ahead and see it.
