I expect something different: more passion, drama ... again another failed attempt of fundamentalism. I am sorry that this movie will be the old leak of 'Chashma'. Even though the 15-year-olds can appreciate it. Acting was very convincing and the lines were simple, lack of intelligence. Still, the soundtrack was good and well adapted. I can not say that this film flop a total, because people see it but it does not meet public expectations and stumble into mediocrity. So, in conclusion, the production puts you around a half hour TV ahead, which is a pretty thing. So, if I'm not bothered you guess it worth the price
