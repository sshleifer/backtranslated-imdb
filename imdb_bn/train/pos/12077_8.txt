Enjoyed a mysterious thriller film of 1945, a young woman, Nina Folk, (Julia Ross) who came out of the job, and her rent has fallen behind and is unhappy with the search for work. Julia reads and tried an advertisement for a newspaper newspaper in London, and tried to get this location. Julia has achieved this position and is hired by Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Wei), who does not need her involvement with her homeowner and she does not have any involvement with male friends and Julia says that she has no family and her job is free. Time fans. George McDaddy, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some strange desires to play around with a knife. It was a low budget movie and most of the scenes were closed to avoid costs for background expenditure and visibility. This strange family lives in a huge palace outside of Cornwall Coast in England and there are secret doors and lots of mystery.
