Note that mine is only for the third review of this film, where 'Patan-Last for Gayiri', a controversial American general's creator Frank McCarthy's previous biography, attracted nearly one hundred comments. Like the previous critics, I am surprised to see why a film has received so much attention from others. <br /> <br /> One difference between two pictures is 'Patan', more focused, relatively focused at the end of World War II and immediately at the end of World War II, when 'MacArthur' is not only this war, but its role in the Korean War and At the time of intervention, he included his time as US governor of Japan. <br /> <br /> The main difference is the same as both leaders. Gregory Peak George C. More than that, 'Patan' has influenced this film. Another big star of Scott, Carl Malden, in contrast to General Bradley, another actor from MacArthur is not the family name for his movie work. Scott, of course, portrayed Patton as an offensive and a fire, a man who sometimes fought with the enemy, not with the enemies but with the rest of mankind. I think General MacArthur looks like a person as a volcano in Patton, but I do not doubt how he looks in this picture. Pack's MacArthur reflected more than the liberal intellectuals acting in his other films, thoughtful and intelligent. Sometimes, he seems to be a man left even politically. Most of his speech on the occasion of Japanese surrender in 1945 may be written by a paying member of Cnd and his policies of reforming Japanese society during his occupation of American occupation are semi-socialist air. In an effort to show some of MacArthur's gifts for inspirational leadership, Peacock makes him a good speaker, but his lectures always carry more meaning in the techniques of practitioners than any fire in the heart. It was given General Uniforms to Atikas Finch from 'To Kill A Macingbird'. <br /> <br /> When Scott tried all the pictures of a 'warts' and Patan, the critique of the 'MacArthur' tried to shine on some of its less interesting attributes. I think this criticism is a fair one, especially since it is related to the war in Korea. The film prints that MacArthur was a brilliant general who stood on behalf of intervention, militaryly unknown politicians who did not know how to fight with war and were in his realization when he was released from his pain. Many historians believe that truman was forced to dismiss MacArthur because later it became a threat to the world peace, and there was no substitute for accepting Stalin because Stalin did not allow his Chinese alliance to be insulted. Even in the Korean scene, MacArthur of Pack was perhaps more likely to be an idealist than his original life-course; We see little turmoil and proximity on political issues. (Aizenhaor said, "He knows about the train Sunday that he knows about anger that he knows much about anger, so he knows a lot about politics," but it can be applied equally to MacArthur's view in international diplomacy). Perhaps the film effort to draw some pictures of MacArthur Mart reflects the time in which the attempt was made. After two militants from Vietnam and Watergate, America had hard times for the end of the century and expressed optimism of the public's assurance, welcoming the heroic image of the previous generation's military personality. I have to make another criticism film that it falls into two stools. If it meant that MacArthur wanted to be the full biographer, he should show some of his early life, which is not completely covered. (The General's first view is to lead America's resistance to the Japanese attack in the Philippines). A theme running throughout the film is General MacArthur's father, who is himself a military hero. I would like to see how Arthur MacArthur was like, and why his son thought he was such a hero and role model. Another interesting way to create the film is to focus on conflict between Korea and McArthur's truman, simultaneously with both men and women playing the same comedy. The way this picture was actually created, it was considered less interesting than these alternative methods. <br /> <br /> It is wrong that I completely disagreed with the film. Although I do not agree with the interpretation of the key role of the pack, he has denied that he played it with his usual professionalism and seriousness. Completely the film is a tough example of a difficult, work-like biopic, thoughtful and informative film. This is a good movie, but it is one that can be better. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (The pre-war border was the 38th parallel). Also, I think MacArthur called the 'taksin' of the war. The war can be poisonous, but it is very difficult to hear thirsty ears for poisonous ears.
