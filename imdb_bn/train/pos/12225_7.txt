I saw this movie and although I knew who the killer was from the beginning, I still like to see it. I would recommend it to other people. It's a lot of life time movie networks. And I wonder if they are closer to Halloween, they can play it more. So if you are interested to see it, then find it. I believe Alicia Silverstone played his part very well. I really liked her as actress and person. She seems so beautiful and down on earth. Kevin Dillon was so much for me on his performance. I'm not trying to stop him or anything else but I believe his brother Matt will be able to drag the worse serial killer figure better. Kevin is just too sweet for me. But I think he's okay.
