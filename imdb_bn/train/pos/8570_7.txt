I once saw that this movie was not really based on the novel Daddy Smith. In any case, it was a great idea that Pongo and Parvita's son had their own dogs now. Of course, the most free of dalmatians, there was a very small snowball, which was completely clear till the end of the film. <br /> <br /> To be honest, I do not know what I could not think of when Cruella de Ville completely changed. In fact, I've often been thinking about the possibility of becoming friendly, but now he has quickly transformed himself into "myself" and declared that he was once a crow, I was often worried about Cloir's dalmatian. <Br/> <br /> In fact, the dogs saw Lady at the time of Chad and Kevin's dinner and saw the tramp, that scene was much better than I expected. I was a favorite of the pot as a dog, and it was incredible that the dogs have learned many techniques for this movie. <br /> <br /> I was certainly pleased that the dalmatians were finally rescued, but I would like to know what is happening after Crula lost his property property. And what the dogs in the world can do with such a huge money <br /> <br /> Finally, it was very sensitive that Snobal's photo was very spotless at the end.
