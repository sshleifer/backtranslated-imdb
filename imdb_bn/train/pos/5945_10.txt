Let me clear one thing? Most of those who express mentality to run the Hollywood show usually close me and more specifically related to treating Iconic character, especially about my choice. Comic Book Pages Why? Let's look at the scenario of an ideal Hollywood Executive Board meeting? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Executive no. 'This day, a lot of dollars can be collected from superhero flicks.' <br /> <br /> Executive No.2 'Good point, then hurry up one by one! ?? We'll do a lucky dive in a hat and take a superhero on a film civilian at a random! '(The dive takes place and the name of a famous superhero is drawn out) <br /> <br /> Executive no.1' Great! Who can we take part now? <br /> <br /> Executive No. 2 Who is the big box officer right now? <br /> <br /> Executive No.1 * * Big actor name * This week. <br /> <br /> Executive No. 22 does he really play the role? I mean that he is not like that character. <br /> <br /> Who does the Executive No. 1 care? He is a big name; We'll make films with him as well. '<br /> <br /> Executive No.2 You okay And along with that we will fill the whole film so that glitzy special effects are full, which will not ask any question to make the Moroccan people happy! <br /> <br /> The above scenario is usually the most hateful of superhero movies. All styles, no substances and deceit lead are simply kindly cast. Of course, to be fair, there are exceptions to the above rules; When does Hollywood get it right ?? Take the original casting (and still the best!) Superman; Christopher Reeve and more recently Patrick Stewart and Sir Yan McCain in X-Men films <br /> <br /> But what's the common negative features of Hollywood ?? Was our studio actors always choose actors who fit the role? Less than the best in the world, a filmmaker does not believe it by throwing actors on the basis of their real similarity to his comic book opponent. His name is Sandy Collora. Sadly (but generally) Hollywood has not yet managed to complete a full-length movie, but fortunately for us Hollywood is not allowed, he has two results (still up) super heroes. A great Batman: Dead End and the other is the Mack Trailer for a completely fantasy movie, World Finest. <br /> <br /> Do not reduce the meaning of our words here? This is absolutely amazing! <br /> <br /> Play the iconic people of Mr. Universe winner and male model Michael O'Hare, Casting (who looked very similar but looked completely helpless in the helpless Barbarian) makes the most perfect choice. Indeed, on the condition of physical similarity, there is no conjecture with the comic character undoubtedly. <br /> <br /> <br /> This clerk returns to Bertam with his batman's wonderful role as a dark knight: the dead end; Again, a lot of other pieces cut to the logical! <br /> <br /> What can I say? ?? If it was just a real, full length movie! Hollywood studio officials ?? Take note! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As a final note, I am again excited by the diverse reactions emerging from fans. Not saying, the maximum acerbic and fierce adverse reaction against it comes once more than a small, less cinematic veteran experienced reader (such as with Batman: dead end); A reality betrays them somewhat grammatically by the use of primitive rants and base fiction. This unfortunate situation of close psychology is a tragedy despite our predecessor studio's official, but it is not doubtful that there is so much satisfaction. Finally, these same misleading people came out of the same way as possible CGI addiction, popcorn stuffing imbizzles that outsourced Hollywood through floods today.
