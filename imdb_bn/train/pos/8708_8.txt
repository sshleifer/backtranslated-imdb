I saw subtitles as it was Russian, but really enjoyed it. The main character Sasha was born, curse with a deadly weapon as her body extension. He was unhappy with his whole life because he was different, and anger led him to do terrible things. <br /> <br /> When Sasha finally ended up in love with a young girl named Katiya, everyone tried to end it in a fierce battle. There was a fair amount of cattle, but not too much for the weak stomad. <br /> <br /> For those who prefer regular old Hollywood movies, but for those who enjoy independent films. Kinda got an Asian fantasy film feeling.
