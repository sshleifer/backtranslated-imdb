I got this one a few weeks ago and love it! It is modern, light but filled with true complexity of life. It's like other Eytan Fox movie questions and answers. This is my favorite, as well as JC and Jagger. These pictures are only globally, more than just living in bubbles. You do not have to be gay or gay to enjoy it - I'm not, but the movie goes straight to my top ten movies. At first it seems like pure entertainment but it makes you feel more. Relationships with us are worshiping, meaningful, deep, deadly, you name it. You do not know what you're coming in and you definitely do not know where you are heading this story as you are seeing it for the first time. It's worth seeing a lot of times. Fox Films has a lot of bonus material - a great music video and "made" (with the interpretation of the title, Leir Ashendenji interviewer who played herself in the movie and is suspected of Arab's Israeli style of life).
