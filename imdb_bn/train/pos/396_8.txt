Legend of June <br /> <br /> I remember well with the original Zoo Warriors of Susie Hark created 18 years ago. In a rare weekend of one-day Christmas, Channel 4 shows a week-long show of Hong Kong film, when Ju Warri became so young and very sticky for his brother, and it seemed as if he was now up Sprague ... <br /> <br / Actually, I think the real zoo is one of the smallest films in Warrior, which I can clearly clear story lines and action scenes. And remembering Yuan Biao, Samojo Hung and others in remembrance of their classic head <br /> <br /> When I saw this remix of Jur Warriors, there was a fear. Could it defeat me the artistic memories of the original dream, or do it follow the path of another remix, and that kungfu is harmful in the film, and deadly death than their broken neck? <br /> <br /> I can not say good answer. But it's not really a remake because it was. Stories (and styles) are almost completely different. <br /> <br /> The story of June legendary King Sky, the only warrior whose Lord Dawn announced his love for him, but his life was taken from him by an insomnia giant Twenty years later, insomnia came back, Don Ingi was reborn as, and came back to destroy the insomniac. Meanwhile, trying to white Ivro and Red, the King stopped the insomnia with the help of Sky. <br /> <br /> This plot is not totally altering and escaping, but it was enough to be interested in me. But I can see this movie as you love or hate you. The film is very much about the special effects, most of the computers are environment-friendly, which is similar to The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two, this image was such that the graphics did not do much and the whole thing was delicious. Nothing is displayed - unlike heroes. The backgrounds were complementary to the act and the scenes were not at full empowerment. <br /> <br /> The story involves a lot of characters and makes it so much fun with the movie. Perhaps it was at the end of 'too much cooking', but usually each character had its share. But some of the roles in my opinion seem to be 'extended kaymoos', and I'm going to ask a little bit about its requirements. <br /> <br /> Icon Cheng and Louie Ku played a very important role in this film, but I could not show their best performance in this film. Cecilia Cheung seems to have matured at least her performance, but it's still quite raw. Kelly Lynn was a new revelation for me. Despite its very small role, I apologize and ogling! <br /> <br /> Overall, I've enjoyed this movie as much as I've enjoyed the original "real". Both the films have been made in the legendary Sui Harke, two films together as part of a chronicle which shows how filmmaking in Hong Kong has changed for two decades. And one of the beauty is that you can not really compare two movies, as soon as apple apple and animal pear are done. Finally, both of them have their own enjoyable movies. OK. And I'm going back to the reminder by watching the original again. <br /> <br /> See two, but do not compare.
