I look at this page, and it seems to me insulting me to have someone ramble and rant at a real classic. Sure, I agree to give their opinion, but here I am: <br /> <br /> This movie should not be missed by a classic horror audience and many casual visitors from around the world should be seen. Surely, it has lost some of its talents and greatness with age, especially in today's CGI influences, but why do not you like it. <br /> <br /> You have to like it because it's actually a scary movie, even for today's standard. This overall leniency will be as close to the original as you like, so if you do not give it a chance, then do not slam classic. See it, but not with a critical attitude. See it for fun, how it was originally intended.
