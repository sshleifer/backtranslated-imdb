The most satisfying material about "Dan in Real Life" is that the relationship between Dan (Steve Carroll) and Marie (Juliet Binoch) is sensual and beautiful realistic. Oscar winner Juliet Binoch was a great choice for Dan's love interest; He is an exceptional gifted, intelligent, naturally attractive and part, thanks fittingly for the part! This movie was created with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, it could be a disaster. Another wonderful aspect about "Dan in Real Life" is that it is a mature comedy that brings out three pillars of a perfect film, "Fetch Pack", for adults interested in it: fools, confident boys, and lazy Joke "Dane in real life" has been wicked and fun, intelligent throughout. Other comedies are based on a comedy or almost entirely based on jokes, seeing the audience laugh, "Donate in real life" is more natural and clever, and involves some thoughts of the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with "the gift of real life" is that the actress has acted very indiscriminately by the rebellious, middle-aged actress, Britain Robertson. It is difficult to say if it was a choice by a personal choice or director on its behalf. In both ways, his character is unreal and annoying. However, this film is just a minor flaw, and does not move away from the whole story. <br /> <br /> To everyone, "Dan in Real Life" is a great movie, a fantastic turn obnoxious and dumbed-down comedy's laziness. Writing quality, direction, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.
