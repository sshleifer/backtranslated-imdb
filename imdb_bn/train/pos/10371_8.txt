This is a very powerful based-on-a-true story film that can be hated. I say how cruelty can be given to people, in which case a innocent Australian couple accused of killing their child. <br /> <br /> When this film was released, Merrill Strip received many recognition for his performance. But I had just as good as Sam took. Let's just say they were both nice but Streep's role was a bit difficult because he had to learn Australian accent. (He learned very well that I understand his part. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
