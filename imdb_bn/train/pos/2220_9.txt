We have forgotten that the master / slave background of the last century is more than the richest estates, operated by a large group of slave slaves, and making huge amounts for white owners. It leads to a group that has been caught in the middle - children are born as a result of interference between slaves and their slave girls. <br /> <br /> Some of these children just became more slaves, and others were free ... but free and colorful, which meant a lot after that, much more than their shire. <br /> <br /> A class developed around this lineage - the color of the free and open people of Jane's de Kullu - and that class was capable, to increase a certain amount of proprietary, property-rich, educated people, and to achieve comparative status. It is said, they were not slaves, but they were still absorbed in a certain amount. <br /> <br /> Often, women are planting white women and rich men, settled in them as mistresses, paid homage to their children in schools, allowances, schools, and a kind of humility, they choose to apply pressure on their families Dependent on dependency for. In fact, they themselves fell down to ensure their prosperity and relative independence from labor - an arrangement called Plesses. <br /> <br /> A beautiful written story about one child of all child origins. The result of such a system with only a negative and positive way with a local lady, and who touched their lives. This story was an eye for me, without a real idea of ​​a new Zealander, black / white line, in the middle, that gray area was the only one where Jane's de Couluir Libara trojana was invented. Characters are very 3D, and are adapted into this adaptation of Anne Rice's novel. Good-throwing part, costume is wonderful, and the brutal way to draw lines, makes it more distinct by the conflicts between the drama with the spoofed area. Jens De Kullu could not marry Sada in Libre, the slaves could not help themselves, and the white, even the sympathetic people who relied on could not face the reality properly. <br /> <br /> I unintentionally recommend this story, novel, and miniseries to everyone. If you can not manage the truth, you will do some part of the crunch and cover, because the colored criminals and their own people have done injustice to others. Remember that this is nothing but reality, and this story is a exploitable way of learning about it. <br /> <br /> I know that it may be lazy word, but these minisers entertained me and pleased me, despite the taste found in the mouth of the yeast, I found it, and I totally enjoyed it. See it If this does not read over time, because it has a lesson to learn from all.
