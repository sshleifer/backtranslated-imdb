In Budapest, Margaret Sullivan (as Clara Novak) gets a job as a gift shop; There, he bickers with colleague James Stewart (as Alfred Cortical). Do not get along both jobs because each one has fallen in love with the invisible pen Paul. Observing Arnest Lubbites inevitably sees these stars directly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Confirmed about sex with them. Morgan, sadly, realized that "he just does not want to be old with me" and supporter characters prevent the film from being old. <br /> <br /> ********* Shop around the corner (1/12/40) Ernst LÃ¼bitz ~ James Stewart, Margaret Sullivan, Frank Morgan, Joseph Shieldcat
