Joan Crowford started his "working girl well" stage with his dynamic "Paid" (1930). He has tried such a role before and is critically influenced. So other actresses wondered why their staff was established (because they hold the "In" thing some years ago, but now they are frustrated) Joan was listening to the public and secured her longevity as an actress. Depression was here and framed upon an endless round of teams of jazz-aged children who were survived. Of course, if you are enriched by immorality, it hurts for it - that's right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image starts with a spectacular house boat party. Bonnie Jordan (Joan Crowford) is the most popular girl there - especially when she recommends that everyone is swimming in their underwear !!! However, when Bonnie's father has a heart attack, Boni and his brother Rodney (William Bekewel) both understand their real friend, because of losing in the stock market. After Bob Townsend (Lester Wael - Johnny Brown, a poor man), offered to do the "right thing" and married him - when he was announced, he spent the night together (he abandoned) that he would love to love - he begins Show some character by deciding to get a job. <br /> <br /> She has found a newspaper job and is quickly influenced by her wishes. His working friend, Bart Screenton (Clif Edwards), and together they are tasked with writing about the internal work of the public. Rodney is also surprised by the fact that he has a job. He was thrilled for him but soon realized that he had mixed with bulletlogging and he was cold-blooded killer, Jake Luva (think of Clark). Rodney goes on a mass shooting witness and piece, the first person she sees in the bar "spilling the beans" - which will be burt. Then he was forced to kill Bart and after that he hid in hiding. In an attempt to find out Burt's killer, the paper drags all the stops and sends Bonnie as a dancer in Jack's clubs. (Joan dances very lively in "Accordian Joe" - much about Sylvie's hatred). The film ends with gunfire and as soon as Rodney dies, Bonnie tears in her story. <br /> <br /> It is a super film by Crowford and Gabelle, who gave them all. Sylvie will share a famous "cigarette scene" with Silvie, the first gabile of this movie was "another woman" stylist, which was in her early 30's. William Bakerell had a huge career (he started as a teenager in the mid-20s Douglas Fairbank's film). His many roles were weak, ruthless characters though. He played a weak brother in this film and was completely shadowed by Joan Crowford and dynamic young Clark Gabelle - perhaps he could never be a star. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
