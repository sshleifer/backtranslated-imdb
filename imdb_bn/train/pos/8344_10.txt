This is my favorite one of all time. It's very simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. I really like a movie full of good quotes and I have it ... My favorite is Albert Einstein, when Ed Walter told "Do you think what you think" and Ed said "What's the oddity of what's happening now?" In my opinion, a movie is fantastic if you can see it repeatedly and enjoy the same amount, and with this one you can !! The way to illustrate Einstein is really Walter M. I think all the characters really fit well together and the story flows nicely. Many times I found the right smile along with the movie and cited my favorite lines! I have no heart at this time and enjoy a feeling-like romantic comedy and then!
