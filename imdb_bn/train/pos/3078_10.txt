Like this show ... Smart acting, smart dialogue, great story with real people .... Please bring it back or make it available online ... really miss it .. hope Davis really shines on this show. I like the idea of ​​Six DEGREES ... it really makes sense in this crazy world. Please salvage yourself from the stupid reality show and give this shot a second chance, please do not bring it back. But please! When it went to the air, I saw it online and I liked how I could see it with intimate obstacles, in fact, online ABC makes it easy to enjoy the shows when you miss the primetime ... until the end. Any time you want to bring it back, I'm ready.
