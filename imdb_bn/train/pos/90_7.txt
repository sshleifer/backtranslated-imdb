Yes, the poster is a terrible act. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was okay ... not really outstanding ... I just hope he will be a hardcore dragon and it will trash completely. Life <br /> <br /> <br /> Ahh, but can not such rich children be now? A rich businessman's son does not have to hold the big stars, and there is a beautiful manicured lawn in front of the Mini Mann. <br /> <br /> No ... The child is very good to trash his life perfectly. . After all, the brand will run a new SV and who will go to school? <br /> <br /> Ah, poor little rich children ... with their wonderful home, their Ivy League school, very clean home and socialist parties ... what would the world do without them? <br /> <br /> I hope they all become addicted to drugs, their lives will end in jail ... so maybe we can see a movie that does not roam around all the poor little boys and girls in the surreal world.
