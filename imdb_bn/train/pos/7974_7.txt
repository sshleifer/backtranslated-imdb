I found this image to be the normal French slap in America's face. Cameras, often, keep an eye on fatty people, rural houses and rural areas. The description seems to be sympathetic and admired to the small dancers presented to the audience, the cinematography exploits them and destroys them. Undoubtedly, the thin people are seen in Glencoe and in a well-organized, well-organized house, but Mallee chose to show the worst to show us. <br /> <br /> I can only hope that some American filmmakers go to France, so that the American people can reveal their worst elements. I can assure you firmly as a Visitor of France, that's all right. Foreign immigrants are not easily prosperous, thus they create serious social inequalities. But America is not interested in unmasking French masks for their bias towards their own patriots in America and for their jealousy in the United States, so we do not expect to see the film in this regard.
