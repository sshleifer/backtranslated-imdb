I approached this film with less prospect but was very pleasantly surprised. It works very well and it hand in Bollywood dance films, especially in "Strictly Ballroom" in recent years. Although the music is beautiful and dancer colorful, do not dance to the movie for me. It is a very Japanese company that offers free time after working for longtime work in male office workers and for those who do not include their families. Here we have people with a flagging loudness for the whole family and big mortgages and life. She is drawn to a young woman attractive image in a dance studio during her journey and this leads her to try to dance ballroom. Japanese is also true that the zealous motives that were introduced to her new passion were made generally but at least it was accepted by family and audience. The outlook of Bollywood dance, as it has been published in the film, is clearly non-western, although discipline and music are explicitly imported to Japan. Cultural contradictions are so playful. Even in addition to cultural insights, color, dance and encouragement of the players all make this a fun film.
