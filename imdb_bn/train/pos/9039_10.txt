I grew up in South West Virginia; I am Homer Hickam of this age (or perhaps one year old), "Rocket Age" author, this book builds the basis for the heart-warming film. <br /> <br /> And so I was closely related to West Virginia coal mine theme, and At that time (October 4, 1957) Sputnik had stunning effects on all of us. Rocket boys went to great life for themselves. I went to get my degree in physics and computer engineering. Because Spartan awakened several young people to "Science Gap", who was in the United States on the cold war in the United States ... <br /> <br /> This is an excellent film for all ages. But when grown in West Virginia in the late 1950s, it will touch the core of your life. <br /> <br /> Everyone: Get it; See it; Suggest to your friends ... who will thank you many times.
