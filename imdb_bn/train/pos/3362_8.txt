'Una Georanata Particular' is a movie which is a title that seems so familiar, I thought I saw it once. Now finally I saw it, I'm very happy. It is one of the best Italian movies in Marcelo Mastrianini's most amazing performance. It's one of the best artists from 'La Dolce Vita' and '8 1/2' from Federico Fellini. It is also managed by Scola, a film that takes character while identifying characters and gradually develops a story on a particular day, on that day Adolf Hitler visited Rome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Marcelo Castrinini plays Antonioit (Sofia Lorraine) in his neighbor Gabrielle. He is a member of Mussolini's Party, he is very playful in his thinking, and he is no longer a member. That's because I will not be released. On that day every man in his house caring for Hitler with his husband and son, they are still in this building. Antenatal bird escapes and flies to Gabriel's apartment, and thus the two meet. Just before Anthony goes to Gabriel, he thinks of killing himself, because it will not be revealed again. I will not publish the story how it develops from here, but in these two special days it creates a special day that Hitler is not in Rome. <br /> <br /> I said, a fascinating performance of the mastrians. You see that he is a man who wanted someone around him, although we do not know why first. Maybe he likes Antonio, maybe he loves him, maybe there may be other reasons. What we think Antonio What do these people want from him? He took any note however. We see how people look her hair attractive for her. Loren plays a very good scene as well. We understand his question, although we can not confirm his motives. Moments where we find their secret secret, if you can call it but this is a great moment. How the story is developed is even more interesting, but I do not want to waste it for you. This is a movie you will see. Great performance and a beautiful cinematography, and the message we give is still standing today.
