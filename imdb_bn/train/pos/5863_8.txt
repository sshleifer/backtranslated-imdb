"Jackinf" was still irrelevant even after 15 years of the war in Vietnam. This is one of the few who try to deal with the second sad aspect of the war: time later. Unlike "taxi drivers" or "ramboos" movies, which are used to present their main characters in a bad environment after the war environment, this movie allows viewers to face different views in Vietnam vets. Their development was very precise before and especially after the war. The problems are obvious, but in this sad situation, there is always hope in the relationship between love and friendship. "Jackief" may sometimes be the ultimate vietnam movie, but after about 15 years it's really commendable and it's justified. Moreover, it can convince us that the war has not ended yet; At least some of us <br /> <br /> Three main characters are amazing. De Niro has done one of his best works, but Ed Harris is the star of this movie. Most likely, this was his best performance ever.
