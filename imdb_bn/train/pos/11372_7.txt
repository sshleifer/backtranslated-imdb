"Citizen X" "The story of Roostervo's Butcher", the nickname of a shocking and contrary Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. This film focuses on the new detective intelligence (rays), who, in spontaneous and favorable denials, face a non-cooperative bureaucracy and followed the killer against all animosity. An HBO product for TV, the film provides a solid cast, provides better performance, gives much detail to the viewer, but similar to the Hollywood movies like Stylistics, similar to the documentary rentals. An even and straight-forward drama of a more serious and relatively less familiar story than "Jack the Ripper" (B)
