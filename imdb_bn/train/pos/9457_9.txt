How can you just add to the feeling of this film and the right and just touch ?? Every week I went to the DVD store for a shelf for myself - I saw Steve Carroll in several films before, I did not want to clear his thought process - so I resisted and prevented me finally 'catch it with hell!' Attitude! And I wonder how wonderful! I just wish I had purchased it before. Three times in two days, I have still shown a fight with three girls who are still happy, who are absent from pardoning their beloved wife. The deep and interesting (I say sir?) Way, gives a completely different light on life, which makes him realize that what he is looking for is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Seeing "Dan", which depicts Dane with a ridiculously and embarrassing picture, his family and his brother enjoying joy and happiness. You just started to feel for him. <br /> <br /> Then when the blind date comes with Ruthie Dropper - the main point of Marie Dan's estimated measure !! When he repeated his comment, he saw him, did not like bread - Green Eyed Monster! Trigering an absolutely ridiculous view as two couples compete on the dance floor! Dan starts to hesitate with Marie, this sequence is best made. <br /> <br /> Other stereo scenes - Returns from Dan Book and Tackle Shop, faced by his brothers, to describe exactly what happened .... When Dan's face stops breathing Do it. <br /> <br /> Her little girl Lily is celebrating her love for her current wife, Suzanne. A little hearty warmth and donation as Dan Danie realized that he had lost his life. <br /> <br /> When the dancer guitars and singing talent show ... his song is shaking slightly like a reprint of the song. ... the ultimate gem! <br /> <br /> The acceptance of what happened in the late film by his daughters ... They all love their father and want to see him happy; he does not allow her to deny her love for Mary; Dan's frustration fails to fail his daughters because they say their rock, their castle ... and more than that with few words. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now it will leave - maybe will come back and post more comments in the near future .... but I'm not saying .... <br /> <br /> .... If you want to see a movie, it's such a great, comedy drama that makes light of the film, which does not appear to be forced or rare, which comes as a real picture of a person in a new life discovery - only with a woman Not even with her house, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Performs by ensemble cast. I can not wait to watch this watch again !!
