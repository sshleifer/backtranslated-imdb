I enjoyed Longstreet, following the steps of Raymond Burr's successful Irananside TV series and it was intended to compete. But this event was canceled after one season because it was decided - I mistakenly believe - Longstreet will not compete with Mr. Boond's Iranaside. <br /> <br /> I can add a pilot for this event. Especially good work and very memorable. I hope a box set of longstrights will be displayed. The authors should remember that the concept of this story is only briefly searched here and there should be more and should be done to show the game and the interplay of the disabled on TV.
