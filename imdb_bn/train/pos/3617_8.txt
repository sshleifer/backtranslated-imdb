In "Girlfight" a school in New York's high school school, amateur boxing follows a sense of absoluteness in the world, where she finds herself self-respect, purpose and much more. Although the film is not about boxing, boxing is all about movies. So you can smell sweat around. Technically and artistic about it a good shoot about honesty and reality, "Girlfight" no chick flick and no "rocky". It's rather a very human drama, which even the spectators who do not know boxing can be able to connect with it.
