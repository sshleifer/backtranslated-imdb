I watched this movie after watching the practical magic, and the old movie was a lot uphill. I like the way to change the light, makeup and costume changes in the Guilinan story. Jimmy Stewart's behavior has not done much for me in this movie, but I think he has highlighted the character of Guilin's character. I was also hit by the behavior of Nicky and Gilillan - the director wanted to show him spirits and wanted to show Jillian a monthly. At the time of showing the red light, Nikki's gesture hit me especially. I did not think warlocks were ever as effeminate, so it was an interesting way to contrast those letters.
