I saw this photo at the Toronto International Film Festival. Aside from attaining a genuine qualification for the 2006 World Cup, Offsaid works wildly as a comedy and a tragedy. This picture follows the fate of a group of young people who are trying to run football in Tehran's Azadi stadium. Islamic religious leaders of the country have decided that women can not sit with men in sports competition, so that they can face curse and morally suspicious behavior. It could not stop the young female fans of the country, who used to trick them using different techniques. But the watchman keeps a watch on a small group that has been caught and is being closely detained near this operation. They allow indifferent soldiers to watch them or at least watch them for matches. The soldiers told them that they did not try to enter in, they might have seen playing at home on TV. The game goes on till the game continues, so that the real time is delayed. <br /> <br /> Here is a very interesting section where a young soldier takes a girl with rest. Since no female is in the restroom at the stadium, so she needs to be cleaned outside the house before entering a man's house. Plus, she keeps her face so that no one can see that she is a woman. It is used as a mask with a mask of Iranian football star Ali Deeway, causing the loss of eye drops. <br /> <br /> You really understand that the soldiers have become disturbed by the ban and only their orders are so fast that their compulsory military service ends. A soldier complains that he should stay on vacation so that he can take care of his family's cow in the village. Little, girls and soldiers talk to each other, and many small acts of kindness towards both sides show that these are really good people who are living in terrible conditions. However, the soldiers' constant reminds that "the chief" lends danger to his way, because we do not know what kind of women will face. <br /> <br /> Most of the Iranian films, which are known for their strong visuals, are not impressed with an authentic style of offside. In fact, the image was created on June 5, 2005, during the actual qualification against Bahrain. In many ways the "plot" was determined by the result of the patch. They will qualify if they win Iran's match. If they lost, they did not. As the World Cup has arrived and gone, I do not think that Iran does not seem to win this match. At the end of the film, the celebration scene is real and spontaneous, which makes the film true. To see how sensitive it was to the Iranian people <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> March 25, just a few weeks ago. The police were sentenced to death after they spread the crowd to guide the public on a specific path. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . Iran is a nation of youth, and in the political field, it is only a matter of time before their elders take place. These films show the proud attitude of the Iranian people in spite of their current problems and I sincerely hope that there is a bright future for them.
