Dominion Tank Police is an exercise making contradictory film. Throughout 4 parts the story mixes stupid actions, snap-stick humor, humanity, and mixes with excited philosophical questions. It was difficult to believe that there was only one manager to change the style of episode from the episode. For anyone who likes anime, certainly watch a movie.
