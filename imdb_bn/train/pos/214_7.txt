An old Vaudville team of Willie Clark (Walter Matthews) and Al Lewis (George Burns) were best known but they hated each other. After more than 20 years, they agreed together for a TV special ... but they still find each other's hate. Willie's nephew / agent (Richard Benjamin) tries to work together. <br /> <br /> A big hit on his day and George Burns won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. I liked it (some). It wrote blue simulation so that its non stop single-liners. It was some fun but Willy and Al's secrecy was not making fun. I do not like dads I never thought he was a good actor and some wrong way about him surrounded me. Also his character here is so sick that you get sick so quickly All that was fun aside. Barnes was easily ticking off one-liners and even matthau was good to match with her. Their verbal battle movies are the best sequence. Benjamin, along with Willie's nephews, is very good at trying to work with each other. For me it's valuable for Barnes alone. This jump started his career very much and after two years he got another hit with "Oh God". So, this is good. Just good - not great. The character of Matthur really makes this difficult love. I give it a 7.
