There are not many reviews, so I thought I would add one. <br /> <br /> Take another review! This is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Considering what was good. <br /> <br /> I thought I thought Khaki and I thought Khakki was a very good movie. <br /> <br /> A fairly long movie, but of course valuable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The role played really well in the movie and in the same sequence in the future you can do.
