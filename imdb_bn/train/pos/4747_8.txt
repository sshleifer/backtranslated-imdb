This movie has never been seen by anyone who did not see anything like The Matrix's war scenes. Action Scenes The events of the war of psychopath Yuan Wing Ping were dancers, who also fights in The Matrix. And the war scene is somethin. <br /> <br /> Lee is a supersoldier who feels no pain, who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian (did not get me). Other bad superlarisers started killing local drug officials for a drug drug business, Lee took his policeman along with him to help stop them. <br /> <br /> This film is going on in some incredible things (one gets Badguy gets lopped with a panel of his hand glass and less notice). The battle scenes are filled with flying kicks and pancakes; There are ways to calculate the body. Lee has rarely been good, and she surrounds herself with a woman of beautiful women casters (Epe, some serious ass like her colleague supercomputer). Anthony Wang also creates a camio as a drug maker (there is no encouragement there; he has made a Camio in every HK movie). It is unfortunate that they do not produce action films like the United States; I can not sit in such a terrific dubbing work that I want so much. Recommended.
