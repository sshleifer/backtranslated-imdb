Thanks to Jimmy Magnen for making Disney's best 2 cartons This show has been a lot of improvement over the years. As a kid, I did not like it, because I thought it was the rip off of the Doclesex, which was then my favorite Disney thing (eg, Grandmophromero). After then it was good but not great. But after reading the reviews here, I decided to give it another opportunity and bought a DVD set and saw the first pilot the first day, and I was very surprised. It's still my favorite episode, although the series was live on it. And at the end of disk 1, I knew it was going to be a top tender. <br /> <br /> The letters are so complex and charming. My favorite is to be Wildcat. She is absolutely sunny and the boot is sweet. My next favorite is Balu, the best pilot show. I can see why Ol 'Jimman created the show around him. Then it's Kit CloudCoicator. He and Balu did the best relationship of the series. Then, Louie. Jim Cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice. After that Rebecca He laughs me hard, and I believe he and Balu eventually get married. And finally (for the heroes), Molly. Although he is my least favorite, I still like him. I think he is a very intelligent character (much better than robbery from Webb). And villains were very original. Don Karnaz and his air pirates always crack me down, ice cold and ruthless, and Thimberians are always at least ridiculous. As mentioned earlier, stories are fun (Time Wets for No Bear, Roaming of Red Chip), there is nothing short of touch (The Old Man and Saddock, Paradise Lost), Funny, Fun and Exciting Events (Old Blunders My favorite for searching and balancing stuff). This is just a few of my favorite episodes. However, this is some of the reasons behind Teespin Disney's best, gamy beer? My favorite character of GB (Cubbi) was a decent amount, while TS was not enough wildcat. But in the end Talespin remains a classic. BOTTOM LINE- 10/10 at 6th best cartoon ever
