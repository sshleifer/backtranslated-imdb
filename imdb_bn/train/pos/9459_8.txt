I see some romantic comedy with some hesitation, for the incentive of a movie which is the old clich√©s of the romantic comedy feature age. Usually there is a romantic comedy, a girl and a guy, both fall into love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles of marriage or whatever. However, this movie is a different story, I have seen very different from romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> There is a widow (donation), there is a girl (Marie). Danny met with Marie in a bookstore and talked for a while, after some time Marie left. Dan develops something for her, and when this starts to turn meaningful, we get a wrapping. Marie is her brother's girlfriend. Strangers with the situation, flirts with Dan Marie and realize that she loves him, even Mary loves him, but their love will not be possible only. It is possible how far the story is left. <br /> <br /> Steve Carroll played well, Juliet bilicely Marie as well. And each other thing is well done. This is a good movie, see it.
