I like top songs. It held my interest. Predictive plot, modest character development and story lines It is as beautiful as Hi Nun that people in the city become weak and afraid to stand near villains. This movie has some quality actors who have not had the chance to share all their talents. Also some actors do not credit for their role. Denver Pyle was a good man in his short days. John Dahner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their role. Sterling Hyden did poor stuff with that he did well. It's hard to imagine him as a gunman. Laura, played by Karen Booth, was an annoying character. Two men seemed to be fighting on him. Disgust Finally, how can people travel without baggage? Especially women
