Vivah is by no classic. However, on hardcore work days, the stone-breaking special effects and complex plots (no Bollywood has achieved skills yet), it is quite satisfying to see a simple film like Vivah. We all know that the story is a journey from a couple's first meeting of some of their moments and their last marriage after the examination. Not too much Music is not quite the same in the same league as the MPK or HAHK but your sense is Jars. The two songs were standing for me - Muze Haque Haya and Ajan. Milan Abi Adha and Hamari Shadi Hamble were there. Shaheed performs sincerely and shows many possibilities. He likes to play something else, but he usually does "cold dad". Amrita is very sweet and plays a role in the fulfillment of girls in a small town. Alak Nath, Anupam Kher and Saima Biswas are great supporters and the rest customs work reasonably well. Directing the sun is simple but effective. The main flaw in the film is the slow motion which can test the patience of many young visitors. But all in all a good, clean, decent family cinema.
