Dick Tracy was not the best for many comic book fans, because they wanted something with blood like Batman. Dick Tracy shows the integrity of a comic book with Villains, which has serious appearance disorders and is fun. Warren Betty commands the main character and they committed crimes without using super power. Due to the red color, blue, orange, yellow, green and black comic atmosphere, I liked Dick Tracy. It is the perfect film for anyone to see with their children. Like Jack Nicholson of Al Pacino Batman and playing Big Boy Caprice with seniority. Madonna does not play the same son toys representing her as the second celebrity in this film. As I said, no blood, indecency, sexual innocence or other insults.
