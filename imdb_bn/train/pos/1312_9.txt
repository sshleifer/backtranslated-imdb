Joy Column This one shiny, this was a fantastic movie. The performance performance was great and the script was equally cool. <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt Riverside was fantastic like police officer Gina Pulasky. Gina was a complex character. He was a ROCKI police member with Riverside Police Department. He took dangerous things to go in disguise to catch fellow murderers, when he ended up in a relationship with a colleague that he knew that there were wives and children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was stoic as an officer, but he felt his feelings and There was quite a contradiction when came to deal with his extra marital affair. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Excellent job as quiet, gentle, underachieving sociopath. Under patronage, he was innocent, but lying on the surface lied to a cold-hearted killer. Weber took the personality of a child-aged adult like hungry thirsty to kill really small boys. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was spectacular. Let us know more about each scene, each verbal exchange letter. The 90-minute movie does not have an event event for more than a week, the production team did a great job with the condoming days. This movie was a good example of a lot of work with little.
