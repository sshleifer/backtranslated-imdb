Horn omnibus films were popular in seventeen. I do not love them too much myself, but this is a perfect piece of British horror movie. House that dried blood is a terrible Omnibus, of which there are four stories that surround a strange old house in the country and called the Scotland Yard Officer by an estate agent. <br /> <br /> The title of this movie is well known to three horror movies; Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, whose horror fans will be known as Lee's co-stars in the greatest British movie ever; Wiker man <br /> <br /> The first segment of the film tells the story of a horror story by the title "Method for Murderer"; A stranger named "Dominic" was brought to life by his own imagination. This story creates a very good mystery; His girlfriend, he and the audience are convinced that what he sees is an image of his imagination. This story is not very original, but it creates it for the lack of basicity through the atmosphere and it is the final packing; Which works incredibly well and comes as a real surprise. <br /> <br /> The second story, the title "Wexworks", Peter Cushing and four of my favorite favorites. This story follows the story of Philip Grieson (Kushing) who discovered a wax museum and decided to enter. Inside, he invented a woman known to him and we later know that it is a superstition. It is not really explained how to interpret the relation of women with Philip, but the story relies on the mystery of creating mysteries rather than the plot. After Kushing, his friend Neville Rogers (played by Jose Ackland) joined him and this story really started to start. A candle museum full of murderers for a horror movie is not a new concept; The same setting was used to make a great impact on the 1966 horror film "threatened chamber". Although not one of the movies mentioned here, the power of the setting is not used for any terrible effect, which is achieved by the feeling of most clustrophobia, which is a limited area museum. Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch, and a treat for the awful fan to avoid seeing him see a handy wielding rook. Despite my least favorite, this story is still entertaining and interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This story highlights the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly excessively insecure father. The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played. It gives viewers the guesses; We know there is something wrong with the father or daughter, but we do not know who, or what, this is it. Christopher Lee, naturally, portrays his character with a great degree; The audience is limited to his work about dolling his doll, and this is not allowed to keep him or her in school. The right to buy is kept near the chest until the end, with the actual cool line, Lee is recorded, where Lee tells his father that he really fears his daughter. This section has been played nicely in the end, in my opinion it will be with you in the best end of any horror story and after a last credit roll. <br /> <br /> Omnibus ends with "Clock", which is certainly the most ridiculous of four. This story is about Hammi's horror film star, who disagreed with technical issues of his latest film, went out and bought himself a cloke. Naturally, this cloak turns to be a real vampire cloak. Contrary to the other three stories, this one seems mostly to be played for laugh. This is not a bad thing, although most of the humor is funny and it works well for the rest of the film. The ending of this story is nicely matched by the end of the film's raparound, which is a very good but ridiculous ending of a very good movie. Also, see for a little bit about Dracula's Christopher Lee. A nice touch, I think. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a terrific omnibus, you can not really make the mistake with blood holding that Dripped Blood. The only third story makes your movie eligible for the movie and it's really a very tough horror movie.
