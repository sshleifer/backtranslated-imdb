I saw that when I was young and it was nice. Kelly White, like Lisa and Messi Maisas, is beautiful. Susan Sodom as Doodle and Sandra De Heideck as Snoodle of Humanias. Karen Boettcher-Tate as professor was interesting. Burl Ross was fun as Little Bunny Foo Foo. Gregory Donovan as Casio was brilliant. Snowy and doodle eat too much candy Hilaryarius Little Bunny Foo Foo that Meecy Mices bops on the head by a sprite that sorrow will give some wishes to Little Bunny Foo Foo then she turns into Goon. This story is only when Lisa, Saddle, Doodle Big Rock goes to Candy Mountain. This show will be great for kids to watch this show, new words, songs, and playing them.
