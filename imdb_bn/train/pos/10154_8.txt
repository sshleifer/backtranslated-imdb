This is the first time I saw the movie Michael Verton - I did not see Alias ​​- and I was interested in seeing if the man could work. He is sure that this film is a choice and choice. Natasha Henridge is certainly fantastic but she usually plays more physical and action role, so I found her schoolgirl a very good and lovable role in these different "sweet" roles. The negative comments I read are true, the movie is full of clichés and the story is not true. Every character in the film comments how well they look, I do not think there are screen chemistry in them. However, I enjoyed this movie. Locals are beautiful, characters are preferred and lovely and helpful actors are quite good. If you look forward to seeing a great romance, it's not. But if you want to watch the movie as a favorite, it is very good.
