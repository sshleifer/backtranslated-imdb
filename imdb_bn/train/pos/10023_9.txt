After watching Villarangar's many films, he had a very clear opinion about me - he paid very much attention to the character's personal views, forgot about the rhythm of the film. That is why, despite his being a good critic, his films did not attract the attention of the wider audience. He followed the same line in the ARO, but in the end at the end of the film really improved. Frankly, I go to sleep in the first part, because the first part gives the necessary information, but it is really slow. Yet the second part is absolutely incredible and Villarangar makes the whole movie the best movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
