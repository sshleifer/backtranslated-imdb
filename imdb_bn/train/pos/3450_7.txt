I could never hear this movie until I thought the DVD was a little suspicious, in the past there are so many films that are good enough to do bad scripts to a movie and in some cases it does not seem to <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> There is no reason to not release this image in theaters, it is good. Most of the story in this series may seem forcibly for a while, but there is also a good amount of reality that enables the carrying speed. I am surprised by the fact that Justin Timberlake has done so much good work here, he still is not an Oscar material, but he will learn about each role and he has many promises for the future here. Dylan McDermott was surprisingly good at his unexpectedly nasty role and definitely the cream of this film crop. <br /> <br /> Finally, it just goes. You will not be disappointed, you will not get bored, in fact, I think you will be happy with the end result.
