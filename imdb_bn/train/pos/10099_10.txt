Anime who wants me to animate ... <br /> <br /> Set in 2010 (Hey, not too far!) The world is now poisonous gas waste of pollution and violence. Seeing how crime takes place within 30 seconds, committed by the thieves who possessed firefighters of thirty world terrorists, the deliberate New Port City Government constitutes the Tank Police to tackle this problem - the police with the tank! Hello insane! <br /> <br /> The newly recruited "heroes" of this series, Leona Ozaki, a red-haired Japanese woman (yes I know, Japanese characters do not match them with Japanese characters explicitly). Just been drafted into the tank police and fast blonde, blue eyes are well-stocked with the good al person. New to the use of the Leona Tank and, unfortunately, the Tank Police Commander, Charles Britain's favorite tank (also known as "Brenten"), a big man like StellaRoad, a big man like Tom Seleck, and a pair of Nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a sports favorite tank. A bad mood. Leona joins the tank police in the first place, and Britain does not like her because of breaking her Tiger Special (a giant green giant tank), or she does not like to take the remnants of her giant tank. And it uses it to create a mini tank which he nicknamed Bonaparte and he is now pressurizing him to move to child welfare, where "boys are more of your size". Also, for fear of bizarre talent, biblical quote / chapline, God is purple, M. Howard, and Pot Bold Chief, who is always screaming about the tank police antics to thank Mayor for the mayor. While chasing bad police, tank police often destroys half the city and using extreme violence to catch them, they do not like people very well. <br /> <br /> "Villain" has got a mysterious past called Cyberbank Buku associated with a project known as "Green Piece", his gang and two sexy cat Cyborg Sidekix brought Anna and he puma. In the first health these boys are being paid to steal urine samples of the hospital through the treatment of toxic gas clouds and secondly they are hired to steal a painting of nude Buaku. However, the story was enamy incomplete and it was finished in a bird comic ("monga") book which was very difficult to find. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This black hilarious initiative created all kinds of chaos. Examine how far people want to go to the police to catch offenders and test what will happen when the fine lines between good boys and bad boys slow down. This is one of the things that you are about to make a movie of, but you will get Quentin Tarantino better. Uncomfortable in place but still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> "Follow the new Dominion: Tank Police".
