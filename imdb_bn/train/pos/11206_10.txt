I did not see this movie! At least not in its totality. I've seen some hunting clips which I gagged to see it all. One order is my memory today in my memory. A (very strong looking) spacecraft is rotating in the moon's darkness. The pilot released a flash device for its hidden surface photo below. Flashing in the visibility of the moon. . . . And it's for a few seconds. Parallel lines, squares, it can be .. Then the light fades and the short glimse ... what's gone ... and the time to return to the spaceship world. Wonderful. I've seen some other clips but I want to get a full movie.
