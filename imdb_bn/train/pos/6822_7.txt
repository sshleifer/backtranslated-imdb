The "Opening Night", released in 1977, tried to produce an aspirant. It has only succeeded in the amazing performance of the Gena Rowland. Theater actress Murtle is not necessarily her character, we must love in real life. He is self-absorbed, often objectionable, and makes life sad for the people around him - in other words, not against actresses! A woman at the end of Martel's fall - we are sure that the giant war that she is fighting is not real or imaginative, even though we secretly went in secret. Rowlland is clearly directed by the love of his gifted husband, actor / director John Cassettes, who also plays a role in the film. This image is not faulty - it's too long, and when drunk is drunk, the last part of the film seems almost cruel. "Reform" in some dialogue - at least when gradually - it went very long. Some of the supporting supporters played well, especially from Ben Gajra, playing Martel's sleazy producer. The character of Joan Blondel has never been fully developed and I have never been able to illustrate why he was in the film, to exclude Marantle. Watch this movie for Roland Lynn alone - she's fascinated throughout her life - and it's hard to close your eyes, though you sometimes want to do this.
