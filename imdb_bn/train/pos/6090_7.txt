Jealous is not funny that I think it will be primarily, but after reading some reviews I found it to be more fun than it is for the person, it is not true now that it is not a minute movie like a jungle or dowager, but Ben Steer And Jack Black's work is much better with each other and is much older than the Crissover Walken, so the story is about the character of Jack Black The spray that invented the dog, which makes the puppy feel invisible, does not want any part of it bothered, but when the product is created by Jack Black-rich Ben Stei starts watching the envy, it is not great in all ways, and both Ben Steer and Jack Black are under their belt. There are fun and good movies, but if you have a fan but it still suggests it as a fun flash and I'm pretty Yekabara my ass off, because a big fan of Ben stickers ID'm not saying this is a low-sterer but still great fun, give it a watch
