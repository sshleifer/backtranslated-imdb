I think this movie is very funny and awful. I love Elvira and I like this movie. It is unfortunate that the second part of this wonderful movie has not been successful, because it is interesting as the first episode. I'm also sorry that alongside this movie I did not see Cassandra Peterson in another movie. I think she is a wonderful actress .... I hope the third part of Elvira's event will see him in the future. Cassandra Petersen is one of my favorite comedy actresses. Cassandra, if you read this, know that you are the best and my heart will be with you. You can trust me. Can I add more? This cool and classical movie!
