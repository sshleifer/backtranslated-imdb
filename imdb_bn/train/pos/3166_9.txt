This show has come so far. The first actors from Eric to Fijze see everyone new actors and actresses, new faces, and what they did. They stuck with the show and it was a success. This is one of the best shows of all time and it is probably the most fun of my life. It will be sad if it ends, but if they finish the show, I hope that the series ends with any big bang in the end of the series in any season. If all the fuel is stored for the final episode in the entire season, then I am not concerned about it. Jump down, get a last punch. The show claims that fans deserve it, if they go, all of the friends will end, just like friends, and let the final be huge. I told Donna and Eric to marry, I fought with Hayd and Kelsco and have become friends again, I'm saying something between Fez and Jackie has been interesting because Phase has been trying for so long, but certainly does not work for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Eric, Kelso, Donna, Jackie, Phase, Hayd, I'm your friend As saying. Best of you <br /> <br /> 10/10 ...
