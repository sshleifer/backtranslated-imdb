<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some scenes hold the edge of my seat while others came back to horror, and after the sad end, I was drowned in my own tears. <br /> <br /> The picture had a deep impact on me. This frustrating violent scenery is fiercely opposite to the cruel and flexible 'love' scene. The movie makes the rating of the cat third (nudity) worthless; There is no nude scene, and even 'kiss' is not involved in 'love' scenes. <br /> <br /> Message presented to me this picture? All people, they may feel violent or cruel, have a flexible side. Edison Chan is a great act of acting in the famous Pang. <br /> <br /> I rate this image at 10/10. It's a watch clock.
