"How to lose friends and isolated people" is not based on the betrayal of Tiger Woods. It's a mid-romantic comedy based on Toby Young's book on her experience as a celebrity journalist. Filmmaker Simon Peg as a British journalist in Sydney's famous celebrity magazine, Sydney Young The young is troubled to catch all kinds of isolated shenanigans around him, so the movie title. She is violent, brave, and moronic. But for some very strange reason, he is a little appreciated. Sydney played a commendable role with a fellow journalist, musician Alison Olsen's friend, Carsten Donst. However, Sydney has primarily acted for the sex actress Sophie Mace, who has played the superb Miss Megan Fox. This foxtrot acting efficiency is short but the "eye candy" material is high. With the magazine, the journalists get all kinds of tombflowers in Sidney to move the stairs. The top comedic moment of this photo. However, I think director Robert Weid and screenwriter Peter Straugan can defeat some viewers and can break the authoritative rom-less element by creating an impossible romantic plot line between Sydney and Allison; Although Team Weatherworthy had otherwise formulated an entertainment story. Pig has not peg his figure down with his colorful performance as Sidney Young. Jeff Bridges again created the "The Dude" bridge, which included its mysterious support to client harding, Magazine's Sueve prez. But the rest of the film was not enough here. "How to lose friends and isolated people" should not be completely isolated, but if you publish it as a great romantic comedy you can lose some movie friends. *** average
