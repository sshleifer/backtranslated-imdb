Most of the movies about New Orleans, or set up, are ridiculously bad and are laughably incorrect (check: "Savage Bee" Remember? But I'll make an exception for "Titrop" which seems almost right). <br /> <br /> Here's one that does not necessarily make a mistake. The pronunciation is not too bad (yes, the pronunciation "yat" here is more like a brooklyn than the south), it was shown in the city of 1950 without compulsory "tourist" shots, and they did not try to make a well-known drama "quirky southerner" Do it. <br /> <br /> One of the few pictures of justice in this city, and a good movie to boot ..
