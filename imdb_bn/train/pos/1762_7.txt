Okay, here's the deal: If you're easily offended, you might want to stay away, far from it. There are some painful moments in the movie, but I probably laughed as much as I laughed. Indeed, I probably blushed more than I laughed. And if I was not blushing out literally, I was blushing inside inside. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you but you do not have any shame. Whether it is badge of honor or not, in view of the audience <br /> <br /> I would not be disappointed that I smiled a bit, but this is because of the fact that I can not recommend blanket alone. If I say, "Check out this movie, ridiculous!" And in some sweet, small church moving ladies, the head will be on the theater and graphically will face heart disease during a clear sexual orientation, so do not need my conscience. <br /> <br /> How is it so messy? Hmm, try 100 times worse than marriage crushers. Really tell me. My mom went outside during the first scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both freaks and geeks and undeclared. I'm all for Michael McDonald's fun; Kony Rogers has enough levels to give a run for his money whose hair and beard are quite white. Paul Rud announces, "If I listen to Ya Mo, then I will burn this place once more," It's ridiculous, but it's a thing that most of the viewers will not be grateful. <br /> And when we see fast 3-second flashbacks of Steve Carroll, I've played with Camio's words, I smiled for two minutes after joking, but most of them shy and then forgot. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully enough, despite the round, there is a pretty morality for the story. The film does not refer to Karleel losing some curiosity because he is a virgin. She is really portrayed as a likable, pretty character. Of course, he's a little weird. Finally, he created an Asia poster, "more video games than an Asian kids" and a million dollar manus BOSS, which collects a toy, but we never believe that he is actually a virgin. It seems strange, there is a bit of "OK to wait". <br /> <br /> But people, o people, please be careful that this is as much as possible to her. That was certainly the intention of Apatow. According to him, he only gave some people (especially Rozen and Malko) the impression and are talking about the normal way, trying to find new ways to destroy all. If you can manage it or talk to yourself, you will love the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not too big fan of superstition and sexual jokes. I find that a fine, laughable f-word or fratboy sex toy is far more entertaining than about 200 usage. But that's me As I said, there is a violent moment here, but if you are sitting in a strange movie that you want to see in the theater then ask yourself. I do not know how most women will be interested in what men are discussing during playing poker. Sincere ladies, you may not want to know. If you are ever interested in why some girls think that boys are fairly good, it gives you a good idea. <br /> <br /> You go there - take my humble, honest, what you should expect. That would be your guide. It is of course not to see your Sunday school class, mother, grandmother, opposite sex, children of any age, or anyone who is easily offended by superstition or explicit sex talk, should not be meeting with his family. If you see it in any of the above, you have no idea to be clearly uncomfortable.
