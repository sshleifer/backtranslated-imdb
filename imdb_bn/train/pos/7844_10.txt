I really love this show, it's like reading a book and you each leaves each section missing. What is going to happen in the next episode and you think about trying to maintain their friendship throughout the year. After the end of each episode it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth which states: One-shot was good, you can not wait for the next episode, and it really thinks about what will happen to you for twenty years with friends. And two - this event has been "interrupted" and we will not finish the program as a whole. Fox clearly did not know what they did, they claimed that they had lost sight of the 18-49 division, clearly they did not know whether "reconciliation" was released from such a good show. I have a question though I want to raise. If they bring shoe and it goes to other seasons, how will it work within a year of each episode and based on what the story is about in the twentieth year? Your answers are most welcome. Restore the reunion! Restore the reunion!
