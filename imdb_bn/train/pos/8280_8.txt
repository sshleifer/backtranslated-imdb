George and Kim are taking their little boy Miles to a remote cabin in New York when their car hits a deer and jumps into a patch. But it seems that the unfortunate event only marks the beginning of a terrible journey, where reality is real and a meat-eating soul, half of the creatures and half of the people, Wideuogo, hunt a small town ... Larry Feydenden's "OneDogo" is a horror film that often tends to tender Turns into a small family drama. Acting is fantastic, letters are well-developed and some bone-biting moments. Wendigo's delicate impressive operators are effectively operated and it is never true and it does not seem to be imaginative, even if the story is not fully played on Miles's head. The overall "Wendigo" my first acquaintance with Larry Facenden's work and will certainly not end. Give this movie a chance, if you do not see anything unusual in 10.
