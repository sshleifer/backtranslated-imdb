"Bell Book and Candle" has been shown on the cable recently. We did not see it for a while, we decided to give another look in this comedy. Based on James van Duttenen's Broadway hit, which was for a vehicle in the first fifty years of Rex Harrison and Lily Palmer, the film adapted to Daniel Tardes's screen. The film was directed by Richard Quinn, who turned this delight into a comical comedy. <br /> <br /> Clearly, some comments presented by IMDB are being judged, big problems seem to be associated with two large pairs, who assisted on "Vertigo", released in the same year. While the film was released, the movie's viewers did not feel anything about the age difference. In fact, most of the older men of that age were always involved with many young women. <br /> <br /> The film is a fun comedy set in Manhattan's Christmas time which excited the audience. Kim Novak was at the height of his beauty, because of the camera he did not play, his camera was unclear. As the man that dances, his Gillian charming. The publisher, Shape Henderson, is seen by acting stalwart James Stewart at his best times. Mr. Stewart is an excellent comedy actor who was at the top of why he was at the top. Actor Alsa Lancaster, playing Quinnie, is a welcome addition to any film, because she has proved to be here. Gillian's brother Jack Lemon's Nicky Hollywood is also good. Arinnie Kovacs were also seen as the author's Sydney Raid. <br /> <br /> This is a great way to spend the winter nights while watching this ball chest and candle.
