What is so forbidden about love ?! People seem to have big problems with transgenered. <br /> <br /> This movie title does not catch my eyes. It was a 4-minute stained shot in the movie that stopped me from surfing the channel. I can not believe how freaking this film is amazing. It touches on many levels of human emotion that it sometimes fails to move me in any way. It's one of the best independent films I've ever seen. I do not see these characters as both sexes, just humans. I would recommend it to those who love movies. Especially independent films. All the fearless filmmakers praise!
