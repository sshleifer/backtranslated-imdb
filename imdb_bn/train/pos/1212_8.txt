Care Bear Movie 2: A new generation is not a bad movie. Actually, I like it very much. Yes I accept the conversation freak and the story has been called in a little worse time. But the darkhard is very dark when it is very dark enough to move Vielen, and Huddle does some amazing work. The voice does not say acting, it was great, whatever it is, nothing wrong. Animation was colorful, and especially in the beginning some of the visuals were exciting. Songs and scores are lovely, especially growing up and always young, secondly there has always been my personal favorite two. Carry care, I like, adorable, and human child is doing very well. And the end is a real tearjerker. All in all, ruthless kiddie fun 8/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
