Before leaving it, I dropped the subject, but this is not the average win over your catastrophe story. Although technically it is technically necessary to mount tectonus kids in the dark. Everest, it's much more. This film shows the strong, often contradictory personality that leads to two extremely full blind adults' children, Eri and Sabraya. Eric is an American blind mountain mountain / athlete and Saberi is a blind German academy who started a school in Lhasa Tibet. They both are exceptional in their own way, but what really disagrees with building confidence among kids. Eric wants to reach the summit, when Sabrians want to enjoy their role as a role model and enjoy the pleasure at the moment. No matter if the complexity of complexity was genuine and in reality what was right, or there was not a wrong or a great idea across the whole, then someone would walk. In the deepest scenes, Tibetan children and children are facing difficulties facing them on the way to school. The most moving story for me was the story of the young teenager who grew up in the street after leaving his parents. I could see the entire movie of his life and was happy to thank him at school, he is now running a successful small business with his fellow students. If you like Spellbound or Murderball, you will love this.
