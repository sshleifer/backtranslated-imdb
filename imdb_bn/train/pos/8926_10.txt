I do not think anyone else is a Terrence owner, and Tranhena produces a pure level movie than Hung Claire Dennis. She said that I did not love her new film, its 2001 best-written "Trouble a Day" (though it comes very close), which itself is one of my most favorite movies. It's just because it's probably somewhat less ornamented for yourself here. Do not make me wrong, this movie is all about a plot. It is actually one of the best things about it, but I think Dennis wanted more than one degree away, and the film flirted. Ignorance, and some key plot points should be interpreted in any way (like instead of showing him where he is or where he is there) instead of showing him, instead of showing him the main character can get his heart rate in South Korea. Other characters seem to be unnecessary, and if they still like to use Denise again for the actor, then they like it again (the character of Beatrice Dal is particularly confusing because you expect him to have some importance). Still, the film is incredibly absorbing and cinematography is beyond amazing. It's certainly a very nice composition in its own way. At least as good as Denis' more highly acclaimed "Beau travail" as well. Clair Dennis will be my favorite French director at this time, even better than Leo's Carrack. Also, I must admit that the South Korean sequence is actually "lost in translation" compared to that movie (and I'm a bit different, I am also a huge fan of that movie).
