When a small dome called Froodo Bugins receives a magic ring from his uncle, then Wizard Gonfal investigates that the ring is an evil dark lord. The ring will end up in his hands, he will get back his power and destroy the Middle Earth. Frodo and his loyal friends set out an enthusiasm to destroy the ring with a band of fighters. It covers the first half of the story as the intrinsic adaptation of the classic novels. However, it is an epic and wonderful animated film. <br /> <br /> The animation has been done nicely with the rotoscope, which is keeping an eye on live action footage. Ralph Bakhshi worked well with his low budget budget. Leonard Rosenman has a grand music score that fits every scene. There are some holes in the plot with the script, but it should be apologized, the first in converting the original contract to triple the film into two films is that many were increasingly growing. Some of my biggest glype's character designs, Samwise was a little malicious, while other hobbits work perfectly normal. Other characters are actually well-written for the screen and voice actors do a great job, I was pleased that the legoolas are actually more helpful for the plot. Rotacoped orcs are more ridiculous than terrible, when ringwhether is scary and at night. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that the malicious surgeon is called Arun, thanks to the authors. Overall, I think a little more money and good authors have tried it so much, but there's something nice for it. Ralph Bakhshi became a brave attempt to adapt to these classic stories. The film is suffering from galaxies live by live action movies, but it is still a great film for all ages of animation lovers.
