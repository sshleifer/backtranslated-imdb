I really liked this movie. Kurt managed to work without talking, speak for yourself for a moment. He does not have to make his actions verbalize or reasonable, he only takes a decision and takes action. He is supported by a good cast of actors and settings, and without having to get corne our soldiers are able to show a more humane aspect.
