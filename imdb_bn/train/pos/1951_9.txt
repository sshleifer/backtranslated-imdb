A single mother (Deane Keaton) herself has found a number of minimum-wage jobs. When he is being fired, he discovers that he can not support his boys (Michael Sitter and Colin Roberts), who have asthma later on. Then he goes to his friend and starts selling drugs. Soon, he gets addicted to drugs that are sold. His life comes crashing down, especially when his children, as his oldest son, finds out the truth and threatens to leave him. Then, he struggled to free himself with the help of his children, but could he protect his family from drug addiction, for which he worked? <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the best performances I've ever seen. Diane Keaton overacts a lot, and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convinced. She is much better suited to the drama than comedy. However, the film's best performance comes from Michael Sitter, who plays his youngest son. She is still perfect as responsible boy but trying to be adult in the family. His performance was apparently particularly great where he faced his mother about drugs. Colin Roberts, who played a little boy, did a great job. <br /> <br /> It's good to watch a movie, especially for Michael Sitter and Dean Keaton.
