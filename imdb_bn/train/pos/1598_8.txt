Either, I love postponing any cosmic plot in this movie. I've visited it many times again and it always holds up. For some, too little style is but I love fond of any opera lover. Canadian colleague Norman Jeussison has had a lot of potential with his film and his casting, and it almost always closes in movies in mid-movies and in some way tastes good. I am often surprised by the lack of acting of the Chair, he does not play a good role to reduce or chew on this part of his life. I found him as an extraordinary actress who can go back to this role, like "mask" is very strong and daring and scary. I found comedic strokes occasionally (a hair salon "Cinderella"), but both writers and directors had the same purpose. Nicholas pauses overwhelming, overwhelming gestures at one point to ask for a knife to cut his own throat. Brooklyn's scenes are witchcraft, it is the light of Brooklyn's moon, romantic and dramatic, just like Opera. Despite not being satisfied with everyone's satisfaction, I love it till the end, everyone joins like Greek Coras, lowering each part downright and mixing them with others, putting the camera down the hall and letting the players speak. 10 out 8
