I felt in this movie on TV, and I could not give it .... It's a really great movie that teaches humans about the history of America with the Vietnam War, flower power, the struggle of racism. It depicts generation conflict, political opinion, conflict between the 60's .... I was born in 1980 so I did not know all the things that I had before ... In France, America's history is not a priority and the movie really taught me a lot of information. ! However, I think all actors are great; In particular, Jordan Burrers, Josh Hamilton and Jerry O'Neal Now I see this image more than once every day !! It's really great .... What is shame in TV not only in movies ... <br /> <br />
