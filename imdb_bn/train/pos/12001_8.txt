I do not know what some of these other people have seen in the movie, but they certainly saw that "Joseph Smith: The Restoration of the Restoration" is more different than that. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was both good work and inspirational. I think it's definitely worth watching. From the very beginning it is visible that many care was taken for the film's creation. Background scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I think this picture is a good work to portray Joseph Smith as a man and a prophet. Joseph's spiritual experiences are illustrated with taste and respect. <br /> <br /> I certainly would recommend watching this movie.
