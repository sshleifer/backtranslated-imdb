I found this a very romance / drama that's a nice ending and it usually has a nice feeling. It's not a family film of the Hamlet Hall of Fame-type, which is considered "normal" behavior before the wedding before sleeping, but considering this, I expect a lot of silver films in Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro, at least in language-based. <br /> <br /> The most memorable part of the film is how difficult it is to learn how to read and write if you are already an adult. It's a big theme of the movie and it has some touchy scenes, but being honest, the film is not memorable. <br /> <br /> It's still a fairly light, nice story that I'm happy to recommend.
