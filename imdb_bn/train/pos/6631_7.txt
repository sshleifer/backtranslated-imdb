I have no idea how this film can be described and I would love to give it the same opportunity to others - there is no knowledge before that what to expect. I have enjoyed it but I can say I do not understand what is happening, if I really understood something first. Supporters of David Linch (especially sensitive), or especially the Gai Maddin film, should enjoy it, and any fondness of the comic book will probably be with my own delight and wonder, (like any film I saw in the tone and the mood created Dan Close is so effective. <Br /> <br /> Only a small note that anyone can easily warn of dissatisfaction - if this movie is rated then The NC is sure to be -17. Male full frontal nudity fans, but ... hmm, well ... yes. In this strange wild thing.
