I was very enjoyable in this film. I saw this film with my wife before my first child. Therefore, I have not seen it just like family entertainment and I still enjoy it. It seems that this movie does not separate the world, it seems that this movie was not an unexpected plot change, and the film was expected and annoying. If these people saw this film as a religious experience, they would have been disappointed. It's just an animated movie; not so more. If you just want to sit down and humble yourself in this movie then you will not be disappointed. While closing, it certainly is not the best movie made by Disney, but it's entertaining and I do not understand the bad reputation it takes.
