Beaver Trilogy is one of the brightest movies ever made, without any doubt. A few years ago, along with a question-answer session with director Trent Harris on the New York Video Festival, I was lucky and then bought a copy of Trent's website. This movie will be seen to be believed! I sincerely recommend searching the name of the trent on the web and then buying the movie from its site. She is an incredibly nice guy to boot. Do not be confused: Cameraman is not a trent in the fantasy section of the Bryan Trilogy! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Penn version. This is like a try-out version for the "Orki Kid" section of Crispin Glover and if you're a Pen Fan than it is a good video but more interesting as the curiosity item. Penn is quite funny, but you can see a big star makers in this diverse B & D video. This is probably one of Crispin Glover's best roles and I only want to see an update documentary about Groove Gary. Once you see this movie once, you will sometimes not get Gary's nervous smile from your head.
