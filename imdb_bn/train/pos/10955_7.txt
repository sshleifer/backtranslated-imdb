I originally scored Sarah's show with a fine fat 8, but I was a little annoyed with her late and I would explain what made a thin 7 that lasted. <br /> <br /> You will like Sarah's humor, or you will not. If you do not, I doubt if anyone can convince you. You know who you are and it's perfectly fine, but then you know.

In a memorable episode, he was "dragged" for the first time with the officer winner. - "You know why I'm standing here?" He questioned. "Why do you have all the high school in C?" She answers quizzically. It started to be a real question. This is the fun thing in my book. Sarah can come to you from the strange angle. In another episode, his relationship with God was remarkably funny. God being a little jealous and joking added surprisingly. It's tricky, it's a bump scene, but it will show us the truth of humor and we'll laugh. <br /> <br /> Then, came the second season. Although without any new and innovative comedy yet, we seem to be somewhat frustrated, quite simply. I got some good smiles here and there, but most of it looks like a filer, and the authors are struggling to uncover some key elements. Sophomoreal and exhausting I feel the feeling for recent episodes, but I have found the gems that I have been waiting for and waiting to turn it around. I was a fan of her "Jesus Magician" routine and I want to remember that she understood what she was capable of. Let's get back to that.
