This movie is a real gem. The plot of the plot is defined in the first 3 minutes, the characters are sympathetic and clearly drawn, their motives are fully trustworthy. Dialogue is fresh, and oh so real. The situation is unique in character and not all clichehed or hackneyed. Finally, that is. Then the movie seems to be a bit crazy and it's a little hockey and incredible. But I do not want to disappoint people from seeing this picture. It's really amazing at first 3/4. I gave it a 8. Here are some extraordinary performances. See this movie.
