Anyway, I will not appreciate Innerut's small film, even I am proud of the success of Mexican and mainstream Hollywood. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I have seen mostly reviews of their favorite (and not so) small movies; But we are forgetting that there is a fine bottom line which makes the entire collection interesting and probably it will not be so much fun for the Americans. (Even if it was not the main purpose of the producers) <br /> <br /> What I'm saying is that most of the small films do not show the sadness that WASP people had left because September's terrorist attacks were the 11th, but other people's trouble. <br /> <br /> Need proof of what I'm saying? See in Bosnia Short Film, the message is: "You cry because of those who died in the towers, but we (others = Eastern Europeans) are weeping for crimes against women long ago and nobody is paying attention to you as you did around our world". <br /> <br /> While Burkina Faso's story of jokes is even more, there are similar thoughts: "You are angry because Osama bin Laden has punished you in a temple, but we should be more angry (others = Africans) Because our people are going to die of hunger, poverty and AIDS a few days ago, and like us, the world is giving us our attention. <br /> <br /> Now look at Shan Pane: Twin The fall of love brings happiness to a lonely (and isolated) man, so the message is that should the power and greed (symbols by the tower) be allowed to see the rise of the sun and the flowering of flowers? It is extraordinary that this terrible bottom line is proposed by an American <br /> <br /> This little picture has happened so annoying that it can be isolated. <br /> <br /> Well, Cain Loch (know very well because its capital Anti-capitalism) The more obvious and shameful point of direct going: "You are angry because your country was attacked by evil forces, but we (others = Latin America) suffered the same day very bad and that's what happened to you all over the world We did not remember our grief. "<Br /> <br /> The creators of this project wanted to tell the Americans:" A Pony is now seen in America? You are not the only victim of global violence, you are not alone in your pain, and anyway, we (others = non-Americans) have suffered a lot more than you had before; So, we're in a relationship with you in your pain ... and anyway, we're sorry you got some taste of your own medicine. "Only Mexican and French small films have shown some sympathy and sympathy for the Americans; others have faced the American state, which is equal to the American people. Not.
