Running Man, along with the total RECALL, my favorite Schwarzenegger movie. No, it is not 2001, but it is not meant to be. And not even played here and scripts up other Arni movies like the script PreDATOR or TERMINATOR. But I submit that the IDEA behind this movie is the coldest hit to hit the Big Screen. A state-sponsored sports show that convicts criminals for serious crimes, competes against the "heroic" defenders of the surgery with the help of all kinds of weapons to satisfy the public and public of sport and blood. Final Award for a Winner Runner: Freedom. Or so claim the rules. <br /> <br /> For a movie with such a leading poorer death scene and cheesy one liners, it really has a lot to say. Someone has given all the commentary about the culture / government presented in this film, so I will not go here. Not saying that if you look beyond the seemingly stupid feeling of the movie, you will enjoy it (especially if you are a big SF fan with many imagination). I said, it is not trying to be a serious art film, but it's surprisingly level for the 80's shoot-up flick. The cover is borrowed from a short novel by Richard Bachman (Lawyer Stephen King), but is particularly strongly cut off from its source material at the end. (The book is endlessly finished; I do not need to say this movie.) I enjoyed both, but I loved the movie. <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "It happened because of steroids."
