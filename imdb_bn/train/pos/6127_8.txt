Jack Frost is executed about a serial killer. On the death penalty, he was transported into prison with the chemical tracker he had been involved in, which transforms his molecules into ice with frequent snow in the ground. Like a murderer, a killer will return to the snowman. Jack now seeks revenge for those who arrest him. Jack is now starting to beat the people in his small town again. <br /> <br /> I do not think Jack Frost has the potential to be a classic, but it's a recreational flash. Just hold your brain and have fun with it, but do not take it very seriously.
