When I sit to see 'Lorego Witch', I expect more than action scenes and fascinating cars. When I got up, I saw both; And more. <br /> <br /> Carl Rossen finally started without being a rival in a movie. Christian Scott Thomas played well in his role, but in my opinion the real two stars were Tamer Sisley and Miki Manzlovic, both of which acted as great. Bookwik Goran is well illustrated in Radowows. <br /> <br /> Mixed linguistics brings a beautiful color for the movie, but I understand why people will be annoyed with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; Someone loves expensive Limousines - type cars; This is their movie. It is a film that shows a sequence of love, good acting, visibility of extremist beauty and, above all, a movie for people who love a fast, well-written action movie, amazing warfare and intimate inner drama. <br /> <br /> My vote, it has been illuminated on a toxic day: 10/10
