I've seen earlier: Warriors from Magic Mountain. This film has happened in China's hill, which looks like another legend of Jazz! Thanks for the extensive use of CGI effects of CGI Harker. He is able to illustrate his vision of the floating mountains on the clouds, a land where people fly freely, and the powers of the razor sharp wing blades, the split sword and the power of the moon moon orbine. <br /> <br /> This multiple characters are mainly focused on Kings Sky and Inga. The romance aspect is there, though the film seems much darker than the predecessor. Cecilia Cheung makes this movie worth watching and watching her presence on the screen. In the beginning, how I spent it (from Zoo Warrior) and she is playing Ingiaga as soon as she encounters her past life. Oh, anyway, did I mention that the eyes of Sicily are very interesting? <br /> <br /> Zoo Warriors had more comedy elements and his special effects were limited due to his time in 1983. Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets the movie a new standard.
