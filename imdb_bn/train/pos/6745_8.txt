The Turkish Bath Sequence, a film in New York, in New York, which is an indication! Nobody raised the curiosity about the previous opinions, but I do not think it's necessary to understand this movie. <br /> <br /> Turkey Bath Order: A street road at night, sleazy sauna entry, and a sheet-covered scalise, Getting her thigh massage. Steve, messenger is the young rough boxer (Bifaque!) Type, and another guy, a bodyguard? End of last dressing. Dixon probably hates what she sees there and gets rough rough. We know he has a reputation for roughing up the suspect. Good policing but getting out of control is easy. Why does he hate so much? <br /> <br /> Could it be that he hates himself? Is this part of his inheritance inherited from his father? The dark side that can lead him to the right side of the pathway, in the gutter? Is that dark hidden in a "closet" on the side? Remember: Whenever Dixon Scalize (3 times) meets the person, the man is lying on the bed, and only for the man around him, the company's mockery of "poster of the girls" has pinned him on the wall!). <Br> <br /> Workers do fun work: affecting behaviors, proud of his neck, making his inhalator (poppers?) Shoving in his atheist every time he speaks to Dixon. With revenge, Dixon, who does not understand Snailze, does not understand: "I have never seen a man like you hate you. I almost looked at you once in a while that you came after me." Four years are hanging on me so I specialized someone! Why? <br /> <br /> Because Scalise is really a special one: He is the direct heir to Dixon's father: "Your father liked me", "Your father put me in business". He is standing as a criminal brother of Dixon, his incarnation of darkness, and to keep it top, he likes men's company. Dixon well knows: "Who killed him? Are you or your players?" Players! When they meet Dixon Manhandles, when they meet, he has chosen the address book from his jacket, has torn his face, beat him up. Parameter: "I do not let you touch!" Dixon Homophobia is clear. Or keep it aside: its vague homosexuality Dixon, Lawyer Dixon's son, son of the thief. In response, he decided to become a policeman, become a better person, but there are some of them criminal, a dark side: he is a fierce joke, a murderer, a liar, a liar. He also did not marry, now and later in his familiar food, the place comes with "a pink blonde", but nothing else. The waitress is shouting that she does not know how to love a woman. Dixon has a deep feeling of guilt and he hates himself because of that. "A Hood and Momster like his thumb, blood will say." Finally, Dixon decides to sacrifice himself for release: If he kills his arrogance, then he will release him from the crime and free his daughter and her father. <br /> <br /> The end of the film brings us to the growing aspect of opening: Scalisation hits the gutter and is entitled to walk on Dixon's path and win the love of Deme. She's finally finished. <br /> <br /> The unclear theme of the movie can be on behalf of a person who wants to get a woman's love experience to cover her feelings of pressure (<br /> <br /> <br /> Notes: The Geo Ducch film in French DVD is very much edited by Carlottai
