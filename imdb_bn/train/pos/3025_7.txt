Beckle works well here - especially this is his second movie. It often spreads because it falls into 2 great successes: "To Hand and to the Night" (1944) and "The Big Billy" (1945), which both of them linked him to Humpty Bogart. This hypothesis is not the same as other movies, but I think without blame myself. I think there was some miscasting to portray a British upper crust lady. There is no pronunciation. I think all the strange pronunciation was confusing - the age was certainly not Spanish. It is hard to keep the people straight from what country was straight and straight. <br /> <br /> I really like black and white cinematography. Mood is used in big effects - I especially like fog scenes. The light also makes a great job of adding conspiracy and excitement. <br /> <br /> The bark is just gorgeous Boy does not fit the role of romantic leading people just for me - so he and Bacall were a little weird together. Not great chemistry - and of course no Bogie and Bacall magic. But I still really like this picture. Have great tension and it comes along with enough. I must say that for this movie I found the murder of a little girl. <br /> <br /> Standing as supporting actress Katina Packenu and Peter Lauer. Paxinou as the hotel champion is absolutely villainous and evil in his photo One of his scenes where he laughs psychologically, as Mr Mukerji was leaving after killing him, the murderer of the child is quite annoying. Laura does a great job in painting her thinner, connatural snake - in the end, in a lazy cloth. Wanda Bendix also performed quite well in illustration of the child Else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (although she appears to be much smaller). She later proved to be a short-lived, flashing marriage in which married Married Marie Au Marie.
