Those French and those Germans do not like each other have a long history. It is very interesting to remember Kamaradasoft or Comradehip in translation. In 1931, after a few years Hitler surrounded Germany and began to plan his plans on the world. But times sereneness compared to this future. A group of miners trying to cross the border to work in France. They are returning to a nightclub by their French neighbors and afterwards are spurned. Then there was a disaster in French mines and a disciplined and written view was seen, a group of German miners decided to recover. Is not it a simple story? Pubert was a poet in silent film and I'm not sure whether it was his first sound film or his poetry to be discovered. He is not deceiving but the ordeal comes in a rugged reality. The point of this story that THERE is a flashback even in a WWII event. Indeed, based on a real event, the film directly plays with seriousness and terseness. Smetimes, that's what happens to be a movie
