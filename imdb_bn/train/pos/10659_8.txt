"I like the cheap scent, it does not last long ..." - Ralph Makker's guilty character (Lawson) repeatedly told Helen to Stanwick, saying that she was getting fragrant smoke that her husband had chosen. Tijuana ...! This line has cracked me, and this film looks as a metaphor - it is better than cheaper because a cheaper perfume-loving man who has a way with a 2x4 is a good man running longer! I agree with some other comments posted about the attraction of Helen to Lawson. Although, as described in his narration, he wanted to remove Losan, yet he felt attracted to his burning nature, and the emotion that he uttered in him would not wash with tide!
