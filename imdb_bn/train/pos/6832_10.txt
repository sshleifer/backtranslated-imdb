Beautiful film, pure Cassavetes style Gena Rowland works with a great actress, success, old age, loneliness and drinking of a falling actress. He tried to escape from his own subconscious soul, it is equipped with the execution of a young girl. Human condition, recognition of its overall problems, the real purpose of film. Parallel between the dramatic sequences and movies is confusing: it has become a way of phonetic for heroons. If all American movies can be only the top quality, treat human relationships at an adult stage, do not try to infantilize feelings and fits ... One of the best dramas ever ... 10/10.
