I forgot the Fire and Ice taped on an old OOP rental video of Ralph Bacchus. <br /> <br /> It's better than any other Kan-Esu film. Of course, it's sugar, but who care? It's been a test of time, and the only way to start seeing Chess is to compare the modern fantasy epics like the LOTR: FOTR (though I love this picture.) <br /> <br /> <br /> In the Fire and Eyes A war, a princess is kidnapped by the predecessors of the Girils (Ice), while her rescue only survivors of a victim village. <br /> <br /> Yes it does not sound as root as nurse Betty, but that's not the point. It really is an adventure of two enemies to bring an interesting idea to the world: fire and ice. And it is successful. <br /> <br /> For action scenes: Fantastic. They are well managed, have terrific doubts, and have lots of sounds. Just check climate war, now it's over! <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue: capable. Really They will not be nominated for the Oscars, but they are okay and do not fall on your nerves. <br /> <br /> The animation is pretty good. Shot on 3d and rotoscoped (I think), it looks pretty good. Many backgrounds are really granular and nicely grabbed, and although the designs of the character seem to be 1-dimensional, they are fine. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a fine neglected little gem and will give you more entertainment. More than superfical "entertainment". 10/10
