Tell me that I love Adam Sandler, watching the kingdom on me is focusing on his acting. <br /> <br /> When he raises his voice, I can not help but say hello to Gilmour as golf. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Always do a great job and it does not make exceptions with some really cool lines and is eligible for an Oscar in a movie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Career Best Acting Film But I can laugh lots of laughing in this part of the film <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, NYC is a great drama and a great drama of great acting comedy. A new honorable honor for Sandler if you ever doubt him or don cheadle how great he is
