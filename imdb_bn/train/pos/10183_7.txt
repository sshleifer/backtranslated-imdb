This is probably one of the best curiosity without Jubaida. Even nan bettaker gave his best without trying. The story is very good but it is dragged till the end, especially when Shah Rukh comes to the film. What really led me like it, conversation delivery, as well as the story, it was for what it was. It can be guided better, and edited. The case supporting Kerry's mother-in-law was too big, though she was only a shining moment, yet she was good to see. <br /> <br /> The sets were pretty good too. I really did not like their screenplay from the Canadian family, but once they got to India, it got as real. <br /> <br /> Overall, I will give it a thumbs up!
