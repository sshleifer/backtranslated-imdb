I caught this film at a screening screen. Was really surprised to find a sweet and funny story Good acting. Julia Roberts next to Natasha Henristidge. The male lead was awsome. Very funny pictures. Took place in New York's best position. I want to go there. I saw, "you have mail" I thought "it would be yours" was a great story. Fresher <br /> <br /> It was clean and nice for the whole family. I think it would be good to see the audience I liked it with. A specific recommendation!
