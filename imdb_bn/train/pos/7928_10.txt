Let's get something in the first place: Zombies can not exist, so filmmakers can walk, run, hell, even if they want them. That makes this real H Zombie Movie so well. All they did was very original. Everything like Romeo or filmmaker loves everything like Romero when I hate it. Some idiots think that jabbiis like rambho movie only need to be pregnant, if a zombie does not exist, then a filmmaker can create a jumbo seat if he wishes. The bodies of this film look very good but they do not damage the death because they are just dying! Although they are pretty messed up and cut full of face and blood. There was a half-awning cottage of cooler scenes. It looked like my daughter started crying so it seemed impossible. This movie has got a really good review in Fangura and Rou Mergue so that I want to see it. I heard I'm happy. They are always right when it comes to the real horror fan's taste. 10 out of 10! Rent it!
