This may be one of the favorite films all the time. The most entertaining and librarian motif in the character of Parker Posey can never be lost to anyone who has ever worked in the book and stack world. <br /> <br /> If you are a library student, RENT is here. Then buy the poster and hold it to your wall. Soundtrack is highly recommendable. I have shown this film in any other picture than the friends of other libraries - they all fell in love with it.
