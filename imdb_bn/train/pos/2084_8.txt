My main problem with the film is that it is too long. Other that, then it's pretty good. Paul Muni is a poor Chinese farmer who plays to marry through a marriage marriage. Luis Renar married Muni, a job girl. They live with Muni's parents on a farm and they're doing quite bad. Ultimately when he gets some money by buying some land, hits a drought and nothing is rising. The head of the Munis is at the head of everyone. When they go to the city and reach, they find that they have no jobs and they are worse than ever. They are even thinking of selling their young daughter as slaves for some money, but decided against it. When people start plundering a bunch of people, start showing military and executing people. Paul Muni did a good job and won the second Oscars for the film Luis Rena.
