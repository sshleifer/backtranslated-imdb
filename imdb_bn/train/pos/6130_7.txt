Wonderfully good. The acting was fun, the screenplay was fun, the music was fun of Chess, the plot was great fun. It was a fun movie to give your brain some relaxation and watch. Plot and coat parts I found very creative. 7 out of 10 For this, it deserves 10 out of 10. You can not compare it with an anthology or bloody slash film.
