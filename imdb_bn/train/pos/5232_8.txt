The film goes on with the mind of a photographer caught in his own opinion. He is 'who I am' and 'what am I?' Let's examine all the confusing questions of this time. This is a brave and thought provoking venture. A beautiful, dream-inspired, echter-like paradox of beautiful images is a monument to draw itself, or rather to self-destroying. We tell the person what he says and follow the writer in his grief about what we say, we call him his wife who has gone to Peru, has kept her child care for her, as long as she works with less and less attention, she hesitates. So much so absorbed that he and the child no longer see. His wife comes back and creates a scene, destroys her notes and helps her to finally go to Taskold. Eye-pleasing and split with I-destructing images, the story is basically the philosopher. It's about the screen of the Maya, the embryo world. However, the satire of the film is to stop thinking and think that it should stop thinking. For more than two hours of sensational beauty and quick philosophies, this film has prolonged me for silence or short film. If God's purpose was that, he was quite successful.
