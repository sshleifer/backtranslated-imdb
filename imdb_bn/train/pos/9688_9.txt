I approach approaches with films about animals to care. For every wonderful one like Bab, you are equally poor like Homeward's dam's awesome remix: The incredible journey. Or in the case of cats and dogs, you have the idea of ​​a movie that does not survive until its feasibility. When I heard about silly, the foundation of an advertising vessel did not fill me completely with confidence. But I searched the picture for a wonderful surprise. And it guides you to tear your heart out without your feelings. <br /> <br /> A Russian generator, Misha Vilenkov (Tony Salub), got a job in the research study. One day, he sang singing coming from the basement. And when he investigated, he found out a parrot in his cage singing out of his small heart. The mishah is fascinated with the bird, especially when it can be lifted, the python can not sing only, it can speak. And few phrases do not It's a parrot you can actually talk about. <br /> <br /> The parrot policy is called (Voice of J Mahar), and recognizes a colleague in Egypt. Strongly believe that the intelligent bird has finished this world in the dusty maze of the dusty maze, and wonders how to tell Mhesa Polike his life story. She was all started when she was a child, and with Marie's care, a five year old girl with a stutter. Two of them became birds (okay, bad punishment!) <br /> <br /> When Marie's parents are worried about her close friendship with the bird, they think of sending her. After teaching Paul to fly, Mary almost beat her up and did the last. With fear of reuniting with him, Pauly began a long journey across America, in which the number of new owners, flying great distances, and even the end of bars. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And although it was not consistent with his father's similarity or box-office success, Paul succeeded at several levels and it was a matter of intelligent intelligence. <br /> <br /> J. Maharara's performance in the studio-style is very good. She does not even part as a smart smack, even if she is a bit of a smart Aleck. Paul is in the world, but he is also naive on his way. <br /> <br /> When he took him away, he lived in a shelter with Marie because he had to save himself for the first time. And when he falls in the hands of different owners, they promise to reconcile Paulie with his Marie, which he believes. Only that commitment will be broken repeatedly. <br /> <br /> The policy confession is a little smaller. It follows the ending with polynomials, and follows how he is slowly brought near and closer to death. He first fired in a fifteen storehouse, where he was adopted by Ivy (Guyna Rovers), a humble woman who taught him the meaning of humility. He is sympathetic to Poly's situation, and to find a RV shipment Mary across America. <br /> <br /> Polycarms are sometimes very sensitive films. His view with Ivy is something good. Polly's wonderful moments have gotten Tom Jones on her shoulder. He hopes that his hope is great, and some conversations are quite good writing and even thought-provoking: <br /> <br /> "There are some things in your life, because you think 'they will have to do their work later. Ivy is teaching me that you want to stay there as you can not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dare to go He climbs across, gloriously brilliantly beautiful scenes that last with you in the last few hours of the film. <br /> <br /> Sometimes there is a sad moment, there are lots to smile. Polly Spanish outdoor restaurant is a group of parrots The animatronic effects are really nice as the four birds here do not dance dancing perfectly.And there is even a romance in the polyps When he was a small thief (also played by the pound), while the dash is left with. I may be the only complaint. As soon as you become comfortable with the situation, then leads to the film's Eve. <br /> <br /> This is where Pauli is taught to steal money from ATM machines, but it is a little annoying. I was surprised, Dreamworks was given the opportunity to include such a scene in the children's films. And polite diamond robbery is very impossible to miss. She has been caught in this work and sent to the laboratory for animal testing, where she is from then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They do not find Mary. But the final revelation was such a view of frustrated intensity, I was left numb for a few minutes. Polly may not be in a long time for a baby, but I believe her equally bright film. Same smile The same faulty effect. And the same wondrous intelligence. <br /> <br /> A little gem.
