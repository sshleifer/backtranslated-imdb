I've seen this Australian film about 10 years ago and have not forgotten it. This film shows a horrific fight scene that Hollywood usually glosses. The relation between the soldiers of the two warring countries is highlighted by the differences in culture and the final knowledge that until that time we are not really different from inside. If you can find a copy of it - buy it or rent it You will not be disappointed, just awed.
