"Thieves and Levers" influences many of our Puerto Ricans, presenting a very natural screenplay of the levels of corruption and compelling them to make difficult choices about the lives of their loved ones and their loved ones. Cast is excellent, that some non-professional artists are considered; An excellent choice that increases the level of reality in the film. Photography inspires the story of infiltration, as it should be in such films. The script captures the statue and attitude of "Borikuas" very deep. Sometimes you seem to see a documentary! Seeing this movie, you think you secretly entered the Puerto Rican society and are seeing it in an invisible way. I love it
