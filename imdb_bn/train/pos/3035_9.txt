MacArthur is a great movie about a great movie? General Douglas MacArthur This must be the story of the great military figures of America and a picture of me from the very first moment of my memory. Although there is a continuation problem (others may also be) such as MacArthur's depiction in the film, in 1932, "the old soldiers do not die", in the adoption of the American Military Academy's theater award, in 1932, they just become pale. (In his speech to the Congress after his dismissal by President Truman in 1951) for his alleged inconsistencies (not seen in these two eyes) Gregory Pack is IM-pack-enabled, who is committed to returning as a normal man. Philippines World War II From the beginning of World War II to the film general, his family and his staff, his service was quickly and easy to come to the end of his career. This film, which is known both with WWII and Korean War, will get even more importance. Yet, this is a real memoir of the peek scandal against the leak of this great person and the conflict between fascism and communism and hatred of war as a soldier only. "There is no alternative to winning the war."
