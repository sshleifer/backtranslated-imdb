A cruel bold film creates a seemingly instant camerawork with some superb casting and an explosive soundtrack, and plotting the harmful effects of corruption and corruption of Santiago Undarde on two younger brothers of Tumuko in southern southern Timo. <br /> <br /> Film debutant Daniela Reos is working on the seductive erotic dancer Gracia, the film production of Chile, Nightclubs owned by Alejandro Trejo's new Mini Wave. The older brother, who played the matured role of Netrara Cantilana, is convinced that she would become the head of the tragedy on the night of the Dreamplab night to celebrate the seventh brother's Victor's (Juan Pablo Miranda). From the founding shot of this opening scene, the film exploded in Neo-Niir for anything in the outside world, since it is not really expected to see it in this country, sincerely conservative and Catholic. Draw three people like honeybees in honey, although Trevor men and gringo of the three fantasy romances are the heads of 'Ginggo' among Eduardo Barrels. Rotating around the linear line of international narcotics. Energy relationships are an important theme, because the outside of society is integrated into a small family. There is an exotic spell on all Chilean men in the prostitution film, which is arising from its hesitant position in the circumference of the society, and it is seen as the key to the future of the three men. Relationship between Trazo and Cantilan has become important, because the parents of the boys are in their absence (they think they still live in the neighborhood). Therefore, it is Trozo, El Pedro, who 'accepts' Cantalena, and effectively 'creates' him as the city's people. Miranda became increasingly frustrated, because reliance on the image of her father Cantilana became increasingly annoyed by the jealousy of the beautiful Gracias. However, Miranda is still stuck in the school's limitations - she is dependent on Tangi dependent cantillana, for the money to survive. Trajo is instead under the finger of 'Ginggo', and his wealth is collected through drug steel and like his strip clubs. Graasia acts as a bomb when viewed as a beautiful bomb, he wraps a web of beauty inside patriotism but the tension can only be one climax. <br /> <br /> From the head of tension to this energy relationship, Gracia remains ambiguously unexpected. The viewer is not sure of any male image he will make. The film is a shoot out which ends sadly and blast, which revives the power relationship and removes half the main male protonist. Final shot of Minarad's beaten face Panamerican highway down the speed is disappointingly strong. The boy has been breastfed by the boy's underground love, yet his only visible family is lost, and his wife, who is his only friend in this film He has nothing. The overriding metaphor is brave and brave. This is a gangster film in Chile. The idea of ​​family, no sex before marriage, etc. is abolished, and instead of solidarity on the other side of the currency of Santiago, they are shown in all their brutal glory. Trejo beat Rios brutally, love in a movie relay room in Rios and Miranda - having a sex with a whore, she rarely knows. The 'Latin' grin appears to have financial meaning on this little Latin American nation, but not through copper mines through illegal means of drugs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gradually, it has gradually spread, which puts the picture firmly in addition to the Sex Con Amor, Taxi Para Trace and El Chocotero Sentimental. Filmography proves that Chile is good and true artist alive and kicked in post-transition era after 15 years of censorship of military rule.
