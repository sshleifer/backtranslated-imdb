You gave this great movie that I saw you ... ... that you see it for the first time is meant only. I have never heard of this movie before and it happened throughout because this week (and last) was a very slow rental experience (too much is not coming). I'm not sure how the movie left me - I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam. Still, it did. <br /> <br /> If you do not have a big budget, then this is a great example of what to do. It had lots of interesting plots and dialogues and keep the viewer in the dark; Enough The whole picture is trying to find many twists and turns in you (viewer) plots. I could give this picture 10, but some shots were fake. I do not get too much against this picture, but I do not think it's a perfect score. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think she is pretty underrated as a serious talent. He does not think of his beauty (which is difficult), he really takes his role seriously and does not rest on his face to drive him through the sophisticated emotional scene. And if necessary, it may seem cold and even useless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jeremy Northam has worked quite well, mostly like Gucci Corporate Rats, willing to drive any deviation to prove itself. However, as she changes across the entire film, it's like night and day. I know Clive Owe, Jude Law some fondness, or next James Bond will hate me for being optimistic, but Northam may fit this bill. She is suave and cultured. He got a great bond posting and voice. I think the situation may become cold even when it gets worse. Rather <br /> <br /> This image must be seen at least once. You like corporate spy movie.
