Remember that you were still fling your first kiss, first-boy / girlfriend, or the first dog that summer ... This picture is for you! Okay, this movie will not win the Oscars and I would never like it as Dominican ... There are some things in the movie that are not part of your culture, only your head will be fine ... Both the children's mother and father are the big kids, the little The baby bathe with the baby, baths with tin (Sohu Dominican!), The people around Judy are harassing, going to the church and going to the church Say candle light ... The small details of the film's brightness. Imagine, it does not seem to be an extraordinary work of cinema, but it was not meant to be an educational tool for those who want to learn about Lorish culture. (Tip: Create new friends instead). The more of a bitter-sweet, faux-leopard, the film keeps itself real without taking it very seriously. It was simply the arrival of a boy-age story as the tradition of "You Tu Mama Tambian" was. I recommend it (especialmente si eres Dominican!) = O)
