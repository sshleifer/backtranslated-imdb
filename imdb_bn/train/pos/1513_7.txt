This movie is another horror mythology. It's rather good, but it can use something more. I compare it to "Doctor Terars of Horse of Horse", although this title fits. It has four stories connected somewhat by a house. The first story is taking away a writer and his wife. He created a killer for his latest novel and then he walked around the house to watch the house. This one is sort of predicting, but eventually some twists are cast. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you do not really know where to hack it. This one was Peter Cushing's feature and perhaps the bunch was my favorite. This guy buys a house, but it is not a center that takes the central stage, rather a strange wax museum. The third story rather well started and features Christopher Lee. This one thinks her daughter is terrible protector who rather than a malicious father. The problem is that the story is not going to happen soon after knowing it is happening. It drags a bit in leading a very expected conclusion. Then the final story is an actor worried about buying a cloak from a weird little shop. Actors really get what they give for. Then there was a short story about an actor who was seen in the act of trying to explain what happened to this actor and then why this incident happened. Although I was not very pleased with the explanation because I do not think it really explained the story of Kushing. I think they need a bit more story. Although it was an interesting story in all the stories.
