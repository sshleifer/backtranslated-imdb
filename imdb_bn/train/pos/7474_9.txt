It is one of the movies that is difficult to review without the plot. Continuing to say that the strange things and unexpected twists, the primary sponsor "Tom Cruise is screws around with multiple women" without the plot. <br /> <br /> Mapping the film is a movie that is ideal, and all Castes are well suited to their parts: Cruise is like a cheerful kiss player who has all - and then loses all, as the interesting but slightly malicious Zillad lover, the cruise is visible. As a foreigner new girl and Russell as a parental psychologist. The story includes romance, morality, murder-mystery, mystery and science-fi elements and is usually a recreational trip. <br /> <br /> I'll add more that photography is a nice and varied visual metaphor for insertion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
