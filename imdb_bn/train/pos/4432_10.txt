I'm glad to admit that I can be quite smart for a beautiful movie, and enough innovative camera movement and angle can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. Gozo's length is not the same, although it was the most amazing filmmaking, which I saw after a piece of the Korean era. However, Gozo provides far more than just beautiful pictures (such as Musa ... not to conform to any contradiction) - it's an interesting story with the second greatest power of extraordinary performance and some dark philosophies. I would eventually accept the points being uncertain what is trying to create, but it is definitely provoking some thoughts with the way. Blurred, but clearly thought: P <br /> <br /> The picture that can be good in one section is action. The film has a lot of bloodstream, but the action is illustrated with heredinetic close-ups, and often hidden by objects in progress. It created some very intense and impressive visuals, but it was good to see some more practical steps, it could be more believable that villains could only destroy the armed forces. However, the film is certainly some of the most interesting and most beautiful films I have seen on several occasions. Recommended!
