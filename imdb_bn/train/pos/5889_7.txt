All right, I must admit that I have never seen one or two episodes of "Rhoda" and "Mary Tyler Moore Show". Although I do not know about this genial talent, I still liked this movie. <br /> <br /> Mary is going to work. Rose is a comedian trying his luck. Rhoda struggles with a career in photography. And Muridith ... what does he do again? These three stories we follow in two hours are fun and entertaining in their own way. When two long friends reunite, it only makes the movie even better. <br /> <br /> I was surprised how good writing was. Little joke cast by Mary and Rhoda was funny. The script was kept very well together. <br /> <br /> I saw Murray and Harper in other films in the last few years and thought they were very good. But I had no idea that they worked well as a team. Actors will share them to fill the title of this movie, but they will never disappoint me. (During this movie's run) Joe Lenz and Marissa Ryan have their roles okay but nothing is cool. Restricted customs like United, Sicil and others ... work well together. <br /> <br /> This is a reunion, so you will hope for a fan of any show for this enjoyment. From a fan I still enjoyed this together to get this together. Good story line for each character and two main characters makes this film very good. (The new version of the MTM theme song does not do any harm.)
