This picture was kept in the DVD, it is still formatted on TV and really a lot of movie purists with a vague picture ....... And just so It is very good treatment. <br /> <br /> The story is about the street actor, who needs a son to pass his craft (the rules of the day) and instead compared a small girl to the wind (not the traditional way) .... And later that happened to the problem . The old man bought a baby at a slave auction and soon wanted to know that he was not a child, which he must have thought. <br /> <br /> The Barbarian Wang (Zhu Zhu) is a non-existent face and fun-looking with an infectious grin. The little girl "Doggie" (Zhou Renying) is a cutie. How to manage the rest of the story after them. The rest I usually loved the end of a wonderful conversation but this took a little distance in the final 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall, the story of drama, mystery, humor and sadness is completely involved. Just do not expect a good quality picture for the money you're spending on. Dvd It does not come to the widescreen, rent it.
