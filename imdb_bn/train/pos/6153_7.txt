In the charming fantasy of Walt Disney, clear parallel sensation scandal and bromstics and Narrator CS Lewis Chronicles are quite clear. Compared to Mary Poppies, there is more similarity with Bedenbus and Bromstics. Although the same creative genius went to two Disney movies. <br /> <br /> Some English children leaving London, like the Chronicles of Narnia, are coming to live during rebellion and country. And those kids will have to deal with a world of magic. But c. come. In contrast to Louis, Raulin's children's magic invades their world and makes it shocking here and now. Can not go back to fantasy Kingdom like penguin kids. <br /> <br /> There is no heavy duty visit here from Walt Disney, but maybe it's a good thing to mess with the beginner like Angela Lansbye, or David Chamillion like Tomlinson. Mrs Lansbury can not be the most bankable actors to do anything. He could not even top the boys in Disney special effects that he wore his own brand of witch. And for this picture, they won the Oscars for that division's Magic Kingdom. <br /> <br /> Two actresses went to the movies of Bednobbs and Bromstics. Tessie acted in her latest role in the film, and she accepted many UK films as one of her best favorite music stars. And the grand character actor Reginald Owen is the Retired General who leads the war in Old Home Guard and plays the role of the audience throughout the world. <br /> <br /> Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. She wrote a score of Mary Poppins, Sherman wrote here is a good and complementary. The Edge of the Blvelling was nominated for an Oscar, but lost from the theme of the Shafts. Personally, I respect the most colorful David Tamlinson of Portbello Road, on the streets of London. <br /> <br /> Bedenbubs and Bromstics are a beautiful fantasy film that is good after 40 years. Imagine what it will be like with computer-generated graphics.
