I first saw this movie in a theater in France a year ago. It came and went with a little imagination, but I enjoyed it for the beauty of landscape photography and interesting wildlife footage. (The story is wonderful, really helpful.) If you actually think about it, there is no way in what can happen in real life.) I have seen the DVD again tonight. Again, I gathered it very limited delivery. The blockbuster only had a copy of it, and I never remembered playing in Cleveland's Art House. <br /> <br /> I saw on my TV, photography is not exciting, though it is still very nice. Wildlife footage is still interesting. The story about the relationship between the 10 year old child and the fox is a little less believable, when you know where it was. <br /> <br /> However, I said, the story is anecdotal. It's a nice movie to watch, and if you like wildlife footage, you have to find this interesting.
