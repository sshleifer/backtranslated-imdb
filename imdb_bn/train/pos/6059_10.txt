This is a nice documentary, packed with beautiful pictures and a great story of racing action. IMX cameras give you a very broad perspective, as it is perfect as a DVD movie. Hear every speaker you work around, the film is fast dynamic and gives you a natural feel of 230mph only. Of course some sound effects have been added but I think they are good, they give depth to the driving scene ...
