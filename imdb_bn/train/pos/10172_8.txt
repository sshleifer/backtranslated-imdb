Friz Freleng's 'rumor' is a wonderful personal snap cartoon that warns against spreading Panic-Mutouring rumors during wartime. All the snafu shorts, as the recreational guide film has shown to the military listeners, 'Ramers' are fantastic and make a few concepts in its very short living. When Sanfu started rumors about a bomb attack, it was a last rumor that America lost the war. It is a long, robust piece of sand, and some of the weird, mythical creatures who come back on the way back to Sanfu with more horrific news against his country's army. The 'rumor' is inventor, quick and funny, which helps to spread the most shaky shadow, "no military badmouth" message. It stands as one of the best personal snafu shorts.
