Everyone knows about this "Zero Day" event. In this film do I think the elephant is not how they saw us. They show their lives almost a year. We may like them throughout the movie, laugh with them even though we are fully aware of what they will do. And that gives me cold. Because I felt guilty to scream by their comments, and I just think Cal was a sweet guy. Although I knew what would happen? Even at the end of the film, even after suicidal, they decided to make a decision to calculate 3 or 4, but it seemed as though it was fun, but still I was scared to blow their heads. Of course I was. I got to like them. They were wicked, perhaps, but I really felt like they're normal, they really do not understand it. But I knew they were. <br /> <br /> The main force of this photo is IMO. It realizes that our friends, relatives, or anyone, are planning to make some crazy, and we will not even notice it. The movie was as good as it was, I think it's bad. And so I'm not going to sleep now. Still have little sense in my stomach. Butterfly
