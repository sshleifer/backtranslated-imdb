This movie is probably all my favorite movie all the time. Mary Flann Bonnie Packard is as nice. Jane Buzzby Comic genius as Delores The rest of the rest of the cast is amazing, and the film is really really fun. With a zany twist, a particular taunch of horror films. If you enjoy fun, comedy filled evening then go and rent this classic. You'll laugh all the way!
