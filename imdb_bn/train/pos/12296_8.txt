Fragile Carne, just before his great time. Although it is occasionally run confused and beaten by langeware, but Hotel de U. Nard was involved with the characteristic features and beauty of French films in the late 1930s, with this director's unusual touch shortage. Its all great qualities here: gliding, complex, delicious camera divided by movement cramped internal; An unfortunate deployment of light and shadows; Alexander Trunner's wonderful, wonderful set, which is so stimulating that he proposes as title, takes his own personalities; The quietly mournful music of Morris Jabert; A seemingly casual plot about romance, tragedy and fatality that throws a gravel on its characters; In this case, Louie Juevette and Arnite are the greatest performers of all-time greatest players at this time. <br /> <br /> In fact, the biggest failure of the film, and I am surprised at it (usually the importance of reducing it, of course, its importance) to accept it, its script is. There is a lot of intelligence and stupidity, but poetry and adultery regularly carry Kane's fellow Jacks Provert to their best movies, but it can not return to Clich√© (even if it only clashes on the hedesite). <br /> <br /> It is apparently set in the boarding house, this film is related to the two inflamed love of the community's opening concept, and set up with emotional, spiritual and actual isolation. Cruel love scenes at least work well. Annabella is very nice, but not very good at tragic times, the pen of Amant, although it may be brilliantly appropriate, by her nature, no real, felt, romance. Maybe it's just me, but I think it's hard to be sympathetic to the couple, so a little bit, so interesting, who, after a few months, gets so frustrated that they shoot each other. Their high fly line is rather embarrassing. Of course, this is not considered logical - they are waiting for the young man's emblem, hope and possibility in France, or France itself, frustrated, resignation, death. If the symbols are really strong, they must rely on a descriptive level, which I think they are not quite here. <br /> <br /> This plot is saved by M. Its connection with the story of Adams, a character linked to the great tradition of the French gangster. Although we only gradually learn it, he is a hideous hideer, inviting his associate to prostitute acting prostitution by the array. His previous 'role' - and the drama of his position is very important - his character was one set; In hiding he took them the full opposite. Rather than living a purposeless life, he deeply got reduced by the love of the lovers, and the folly of deceiving deceit became fatalistic. <br /> <br /> This way - a collection of fewer symptoms than one person admitted, and death is an indispensable reality that can threaten the most powerful manhood - like the romantic prototype of the clinical killers of Edmund Melville. With an exception - he hopes in a little bit, that there is a confusion which is only straining - if it is not more of a helpless mockery - his deadly solution <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Louis Jouvet really amazing performance. I was studying his dramatic work at the college, but it was the first taste of my screen triumph, and he himself revealed himself worthy of the great-grants, the Machrianian, the Clift, the Meson, the Mitchum, Cotton - giving a quiet silence in a role that is a real A concept is more than a person (he is, illogical to say, also figuratively). Edmund starts a minor supporting character, but some balls appear as a sad protagonist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Oops, rays and mineralies. Although the drama of Siercock's contemporary German Melodramus lacks the simplicity and clarity of appearance (see Jane's New Eufen and El Abenera), the Carnier style really fits his theme - which sabotage, paralysis, resignation and resignation. <br /> <br /> The original form of the movie is water - float and dissolve credits, the hotel is standing on the waterway - but instead of Renoir's open river, we have a canal, still and manmade, which is not going anywhere. The movie starts with the ending and the setting never changes, except for a brief interview, both are destroyed for running. Characters can escape only through death - their gateways emphasize by their narrow rooms, walls and frames that keep them captive, they can not get the windows out of any escape. Therefore, ultimately any hope, if romanticly compromised.
