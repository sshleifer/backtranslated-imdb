This movie was rather awkward, Vipul Shah's last film was good. Although it was a bad story, it was a bad story, and it was a great way to get inspired by Atish Kapadia, who did not do another good from the film "Ajo Wahala Fari Malishu" but gradually piano. There are many errors in this movie for 22 hours but it's still an entertaining song that has become rather dark and does not work well, but they are not yet a movie overall that you will look enthusiastically, it's still a story. To take into account and if it is good then you have typed a good relation, which does not need a lot of error and humorous load which really needs a little bit.
