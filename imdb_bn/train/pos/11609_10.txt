I saw it when it's premiere and IFC again saw it again. In the early 1900s, it is a big thing in many possible stories about migrant farming population in Hawaii to do sugar plantation. My grandfather was part of this migration; My parents were born in Kohla Planting (Big Island) during this movie. I moved to the big island a year before California's residence for 30 years. I was surprised to see that many planting plants are still adopting, wild forests are still growing, after several years of closure of plants. I have heard a lot of stories from my cousins ​​who are growing up in the children's garden. This movie helps in images of those types of stories and memories. This story is a historical document compared to a romantic plot-driven film. It's like ccthemovieman to read a review to leave my head shaking. <br /> <br /> I do not think that Yuku Koodah played the role, with whom he did incredible work. I remember Jim Jarmas's "brain train" and his wonderful acting in Australian movies, with Russell Crowe starring "Heaven's Burning". Tamil Tommy did a great deal with her Pidgin English, especially someone who grew up in the islands. I have forgotten that Tisiro Miffun's moving illustrator had a role to play. And I think Jason Scott Lee worked as an unpredictable, non-speaking part of the tree plantation during the park scenes. <br /> <br /> I wanted to know that director and co-writer Kaio Hatta died in an accident in 2005. <br /> <br /> <br /> This forest plant experience: "Gaizin" (most of them Japanese) about the migrant poor workers in Brazil at the same time; And "sugar can can" about the experience of forest planting in Africa. The latter is still available, but sadly, "Gaiazin" does not seem to have been shown in a while. Another great movie about America's first Asian, when immigrants were more like slaves, there was "a thousand pieces of gold". For the involvement of Chinese workers in this railway building, Rosalin Chau, Chris Cooper, Michael Paul Chan, and Dennis Dawn star starred.
