The perspective is a good thing. Since the release of the "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace", the second and third episodes of episodes claim demand and protests about how the 'original' Star Wars films have taken spotlight, which make them fully partner together, both old and new films are different Instead of the separation between trilogies. What new movies did allow you to set new perspectives in old movies. This new outlook, which is largely the weakest form of the quarter, gives more praise to: "Jeddah's return". Often stimulated for its overly 'clever' factor, ROTJ is a strong sense of sense in terms of the strong and almost perfect "empire strikes back", slightly less impressive. In fact, the 'intelligent' element of the rotation, EVOKS, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas keep only the false midgets of film for possibilities of merchandise? Only he can answer that question. <br /> <br /> Except this beautiful fact, the film is a brilliant circle and the evolution of cats. Since the conclusion of "The Empire Strike Back", Luke Sawawalkar (Mark Hamil), to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Tatooine of his home planet followed his rebellious allies, made the place a pirate rebel hero, who was captured <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> Now all of the black swim, his invention of the invention of Luke is confused and broken by him. Her emotional make-up will not suggest her outward appearance as well. Although he can always aim to help his rebellious friend, he again wants another chance to deal with the evil wicked man, though he will destroy him or else he will return to the dark side and join the emperor with a gentleman. <br/> <br /> The first scenes of Tatuain are from the Jabber Layer, in its floating palace and the 'Almighty Saralak' - which is impressive from an underlying inhabitant in the sand. In 1997, Lucas's CGI enhancements made the overall effect of Sirlac worse, it became fake and extra. <br /> <br /> The war scene of Tatuine is outstanding, and it is a more memorable story. Luke almost unknowingly jabbah and his crony, and proved that his skills like endurance are almost finished. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yoda's scententime distinct lack. Undoubtedly the star of "The Empire Strike Back", has been removed from all the stories because Luke's fate has been screened on the progress screen. <br /> <br /> The picture of ROTZ is actually more, probably more than that original. His journey carries the film with late Bhadar and his fate as soon as he closes his clashes. Other rebel characters certainly work in its shadow. The romance between Lia (Kerry Fisher) and Solo is not incompatible with the "empire". In reality, Lia's character is developed in rotose, the character of Solar seems to have become very familiar in the first two films of her images. <br /> <br /> Also work to work alongside Rebele to destroy their roles. A new death star that is near completion. At this time the Emperor himself is supervising the final stage of construction. Empire wants to crush the rebellion once and more, when the Emperor plans to work (or replace it) with the powerful Skywalker himself. Emperor for the film's various types of evil, "Star Wars" is less tricky than Governor Turkin (Peter Cushing), psychologically darker than anything else. Ian starred brightly by McDermid, the emperor is just one of those abominable characters that you love to hate. <br /> <br /> All other actors are well-connected to their role. Hamill is more intriguing as a more intelligent look, a rising warrior from his character's character, a prominent warrior for the development of some real-world characters. Ford's role is becoming thin, because his first interest and charisma was spent in the first two films - he was the original star of the first film. Fishers Lia is more than a prop, at the end of the final antioxidant, where she could learn something about herself that she was never sure ... Alan Guinness Kenyibi, Ioda and Loving ChubCacha, C3Po and choose as favorite. R2D2 and the series look similar to a family than a cast. <br /> <br /> Despite the wild forest battle of the film associated with the Yokos and empires, it ends well and includes three sequences of war: Endor, Venus and Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. The music, as always, is bright and captures perfectly mood in every example. Just as 'Blue Danube' worked perfectly for "2001: A Space ODC", John William's score is much more like "Light Wars" with Light Sabbaths and Force. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The explanation is the last open, meaning the meaning can be made more episodes. Indeed, science-fan fans repeatedly made the seventh, eighteen, and sixth versions of Episodes on their heads. ROTJ works when it gives a chance, and a good finish for a series of beautiful animal animals. <br /> <br /> This Sagati can always be the best when all six episodes are viewed together. Is it already? Episode I changed the landscape of the series. For this reason, "Jeddah's return" is now seen in different light and after almost 20 years of release, a completely new perception can be made.
