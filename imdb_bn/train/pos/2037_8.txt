Christopher Smith is a clear horror fan and it is cleaned up on its first horrible flickr 'Crump'. Although 'cripps' loose on information a bit, a true gory classic proved itself worthy. A little less shiny than the recent US horror (Amtiville Horror Remake, House of Wax Remake), this dark and dreadful story follows Kate (Frank Patent) through the underground tunnels and by using the rail minister's abusive behavior, and on the other hand, try and kill a killer The attacker escaped. Although some bad reviews make this film consistent, I genuinely believe that the 'creep' that really lives with its name for the robust budget and for the first time producer Smith Smith's UK production. It provides lesser or faster moving minor steps from the beginning, sometimes in very few cases the story is patchy, but at a perfect location and best character-response-at the end, I've seen some 'creep' which provides some views Of course nightmares
