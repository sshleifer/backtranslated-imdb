I'm not saying that after watching this episode for the first time in the DVD, PM is about 10. One night, I can not sleep until 3:00 AM <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Can say the best episode. I'm not saying everyone should feel this way, but I do. This episode is like a weekend spent with my family, keeping an eye on my father, before passing the comotose to the ICU. <br /> <br /> This phenomenon begins with an alternate implementation with Tony: She is a salesperson who has been mistaken for identity for a person named Kevin Fint. <br /> <br /> After ten minutes, I knew Tony was dreaming, or I saw another show. It was not like a normal supernova and I liked it. The <br /> <br /> option is confirmed when "Helicopter Spotlight" Anthony (or "Kevin") shows up in the sky and we see it streaming through it, a doctor with a flashlight. We only see this for a moment and we continue to return to the real life until the drama ends. <br /> <br /> Tony came out of a coma for a moment. His sons The house and the caramel, broken down by the pressure, breaks into the hallway: a signature moment in the episode. <br /> <br /> We are living in the real world for the rest of this episode: The family is feasible with negative consequences in this coma, and Tony's alternative reality, in parallel to what is happening in his mind and around the real world around him. <br /> <br /> Then came the episode of the episode: AJ is telling her mother that she is spreading in school, she is walking around to celebrate Mando's happiness. <br /> <br /> He said in Tony, "Anthony, can you hear us?" In the world of Tony, he entered a dark hotel room and turned on a light. She goes off her shoes and goes to the phone. He tries to dial, but he can not do it - as he was trying to say something back to Karmala, but could not physically bring himself in such a way. Not yet <br /> <br /> He sat down and opened the window. A wonderfully restored full of this episode now seems to call him from the other side of the city. <br /> <br /> "When it's cold I like to die" Mobi is fully married to these last pictures and a feeling helps to create a mental roller coaster. <br /> <br /> 10. Between 10 <br /> <br /> PS: See the next episode. To find out what you lighten. It's nice
