Now and then a movie is notified as frightening or terrible even though they are not usually. Most modern horror movies can be fit in this section. <br /> <br /> Yet those movies are not only intensely intensified and adrenaline can be pumped tightly than normal. They are actually afraid of you that you have never experienced. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is a movie. It takes many risks that most of the movie makers are crunching. But almost all their work. "Halloween" is terrific inspirational in its simplicity, and as horrible as the whole. <br /> <br /> The story is simple. Laurie Stroud (Jamaie Lee Curtis) Some children are childbearing on Halloween night, after 15 years of ruthless murder of her older sister, she became mad after fleeing from a mental institution. Of course, crazy, later known as Michael Mayer, started killing local teenage population, and finally he comes after Laurie. <br /> <br /> I feel familiar, all right? Just another foolless slasher folly filled with teens and gore gobs. There is no chance <br /> <br /> I think James Bardinelli kept his book "Halloween:" completely in review. "Because of its title, Halloween has often merged with all other Splatter movies, which throughout the theater in the early 1970s and early-1980s. However, Halloween is considered to be the father of modern slasher but it is not a member. "<br /> <br /> Because there is a point on her. First and foremost, it's all horrible, though most entries in tun slash styles are fool-proofs (some may argue that the latest ones are tongue-pal but most of them fail). Second, there is almost no violence (which is very bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence is not equal to fear, and it relies very little (actually, the body count is quite low). Actually, someone might argue that this is not really a horror film, but at least not by the mother language that can be contracted to the maximum death single film, every summer and more unfortunate than the end. She scares, and depends on the ideas for the skill. Third, some characters can do stupid things (which sometimes seal their fate), they do not talk about them because they are stupid. Characters are real people, so instead of thinking the characters die because they are stupid, we are afraid because they are wrong. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" is why a prime reason is so scary because it is so easy to believe that it is real. There is nothing hard to swallow in this picture. No supernatural, no ridiculous creative plot element, or "inventor" murder, or what not. Instead, all set pieces and camera work (save opening order) are easy. Carpenter calls the camera set and action in the right place. What we found is that we are actually seeing a murderer in front of us. <br /> <br /> The horror movie can probably create the most difficult movies because everything will be perfect for some fear, and ideas do not work twice. This is a hit or miss game, because if I call you all the best ideas of the carpenter (which I am not), they would seem primitive (especially since they were repeated over again with low impact) for years) <br /> <br / > Acting here is not a plus point because it does not have to be. This is not a movie about a movie, dramatic, conflicting characters about horror ideas. Actor works like a real man, not the character of the story. not so more. These exceptions are known to anyone who resembles size or later Michael Mayer. A person does not say anything and is afraid to kill only, but it is difficult to drag it (why not stop asking people). But the man closes it, and it is horrible. <br /> <br /> Through this and the carpenter's film through it. He managed it, co-wrote it, produced it, and wrote its cool score. This is a great person, and his next movie "Thing" supports this statement, although Things are not as awesome as "Halloween". Unfortunately his successes have dramatically decreased, as when the greed for big money for less freedom once big producers take advantage of "recognize your potential". As well as this film, it is not without errors. The famous opening scene is annoying, but not too scary. And in the first part of the film, most of the scary does not work. It is not bad that there is no proper reason to fear "shapes". Thankfully, most of the carpenter uses this time to establish relationships between characters and viewers. There is no intimacy in this relationship, although it fits the purpose. We grew up to know the letters, but not so much that they were frustrating when they died. But once the movie gets on Halloween night, once the carpenter kicks the things in a high gear and it stays until it finishes. <br /> <br /> "Halloween" may be defective, but it's just a little bit. This is a very horrible movie, and scary movies will look for anyone to see. Be careful, this movie will be afraid of the living hell in you!
