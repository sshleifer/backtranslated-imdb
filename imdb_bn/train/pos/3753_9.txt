Spottla Madness - This short film, inspired by full-length features soon - is a sunny part that many writers fight against similar cartoons. Short film star Edward the Spatula, who was expelled from his job, joined the war against evil spoons. This compound allows for some fun stuff at the beginning but the feature is just present for the residue. This 15 minute running time is absorbed by some weird comedy and a small musical number. Unfortunately it also lies down further. There is no time to really show that the plot is set up. But it certainly follows most of the high-budget Hollywood movies. This film is worth watching at least several times. Take it for what it is, and do not expect a deep story.
