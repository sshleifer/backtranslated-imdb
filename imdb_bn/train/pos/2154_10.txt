I have seen this movie many times and I will never be tired. It is a classic in every sense of the word. The movie is violently funny and still quite touch all at the same time. Open up your mind for those who are not "subtitled" or generally fond of foreign movies. This is a great movie for "beginner" because the story is so entertaining. Do not make me wrong, it's 100% Japanese (and it works), but everyone will get something from it (even if it's just a great smile among the main characters known as Aki - the one I've ever seen the most fun characters!) <Br /> <br /> I can not even think of this movie without smile !! I love it ... and I think most people will be too much.
