I was having fun watching the red eye. This is not a great composition, but it is well-directed and structured. The role of Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams is perfect. Yes, this is the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven has given it a good pace. At least the college's killer does not have another scam. Although the originality stands as the main character, you can see a clean, coherent thriller, it's nice to see. Especially from a film maker like Krevin, which has brought many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre of the past and has now encouraged itself to come only on TV, it was not released in theaters. Savass!
