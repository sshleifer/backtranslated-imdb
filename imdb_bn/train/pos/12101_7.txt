When I was in this boy, I saw the film in the West End Theater in Louisville, Kentucky. The scene where Dr. Karmas found the clay coffin and the body breathed there was the most horrific part of the film for me, only by the darkness of the film. I was finally surprised by the hanging of the trees, until I recognized the part of the film by changing the family name of Blackwood from Blackbud, there was a character in family history that was known for many hangings of different people. Sir Thomas Blackwood came out to provide the death to his family. I noticed that Foster entered the entrance to the first cemetery, he took precautions to notice the sharp object in the gate, where he finished his last. I do not hesitate to suggest this film to the horror movie lovers.
