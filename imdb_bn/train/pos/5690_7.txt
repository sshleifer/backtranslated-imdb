This movie was only seen in the DVD and the acting seemed to be very good, but there was more choice on all the stories. This film has the same look and feel of the Panic of Needle Park or the Dragonfly Cowboy. It is difficult to believe that such a lifestyle can live; Under the society, in which their full existence is based on the use of hardcore narcotics, crime, violence, sex, and self-respect for any person with himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Just throwing support is just as good. However, it is a dark, dark, annoying and depressing film. The killings were brutal, but this man's daily life was brutal as well. If you are not interested in this killing or are not "fond of" John Homs, it's not really a movie to watch. If you want to see a Doku-drama on the killings, the cold-blooded performance of Truman Capet's Scott Wilson and Robert Blake in the 1960's is very good.
