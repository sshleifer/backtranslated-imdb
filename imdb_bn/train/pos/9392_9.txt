I came home late in the night to watch TV, Siscell and Ebert saw their favorite summary of the week. I did not hear anything about "Red Rock West", but watch it before leaving it. Due to the problems of the distributors and lack of publicity, it did not last long in the theater, but they said it was even better. <br /> <br /> I followed their advice the next afternoon. They were correct, some of the most fun I had ever been at the movie. As some readers said, there are some plot holes in it and the last 10 minutes never seem to end. But it's good, for that fine craftwork it's in the first hours. It's the best role I have ever seen for Nicholas Cage, but almost everyone is throwing it perfectly. Dennis Hooper almost goes to the top, which gets stupid, but reinforces how anything else works well. Set and music almost contributes a great deal to each scene. <br /> <br /> I did not work when I hired later for my family. The theaters were difficult to praise because of the long scenes of creating excitement due to confusion in the house. It deserves your full attention; Turn off the phone, make sure you do not get annoyed, especially at the beginning and see each view.
