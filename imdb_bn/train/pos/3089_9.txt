Obviously ABC entered this event as licensed on Pearl TV in Hong Kong. It caught my surprise, it was a break from some Chinese listeners. But I started crying, because the cast and story lines are just enough and thoughtful in NYC. Nothing is incredible, though I think it is very stereotyptical to write it as a possible black man with a sheet of dynamics !!!! That has been the most frustrating aspect. The rest is great and I am sorry to learn at IMDB that I can not wait to see the season when I return to the United States. I am not as frustrated as other commentators that it has shown many promises and qualities and tastes. But it shows that the letters are coming closer, if it starts showing several episodes but it is difficult for people to see. Which is apparently too late for some late networks.
