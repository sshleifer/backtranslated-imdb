The Creator chose the best man for the job and set the scene nicely. Each interior details tell you about everyone living in it. Whether the current time for the medieval period (ie 1950), or the last of 1910 (the last), the costume and settings are lovingly performed and prepared whether it is 20 seconds (the first story). I love the sunny costume of two old ladies in Santorum - fine lace of exquisite finest sparkling shawls. Roland Calvara like Ashenden is very attractive, but never thought of the sticky young lovers, it is Raymond Hunt who hates our emotions by hunger and health of his wife. He was generally humorous, played pompous kind, but here he is fine and believable and very impressive. The Chinese Saas (30th film by Gabbel and Harlo actors) stole the plot of Mr. All-episode (and duplicated the Copernican story). I want to see Nanton Wayne as an avid husband - even though he has a wonderful moment in the Mexican hat. I love that flute bird, who his wife, too.
