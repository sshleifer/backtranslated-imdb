Alin Chabat claimed this movie as his original idea, but eventually the lovers' end of the theme is so old, compared to Shakespeare's old, not old. <br /> <br /> A whip is a "Victor Garnock", happily a member of a single and opposite sex does not want to disturb his life. She is a problem, 5 sisters and a matriarchal mother - G7 - She should decide to marry. Pleasant, enter charming Charlotte Gainsbourg and what a simple plan should be. Charlotte will be paused as a girlfriend of Chabat and after that the wedding day will not start. There is no more talk of marriage than the G7. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> br /> There are some fantastic scenes as there are first charlotte sheets, then family revolt. French Farce with English.
