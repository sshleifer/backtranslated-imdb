If you are a T-Rex / Mark Bowen fan, then I recommend you check it out. It also shows Marc Bolan and Ring's fearsome side, apparently for a nice time to shoot scenes that are not part of the concert, but fun to watch, give you money to understand them, and a talented singer of concerts is shown, both playful and professional. That seems to affect the stones and screaming girls. Watching him at the concert, you never know that a rock star is a work, but some good friends playing some live performances like some good friends, such as Elton John and Ringo Starr. True, there are some songs I want to watch there, but it can not have everything like any album. I bought it in 2006, but if I knew it was published in 1972, I would certainly buy it many years ago. The tragic and weirdest cars of his love songs, people will not learn to drive and die in a car accident!
