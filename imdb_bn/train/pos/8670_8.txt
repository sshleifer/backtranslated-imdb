WWE Armageddon, December 17, 2006 - Richmond Cleveland, Richmond, live from VA <br /> <br /> Cain vs. MVP Infinfo match: So this is WWE's fourth greatest match ever and it's KE vs. MVP (wonder why this is the first match of the card Was). I only saw the last parts where Cain burned the MVP's ass in the fire and then MVP was going around screaming ?? Eventually the references fire out with the extinguishing forces of the fire, MVP spread around the entrance. Funny and sight is the end of the entertaining. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Tag Team Championship: It was originally a regular Tag Team match between William Regal and Dave Taylor v. Brian Kendrick and Paul London (c). However, GM Teddy comes from Long Ring and announces that this is going to be a deadly 4-way tag title match. MNM and Hardies are throwing and it's all chaos. One word to express this word ?? How nice. Man, I can not really remember how many sick places in this match and words can not really judge it. There was a particularly prominent spot where Mrs. Hicks placed a staircase in a visible position and Jeff closed the top rope, when Matt was holding MNM for the murder and then Ham! Bonded it on Wednesday when it blew sleepy on Wednesday and had a bleeding like hell with lacerations on her face. He needed to be taken and Nitro was going solo alone. Another spot was Jeff when he was tall and attacked in London. There were so many flying highlights breathtaking stains. London finally unbuckles this rave show-runner win belt. 8.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> Boogeman vs. Mijs: Two men have thrown the ring inside and around until the bootmanman exploded a seat-out power bomb to be the winner and until it was normalized on the mijes mouth. . This three-minute disguise 5.5 / 10 United States Championship: Chris Benoit (C) faces Chavo Guerrero in another match. Some good stains have a superclock on top of Chavo and Benoit has excellent long succession of German Suleksi. Vicki Nerell nails a belt ring with a belt ring, but Benoit feeds him and takes a long time to keep him in a sharpshooter. This allows Chavo to roll-up, but Benayette launches it once more and lock it on Shawvo Sharpshters. The end of the game Hard to fight hard-hard fight though hard at times. 7/10 <br /> <br /> WWE Cruiserweight Championship: Gregory Helms (c) vs. Jimmy Wang Young, in roughly medium-sized matches. Was there some flying spots in the match ?? Most Helms' Top Rope Closes Off ?? But after seeing the match of the crowd it seems that it was not in the crowd, and Yang needed to get more airborne. Hell fly away with a mouthpiece on the knee after the match won the match. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The winner has escort outside the rocks in a listening to his opponent. Really good for really these two can give. Kennedy bargained manhandled a good deal and even set off 15 feet down Armageddon, throwing off the ace breaks Chokeslam; And thank God for Kennedy, otherwise it would be brutal. Kennedy often wins, until the waiters hear back in (I love the camera view). Tariq then missed a steel pipe in Kennedy, and instead broke the window of listen, but later Kennedy kept open with a chair, and followed closely with Chomskom and Tombonston on the Shannas roof. Kennedy was unconscious and Ticker brought him out to win. I'm actually interested in willing to give myself really sick shots / these guys' willingly. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Santa comes in the ring, what do I do? Like many of the kids in the crowd, and then the word "lingerie contest" gets in my ears. Brake time <br /> <br /> Talk about Battista and John Sena versus Finlay and King Booker: Curitiba v. Technically. This match was actually a pretty good event and reasonably shifted from one team to another team and maintain good mystery. Even Finley got some of his opponents' legitimate shots at this time (I suspected his power against the Champ), and failed to try him and cheating mainly ?? At one point where Booker entered his army throat. Boutista booster won a bomb to win, FU did not see; Sina 5 performs fake Shafl and I think she did STEF. It was probably the best technical match in the night and the participants worked nicely for what they could do without the stairs of 7.5 / 10 respectively. <br /> <br /> As soon as being a WWE fan, I'd like to agree that Armageddon was busy with numerous surveillance throughout the stairs and the ladder match finally halved the show; The Last Ride match shows some nervous-twisted spots, and the main event was also very good for its division. All other matches would probably have been billed except for the Bijigman vs. Miss Beut and the non-existent underwear contest. Above all ArmaGedon was a highly enjoyable pay-per-view and despite some major dangers before the PPV Chronicle, Armageddon wishes this year's farewell greetings with great respect. PPV rating: 8/10.
