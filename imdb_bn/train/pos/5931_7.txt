Although Steven King was written, if there was a writer, it was actually a pretty entertaining B-movie Vampirectic, disgusting creatures who live by lighting candles and living in virginity, great cemetery scene, heroic cat and very beautiful virgin The soundtrack even has Ian's music, an idea which I got quite ... excellent. I'm sure the King is frustrated for this little film, even though it was a real and tedious King of Potbole's dialogues and ideas. (If I understand correctly, this is a novel or a script without short story behind it). Still, the touch of the smell of smell will not be used by a ghost writer after all ...
