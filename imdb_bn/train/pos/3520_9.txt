This is a "B series" movie, and my vote reflects the membership of that series. Yesterday I saw this movie in the left-banker movie in Paris, where it started a quiet two-week film silent movement. The film has some flaws, yes, but negligence of a lot more delicious ingredients. <br /> <br /> Previous commentator commented, the drumming scene is incredible! (A-movies are forbidden to enter where B-movies can take place!) And the plot is confusing. About Frank Tone, however, I would like to disagree: he is mysterious to me; Just shadow the right shadow. It should be remembered that here there is a German expression that was directed by the director (Robert Schoodmacher, who came to Hollywood during the war in Germany), and thus there was excessive ventilation in the whole film. At least it's for me. <br /> <br /> However, this is an amazing Ela Reyns, who plays only with his third achievement, this viewer enters the whole film. A "Girl Friday" type with strong similarity to Gene Tienni, it is astonishing that she did not become a family name. But she is so good here that I've ordered her another picture ('Impact') from the Internet, and I can not wait to see it.
