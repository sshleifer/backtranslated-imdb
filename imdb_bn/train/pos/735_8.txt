Wonderful worship movie since 1979, where Wins Lombery faces a new, authoritarian principal named Miss Toga (Mary Varnov), high school student. Togar is a music dancer and blames the musical taste of the students for their crimes. Interesting love referee Randel (PJ Souls), the fan of # 1 Ramon, who runs the charge against him, the rock group wants to record his songs. <br /> <br /> Now * it * prevents an impossible movie. First and foremost, soundtracks are incredible, such as Alice Cooper and Velvet Underground songs by artists with the infectious non-stop storehouse of Ramon songs. "Teenage Lobotomy", "Shinea a Punk Rocker" and "BlitCridge Bop" are just a few of them. Later, the Throw really gives them all, the Souls are ideal for the role of Reef; He is a true pleasure. Vincent van Pantin and Day Young Tom and heartwarming like Kate. Vernavo has played well against the type as a great and disrespectful toga, Clint Howard Washroom - the best part of his time, like the Occupied Entrepreneur Eaglebauer, and new world regulars like Dick Miller, Paul Bertell (especially fun as Mr. McGree) and Real Don Styl is always funny . And, of course, it's a treat Ramon plays himself. <br /> <br /> This picture is the true spirit. With high level of energy level, co-story writer and director Alan Arkush bringing a great deal of proceeding There is a great sense of humor. This is a fantastic example of paper air spots. This scene stretches the transfer style "erase" the right. The very hilarious giant mouse made by future makeup impressions even made Rob Bobine the notable among his first gigs. <br /> <br /> An authority-defensive, found-on-party-to-film party found "Rock 'n' Roll High School", quite simply, is a wonderful culture film. <br /> <br /> 8/10
