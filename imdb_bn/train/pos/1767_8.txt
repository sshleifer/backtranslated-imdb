Steve Carroll portrays a slightly weird straight man, first in 'The Daily Show', and then plays a variety of supporting roles. In Virin, Carell found a clever and ridiculous script that perfectly capitalizes on its power. Carole Andy Steeter, a middle-aged person, lives quiet, alone. Andy is a little weird, but a strange way to sort cute people. One night, while socializing with his colleagues for the first time, Andy accidentally revealed that he was a virgin. His colleague, David (Paul Rudd), J (Romani Malko), and Cal (Seth Rosen) initially excited Andy about his condition. But it is clear that both Andy holds special respect for civilians and they are determined to help her in ending her virginity. And so began the search in Andy's Adults. Andy is the perfect innocent, and most of the pictures of humor have found herself from her catastrophic life throughout her life. Humor stuff out some weird overall stuff, but it's mostly done well-intelligent comedy. In addition, I have actually touched most of the film since Andy discovered herself for the first time in both her romantic relationships and friendship. I'm not trying to illustrate the movie as a story or play; It's a rolling in your seat comedy. Yet, I have seen any good comedy that has enough heart to take care of the characters. This is a good comparison of 'marriage crashes' from the beginning of the summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but some of his jokes are probably more obscene. I especially like the end of the movie, which I think is a perfect way to finish the flick. Without some distance, it reminds me of 'something about Mary'. Very light and fun; This lets you smile and laugh, which is how you feel when you finish comedy. I would highly recommend it.
