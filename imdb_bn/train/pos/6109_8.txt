My Tietor Friend is a well-documented romance comedy movie that has something like my Sassy Girl .. There are no kisses / sex scenes. Learn more from Hollywood Korean productions. Sex romantic movies are not always necessary. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> When I like the part of Je-Hun about kissing in swan. The most joyful moment when G-Hun suu-Van's first love hit because he dumped Suwaiyan for another girl and he will soon become the father. Later, how he became a father brought a smile to the audience. <br /> <br /> Mao points: 8/10
