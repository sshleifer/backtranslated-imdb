With the delightful, emotional and dreamy music of the Oscar-winning composer Rachel Portman, this image can be viewed once a year. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Tony Colelett was just as spectacular as Harriet Smith. <br /> <br /> The character stole the character Mrs. Bates !!! He became gentle to look up, someone hanging on his feet, he started hanging on each of his words and got violent with her. I'm one of the most favorite characters throughout the ages. In one of the opening scenes, he thanked Mr. Woodhouse and said, "Dry Quarter-Whit Dry ... Poke, Header !!!" He is a drunk and obviously hearing impoverished mother, Mrs. Bates (Actor Emma Thompson's mother, played by the Philida Act), who is seen to be drunk and lost. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When Emma excurses Miss Bates to her heart, then uploads Picnik herself for a true gestational scene. We then see Miss Miss Bates stammering and tears, and so a miser can not help, but his heart goes out of his way. This is a classic scene, a revival of the game over and over ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope this picture is not enough I will also satisfy you as you have it <br /> <br /> <br />
