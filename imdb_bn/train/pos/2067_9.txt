Although universally acknowledged that the horrific equation was greatly influenced by the elongation episode, they have been, they, they will be whether it is a rif off or a tribute which is completely controversial. As a huge fan of both series I subscribe to the next faith, although it can not do less charity. James Witmore was brave enough to instruct such a difficult episode, the invisible elephant and gorilla suit sounds like a recipe for disaster, but he closes it with style, teaser is an absolute jewel. Lance guest Keel Lang and Jack Radar have done a great job of creating the credible character, which is in danger as Ed Mitchem. Forget the suspicious fundamentals of great prosperity and enjoy it as deeply satisfied as x files.
