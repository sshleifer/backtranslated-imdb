The most profitable production of phasimbinders dedicates little to his talents for identifying and building people of long-suffering, which acts as social encapsulations in any way; Here, it is much more fulfilled, since the story happened in Germany at the end of WWII and the central character is a woman (Hana Shigla as Maria), who capitalized herself with a prominent textile corps by capitalizing on the weakness (both economic and gender-related) capacities. The loadishness that makes lucrative products available for temporary workers (as it once was). Married to fellow air strikes, Maria and her new husband, Hermann, allowed a brief hive before sending them to the Russian Front. In her absence, her frustration is great: she spent most of the day at the train station, waiting for her to return. When the news of death was found, he suddenly stopped sorrow and served as a bermaid / prostitution for food supplies to America's GI. <br /> <br /> When he comes back, he becomes very dirty, in such a situation, the plot to keep them separate (and in his sense of great sacrifice) the plot. The message is sent by the Facundinder M.O. Write greater: 'Love is cooler than death', but Maria does not just oppose her own husband, and a husband is unable to love her, but at the end of the tunnel is not a country in deep flow with an enlightened light. Fasibindor gives some statements for the highest bid for German postwar, but like all of his films, I block those elements and focus on unsupported sentiments in the display: the fasciinders have been expressed through its character; Filter through their real-life connection with his actor Fassbinder Taken together, his films can be helpless or inappropriately messy together; This falls somewhere, though definitely near to the next. I do not like it like PETA Von Cunt or Kettlemamer's Bitter Tears, Mariah Brun must have a greater chance and more, I could feel the emotion of the person and his true feelings.
