I have read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got the opportunity to watch the DVD. Being honest, I do not really know what the problem is. <br /> <br /> This is a decent murder mystery thriller, which can be seen from different perspectives, often out of the brutal potential killer / suspect, late indecent king, including John Holmes. Please read the plot summary for the correct description of the movie plot - I would like to contribute more to the review than a summary. <br /> <br /> Many reviewers have gone so far to give the lowest rating due to this violence but I do not really see it. Most modern movies were bad - Private Ryan was finally more violent than the film, to save the personal film, which is often based on blood stains, rather than actual cruel slayings (the film's murder scenes were completed with a lead pipe). <br /> <br /> I was fascinated with both parts of the movie - the first John John Homs was shown as a frustrated cash-hungry drug addict, and the second half showed his side as a small conspirator for a stupid bleeding. The film has an excellent performance, though Dylan McDermant has seen a little more space between his biker-esque personality and bad boy's personality. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was awesome - an impressive mix of 70's B-side rock and vague pop, Ala Boogie night spread all over the place for a few hours.
