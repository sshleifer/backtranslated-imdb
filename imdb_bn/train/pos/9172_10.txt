I studied the novel of high school charlotte brontet, and this has left me with a stunning impression. There was a beautiful novel about a young struggle to find love and recognition in Victorian England's dark times. This young lady was Jane Aere, who is a strong mind with a weak and simple character and her own wishes. His story, which Brian Jane said with his own eyes, was both sad and inspirational. <br /> <br /> As part of our research, we saw the 1983 adaptation of the story, and it blown me off. The short series do not consider Bront's original text and the main truth of the story as true, but the illustrative characters of the characters were very good. Both Jellha Clark (Jane Eyre) and Timothy Dalton (Jane's boyfriend in the name of Ranster) earned both excitement from their character. I can not imagine anyone else in their role. (In other versions of the 2006 edition, Rochester's other performance lacks the emotions, strength and tenderness needed to accurately portray Rochester. + I say that Timothy Dalton came in the top because Rochester has all these features in his screenplay. + Jelah Clark did not look like Jane Zen, but he , But has attracted firm and enthusiastic nature At the right moment of Lap, he has kept his emotions like Zen's book but lets him out of the fire. Clark and Dalton together show their view that chemistry, Jane and Rochester's cruel relationships are also reliable and true.) Alongside, supporters also fit their role perfectly and set The Gothic nature of the story coincides with nature. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this version of the classic Brent story. If you do not read the book before, you can see this product as a trusted role of this beautiful story.
