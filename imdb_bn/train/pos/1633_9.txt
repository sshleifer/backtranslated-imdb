After coming out of the 80's, I liked this flickr and still do it! I still quote the classic line like "tell it again" and "you said you will sip my ball off sir". Ron Libman was hot and very funny! Although it was under MAD and unknown, but I must say that this little jewel is always a treasure and a movie that will be sent if I send it on a secluded island! I just want someone to release the DVD because my VHS tape is almost refined! If you want a comedy out of the sunny, this should definitely be considered for you and a religious classic! It's the best and the bad humor! If you can not own it, rent it!
