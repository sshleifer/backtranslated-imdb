It's really a heart warmth family movie. It's absolutely brilliant animal training and "acting" (if you can call it like this) as well (think about how "Grinch steals Christmas" dogs ... it was simply bad training). Polly's story is very well-reproduced, well-reproduced, and generally the characters are too broad. <br /> <br /> My Ratings: Story 8.5 / 10, Acting 7.5 / 10, Animals + FX 8.5 / 10, Cinematography 8/10. My overall rating: 8/10 - Big family movies and very good watch!
