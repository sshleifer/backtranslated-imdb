When I saw this movie about seven years old and it was totally excited, but the film was unable to find out what was said for years. Now I am 21 years old and accidentally hit the movie about two weeks ago and bought a copy. Although my memory of the film was a bit faint, I was not disappointed with what I saw. The animation of this movie has created a world that is so trustworthy and so well animated that you dragged this movie alone. But this film also has a plot that entertains and entertains adults and children alike. This movie will not disappoint you with a floating island, a crazy general, a friendly pirate granny and a well-made love story. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
