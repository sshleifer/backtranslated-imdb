Prix ​​de Beauté was created on the cusp of change from the words to silence, which came a little later in Europe than Hollywood. Originally conceived as a silent, it was released with a dodd soundtrack in France, with the line of French actress Louise Brooks, but in Italy and in other parts of Europe, as a silence release. I was lucky to see the stupid new recovery of Italian silent print Senator de Dolgoana at the Tribeca Film Festival. I still have not seen the tabloid version, but I think it is safe to make the silent version even more satisfying, since all the reports dubbing is done badly (Lewis Brooks can speak English clearly, so there is no way to have his lips.) Also, the film is made entirely in silent style, with a few headlines and little need for dialogue. Precise De Beauté tells his story of visualization, with exciting, fantastic camera-work. Inaugurated immediately with dynamic, fast-cut scenes of urban life and splashing swims at a public beach. Apparently detailed, clothing, apparatus, decoration and signage images, such as a catastrophic bird, hopping photographs of diamond bracelets, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This view is simply his heartfelt This makes her the latest acting role. Beautifully ridiculous, he influences the film with his charisma and gives a completely natural yet charged performance. Here's his role, more than Pbst films, for which he is most known, this is a woman we can fully understand and be sympathetic. He played typewrite with a dictator drunk in the name of Lucien Garnia, who was interested in getting more of life and immediately successfully entered a beauty contest secretly. Then he jumped aloud with his new life and his love for his love. Characters are drawn with all the nuance. Mother tongue inspires sorrow and not just cruel: She loves Lucien, but a limited person who can not live a different life or attract other men's attention. Even the "other people" in the story is not even simple slim which we can take at first, even though its intentions may be the same as the maternal. <br /> <br /> ************* *** **** <br /> <br /> There is a great set of pieces in this movie, along with Lucien's triumph in the "Miss Europe" contest, through comic reactions to the collected audience members, who have plotted the heroine with flowers; Her sorrow as a housewife, peeling potatoes, when the pumpkin pendulum marks her time behind; A night trip for a wonderful trip (in silent editions, after the wedding, the film was delayed), on which Luisen was crushed into a lightweight and depressed by her husband Marto Antix, deciding that she could not go with her present existence; And especially in the final scene where he saw his screen screen screen. Lewis Brooks can not look even more beautiful, the projector's bees shine in his Albasta profile, and whilst he shines inside the white wool on his shoulder, his face flips inside the hairy arm, because he sings on the screen. The double shot of his extraordinary body on the screen and his still living image is particularly furious: Louis Bruce's film, like Luisen, remains unreliable despite his frustrating film career.
