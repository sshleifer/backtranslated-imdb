So, Fox pulled the plug through a play / mystery <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How tall is that? Are there any real risks to finding out what will happen if they want to invest our time in our new groups? Why was not left, films in the United States already? They were broadcast elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Hey, Fox! Are you listening It was a great show, but you kept us hanging out. You're going to introduce new drama / mystery, at least at least a conclusion wind before mid-theme Every such thing happens (and it seems to be going to happen to you - that is, Fox), there are many more people who "wait and watch" before investing their time. This means that you can see part of the less interest, and more likely to end the series. See? This is a vicious cycle. Do not let us down again ...
