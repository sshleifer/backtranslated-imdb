This is a movie that I have never seen even seen in my 3 year old video store and after taking it as a cover photo of Naboobo Island. We got it and saw it repeatedly; Actually we hired it many times. My son will watch and watch an animated movie very frequently; What is a wonderful change from Dumbo and Little Mermaid. The acting is outstanding, the music is mandatory, they can get your head deep and you can help but sing along but help. The storyline, especially about the WW2 when it's timeless in its own way and every time you see something new. I heard it compared to Mary Poppins, but I think they are two excellent movies, both nice, but my son has no interest Mary Poopins. This is a movie that children will not want to see again and comply with their parents. A few days ago we saw it before bedtime and in bed and I do not think the crying that happens when I want to repeat any movie.
