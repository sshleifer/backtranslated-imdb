Some people say that this is the best film that PRC has released, I'm not sure that my favorite place in my heart is for some mystery. I would say that perhaps it is probably one of the most unique movies, or any other studio, major or sailor, ever released. <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is simple. The wrongly executed Feymanan ghost has sent him back to swim, who killed him as well as killing all of his spring along with the lion. This mixture is a ghost hunter, the present-day Feminist's granddaughter comes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Likewise, there is a similar focus on camera work, because it travels across the street by passing through the path of living, innocence and crime. The film reminds me of an opera or oratorio or musical instrument more than a normal horror movie. This is an extraordinary piece of film history which is probably unique in film history. <br /> <br /> This is not to build Lily. This is a low budget / mystery that tells you a tiny little story that will keep you entertained. The story of love and revenge is important here, poet is not made of film and it gives you the first and foremost (technical aspects just like window dressing) attention. If there is a real fault of production Fog creates a mood but it hides that this swamp is completely dry on the ground. It's okay for a little while, but after 58 minutes you want to see something else. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong I love this movie a lot. Its a small film that I hated little less poverty. If you can come across it's definitely worth a look.
