This version of Anna Christie in Germany. Greta Garbo again plays Anna Kristi, but all other characters from the English version are different actors. There was something like this in Garbo in Germany, because both of them were reproduced again. Garbo himself gladly supported Anne Christie in the English version of this edition. This is a good story and must be seen for Garbo fans.
