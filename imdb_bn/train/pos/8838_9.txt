Finally, a movie where the audience will happen is finally estimated. Well, we all know that the lives of the brothers, Andy (played by Hoffman) and Hanak (played by Haq) will suddenly fall in disarray because there will be some other place to go, but we do not know when or when the movie ends. Hoffman was pretty cool, normal and even right, like a younger brother, he did what he originally said because he did not really think of himself. Haq may have little out of his material, but he played enough good part. Add to this mix Andy's wife, starring Misha Tommy perfectly, is cheating with Hank; Andy's fraud for the company's funding for its drug and sexual harassment; And find out exactly what a dad who is finally robbing the day. In this movie you have to worry.
