I could not agree with the comment of one HVR with NoMode 7. A perfect backyard movie saved on Sunday morning. Humor is subtle (correctly referenced as "slopstick" as a misleading commenter). <br /> <br /> I always wondered how many times I would like to find myself to come back to this movie. Twelve years ago I copied this movie to VHS when it could be a pay only for free Weekend Previews premiere (HBO?). Never heard it before. I do not know why it was not good. ?? When DVD was widely released, it was one of the first movies I replaced. Cast and a great combination of writing. Moreover, the drop behind the Montana desert does not damage anything (beautiful). <br /> <br /> This is probably not a comedy type for everyone, but what? Adam Sandler's type of stuff is up your lane, this probably will not be your cup of tea. This movie requires your full attention. Humor is mostly in the dialogue. <br /> <br /> I believe my next visit will probably be about my 12th. But I still know that when it goes to the scene of the closed police hood, I'll open it (Ed O'Neal's face PRICELESS!). 110% recommended.
