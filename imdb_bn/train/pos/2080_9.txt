As the captain of China's Revolutionary Army (run by Philip Ain), I used the quote that I used for my summary to be half as much as a captain, not having time to loot. Just called back to the front line. Of course, the next looter is found and shot is the main character of the film, former kitchen slave girl-Lan (whose picture is Luis Renaar, now 99 years old, won his second successive Best Actress Oscar)). <br /> <br /> The next scene provided O-Lan to his underworld farmer Wang Fuong (Paul Muni) with a bag of looted jewelry, which is one of the top financial financiers of the classic DitchTom The direct reverse of its moral decline of mobility. <br /> <br /> Deals for a movie dealing with issues including slavery, false accusations, misogyny, hunger, home invasions, eating family pets, psychological disasters, infantide, refugee refugees, riots, civil war, brief genocide, death penalty, adultery , Adultery, and biblical proportion of insects disaster, good earth is a wonderful heart-warming film. <br /> <br /> I think of my fate in the form of another classic quote, O-Lan from myself (when her husband's precious soup bone is stolen from her old woman again after being put on the dirt floor on the other side of her house by her husband Wang Fung Stolen): "meat of meat."
