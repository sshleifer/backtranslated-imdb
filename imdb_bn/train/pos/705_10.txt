I came across an insomniac nightmare in search of an offset independent movie, and was delighted that it was not frustrating. This crazy half-hour journey surprised me with all the way, and the last was nice - one of those NOOOOO moments really is with you. I have shown this to many people and everyone agrees. The little ghostie girl was very talented and I think her performance show stole. He creeped the hack from me, I can say a lot. Putting this small together is a great job of Nanavati. All the pieces fall into place and you can say that a great writer from what he did with this script. So good writing. This is undoubtedly the most powerful part of the film. The direction was great and the performance was enjoyable, but here is the most important factor Screenplay Power. Good work for this girl, I can not wait!
