This is apparently one of Shem's first shorts with Stupus. (With this team vaudeville years removed her much earlier). But the trio's ridiculous time here is her honed best. In addition to intense slopstick scenery, others are more subtle, but fun. Look at Larry when Shape asked him to see the camera to snapshot. Or, look at the original object, wondering, "Oh ... very elegant mahogany!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Emil Citka made her fools gifest And Google may feel scary, but he is somehow funny. He feels as frustrated and "regular" people in other shorts as confusing with Stooges. <br /> <br /> For Shemp aficionados, this is a must of episode. It will not be frustrating.
