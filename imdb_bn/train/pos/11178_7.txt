Tiny spinner <br /> <br /> unexpected little Stephen King shocker This is not perfect by any stretch of imagination - even if the deluxe performance of Dell Midkife and Dennis Crosby was good, still the mysterious story elements will be humiliated to blame. The old Micmac cemetery ground, Rachel's interim sick sister and Jacob-Marley-Victor Pasco never got together in coherent and think films are confused and overstuffed. But some horror films are really perfect, and it may be lacking in other regions of this region that are frustrating. The 'Pet Semitic' can be one of the worst horror films in recent memory, with memorable zombie children and Gelder's highly encoded screenplay. It is politically wrong, it is shameless, it's ineffective - and it does not hate us with 'safe' horror movies, in any way, rebellion in such a way. Add to Fred Gwynne's best performance and one of the wicked aspects of Mary Lambert, and you have a very satisfying scary movie - even with the end of the hockey. Highly recommend fans for fans. 10 out of 7.5
