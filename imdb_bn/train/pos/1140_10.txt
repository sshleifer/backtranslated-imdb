I have been a fan of this movie for years and years. Because Terry Hacharsra went ahead, I had to take the film out of the roof and watch it. Why was the man behind why I was left behind in this movie? Sally Field and Kevin Kline are pretty fantastic. Although I did not see every day soap opera, the film killed me while watching me. Acting someone else for a comedy and writing is so smart. I highly recommend you watch this if you are not already. You'll see some names from Elizabeth Shue, Hooper Goldberg, Terry Hatcher and Kerry Fischer ... all played pretty well.
