I remember this show from Swedish television. I was only 7 years old and it was afraid of me without faith. <br /> <br /> I would like to see this series again and see that it looks as good as me though my taste and demand has changed. <<br /> Although it was released mostly in the Alien and other space-thrillers, I suspect that it has its root in 50s and 70's dangerous weather scenes from the political climate. When I thought about it, it was a real science-film, a movie about scientific and political questions, trying to discuss what we are and what we do. Since then, the science fiction has suddenly become a word, and the word comes for a film that is asteroids among them.
