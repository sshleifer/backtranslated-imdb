A bit quirky and unlimited bad taste; But intelligent enough to be obsessed with watching. A wheelchair-bound young girl, Jane Haschard (Helena Bonham Carter) is involved with a reluctant caretaker, Richard (Kenneth Branagh). Richard is an artist who is a human trafficker. She is willing to build an aircraft in her garage and fly it. He wants to revive his suffering life by taking care of independent, mortal, Jane, who suffers from neurological disease and has his stupid and very little motor skills. Wheelchair-bound and full of the soul, his last death's wish is to loose his virginity. He proposes himself to Richard, who will not directly help him; But willing to hide a bank in order to give a gigolo to work. I found this flick ambitious and ridiculous. Even in this role, Carter has a specific charisma and likability.
