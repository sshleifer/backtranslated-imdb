I am a fan of Hal Hartley's film, especially the 1997 "Henry Flower". "Faye Grim" is a series of films, and it has similar styles and humorous ideas. The plot, however, is completely different. Faye Grimm (played brilliantly by Icon Parker Possi) tries to find his missing husband's notebooks and feels himself hypocritical and spying. Supporting cast (along with the first film, as well as Jeff Goldbell, Kiffer Barrow and the 90-in-durling, much welcomed by Ellina LÃ¶wenson) is quite nice and most of the film is astonishing. The director claimed that it is part of a trilogy like "Star Wars", working as a series of "Empire Strike Back", if it is true, I can not wait for the third installment! I do not have to wait 10 years for me.
