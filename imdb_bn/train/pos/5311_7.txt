John Waters is one of the most accessible films, it's a campaign and a complete blurring idea, considering that most of his previous work is cold. Sure, nudity and sexual references are still there, at least it is presented in a fashion <br /> <br /> It is not considered too bad or objectionable. Due to some cool casting preferences, this movie really highlights the fascination associated with modern art and the evolutionary nature of your modern artists. Funny and somewhat light heart (if it's possible for Waters), this is a movie that I'll see on rainy days.
