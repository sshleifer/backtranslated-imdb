I went to expect an art film scary in this movie. What I got to fear was fear. It's a horror film on its core. It is not neutral like other scary movies where a ghostly house is only ghosts and ghores. This image does not show you the majority of deaths which it scares for letters. I think one of the best things about this idea is that it is not just that room anyone who enters the house. Where they became violent. Office buildings, police stations, hotel rooms etc. After reading some of the external reviews I am surprised that the critics did not like this picture. I'm going to meet again this week and get excited about it. <br /> <br /> I gave this image 10 stars because it worked as a horror movie. It's ** ** scared to me
