Despite the NC-17 rating and annoying scenes, the film was outstanding. In reality this kind of thing will happen and hence this movie shows many. It starts with Maya (Rosario Dawson in Excellent Performance), which recently started joining college, everything is going well for her. She met Jared (an awesome performance Chad Faust) who is a gentle party and Jere turns to be a real lady and sweet. He invited him to dinner. They look at a bridge they look and they end up going to her apartment. They talk and take to the basement they become flirtatious with each other. She tries to finish it, but she rapes her. This is his scars in the incident. He meets a Bartender / DJ Adrian to go to a club (played by great Marcus Patrick) who sees that he is getting drunk and before he goes away. They strike a friendship. He also did medicines and Maya began to use as well. In other words, its role in a different world. He started going back to school and worked as a teacher assistant and called Jared as one of the students. Students were taking midtimes, they cheated Jerde. Jared Maya tries to talk, but still his upper hand decided to invite him to his place. History will repeat itself? Or will Maya be surprised to win? You see the movie. Excellent at Rosario Dawson describes the role with focus and patience. Chad Fost does not like that he can be a rapist, but he does a great job as Jared. Marcus Patrick Maya is a bright personality who protects and trains him into a new world. These pictures deserve an award.
