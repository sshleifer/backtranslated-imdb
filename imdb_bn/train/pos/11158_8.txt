An absolutist story of violent, disciplined killers and violent attacks of evil forces. <br /> <br /> A small doctor doctor who is trying to discover the series of continuous series continuous series of violent sexual assault, is trying to discover. <br /> <br /> Inkubash is a tight mystery, some horrible kill sequence, which creates an off-bit and eerie climate wrapping. Murder scenes are intense and intense, so this is not a movie for the chic! At the direction of John Huff, together with odd music scores, filmmakers gathered to create a terrible dark atmosphere. It carries a kind of Gothic vibe as well. Excellent filming position and some stylish camera work also highlights. <br /> <br /> Cast is not bad. The great John Cassettes make a difficult performance as a new doctor in the city. Kerry Kinney performing as a local reporter, Helen Hughes as a city historian, and Docan McNeosh, acting as a troubled psychologist. <br /> <br /> All Inqubush is a forgotten horror film that will be again - discovered and re-evaluated. <br /> <br /> *** *** ***
