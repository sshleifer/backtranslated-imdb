I was not a fan of the Farah Fount ... So far. He was really amazing in this movie. Do not get annoyed with the passion that she will have to go through the re-adoption after taking re-adoption. It was a very difficult movie to watch, this is undoubtedly unpleasant and you are just feeling helpless and misusing a woman who feels like an eternity. I really felt that after the return of his friends to the house, the whole thing got a little compressed and I could not find the perfect maker. The director was very interested in using height in his shots and loved using mirror reflection, I believe he could give more attention to the speed of the second half of this piece. I'm sure it's a strong piece of the theater, made a hack for this movie for me, though it was worth it, but it was very few.
