This picture was amazing. It was an original idea (a vampire film that met the Yakuza crowd film). It's a ridiculous and yet extremely dramatic and tragic film about friendship, love, immortality, death, and happiness, and comments on society. In the part of Gakt Kamui, Shore's role was completely exhausted and Heidi was tortured for her first film, but as a lady, she was surprisingly good. I was also a happy and happy-lucky character, Toshy, who grew up with a loud voice, cried. I love every second of this movie, especially fun cigarette scenes, war scenes, and heartfelt endings for the most moments.
