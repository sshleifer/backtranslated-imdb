The story of Ant√≥n Fischer of childhood negligence and misuse is the inspiration for all of us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of children's children. Exempted by a restless mother, Antwone did not meet her father. "Going to the Church" is growing with torture, not only using "n-words" but also being frightened and hurt, but also using the term as a tribute, a young man testifies how his best friend is kept up, killed in permanent ethnic slogans . Getting excited while working in the navy, Anton's anger gradually gets converted into positive energy when the Navy is advised by psychologist and a love of his life flows. <br /> <br /> The most powerful moment in the film Anthovan filled his mother's birth. The woman was terrified by the unexpected conflict, despite her silent reaction to the young man who told her how she lived without crime, addiction to drugs, children's rights to children and the left side. <br /> <br /> If that scene is not strong enough, then it increases (and opens the flood gateways): a reception to welcome Home Actowon; Hundreds of sunny faces and open weapons declare that he is part of this great family. <br /> <br /> One of the messages distributed through this wonderful movie is that many financially and sincere people are working to help orphans and unwanted children. Even though the home and the administrators seem to care for themselves and serve themselves, many people give them everything. Anton's "file" character, after revealing his birth conditions, is a "dark light" system in the dark of the system. <br /> <br /> DVD has a French language track, various subtitles preferences, as well as additional features and information about Foster parenting. <br /> <br /> As a Clevelander I appreciate the location footage. No matter from where you are, you will move deeply through this autobiographical gem.
