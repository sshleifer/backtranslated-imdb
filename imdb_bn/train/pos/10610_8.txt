The tragic past (Henry Thomas) brings a deserted baby girl to the flood of a sweet nature, and soon she falls in love with him. Though the local generation (Car Simu) is worried about the new family, the elders of the city generally support her child. There is a parallel story parallel to a homosexual trip to a long walk and a terrible travel salesman (David Strathairn at her maximum) has a prescribed small girl. It has the same type of vein in the ozarks, where a beautiful Place of Life is called "The Lily Bloom" and "The Dolmacher". Three of these beautiful mountains were shot and killed and life of ordinary living was covered - but not ordinary people - American people. The least powerful language and minimal but sharp violence make this fairly safe family to watch.
