It was seen in another week on Australia's SBS TV, where it was titled "Laputa: The Castle in the Sky". I have enabled subtitles and I think SBS has provided its own, which was naturally very good quality. <br /> <br /> I saw "Laputa" in Wikipedia and it doubted what I suspected ... The floating island of this story was taken from the classic Jonathan Swift novel "Golves Travels", which was published in the mid-1700s. <br /> <br /> However, this is a compelling Japanese novel, which is an English voice-cast. I think it's appropriate for young people, but it is only run in two hours a day, so it can be too long for adults on my behalf. <br /> <br /> Both of these stories express concern. Children who seek to find a legendary floating island in which it is a fortress. Children are not only looking for this island. They are also looking for pirates, army and spy islands, and are helping to catch their children (Sheeta, girl, Anna Pauquin's voice, girl paju, boy pronounced by James van der Baker) to help them find them. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Graphics are excellent ... realistic pictures of the pictures, especially terracotta scenes illuminated by torch lamps, or beautiful scenes of bright, sunny days, sa With the cloud, or incorrect. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
