I watched this movie on TV a few years ago and did not give full attention, even the first half was absent, so I came to the conclusion that it is neutral and rated. I decided to reconsider it last night to see whether I missed a bit for the first time in the night. I have done This is one of the most annoying and amazing movies of all time, and it has definitely influenced movies today, and probably has its impact forever. I can not believe that this picture was boring! <br /> <br /> A young John and Bart Reynolds gave their career performance and Ned Batty and Ronnie Cox supported it. This story will haunt you for a long time after being hated and intimidated, it's really awesome. Oh, and I've mentioned that the theme song is great, as well? Well, and this movie should be watched by movie fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> Everyone will see this film for the experience. Just do not expect a picnic.
