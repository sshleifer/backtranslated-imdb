This movie is so old that I could never realize how young I felt in 1936 in Ray Millennium, I think she played a great movie "Lost Weekend". Ray plays Michael Stewart, who is a very rich banker. There are three daughters in this picture who are not happy with their parents separating and they want their father to marry a young blonde, who is looking for a father of only a rich sugar for digging gold. They hire a man to make a very rich calculation, his name is Countija (Mihaa Auher) who is always drunk and perfect and gives lots of humor throughout the picture. When Dina Durban, (Penny Craig) was booked at the police station, she surprised everyone and told the police chief that she was an opera star and then Penny started singing with the most amazing sound voice. Began to be convicted, which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this movie. It was the debut debut of Dinar Durbin's first film and she achieved instant success at night and after leaving MGM she became a major film star with Universal Studios.
