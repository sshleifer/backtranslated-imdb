First, do not expect another snatch or lock stock to go to Revolver, it's a different gangster film. <br /> <br /> I saw the cheek in the other night and the film clearly divided the audience. This is a movie where half the listener will leave? What was that terrible, and half the thoughts would leave? It was awesome. Personally I like movies which I do not understand, such as Mulholland drives and general suspects, so I've enjoyed revolver. <br /> <br /> It was certainly not perfect. I found that the big turn is moving a mile away, at least its part, and sometimes some empty null vague left direction is good, revolver leaves become obscure without a lot of questions. There are also some scenes and scenes like animation where the Soretta goes to a murder (actually one of my darling), but the visible scenes were only there because they were awesome because they were not suitable with the film. <br /> <br /> But there were many good things. I was pretty impressed with all the main actors, Jason Stratham, Ray Liotta, Vincent Pastore, and even Andre Benjamin (who was a fantastic surprise). This film has certainly kept me interested, a great, suspicious, action packed, scene after another. When Ray Leetta entered the arm of the table ... it would look good. The script was very well done and the soundtrack was mostly with the Ga Ritchie movies. <br /> <br /> A step below these films, such as Fight Club, Mulholland Drive, and the common suspects, it was still a great, awesome, psychological, action movie, many twists and tunes in the scenes and scenes, after you finish the movie Keep in mind
