This is one of my two favorite favorites in this new version of "Pilgrim Sole" and Twilight Zone. My comments in the new series have been mentioned, this new series lacks a bit. Maybe they have to learn that the lessons are much more stressed. It's a little more dirty and sensitive than the version of Samling. However, this episode may be considered very sensitive. I think the appeal is that they do not do any work, lovers can not be united. I'm not surprised that the Korean film "Il Murray" (later "The Lake House" was rebuilt) I think this is the first reason I saw this episode, so it destroyed the effects of the next film.
