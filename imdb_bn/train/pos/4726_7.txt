The source of this movie is a mystery to me, because I know how much IMDB did before I rented it. I think before the "Starship truppers", "KilShot" was one of the countless non-profit pilots that did not make it network, cable, or otherwise. The new title of "Kill Shot" has been thrown at the rising edge of opening, it was the first incipience to speed, which was not intended for cinema. Quick cut, Chess "Melrose Place" music, and the short 2-second upstream shots of the main actors let you know what you're doing. <br /> <br /> And I do not think all. I saw this movie broken, which saw Caspar Van Deen and Dennis Richards in front of the volleyball net on the rezakking, they might be interesting to watch them in a movie as well as the Sareey Travie of Starship Troops. (An excellent book, in my opinion, a movie is not so hot - but that's another review). After seeing it in IMDB, my roommate and I saw that the pilot pulled the pilot after the success of Truepers and Richards (see Bond-Girl and Wild Things Reference Here). They run into sex scenes involving a small character to reach the RR position - volunteer in the video rental section. In any case, if you are trying to sell it in suspense / softcore porn section, they have to keep it irregularly. <br /> <br /> To everyone, it's entertaining. I like to hide the fun fun of telling you a TV pilot, though. This was the biggest tension when watching - when you expect a movie movie and get a TV show, the differences between them can make them more clear than usual. <br /> <br /> Will I rent it again? No, I will watch this TV show? Well, why not - Beyonc√© is better than that. And their small efforts to hit all populations will be good back in the mid-90's. Token Black people (Avoiding taboos of inter-ethnic dating), Token Asian (Japanese, I guess in the name of Kozi) Women, beautiful, intelligent Latina is more skilled in science and computer than talking to pre-meddled students. All that is being done for her, except for all the bank accounts of her family - perhaps it has been decided. <br /> <br /> But as a movie it just cracks me. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 7 out. Of 10, it is considered what was and what is considered. It's made for a very enjoyable evening, and that's all I ask for rent.
