Dogy is a wonderful movie and Ranu clippers are excellent. So North Bakr usually plays most of his role. Alongside Kairi, it is an example of the best movie in Maryam. There are some parts of both the films that are leaning towards the faith - it probably can not show the film in some scenes of social communication. This scenario is likely to arise from the filmmaker's political concerns, but the film is realistic and it is not necessary enough to be moving. But in addition to this little little cobby, it is a film that is seen more and strongly recommends. Sumitra Bhav's concerns and humanism stirred up.
