There are better ways to make a movie and the worst way and this is very ex. What is more accurate than what this short caper listener gives? It presents a simple story that tells you very clearly with enough advertising to remove, then it just gets better and better. Clooney's Camio is fun and very welcome, but Leam with Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman can easily create it themselves. Ridiculous and funny, so in the end, welcome to the Collinwood welcome welcome genre of the addition.
