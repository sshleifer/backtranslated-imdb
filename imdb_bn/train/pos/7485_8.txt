I did not hear some good things about this movie and probably saw fewer scores here at IMDB, and that's why I avoided it. Today they showed Vanilla Sky on television and I was not good at doing ... and when it started, I had a hard time doing any good work. Vanilla Sky is a terrific, sad and sensitive movie, I actually saw quite a bit. I was amazed by how it was influencing observers. It's hard to explain, but your appreciation of what your feelings and changes are going on to your feelings during movies, and it's a passionate journey. Vanilla Sky touched me in a way that is very rare for any movie, or any media. <br /> <br /> I really recommend everyone to see this movie. Whatever you have heard about it.
