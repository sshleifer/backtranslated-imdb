36-year-old Johnny Kennedy died in September 2003. There was a terrible genetic condition called Dastrophic Epidermolysis Boulosa (EB) - which meant that her skin was literally closed in half touch, causing her body to be covered by harmful fever and led to a final battle against skin cancer. During his last months, Johnny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Clarotan to document his life and death, and this was a movie that was first published in March, which was an uphill, confusing and provocative humorous story of a single person. Ebay did not move away from the deadly reality, the film was also a celebration of a complete life. Created and operated by Patrick Colarton and first shown in March 2004, the Boy Who Skin Fool of the Year has become the most talked about about the documentary. It attracted nearly five million viewers and donated half a million pounds to Johnson's charity agency Debra after screening. Johnny Kennedy has set up a Johnny Kennedy Memorial Fund to raise one half million to keep one million pounds in succession.
