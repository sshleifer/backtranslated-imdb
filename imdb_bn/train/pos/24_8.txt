Although it was probably a low-budget production, performance and songs in this movie are valuable. Date is one of Walken's few musical roles. (He is an incredible dancer and singer and he shows his acrobatic skills as well - watch for Cartwheel!) Also played Jason Connery. A great children's story and very likable characters.
