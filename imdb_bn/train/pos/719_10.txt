Although the film is impressive on its superiority, it is completely closed. Without any doubt, this film should be considered as a modern classic. Basically I like two types of movies - movies with depth (chick flicks, if you definitely - I blame my wife for this), and a stupid comedy where I can sit back and relax. This movie is a perfect example of the next. <br /> <br /> A friend of my release soon turned me into this movie after the release. I feel a bit shallow, he said to me, "You have to see this movie, it's just your movie." Offensive attempt, I started watching. I know they have mentioned Ramon millions of times, but when you actually see them, I said, "Hey, it's Ramones." My friend answered, "I do not know they are a real band." I was in my moments of glory. <br /> <br /> This movie, though somewhat dated, must be seen for a Ramones fans - or for anyone else that matter.
