I hope this film will be run-of-the-mill romance of 1930s. The boy fills the girl, falls in love, loses the boy, the boy finally wins. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays the con artist Eddie with all his usual charisma and naughty eyebrows raising. She is hiding from the police in Ruby (Gene Harlow) apartment, when she falls into the bush in the bathroom, less than that. Instant chemistry He worked hard for a while, but a girl could resist that green for such a long time. The heat between them is clear, and some scenarios which are definitely pre-production codes! When a blackmail works poorly and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for "boring girls", she is unhappy and her roommate gives thanks to her anger, Eddie thinks that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow Hard Nose, quick talk Ruby plays perfectly drama. He does not let Gable get all the best lines! Playing "their song" in his piano is a particularly moving scene which has been perfectly played. Last 15 minutes crying to me. Really sweet romance
