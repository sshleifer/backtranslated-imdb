He's an excellent picture dealing with an old man's life as the years back. In the beginning of 1910, he reminded his son and young adults; His family, friends, romance etc. Very nostalgic pieces with a bittsweet end ... "All things in life get together, and a river goes through it, and that river disappoints me." Worth watching.
