It may be better to have been guided by someone with more experience. Shamlin did not do bad thing, but it's not a great job in the industry of cinema. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful movie. I used to show it to local channels. Graham Greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. Some pretty bad films have been made from his novels and stories. (Many love "The Folele Idol" but I'm not among them. I think I've seen "Brighton Rock" many years ago and liked it, but maybe I'm just a novel lady.) It's a great role. Charles Boy, not true, came across as Spanish. But he seems to have the perfect mood for this character - tired, alert, caring. Lauren Bacall is going to fall for her as a British girl. But supporter of the best player: Katina Packson is also excellent. Its performance is a little Grand Guignol, but I'm the director that features that. Peter Lor, who first met, reads an essay in a universal language as Esperanto, as it always looks nice <br /> <br /> And Wand Hendrix can break the hardest heart. She comes across as a steady first teenager. The character wants to be helpful. She works her best. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Not without reservation. Reservations Initially, it is a little rigged. But stories and acting can be very rarely corrected.
