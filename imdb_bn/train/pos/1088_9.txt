Kerry Grant and Mirna Laure want to build their dream house as a perfectly middle-class couple. It all starts with reasonable plans and expectations, which are bitten by both the numerous complications and the blast of the original budget. <br /> <br /> There are many great smiles (even if the story is thin) fans of adults or the comedy style entertainment in the end of 1940 are sure to entertain. A 1948 audience which goes through all costs running a contract will feel excessively excessive when a particular highlight comes. He makes his exit, he confirmed the client (Grant) that perhaps he could achieve the total or at least $ 50.00 to $ 100.00 reduction ... but of course $ 25.00. extremely happy!
