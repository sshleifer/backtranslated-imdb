Although this series ran only a season, it stayed with me for 20 years. It was up to and far above my favorite cartoon all the time. I would give something about it in DVD or whatever format I can get. If you find a way to see this series, then I suggest you take full advantage. The first of this series was (my opinion) that there was a real coherent story that spread to multiple episodes. It also cares about the true characters and what happened to them. Hack character Huzur actually fear me sometimes She was weird at that time. The team leader also reminded me of the combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones. If there is any way to contact the creator / holder of the series rights and find them on DVD, please do everything !!!
