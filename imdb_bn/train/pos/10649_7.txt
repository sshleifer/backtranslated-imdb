What can I say about it? It's too much budget ($ 80m), and the other horror flicks of Hollywood. There is no scary, it only provides us with a few drill and a truly obscure sequence of skeletons in the fireplace. Many computers have special effects and nothing happens. Catherine Zeta Jones is always beautiful, Lily Taylor is also a good actress. The architecture of Hill House is amazing, all these memories, statues, furniture ... delicious! But I did not like the end because it was very pleasant. Check it out and create your own opinion. I give this image 7 out of 10.
