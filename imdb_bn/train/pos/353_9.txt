I'm not following a specific movie series. I only classified films as art or non-industrial. The director of Valentine after his urban legend, Jamie Blanks second artist movie. In contrast to urban legends the curtains and story lines are very weak. Yet, unlike urban legends, the fundamental elements of the movie are so awesome and symbolic, and this is the best of Valentine's. <br /> <br /> Serial killer's growing hate as the first basic and symbolic element is so much down-to-earth. Since her middle school year, she has been big with her wounds in gathering her soul against her classmate girls, who made her fun. When you pay close attention to this first element when you watch the film, you will see this view of humanism: "No one is completely good or bad. In fact, anyone who is known to be evil may be secretive." The story line and direction are very weak because just we are not satisfied as we deserve. <br /> <br /> Second Elemental Element, of course, the super-stellar splendid convergence of the late 90s: The killer of Jessica Koffil, my favorite, dies in the most wonderful way. An archer breaks his stomach from a bow and gets trapped, when he was playing hideous with dark darkness and could never meet. The first starlet to die in biology laboratory while attempting to hide the human body model of Catherine Higel's surgical operation table. Dennis Richards was murdered for the third time, though he received a Valentine's Day gift for him in the Vipulin bath. Jessica Capaso has died in the last hidden and invisible way, then she has become known as a serial killer. Marley Shelton will die in the most corrupt way that the fate is one of the unwanted ones with a vicissitude that we will never know, because the movie is going to end before being killed. Finally, Benita is not a classmate of serial killer David Boris, so Benita is there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scenery of Dorothy's house and ending the killings theme day. As far as I know the soundtrack everyone liked. Hard Rock does not suit well in any serial killer-mystery movie.
