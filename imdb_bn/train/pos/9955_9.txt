The movie has seen this movie twice in community screening and it really liked it. I work in the Jane Fink community and think that the film truly captures the significance and taste of the community in your view of the level of frustration - draw, determination, excellence, creativity. Writing, dialogue and acting are strong and I have really clung to myself in the story of young young verse because he struggles to keep his goals and does not lose himself in the process. Great dance sequence and it's not just the organization that runs smoothly and with electricity but the camera also runs intense intensity and intelligence. All characters are multi-dimensional - no good or bad and female characters are pretty strong. This is a film that celebrates the heart of the strong heart and the unbroken spirit of the community like young people like Hip Hop and Jane Finch.
