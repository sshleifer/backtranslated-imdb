The story of my family, like my father Milton Rossin Dorse played the piano of the band. After joining the band of Sinatra, my father practiced with him for several hours. Then, at one point, my father said in Sintat that he was really good to be tied to such a small band (band) and he would go to himself. At that time there was a considerable amount of 'under his belt' in the synagogue! Darcy never forgave my father, and as everyone else says history is. <br /> <br /> I have some pictures and records of this picture, so Berkeley University in California <br /> <br /> I've seen more than just a senator movie, and I want to say that his movie will not be old. . . Thank you Frank
