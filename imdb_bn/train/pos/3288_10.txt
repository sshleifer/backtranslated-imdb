This is one way cold-fiction movie. One of my faves, it's really so cool. Director Bernard Rose, who went straight to direct Kadman, he started a great start with this picture. <br /> <br /> On the eleventh birthday of Anna, a book written by Anna, a girl. He is a real man who draws a house on a covered over paper from his exercise book and falls into a real dream. The next dream that he adds to the film is changed by the presence of it. In his third dream he met a boy known as Mark. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never be something again She really gives a great performance in this film. <br /> <br /> Hans Zimmer's score is also. Like many broken arrows, the music is spectral and mysterious. It's a real shame that soundtracks and CDs are not available. DVD is available only in R2.
