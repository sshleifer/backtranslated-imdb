It's an impressive little film for a kids and not quite. John Tha is always brilliant (without any indication of Inspector Morse about him). William's son did a good job, though I did not find him in every scene firmly. I liked the whole feeling of small village and the slow pace of life at that time. I was historically correct where I felt the scenes in London, so far as I can say. <br /> <br /> It strongly reminds me of a Scandinavian film, which was named after my mother a few years ago. This picture was brought out from Finland to Sweden during World War II in Sweden. The wife of the family asked a girl about her (because she got out) she lost her daughter. Instead of getting a boy he completely disregarded her. The son complains that the subject even more issues in Finnish. I highly enjoyed the good night Mr Tom suggested that anyone film, it has to remember the same.
