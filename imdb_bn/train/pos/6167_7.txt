"Good Luck Journey" is a well-planned film, a good shoot and a showcase for some good performances. However, the story follows the mistress and extraordinary characters such as a jumble that it all plots and someone becomes a sort of master jack. Also, the western audience may find the secrecy of the obscure Percy culture near their arms around 1.7 hours. Recommended for those interested in India.
