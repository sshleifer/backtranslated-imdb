The Sniper War movie gives a true new meaning. I think a lot about Vietnam or WWII, bulky bullets, everyone dies and left alive. "Sniper" takes a new level or refine war. The film must refer to all its emotions - the helplessness of the people in the jungle, the hatred and the last reliance between Beckett and Miller, and the moment that strikes the trigger. The seemingly low-budget movie produces actions, suspensions, and flaws for each thrill, because when it comes, it's just a shot, a murder.
