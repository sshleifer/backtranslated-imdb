I did not really expect much from this movie, but it was not bad; Actually it was pretty good. This movie has the funest bit of writing which I have ever seen from a motion picture. Now, I'm not saying it's the most fun movie ever, but I'm quite happy in some parts. "The police committed suicide on my father's death, they said, he fell down a lift shutter." Now this film is not for everyone, it is mostly fools, such as Zundandar or Dodgeball; So if you hate these movies, you probably would suggest you to run clear. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie, about a group of superhero venbabs, which eventually became a real hero. This is a very elaborate comedy which many people probably have not seen yet, because seeing it can be completely rubbish like me. After watching this movie, I finally realized why this film was able to gather cast of a superstar, including Ben Stiller, William H. Messi, Han Azariar and even the good burger child. It's because of mystery man 10 years of excellent comedic writing 7. A very big surprise.
