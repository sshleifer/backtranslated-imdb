Why am I so sure that there is no other film version of this novel anywhere? I have seen the film again this year, because I teach novels and can not find the changes in the film - in the novel the appearance of the little boy is no more. They killed him in the film, but the whole thing is that he was terrified by the program in El Mors House for many years but reviewed and finally kept events behind him. Mister Bentley is a much more sympathetic character in the novel, the film scene where the cops office set on fire and the constant presence of the toy solder to show the child's presence is truly vague but stupid - Coppus is taking vengeance for revenge for women, children! I'm sure I saw a movie that is better with the novel and worse. I just have this imagination?
