Comments? Need my opinion? We are talking about masterpieces all the time and for all generations, all the time. This is the only movie that I still have patience to watch. In it, there are some types of magic like Disney movies. All the characters are "alive" and "real" in any way, so easy to understand the message, even if you do not understand the language (I did not understand when I first saw the movie, because I was about six years old). Maybe my english is not very good, but I know what most of this kind of movie has learned, and it's a bigger scale of such movies, which is very rare in the present time. But there is a big shame. It's impossible to see it in my country, or any other Disney movie! We do not have the copyright, so our kids are unable to enjoy and learn from this type of movie. So, we will again see this movie "Once upon a dream" or ...?
