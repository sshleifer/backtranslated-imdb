This film speaks a universal language; Someone may be related to self, community, society or the world of bigger. This is not the only way to open a few questions, but to try to find and find the right questions to reach that point of self-confidence / ownership. The screenplay of the stereotype in the film addresses the decorations around us, which must be recognized as the repeat cycle of destruction, innovation, creativity and anti-competitive power. Things that disturb the natural flow of things must be clearly and efficient. Idea, definitely a film should be experienced and only shows that it does not ruin the internal voice / conscience through it, it only opposes the watch.
