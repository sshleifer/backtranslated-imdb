Under the direction of well-known group DOS singer Tom Barren, this Belgian movie will not be favorable to everyone. The simple reason is that there is a clear story or even a plot. This movie shows 24 hours in "A city" (Antwerp here) and helps you to get conversations, directions, ridiculous (Dario !, Osteopath Bruno !, ...) and enjoy the tragic enjoyment and genuine (Windmill, Paul Garcin,. ..) Characters. <br /> <br /> There are many memorable scenes: Windman on the beach, finally dance party, KISS-fan, Windman osteopath inspection, ... /> <br /> Apparently something else is so beautiful and interesting in this movie Did not understand They complain that there is no story in this movie, etc. But this is an atmosphere that keeps you in obscurity and pulls you in it. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it, listen carefully music. The soundtrack is fantastic like Tom Barman and his group Dude. <br /> <br /> and "SSS, Mandey, Ditch Hey." (Do not tell anyone)
