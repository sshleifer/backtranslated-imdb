I can borrow this photo from a friend to know anything from a friend, and it becomes an extraordinary documentary about the journey of an ancient ship across a wide range of oceans. Thor Hireadahl wrote a theory that ancient echoes in Peru were able to travel thousands of miles to Polynesia in many seas, depending on some specific silk available in both places, some types of ancient seafarers which we know they were available, ocean and air The analysis of the currents, and the knowledge that Inca has made is actually something ocean of ocean Dista of travel. <br /> <br /> To check his hypothesis, the hairdresser and his crew had formed a ship closely. Ancient ecclesiastes were available that used only to use bald wood and other materials, and it was found to try to reach the island of Polynesia, 5000 miles away from Peru's capital Lima. <br /> <br> His theory, like many ancient history, is impossible to prove with 100%, but the coverage of his journey strongly supports that he is right. The film is really a little more than a description of the footage during the 100+ day operation, but it was a detailed description of what it was and its trials and troubles. I often want the academy award winning documentaries to be easy to find, and it is still interesting and informative for over 50 years, I am sure that when it was first published, I was sure.
