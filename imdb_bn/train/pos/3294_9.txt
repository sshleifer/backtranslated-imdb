This picture opened in poor show in the first few weeks. Then Mina Kumari died and it just entered the crowd. All India Radio, especially the Inhigh Logan Ne, played so many times that despite their recognition of their beauty, I was sick of them! <br /> <br /> Yes, it took so long to do this. That is why marriage was very unhappy and Kamal Amroo had trouble finding money for filmmaking; Tomb set and looking for the costume, not surprising !! Meena Kumar is not only sick of age but is listening to Lata's voice carefully. Inhigh Logan Ne shows a clear development of recorded songs, like the 50's short voice and Chalo Dildar Chawla. I just want someone to find Ghulam Mohammad songs which were not included in the film, because instead of the change, publishing and publishing at least songs for a few songs. In a recent interview, Lata (2007) mentioned Ghulam Mohammad as one of the best musicians, apart from Madan Mohan (a great personal friend). Notice that you rarely watch Dilendra songs of the songs you rarely see. Raj Kumar has a short shot from the middle distance and you can only see Meena Kumari behind. Kamal Amrohi created a quality beyond the necessity and he concentrated on the moon and the moon. Any other film, this song was close to both of them. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the best film for this, I want to be different. This means that you missed many Indian films, especially, Barasat (old), Devdas (Old Version), Bandini, Do Bigha Jamin, Garma Hawa, Dastak, Guddi, Anna, Pisa, Flower of Paper, Sahib Bibi and Golam, Kabuliwala , Present, guide, sujata, bombai ki babu, stain, parnata (old), umra jan, etc. And if you are more valuable than the story, then the list will only grow with the beautiful score of the State of Bourget. New race, Tessi Manzil, Mahal, Ag, Junk, Joy, My name is Joker: This list is really endless! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
