One of the few songs about sailors on holiday, it fulfills the normal sailor girl, complications occur, happily plots are arranged. It earns smoothly enough but it does not drag much space. The conversation is not as zippy as 'Top Hat' for example and Randolph Scott finds out the place. <br /> <br /> there is a compensation. There are a number of songs including 'Let's Go Go', 'I have kept all my eggs in a basket,' and 'Let's the Music and Dance' of Erevein Berlin. It contains Fred and Ginger, which takes a dancing image to the heavenly height and they are not frustrated here. They are a snippet top dance, a fake-out comic dance and a rolling beautiful dance, all of the same movie! Great versatility and artistry. <br /> <br /> It is also good in its role in Harriet Hillield. After becoming more popular with Ozie Harriet Nelson, she had many different careers. Here he is touching with being sensitive. Her two songs are easily and effectively distributed. She makes a good contrast with ginger but you can believe they are sister in the film. <br /> <br /> The film has made it even better by working harder. Although quite well.
