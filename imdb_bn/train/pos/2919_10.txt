I have seen the movie two times in two weeks in a movie in Arlington, Oopenton, Kent, USA. Both of the places were packed and people have turned away. In the beginning of the movie 'wounded' with Henry Winkler, the smiling smile appeared suddenly, smiling that lasted until the credit. <br /> <br /> This photo is a must for those who love American wrestling, but you are ready to see Henry Winkler as you have never seen before. Also looking for a well-known actor, whose trademark wrestling is a head-but! <br /> <br /> If you get a chance to watch this movie and this is the best comedy entertainment entertainment!
