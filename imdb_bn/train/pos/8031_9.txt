This is a military drama I like so much! Tom Berenger is playing the military killer Thomas Beckett. These marines are facing you, and any questions are asked which type of work gets the job done. There you have Billy Zen ("The Phantom" and others), who played former Swat Form DC, Richard Miller, he worked for the government and ordered them. Who needs a bureaucracy? I do not! When these are two pairs, the spark should be flying. And how to However, the unemployed teaches young bureaucracy about this work. When the other sniper hits, it wits versus v, the mouse vs the cat, the gunman vs gunman. And when the season sniper is caught, Miller has to do politics and save him. Like a politician like Beket who needs politics, he did not take orders from anyone other than himself, conducted the book without rules and expressing mutual respect even in spite of politics. The movie was directly hit. See it 5 out of 4 ratings
