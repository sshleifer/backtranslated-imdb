OK, this movie was cool. I think it was not the best movie ever made but it sure was fun. My brother and I still manage the scenes in a while, and occasionally bring the film out of the rubble, blow the dust and pop it. Enjoy all the enjoyable to the end, but a great idea. This is a film that simply forgets criticism and enjoys only. Robot Zox victory victory!
