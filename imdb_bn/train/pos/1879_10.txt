I was very young to remember when I first saw the movie. But I saw it like a second time almost 7 years ago. My sister told me I had to show it. Now my whole family remembered it. We quote at least once a day. I absolutely love this movie. I still smile after all this. Of course, it's really a really, really screwed millionare that is unlawful. The whole thing is that he still lost humanity to others that we see in the film. And she is willing to pay all for love. I highly appreciate that anyone recomend this movie. A lot of smiles Her ridiculous, sweet, and if you buff a movie, it will really change your mind to "funny". Check it out with a group of your friends or your family and I promise, you will sometimes have nothing to talk with some of the AUTHUR lines on your head. This will force you to laugh for a few years. <br /> <br /> This is very difficult in my family, which everyone likes. But this movie, I think, is closer to us. And I know it will do the same for you !!
