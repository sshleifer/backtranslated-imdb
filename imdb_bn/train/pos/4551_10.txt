Daniel Day-Lewis never heard of an incredible performance as I saw Christie Brown playing on the left foot. Actually, his role was not beyond the scene. He played Cristy Brown or was unable to do at least the film's filming, and because of his surgery, his higher role was required for surgery due to involvement with his back. It is wonderful to me and I believe in the role that he has played with all the pain, he believes that he has presented the most Oscars in the history. He was so efficient in this difficult part that I believe that nobody can be better or better than him. Although I can not say that it is the greatest movie of all time, but I can tell how he played this impossible role and still continued it until it was played, unless he was acting, why would I never see an actor. No Probably a man for that matter
