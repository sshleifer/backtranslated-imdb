The next episode broadcast in the original Star Trek series is a fun, sometimes annoying install that proves that this show is still searching for its characters in the third phase; Although flawed, 'all our Yesterdays' his moments and overall a moody, it seems mandatory. Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are bursting under a planet, since they are arriving at the perfect time to save or at least give some warning to the public, since the sunlight in the sunlight of the planet is exploding. But when it becomes active, everyone is very aware of the fate of the planet and has escaped past using a time-traveling instrument. Every person has been able to choose times and places in the past, where he wants to live in a 'library', which Mr. Operated by an elderly man named Auto. Atoz estimates that these three men are searching for past in the past, and they show different times on the spectators they can choose. At the beginning of the episode there is a little confusing confusion, such as with the line: <br /> <br /> Where did McCoy go? Atoz- wherever they wanted <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> Spock and McCoy are sent an ice age, in the past 5000 years of the planet. From here, the main focus is to punish and penalize his relationship with a woman, this time exile. Spock starts growing mental performance, showing anger toward McKay and showing Jerebath, deep affection for the woman. He finally realized that he was returning to the primitive mental state of Valkan ancestors 5000 years ago. Kirk first went back to the library and finally Mr. Do not think of Ottoz as belonging to his planet's history. Before Spark and McCain was too late, Jarbeth left behind; The enterprise throws up as three and sun exposures, destroying the planets. Interaction between Spoke and Zarbeth provides the most memorable moments of this episode, though 'English' Kirk's courage in the past is interesting. After all, a very modest next day Star Trek Outing.
