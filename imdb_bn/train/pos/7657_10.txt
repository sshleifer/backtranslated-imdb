It's a very deadly, hard hit, rude film about even a fatal hit break that goes terribly terrible. It keeps it from the date of black and white photography. Mickey Rooney is fantastic, yet wonderful as a sympathetic leader. One of the first movies of death row psychological solitude. It's pretty ruthless.
