I like this picture! I'm really the fan of Tom Hans, and I've always been impressed with all his work. From his most dramatic role like Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump, Apollo 13 and Philadelphia. A Leg of his One, Turner and Hook, Catch Me If You Can, The Lady Killers, Big and Tower Story. But in this movie, Hanks is the only great actor who does not light the screen. Tyler Whatchlin, an up-and-coming star who has made a great promise to the stars, including Hollywood as Hendes' son, and did nothing for a great performance. He must have watched for his career, I believe he will do something great. Paul Newman as always distributes a brilliant performance on the screen. She really is a legend. We will not forget the people who did not play such a big role in the film, but it still helped to make it cool. The beautiful and very gifted Jennifer Jason Leigh, who is acting in Carter of Out Carolina and single White Memory, I'll never forget, as Hannak's wife brings her grace as a film and does a great job. Another found in the movie of Liam Icon is the billionaire. He did so much bigger work on such a small role, and like Lemni Sneks and sweet November, and gave me a great performance by seeing the dreams of Africa.
