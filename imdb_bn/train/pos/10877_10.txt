I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and even though we only went out of the movie to see how cool it was, others just laughed and remarked how stupid it was. Well, it should not be taken so seriously, because it's basically a movie that makes fun of Hicker Flix and works great. It seems to be showing a different movie, umm ... the scary movie ?? Well this is the Aussie, and the real !!! Jessica Napier has done a great performance and is a brilliant future of Sarada Kants! I hope to see them more. Molly Ringwell was a good move, and Kylie had a better step. The princess of the impossible princess was the Queen !! I recommend looking at this flick, until you finally guess Raffy, Hilary and the ending of the film that ended 20 years ago.
