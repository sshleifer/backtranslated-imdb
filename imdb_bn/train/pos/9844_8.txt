There are very few movies that are so funny as this one. I was lucky enough to see this movie for a movie buff in "saved" theater, so it was not so shameful to smile until my jaw was completely painful and my eyes in my shirt were all wet from dry .... </ Br> <br /> Sometimes the story was a bit "slow", but perhaps it's the best - in the middle of the middle of the rolling part of the rest (I Almost out of the seat ...) was most welcome.
