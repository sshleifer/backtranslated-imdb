Holivides (and Indies) have removed all the shit, then we finally get a movie that provides some scary moments. There are some cluttered moments, but I'm not sure that nowadays it's possible to make a complete film. There are not many new ones here ... it's good to fix. <br /> <br /> Make sure and focus, because the "fine" fear comes quickly and often. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Cheri Christian is not an effective Julie (wife / mother). One thing, he is totally disgusting. I know, I know ... he has just gone through a traumatic experience. But the audience did not want to know him as "normal" and the relationship between him and her husband is rather uncomfortable (in an unknown way). I think the director wanted to keep some sympathy for us, but I never did that. Finally, a thumbs up for the end, which is both annoying and satisfying. At the beginning of the last credit, it can easily be compared to sound effects, but the director is very much in opposition. <br /> <br /> This is not a great composition in any way, but it's a good, old fashioned scary movie ... something that is rare nowadays.
