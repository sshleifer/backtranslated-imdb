Alexandr "Sascha" Luisen (John Tarturo) is trying to return to an Italian-hosted tournament, the former Chief Chess Player. His brightness is uncertain, but his emotions with chess stopped his growth in other aspects of his life. Natalia (Emily Watson) is a beautiful successor who comes to the same Resort with her mother, Vera (Geraldine James) to potential marriage partners out of opportunity. Vera leans towards a handsome count but, surprisingly, Natalia is fascinated by more sau cha, to whom she meets the walk. Saskatcheya was taken to Natalia and in the second meeting she proposed marriage. But, does the consignment that must be given in chess matches and its past events still create problems, will he win the heart of Natalia? Oh, and could she be chess champion? It's a lovely movie, based on the novel Novakov. Acting is remarkable, with Watson's fine little rich girl and Turturro fully as full of fullness as full of shy, awkward chess enthusiast. Gorgeous mother and other cast members as well as wonderful as James gives a good turn. As the appearance of the film, it can not be good. The scenes are very different from your eyes and eyes, Vintage costumes are beautiful and cinematography is very enjoyable. Yes, the story is unusual and using flashbacks has been said, occasionally, it creates a movie that will not be appreciated by everyone. Then, too, the end is bittersweet. However, if you like the fine art of making romance, piece of pieces, great acting, noseout scenery, or motion pictures, but do not miss it. You must be defensive in the prevention of crowds of charms.
