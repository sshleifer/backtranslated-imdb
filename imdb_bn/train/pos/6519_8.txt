This movie has big stars in their previous years: Inger Stevens never looked beautiful; Yule Brenner was a Gene Laught, who had argued about his piracy and wanted to maintain neutrality in the United States. Charlton Heiston did a great job like Andrew Jackson, but some moments were a bit pale. It really feels good to learn that part of the student's history, and it shows that the happy ending is not associated with lovers - sometimes the happy ending is that they escape and find partners of similar backgrounds. The long run will understand them well. I have seen it every year for at least 16 years; And although I have never seen the best movie, I love it every time!
