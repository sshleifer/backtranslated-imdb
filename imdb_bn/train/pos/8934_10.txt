There are two things that spoil you across L'Atruus (miscreants): Who is the infiltrator and is it any movie or dream you see? The end is so frustrating that for some time you are hurt to answer any questions. Various characters of infiltrators, different situations in which different people are not related to the scene, so they are innocent or mercilessly expelled from them, but often due to emotional involvement. The main character, Louis, is a humiliating man. He's got rough ways, some average work and no heart. He needs one and goes after it. She replaced a heart and decided to start a new life later. Could this man succeed his quest for release? A person can cut your throat in a hat drops. You know it but Clarence Dennis does not encourage you to judge. Occasionally, a young Russian woman - a beautiful girl who seems to live in some places between heaven and earth - who judged him. He might even punish him. But not Dennis. The character directed by Beatrice Dal does not want any business with him: Do not touch me, he says. But Dennis makes this guy his own, films him in his self-absorbed search. I do not know whether it is the heart or the mind of a film, but it is not the traditional plot. Whatever the movie, you get to the end. You know that "the infiltrator, you know why, less or less, and some scenes come back to you with their full meaning. But was it a movie or a dream?
