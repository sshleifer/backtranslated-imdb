One of the things I'm most interested in about this movie is that the characters and their related history develop in the fly. I think the author wanted to get interest in character by feeding our characters. The basic basis for using furniture design and construction art and craft was the similarity to a unique theme and / or life / siblings happening. The complexity of being a sorcerer works as a siren father, and even the husband adds a great tension to making this photo emotionally attractive. Also, the story was not one that can be directly related to the public (such as Jewish / couple / family businesses), but the themes are fairly universal because in each family it is a black sheep. That makes it very compelling.
