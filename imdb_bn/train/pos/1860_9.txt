I went to see Anton Fisher to find out what I could expect and was most happy. The acting played by Derek Luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent. Of course Denzel Washington did his usual fine job of directing his acting as well. It realizes that mental problems can be used to help people and this film is a perfect example. Do not miss this one.
