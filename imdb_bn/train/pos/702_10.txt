This film is one of the best shorts I have ever seen - and I have been making it a point in all the main film festivals, I have seen a lot, especially the industry considers "best". I'm not a fan of Munaghan. His performance usually continues to be extra and unpredictable for me, his only great performance on the Lost, so I usually try to avoid his films. However, I got to see it at a movie festival some years ago and was completely awed. This director really knows what he's doing. Of course, you will find chic (or simply unconscious people) who do not understand that a good film has been formed and low budget work has been centered because there is no idea at all. But fortunately, from what I have seen, they come to this jewel in the minorities. <br /> <br /> This film does not work in any budget, do not deny it and some helpful actors can still use the work, because that is certainly true. The production value is very low, but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school? Inspired for a moment that does not matter in the budget. If you take a little bit of acting then the sound quality (which was not really the fault of the filmmaker; I saw it on a festival and the word was good ... I'm sure the DVD was made by itself) and it was actually shot in a mini-DVD, So what did you leave? The story, the visual composition and the spirit of the film, which is stupidly shameless. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nanavati can tell a story. That's pretty clear. He can write material-heavy, compelling scripts in comparison to most people in Hollywood, who can fully congratulate the story and bring life to an interesting, creative way, this high budget might have received rewards. It can not complain to more experienced actors, better sound post-production and 35 mm instead of mini-DVDs and even slogans. This girl is incredible, and remember that insomniac was created several years ago, so she did some extraordinary work. An angel shows that the trailer for the dream, and I can not wait to see his high budget stuff done. 9/10 stars, it's a movie maker hell from a hell of a movie.
