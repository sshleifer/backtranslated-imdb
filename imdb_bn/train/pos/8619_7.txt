First of all, I want to say that in my childhood I remember this movie as a childhood, I could not read the subtitles and I thought Sony Chiba Shan Connie was there. But I really like the idea. You may at least partially suspend your adult suspicion and you are not able to hug your old seven, but you might want to avoid this movie. That said, seeing the 137-minute version recovering from the DVD, I said, I enjoyed it, even though I was not seven years old (I remember the last one). There are some aspects of the movie that are critical, the first 15 minutes and the final 15 minutes are some really funny moments, the difference between my favorite final 10 minutes is the difference between the funny scenes of backing and music (listen to music) . <br /> <br /> Personal stories of individual soldiers and social groups in the group are attracted to an action because they reduce the risk of their travel time duration. At the end of the film I decided that it was a good thing, when the seven 'relationship' Gough was a bad thing. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of fun for an action film, especially a couple of epic war scenes between Pluto and Hordes of Shogun era fighters. The creator of the movie confirmed that death is bloody as much as possible and it can be confronted. I think it was a little child when I was a great part of the movie, and I still say that I am not ashamed. <br /> <br /> I also like that modern day soldiers generally try to avoid changing the space-time continuity and do not spend the film on the shells, they have a lot of machine guns, mortars, rocket launchers, tanks and helicopters and they To create Japan in feats, the hellfire. What I want to think about is what a strong IMDB user wants to do in their boots. <br /> <br /> Small movies are worth watching, it saddens the viewer that there are no more movies on the same premises, and at the same time why a movie like GI offers some strong indication that Samurai is so unique.
