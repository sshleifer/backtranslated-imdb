At the age of 4, I was a Hindi film buff, but especially in Hindi movies, I have never seen such a running and influential film in my life. In the past few years, I stopped watching contemporary Hindi films and saw the classic (Taseeri Kashm, Maare Hajur, Madhumati, Mother India, Sholay etc.) but this movie changed everything. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I found it not only moving, but it found America to be very educated for a large generation of Indian woman. It helped me realize my own family history, which was always very abstract to me. But, "see" it, feel it and realize that it has helped me to be sympathetic towards my generation and to be sympathetic towards the struggles of the Indian people. The film has helped me do much from the point of view, especially considering current world events. I never thought that any movie could change me in the past ... it did. The plot is fantastic, acting fantastic and flawless in direction. Two thumbs up!
