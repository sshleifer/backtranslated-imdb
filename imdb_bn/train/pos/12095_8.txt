When American writer Edgar Allan Poe visited London, he contacted British journalist Alan Foster, who became the target of an extraordinary contest. Bo does not believe strongly in the belief that all of his Macarah's stories are based on real experience, Foster Pao and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood have taken an exchange from him that he can not spend the entire night in Blackwell's spectacular palace. Once installed on the abandoned fort, Foster discovers that he is not alone, as he has come to a number of beautiful women and handsome men and goddesses - who explain that all of them have been lost to repeat the stories of their souls. Their death anniversary! For the first time I saw this magnificent beat of the classic horror, I was full-time mesmerized. I was really frank and at the same time found the tragic movie. Babs Steele undeniably beautiful. Music score conflicts the atmosphere. The unexpected scenario threw me out for a loop, because I did not expect it. Sinapas seems to have done a great job with the film's rise, because this movie shows a fine fine for his age and the Unct International version for it to boot. This film is responsible for starting a Babys Steel and Claus Kinsky for me.
