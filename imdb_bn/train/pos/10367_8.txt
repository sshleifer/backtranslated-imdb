When I first saw "A Cree in the Dark", I had no idea what the plot was. But when I saw it, I was surprised to see it. When I saw it for the second time in the Australian movie class, I realized that the second part: communication problems. You see, when Dingo Lindsay Chamberlain (Merrill Strip) robbed the child, she and her husband Michael (Sam Neill) were unhappy but did not show them. As a Seven Day Adventist, they believed that God wants to happen, and so they could not grieve. But when people across Australia saw their lack of grief, everybody believed Lindi himself did it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a pure accident, it still happened . Regardless of the political opinion of any media outlet, it can be the biggest disaster since the existence of media. <br /> <br /> Strip for acting works very well with Australian accent), and Sam Blue is equally great. You will probably be blown away by what you see here. Of course one of Fred Schepisi's best movies.
