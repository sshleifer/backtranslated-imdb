This is a very long-awaited movie I've seen for a long time. Actor movie characters gave a wonderful screenplay. The story was properly illustrated. The story begins with a young girl from the British Isles and her father, Steamboat, traveling to Nivo, Illinois. He became a member of the LDS Church and he did not. He feels ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraged. He encouraged Joseph Smith, to read about the Prophet. That is the story of Prophet Joseph Smith began. The film correctly depicts his life and some history of LDS Church at the same time. It was graphic at times, but was needed. The emotional expression was very believable, causing my emotions to spread. The filming was terrible. The way in which the story presented was touching. After the film ended, we were unable to sit there. I was shocked. For those who know very little about Joseph Smith, Mormon Prophet, I will encourage you to see this. There is nothing but understanding for some of his life. Those church members, I'll encourage you to see it. It will increase your testimony to this incredible man. It's a must see.
