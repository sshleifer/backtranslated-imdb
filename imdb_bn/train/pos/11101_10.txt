Probronus was probably the last best show in the 90's. It's sad that, on TV, it was the best show at HBO, your mind was not spelled everywhere for you, it was brilliant. Cast was excellent. Tony (James Gandolphini) is a great actor and his character is excellent, as well as acting in others. Each character had errors that made them so real and allowed them to connect with the viewer, and this was one of the reasons for it lasting. The last episode was good, I'm not sure how many different things it can be taken by the last ID can mean that Tony does not die, but frequently goes in and sits with them and the Blackout was just suspicious. Tony should go for trial and the agreement is not like death that I feel ... Sopernos and Tony Soprano live for a long time .......
