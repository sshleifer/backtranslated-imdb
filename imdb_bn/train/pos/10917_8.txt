I could only hold 3 DVDs of Celestial Region of five genomes and what they did a great job. Must be a fantastic digital remastered transfer and a Kung Fu fan. <br /> <br /> The story is straight straight, and has already been mentioned so I will not have to go into it again. Not saying that it is a war scene that many people buy movies, and they are not frustrated. The only problem is that they seem to be a bit fewer and far between and rehearsed. Bruce Lee can drink a cup of tea at the same time! All the kicks and punches come with all the important "type authors" and the wind "johannes", which is quite cool although a cool effect! <br /> <br /> I give this movie a B +. Good but not great. In a way I feel it could be that bit better. It was a decade ago by the same director Golden Solo, a story and good action as well.
