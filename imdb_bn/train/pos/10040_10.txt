Personally for me this film always goes down to my top four. There is no hope. James Cameron has repeatedly proved himself to be a major storyteller. Through films such as Alliance, The Aubis, and both the Terminators, it is clear that he was a bright and trustworthy director until action and science could be imagined. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But the Titanic is much different than the other strokes of its brightness. The film is running exceptionally well and is a story of astonishment, development of the plot and the development of interesting stories that everyone knows. The legend of the famous pirates drowned on his first ride, so Cameron's challenge was to create real, interesting and entertaining movies about it. Acting is great, Leonardo de Caprio, who played Jack and Kate Winslet, who starred in Rose, became a superstar as soon as the film was released and most of the films became disturbed when the letters of support are not for much but it is more about this movie. Objective is because an elderly Rose (Gloria Stewart) tells her story, it is Dru It is visible that it is the story of Rose and Jack alone, not anyone else. It is mentally satisfying mentally and can keep a dry eye in the theater or home. Music became icon and legend. It's a composer James Horner's greatest soundtrack and much more inspiration from movies and audiences. After so long the song has become boring, but I still appreciate this phenomenon and this movie. Just one problem, the normal James Cameron problem, which is memorable but a bad way as to how much of it is in Chesi points but all that aside James Cameron has delivered a lifetime and a romantic epic that will remove you from the journey of life. My heart does not have to go from this one.
