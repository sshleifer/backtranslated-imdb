Hoping to see another nonplotation movie with the unplanned mother Supriyor misusing her abuses and torture, Flavia is much more than my expectations. <br /> <br /> It's actually a feminine story, though I do not think there is such a term that exists in the era of the movie set. It certainly has not been practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very low and lock in the scars of men in society. During the whole story, Sister Flavia (Florida Balkan) could not sit there until she was witness to her period of torture and could actually do something about it, although the result of the disaster. <br /> <br /> There are Flavia as a young teenager near a battlefield in order of pre-order. He saw an injured "evil" Muslim soldier (still some one alive) and tried to help him. Before that, his disgusting fiancée father soldier and wave his head titled his head (great family dynamics, huh?). After this, his father forced him to join a convention where he was a witness to more injustice. Although violence, rape, and nuns are involved in the scenes, I would consider more in this historical drama than nonpllue. In fact, there is a lot of material for a trashy piece of absorption, but acting, camera work, storyline and music keep that level very good at it. Most of the "noon" movies I have seen, the main basis is: A good girl flies in a convention in a convent, where Mother Superior is one of the greatest dogs who likes to whip people and / or live their life. <<br /> <br /> The first part of Flavia movie is spent most of the time asking questions about all the tortures surrounding her. Forgetting most of his differences, he is familiar with powerful souls (but a little naturally - he likes to come out like me, but it is very easy for the boy) sister Agatha. When a group of Muslims attacks their emotions, Flavia and Agath are not afraid of other nuns. Their attackers actually work for their freedom fighters (cruelty and cruel slavery). In fact, it is not a Christian, Muslim invader, which inspires the beloved sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, well, well, let's tell him, his Muslim lover deserted him at a very overwhelming period. I do not want to give too much to the rest of the story, but be prepared to be frustrated, devastating and sad to conclude. This is a great movie, so in the trash epic it will not be closed by the (unwanted) fame. Plus, how could a movie in Florida, Balkan and Claudio Casino, be wrong in the world? I am not familiar with other works of Maria Kesar, but sister Agatha is a character hell. <br /> <br /> I have read many great reviews of Sinepas (US) release, but I copied my German X-Rul Kult DVD. This is not anaphorphic / 16: 9, but in reality there are more pictures of information than all the other than Synapse's publication. <br /> <br /> and there are many great, intelligent or funny lines of dialogue. Bone from Agaga <br /> <br /> "Why God Is Male? Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ?? They're All Men!" Flavia <br /> <br /> "These men are scared - look at them, sisters - their fear will be taken away from them!" -Sr. Agatha (about Christians fleeing after the arrival of Muslims) <br /> <br /> "Woman, where are you going? Moslem can not do anything to you that Christians did not work! -Sr. Agatha (a group of women of shirk) <br /> <br /> "Bless the Muslims of these Moslem - fear of fear of this pompous Christian." -Flavia <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as a runaway nun. The idea of ​​the film came from the incident occurred during the invasion of Italy Musalman, even today it is considered as the matrodrome of the 800th Antantanto "
