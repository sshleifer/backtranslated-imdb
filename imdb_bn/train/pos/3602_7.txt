The story of moving to boxing for self-esteem and anger is a new thing, a fresh twist is given when the story is a girl instead of a boy. <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a problem at Diana School. He can not just stay away from the fight. His father is constantly putting him down at home. His brother Jim handles boxing and one day he takes him away, he decides that he wants to train. <br /> <br /> This picture will be easy to say "girls with Rockies". But that's not all about this at all. The story basically benefits a lot from the main character as a girl instead of a son. In this way you can deal with more problems at once. The daughter of the girl is not the daughter of the girl or the girl's daughter, because of not having her daughter, she must ask her daughter because she is a girl girl. It's a story of how a purpose can change some life. How Positive Things You Can Grow I do not want to say this barbaric term, because the movie does not always seem boring, but what I am saying is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is very good for leadership. It is shameful that she is now trapped in the "hard girl" type castcast, because she is not really part of "Girlfight". Sure, she's a female boxer, but more sensitive moments that really make her shine. So perhaps it's basically your average painful story, but Rodriguez has lifted it above the crowd. Performance. I rate this 7/10.
