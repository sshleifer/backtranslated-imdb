First let me tell you I am not from the south but I'm an American I do not love domestic music but I can stomach it. I do not wear a cowboy hat but I will wear a hat. I do not live in the trailer, but I can eat tuna salad and stay in my house. What does this comment do? If you think that the only "country" people love this movie is one of them. This movie is based on "they liked and lost" evidence. The real instruction as James Bridges gets it as an American love story. In the era of Jerry Springer and "Keep it there" mentality, this film has truly spread out in the past. <br /> <br /> The Buddha started his own life with a little help from his cousin, and he went to a big city with them. Bud itself has pulled out the local ornaments tok alone, only a blue-collar man can afford it. She quickly meets Sissy from the same background and has a cyclone romance filled with two painful ups and downs. <br/> <br/> <br/> (* This plot takes a lot of turns to sit down and wait a few minutes before hitting it.) The wedding is a focus which is often missed. They get married at the beginning of the film and we see that being single converted from marriage. This film depicts a modern struggle where a woman is married to an old fashion man. It is also with women and competition, male ego Eat.) <br /> <br /> buda were challenged and excited when Mickey puts the electronic punk. Sissy gets ideas for it very fun but is quickly married and thought it necessary to start "acting start". The emotions between the two characters are raw and revealing and especially when they fall for a pre-con with split and Sissy a tendency to abuse and cruelty (thinks that the story's story provides a bit more). He soon realizes that the grass is not always green on the other side. <br /> <br /> It's frustrating for me to see someone who can compare Bude to Vinnie Burbino. John Travolta was a worthy recognition which gave an exceptional performance. She was trustworthy and real. The scene where he bows his beard and you first see him in the bar. I do not think I'm a huge Trouballta fan, but let's see why Cinci shot his boots so early in the movie. Dev Winger was so real that you showed sympathy to yourself because he wrote a emotional note to Bud to after cleaning his house during his break. <br /> <br /> Supporting cast was incredible. Wess, who played in Scott Glenn, gave the first-rate performance, which hated him and cursed him and cursed him. Madeleine Smith-Osborne was so reliant on the Buddes / Girlfriend that the big-chested girls in the United States prayed to sleep in the flat chest to get dressed clothes in the United States. Take my eldest Cudo Bari Karin and Brooke Anderson as aunt and uncle of Bund. They thought of cousins ​​and uncle in Texas somewhere and although their role was small, they made the film so big and alive. Two memorable scenes featuring Dolly Part contest and unforgettable scenes where Boad and his aunt were standing outside after the death of Character. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Then I recommend that you take it for it ... before that a movie that gives world visibility as our own but enough for us to enjoy and entertain. If this world sounds like you, then you will enjoy it more. Finally, if the music date is more than 30 years old then be sure to send it back.
