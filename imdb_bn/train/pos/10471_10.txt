I still enjoy this picture because I wanted to help this guy! I have many friends in my fifty years and music business ... who are still becoming adults ... a fan, group, money etc. ... and their hard time adjusting is a regular life ... they are new band etc. Spotlight As soon as it gets ... It's almost like a new start ... This movie is a rule of many of the 70's and 80s old rockets. Now it's going on .... and from there I'm sorry and depressed about the film. But it depicts an old rock star abandoned and lost-a credible way. A young girl who reached her little house reminds me of Hollis McLaren (abusive) ... and she is a woman who will be happy for you in any film. This film must be for 50 people who saw the rise and fall of the band, who knew the members, and watched their age as frustrating and fades popularity. This is a perfect movie ... .sad but a positive way .... because the whales. A must see!
