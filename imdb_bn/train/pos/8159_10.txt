OK. This movie is a pure delight. It has been so violent that a little suspense and many black comedies have been mixed. The dentist really started to loose his mind and he was enjoyable to see it. Some people in this movie, though. Either you'll love it completely or you will absolutely hate it. A good movie for Rent and Watch when you can not do anything else. Also recommended: Cyco III
