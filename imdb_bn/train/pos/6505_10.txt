Theo Robertson commented that after WWW, it did not properly cover the conditions that led to Hitler's rise and WWII. <br /> <br /> Perhaps she missed the first one and one quarter hours HOURS volume 8? This period is clearly involved, and clearly shows the current condition together with the previous dimensions of the series. At this time a friend of mine grew up in Germany, even in the Hitler era, and his experiences were similar in WAW. <br /> <br /> This documentary is far from historic documentary documents. Own, there is no comparison. <br /> <br /> Just wrong, and this is a small one, which is with me: numbers are not often included. For example, if you are talking about debt-lease, then how much war was done / rental? How much is Russia, how much? How many merchant ship U-boat sank, and when? How many ships were there in the German or Japanese navy in 1941? What kind of they were How many soldiers? How many soldiers are in the army, in total? Most visitors can turn off the audience, but I liked it more! And naturally, I'd always like to see more military analysis. Why did Patten and Clarke keep the German army in Kernyne, when they surrounded it, instead of racing to Monty in Rome, and let it run away? I do not think you can begin to understand the issue of war until you saw these video sections like "full war", such as Dresden's fire bomb attack. Before looking at clips of death camps, trying to understand Auschwitz, etc.: You simply can not wrap his head - it's incredible. <br /> <br /> At that time, the unknown, and the course, undefined, was the most harmful cruelties and inhumanity among the Japanese, including sympathy (refer to "Flyboys"), and some live vivisons of medical "test" prisoners, w / o anesthetic! <br /> <br /> Dave
