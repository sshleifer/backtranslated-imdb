Daniel Steel's father, what a refreshing story. This film has glorified the importance of the family and the parental importance in their children's lives. How rare is that? At this time, "Heather has two mummies" (or which one, you fill in the empty space), it will be easy to see why this theme is not for everyone. Being the father's role, I hope it will be another Daniel Steel Saga. It's frustrating to see how it's ending. Each character was important and did a fantastic job of carrying their role. I would love to see each character develop for years. I like this movie, it's every time I see it unselectably. Good story, well played, and I hope it does not have a spoiler, but no restraint gender or bad language. Yes it touched my heart. Alert, get ready for kineneks. What I'm happy about is that this aspect of family life is rarely portrayed in our entertainment, whether it is television or not. There are movies. If Daniel listened to you, you give us more to Gar Girl.
