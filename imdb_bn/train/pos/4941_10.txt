I believe many people are not rating the movie below, because of lack of quality. But it does not follow the ideal formula of Hollywood. The conflict is not solved in some. Finishing is very little practical for others, but providing a long list of journey-rich characters and supporters is both both anxious and very entertaining thoughts. Even cinematography makes the city setting fantastic, directions are excellent and innovative. <br /> <br /> This is 10 of my books, this movie will take you to the usual and expected Hollywood script. They took some risks and some things are different. I think it did a good job, I was deliberately trying to avoid direct references to the film because it's a good answer to see for yourself, not accepting anyone else's explanation.
