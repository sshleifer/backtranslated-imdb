It's not 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'Thelma and Lewis' but it's a great street movie. It slowly and easily sets up its two main characters. Visitors learn the underlying tension quickly, which is a tribute to the director. The young French (and English) boy who wants to work well in France, is a French girlfriend who drinks alcohol and drinks as a young man. And his Moroccan Arabic (and French) father who sincerely follows his Muslim faith, rejected the new culture with the knowledge of wisdom and elders and (surrounding mobile phones) around it. The film can explore very powerful politics - the movement of the odd couple through East Yugoslavia, through Turkey and then to the Mecca through the Middle East. These are areas where the Muslim population is engaged in war, suppression, ethnic cleansing; Where the autocrats followed torture and brief execution to hold power and where religious communities are in constant battle with each other. Yet these films, such as the place and the possibilities, leave such agendas only with hint. Relationship between the two is the core of this film, and Belief, Politics Backdrop. It seems that we all have to understand and care for each other, and to manage this world well. This is definitely not the 'natural landmark killers' and it's even better.
