Here's a movie that's fun at just one moment. How does this movie grow up to the makers of South Park and is it managed by David Zucker? When I first saw this movie, I did not quickly realize that Cop and Doug really were Matt and Tray but their talent in acting and writing was quite impressive. I am amazed that they were really Matt and Trey, later. Humor is doubtful, sometimes stupid, sometimes brilliant, sometimes subtle, sometimes robust and sometimes stupid but overall, it is a film hell which is doubtful without any doubt. Well, its crazy. Completely insane.
