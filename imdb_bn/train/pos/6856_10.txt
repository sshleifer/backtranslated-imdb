This is Brian De Palmawith amazing performance around a fantastic mysterious masterpiece! It was highly suspenseful, and often scary, and the score was fantastic, plus all the characters were awesome. Yes it closes a lot of psycho, but it's still a nicely made horror / thriller, a fantastic opening and a frustrating and uncertain final! It's the best horror / thriller I've seen perfect, and the lift scene is sometimes one of the most memorable scenes, plus Michael Kain this is simply amazing! The last nice, and in the end, the hospital scene is absolutely awesome, plus the last stage comes out from me! It failed to find me, and the rope sequences were absolutely brilliant, plus Nancy Allen and Keith Gordon were fantastic chemistry together! It's a task suspenseful masterpiece with amazing performance from Brian de Palmer! Guidance is incredible! Brian De Palma works incredibly here, the amazing camera work, the incredible angle, the superb use of the color, the awesome zoom-in and the zoom out great Pov shot and keep the movie at a fast pace! There is a bit of blood. We get bloody stabbings, knifing, bloody gun wounds, and 2 bloody slit throats. Acting is awesome! Michael Kain wondered here, he was amazing, obscure, very liked, mysterious in acting, and really a tremendous job I really did him fairly! (Caine Rules!). Angely Dickinson gives a memorable performance here, and was quite beautiful, and was well chemistry with Caine. Nancy Allen is fantastic, and fantastic here, she was very cheery as Hooker, had excellent chemistry with Keith Gordon, and made a great show! Keith Gordon was very good as a kid, he had excellent chemistry with Nancy Allen, and was very liked! Dennis Fronge is as good as detective. Above all, it is one of the best horror films created entirely, and immediately leave your work and see what I say! Out of *****
