For the past five minutes, a delightful gentle comedic jewel that runs in the British Television Force Mills The last five minutes cost me my rating 2 points. Despite this main plot and style errors, it is valuable for the character acting and unique Cornwall setting. Enjoyed a lot of delicate little delights, like we have swiped Clerk's credit card for eternity after waiting for bank approval ... When we are not making more piquant - mostly sure card cards are not maxed.
