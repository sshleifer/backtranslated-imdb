I was superb in this movie. It was fun. Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap. This 70's rock must see the course for any fan. (I hope my and my friends are not like 20!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Steven Ray is perfectly fit in the film It's been as if the glue is trying to hold the band together, but it's not good. <br /> <br /> If you like music and are in a band, this movie is definitely for you. You will not be sorry to see this movie. I do not know if I do not. Even my family found it interesting, and that's something that's saying.
