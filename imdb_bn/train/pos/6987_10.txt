UFO "things" aside. This was the best documentary I saw. Incidentally reporting by Neil and Buzz ... one must definitely see. Interviews and reporting were an unlikely because most information was kept secret in 1969 and was only published in 2006. There is no short description or accuracy of this documentary date of 47 minutes ... the facts will throw you away and you will be taken to the moon first risk ... Neil and Buzz are probably the biggest hero of our time. Ever see a man saving his life? Not good Whenever Mili-sec separates him from death, then blue saves his life. Wonderful to see This extremist man does not tell all the details related to the landing of the moon and failures that faced the failed death, the computer failed ... 10 stars!
