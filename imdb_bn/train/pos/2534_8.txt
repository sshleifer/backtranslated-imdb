Scientists who work frustrating detachedly find ways to detect a meteor impact crater carrying a new radioactive element. All of the (pseudo) science and breakthrough technology discussions in the 1930s are well-formed with the notion that radioactivity can cure any illness. When he called his competitor - who drove him out of the scientific community and ridiculed him - as a witness to his discovery, they offered a 'joint' campaign in Africa ... Of course they are mostly Dr. Rukh's original discovery, giving him the remaining residual credit. Alongside this, the literal sense of the rare painter who looks as the comedy actor from the worst Abbott and Costello (Loton) literally means Dr. Rook's young trophy wife (Drake), who bowed down on the heels for the scraps of the man. Being a deer like horn is not going to dr. Rukh (Karloff) is friendly, so he embarks on a secret revenge mission ... his 2 enemies are killed and friendly Dr. Bennett (Lughosi), who helped him ... finally leaned towards deadly radiations that began to take revenge on him, but (my extremely dissatisfaction) committed adultery and he was married to poor excuse. The acting is mostly fine, Karloff and LuGosi are very good. Look at the strange chambermed scene ... other characters are not significant ... many like the proposed, old world scary ...
