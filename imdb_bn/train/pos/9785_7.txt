Let me be the first non-Australian to comment on this topic :) I got the movie for hugo weaving and I finally saw it. This is one of the movies of "living drama", because my mother calls a movie that describes a real life story with a great event and it is mostly descriptive. <br /> <br /> I like the light and the girls. The rest were without much guilt, but without too much merit. I have something like interviews, or at least some matrix villain elements here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary. The story teaches you to face your own fate and others are freed from the environment created for you, but when the life-giving patch of this area is closed, it does not require much effort to change things. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Background" To the end, I think it has done its job to present a part of Australian life, but to me it does not seem to be particularly Australian (it can be placed anywhere) and it is interesting as an interesting Do not seem to be <br /> <br /> I think there should be a certain mood for choosing the movie.
