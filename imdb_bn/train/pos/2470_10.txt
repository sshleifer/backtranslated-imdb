After the initial shock to publish this image of Mr Brunge, I literally trembled with the excitement of taking this epic forward in front of me. I was not frustrated. Shakespeare is so true and so accessible. It blew my mind. I'm always glad to see it, or rather listening, brunch and it made me wonder ... this movie is dubbed in another country? That Mona Lisa will be like a painting painting.
