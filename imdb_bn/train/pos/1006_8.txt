In recent years Robert A. Heinlinn's classic novel, Starships Truppers, was often associated with the Games, a 1997 movie series by Paul Veriovien, which was mostly in the games. But none of them could speak, the genre of his novel was really captured. Games are not generally related, the TV series was more spin off and at least Vereovan said good about the movie. Little know, in Japan, an animated adaptation has already been completed, the year of Heilin's death was released. And, despite its differences, do not believe it, this 6-part animated series, Plot-scientist, is the most trusted adaptation of Heinelen's classic. <br /> <br /> The most obvious plus presence of this series is the Armored Exxlaton, something we were deprived of Verhoeven's film. Like the book, the chain focuses more on the characters and their relation than the series of action and place, although we see the fair amount of each. There have been different incidents in comparison to the books of the book, the intricacies of the book are present. Rico and Carmen have a romantic entanglement, but compared to the book it only touches a little more. Although some may think of the meaning of dialogue and character a little less than the book (it was a bit of anime treatment, but what did you expect?), But it is very different from the movie. The political views of Heinelen are only excited, in contrast to the film, where they are opposite. The big money making of the series, the army of tiredness and climate war between the bugs / aliens, the kind of work we saw in the operated armor suits is that we want to see a movie version. <Br/> <br /> Overall, I enjoyed this series because I wanted to see a philosophy near Heinelen. And I think they did quite well with this. If you can find this series, give it a look.
