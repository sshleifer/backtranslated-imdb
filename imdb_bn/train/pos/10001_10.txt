Leslie Ann Warren's extraordinary performance. The best dramatic hobo lady I've ever seen, and someone else in the love of the scene in the clothes warehouse. The corn on the mouth is a classic, as well as burning Saddles. Lawyers take too fantastic to take On the allegation of having a tornado, she sold her boss, and complained about the misuse of Pepe Bolt's lawyer, "I am a lawyer" Three funny words. Later, Jeffrey Tomber, a favorite from the Larry Sanders show, is also the supernatural, who is a crazy millionaire who wants to crush the oatmeal. His character is more savage than usual. Hospital scenes, and scenes where the homeless attack a debris site, are all-time classic. Look for foot scenes and battle for two big diggers (one bleeding). Every time I see it good (in most cases).
