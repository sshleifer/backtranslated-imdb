Sometimes, Lady Lick smiles on me I originally created - and copied - a VHS tape of this wonderful TV presentation. <br /> <br /> Recently, I subscribe to the digital cable, and while searching through the upcoming movies, I went there to me. The surprise movie was a scheduled broadcast. This time, but I made a copy in the DVD so that there is no scope to repeat my mistake. <br /> <br /> I finally got to see it again after eight years, and it was just as exciting and intense when I first saw it. There is a little bit of this story that the first contact with my "Pandora's clock" came with a direct reading of the book on public radio. I got protected from the broadcasting station on the way home for lunch, and in the first installment, I was blurred. Each day, I look forward to waiting for the next chapter to read. <br /> <br /> I learned a few months later that this book will be broadcast on TV on TV, I have confirmed that schedule for my event <br /> <br /> First of all, I want to say that this book was true for the book, in contrast to what another critic said. That, itself, is a rare achievement for TV movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about casting. I could not imagine better choice than Richard Dean Anderson for Captain Holland. Indeed, the film can be crashed and burned without proper creator for this important role. Anderson was never good, and shameful that we did not see him much. In fact, Cast members did all the fantastic work. <br /> <br /> My only complaint with the movie and the book - was to intercept the "terrorist plot" for bringing a personal business jet, air missile from the air and its pilot has pulses and shoot down the stricken plane. Basically, we're talking about 36 hours and running and running such a plan, which is not realistic for all the players involved. It was also not realistic how much the plane affected the first plane, then its two engines were flown out. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the beef, and I feel very reactionary, how the foreign governments are depicted in films as well as in our own films. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, do it all the way.
