If you are a fan of Zorro, Indiana Jones, it is obviously a visible sight. Directed by William Witney and John England's SS Team and played by Reid Haddle as Dan Diego / Zoro, this serial is distributed! I will not carry you with the plot (who carries? Low talk, more war); What is the key issue here is the interpretation of the characters in the character of Halle and Dell Van Sekel and Yakima Cantt Stunt Work. <br /> <br /> *** STUNT SPOILERS FOLLOW *** <br /> <br /> You can see the effect of this picture in Lucas and Spielberg - the original version of Zero Star Wars has been captured by a trash compactor on one side, A roll bridge is trapped in the Ala Temple of Template, a riders transfers the coach from the horse and flees through a tunnel, Baddies hit on a huge water tank and flooding tunnels behind him, Md. Just as the Ram temple dumera to Indy. In addition to all this, Zoro has a great key to leaning against Jerro's villain with his traitor Lash. Most of the work of the sword is the language, apart from one of the chapters, in which a dancer from the sword / stunt legend Ralph Faulkner has a sharp sword dispute, which shows the rare screen as a bad rodriguez. This is the first serial I have ever seen, when I was young at Vetu in Matini, and since then I'm hesitant over them. <br /> <br /> Fighting Zorro LeJian "Z" supplies the product!
