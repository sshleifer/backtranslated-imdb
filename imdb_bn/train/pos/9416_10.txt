The White Suite man, like all rights to Jack, shows a low vision of both labor and capital. Alec Guinness is a scientific talent - but a wonderful one (he accidentally stays in a college laboratory ... a mistake ... he has earned his university degree). He managed to push himself in various industry labs in the textile industry. When the movie starts, he is in the company of Michael Gough and Gaffe (momentarily momentarily) trying to impress his mother-in-law (Seychel Parker) in the shape of the ship in the firm scene. While eating lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter (Joan Greenwood), Gabe's lab unexpectedly receives a message about some problem with big budget problems. He used to spend huge expenditures (due to Guinness examinations), and his coffee with his eyes. <br /> <br /> Guinness is working on Parker's farm, and has repeated the same tricks with Gaf√© - but Parker also invented it. . Greenwood has discovered that Guinness is working, and believes Parker to continue testing (but now legally). As a result: Guinness and his assistant can clearly create an artificial fiber, which can change electronic bonds in its molecular structure, so that fiber (for all purposes and purposes) gets better. No textile made from this will never be faded, will not be dirty or wear it - it will last forever. <br /> <br /> Stuart has support for the female store in Guinean, but not his main. He sold the Guinness to the rich and saw that. But when he explained what he had said to them, they turned against him. If everyone has clothes that will last forever, they will not need new clothes! Soon, Parker's colleague Texle Tycun (headed by Gough, Ernest Thaising - a wonderful performance and headed by Howard Merion-Crowford) feared that their businesses could end. They want to suppress the inventions. Greenwood is in his corner (though he is sympathetic to Parker), Guinese tries to get public news about his discovery. <br /> <br /> To the end, Guinness is defeated by science and greed. But he sees the film wrong in its calculations and, ultimately, we think he can stop his invention for a day. <br /> <br /> This is a bright comedy. But the logic for suppression is valid? At one point, the disadvantages of making textile are shown (You need to heat the threads at high temperatures so that they can actually combine the ends of the elements, there is nothing that extends the cloth if the owner is fattening (or the contractor becomes thinner when the owner is thin). People will only want a set of clothes? Fashion changes and what's new style? The cloth is made only in white color (Guinness is considered white). We are told that color color must be added before the process. Will this affect the chemical reactions that maintain the textile structure? <br /> <br /> A science paper, but a film about labor and capitalism in the modern industry. As it is bright. But the questions I have mentioned make me bother about the legitimacy of suppressing the discovery of Guinness.
