I absolutely love this show, but I saw the first of the second episode. After seeing the first episode, I can see why people first stop. First season humor is not good and they struggle to start the series properly. However, I still like the show's light and humor attitude. After the episode, much more develop and become really enjoyable characters. Like the first episode, it really does not really represent the rest of the show correctly, which is really good. This episode is not bad in any way, but as a show it gets better and better, so look for more episodes before making a verdict on the quality of the show.
