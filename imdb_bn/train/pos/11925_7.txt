I happened to catch this movie of cable in one afternoon. I must admit that I was never a big baseball fan, but sometimes I could get a good sports-related movie. I found more interesting Foster family system illustration. A therapist who saw both the community's mental health and dowry both good and bad, although I was refreshing to show a movie rather than showing this film which was taking people from family to family, biological parents are always active participants, and heart-breaking and heart-melting That may not take the infection. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Danny Glover brought the film anchor, and both very credible performances. Maybe it was my emotional state, but I myself torn a tear at the end of the film.
