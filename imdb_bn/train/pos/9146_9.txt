This electromagnetic musical has more than a rock of confidence from its star, the colonial genius that is Prince. The film is posting 90 minutes or so but it is really easy to see why it is such a classic classic. <br /> <br /> It is an indication of the drama to add a level to this musical number, like other young films, who are trying to grow young struggling young people. Although the film is not as good as the recent 8-mile example, it does not entertain at least and the soundtrack is even better. Some dramatic story centers around a young artist and a regular spot of a club around Kid (Prince). The owner of the club is frustrated with the pride of the kid and Kid knows that he will be fired very soon and the rival will replace him. On the one hand, the problems of the parents of the parents of the kid are misused by his father. During the film, the child has learned some lessons in life, and his friends are learning to appreciate more. Of course we saw this in the age of drama, but it is a musical instrument, combined with a very stylized music. <br /> <br /> Cast is good. The prince is actually pretty good next to the drama, when he did not hit a pose. He seems to be related to humans and As well as offensive father as well as Clarence Williams. Apollonia makes a good debut for the love of sexy love of the Kotro Princess. <br /> <br /> The original power of the movie is superb soundtrack. Musical numbers are good stages and electrifying. Prince is no doubt a musical maestro, although very bright. When he was inspired he was great but he often sang for his taste and sometimes his test could be like a miss, but it is the same for many musical antagonists. The soundtrack for this movie is excellent though, only a weak point in Sexshare. The purple rain show stand-stop performance is standout though. It's one of my favorite songs all the time *** <br /> <br />
