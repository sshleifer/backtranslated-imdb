If you want to be folk and patient, you can mention that on May 1, 1945, the round lancer bomb was severely wounded, that was the German defense of the air that Adolf was alive like Hitler on that day, but this is not a movie that is a drunken audience Should be seen by and added literally poignancy to assume a character killed in the last hours of the war. In fact, you could have survived in World War II with full appreciation of Buddhists, beauty and vibrant Powell and press master masterpieces. Today the scenes of heaven are painful? Again when you see the context movie it has been made. The RFF bomber command has lost 58,000 people during the war, the same name is lost in America, but within a short time and active fighters, there are atheists in a fox hole, and if you lose, I suspect you are a relative at the time of conflict, an atheistic material atheism is an intelligent Want to see as things. When the young pilot of Richard Attenborough was scared of his vision, many war heroes began crying in this scene, because they thought that a lot of comedians who did not live in the war. Also remember that even after losing millions of people from 1939-45, fewer people in Germany seem to be passing through pearl gates. This clear Nazis will not go to heaven. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If that was not mine, I did not have much appeal. For the symptoms, you see an issue or life and death is a very political and visionary film that will end the British Empire, because it is replaced by American ambitions. There are little things to show about the film made by people aware of American history and culture. One is America's ethnic mix, even today many Britans think that America is heavily formed by the Hello Anglo-Saxon Protestants, when in fact 51% of Americans "White Europeans" The first revolutionary Aleppo, who admitted to Peter as "I am an American", was admitted to the film in the American War of Independence by British forces, where "I am an American". As a "special relationship" between Britain and America - a special relationship? Powell and the Pressberg know their history when it comes to Britain and America. They obviously know their future <br /> <br /> Remember your mind and your mind in this movie in the past. It's a weird, beautiful, cute and cute, but mostly a film that will not work in the last 40 years. The story was set in 2003 and revolves around the British soldier killed in Iraq?
