Re: Pro Jury <br /> <br /> While the main actress Stringing is beautiful, this plot has little scope for recognition because there are many confusing details in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> Some people can believe that in the 1950s, the girls of middle school girls in the middle ages easily leave their virginity without thinking of their 30-year-old marriage, but I doubt. <br /> <br /> "Easily give surprise to wonder"? What is a reminder about this film remakes? Actually <br /> <br /> Someone can believe that the young high school boys are very confident and confident, when they communicate with their elders in complex social situations, but my experience is more than the children they are so scary Thinks and they make lady test in the world. <br /> <br /> Do not you see the world around yourself? <br /> <br /> One after another thought that an experienced medical doctor does not know Strontomychin's acute medicine - the aromatic bacteria of busy earth's germs - and it does not detect that some useless soft powder mesh, but I think No <br /> <br /> and another "experienced" aspect drowns from the experience. Dandi <br /> <br /> Someone may believe that 30-year-old may have some problems and can roam inside, while building a school school in a school, and creating a problem at school, but I think the school Socially traditionally a protected environment and parents, chaparones and school staff will be pretty close to this. <br /> <br /> Now play a good game and you tell us what you seized in the institution. <br /> <br /> Five teenage friends across Hey Babu Riba have mentioned themselves as four people in a final night. Perhaps an explanation was probably why five were four, but because it was not detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> There is certainly an explanation possible. The pavement that works out well! Now I'll be the general and will help you with your fun stuff: Although it has been translated as a common "four", the word "Chitovka" has another meaning: a game used to design a 4M or 4W set of games, CREW CONSTSTING 5 people: 4 ROWERS and a COXSWAIN <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is not true for me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
