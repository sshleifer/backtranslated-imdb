"La Mann at La Paine" is the most beautiful movie ever. And it can be related to the most current film related to reality and industry, inspired directly by Prost's "La la Richer du Temps Pardu". <br /> <br /> In fact, "La manman la la payne" and "looking for a lost period" clearly tell the same story: One of the failures of love, which is repeated continuously. The name of the first woman is always Gilbert and the second lady seems to have been mischievous and distorted by Gilbert: Veronica is a beautiful night "slut Gilbert", and Gilbert is pure and "beautiful as a day". After the first love failure, the second love begins, but this one has already been destroyed. Veronica took Gilbert's place in Alexander's life and movies. For the first time, when he arrived at the time of Grabber, when Alexander waited for Veronica, he hurriedly It shows that this same sad story, like the same Alexander, speaks of the same unbelieving woman, who comes incessantly - and professor of unreliable love professor, which makes it available, which also points to his illusion. <Br> <br /> The reason for the difference between what is outside - the delusion of love - which is true, and an education of this truth. For example, when Veronica curiously puts Alexander in bed, she replies that she watched in a movie and then, a film "It was made for her, how to survive, how to bed, learn how". Alexander wants to live like a movie, wants his life art. <br /> <br /> This art of art comes from the idea, with which the Eastern political industry rejects the reality and the realism of the industry. The idea of ​​the "La Mann at La Payne" art is against the concept of "principally political" - for example, a playback review of Alexander's political film. Like Prost said: "Art is not worried about these announcements, and only silently exists." First of all, the art is introspection. And why are the realism or naturalism rejected: the art must be converted into a real form. Proust wrote: "I discover the illusion of reality, which is a lie". Because of this, "La Mann at La Payne" does not hide its artificiality, the actors wrote through their text "Kadar": "The more artificial you are, the more you go, the more you go." /> Eustache and Proust both artists share this idea that an internal translator is a "translator". However, Alexander succeeded in Ischette. "La Mayman at La Pauin" tells us about the failure of a real character. When you go further into the movie you may be worried about the tragedy, which is tragic. You can see it in the face of Alexander, who is seeing more things like living dead. You can see it after the scenes are long and nothing happens after a while. At the end of the film, when you see Alexander's writings, and Veronica asks if he writes his life, you can guess that he did not, even literature failed. The end of the film shows Alexander's symbolic death, which is destroyed by reality. And in this small nurse's room, Alexander looks more like Albertine than Marcel. <br /> <br /> To illustrate this failure we can say that Alexander is a Balzac reader. In "Form and Signification", Jan Ruset explains that readers of Proste, Swan and Charles Belljack can not create any artistic, because they are really trapped, which they make mistakes with art. They see the reality of the art and "are not aware of the artistic and industrial changes, in reality, with the reality, of the unchanged transformation of the life of the industry". And that's exactly Alexander. He, for example, claims that he "loves a woman for paranoia, because he has played in the example of a brusson". He's like Swann, who loves Audit because he looks like a woman in a bottle of a bottle. <br /> <br /> "Life is probably not my profession". These thoughts really have been erected, committed suicide, even if Alexander said it. However, there is a difference between Alexander and Esterhey: If there is absolutely Alexander in Christ, more than twice in Alexander's art, the horror of the artist, which inflates his fears. <br /> <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, Alexander Illusion is condemned. This is the death which reminds me of the last frame of the movie Jein-Pierre Leod as well as the continuous packing of Veronica. Or maybe it's already hell, which gives the last description, like it does not like the final release of Sartre's "Whit-Clot", and "Le Temps retrouvé". If Eastwick used Proust to read, Alexander could not finish the book, always life and Veronica tried to read in his apartment or cafe, he bothered him. "La Manman et la Putin" is twice the opposite of "searching for a lost period", which says that Alexander is not an artist, when "A la Richch do du Temps pardu" says Marcel is a writer (genetic) <br /> <br /> <br /> If like an artist, like an artist, "reality in the light of dreams," his nightmare is that in US, we call it "La Maman a la Payne".
