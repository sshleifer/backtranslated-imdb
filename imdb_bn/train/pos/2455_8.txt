This is a good film, but it's also predicted in America. Change the Turkish family for football for Kung Fu and Pakistanis, and you will see almost the scene for the band "Brick Break Backham" (2002). The Kung Fu master, with the emphasis on several occasions, is an excellent feature that works as the main part of the movie, progressing with the mysterious Nijjar on the highway, starting with harmful damage and gradually progressing until the fight against the last fight. At different levels, Danish life has been released separately from the picture that is from outside: Non-indigenous immigrants who make a large proportion of Danish citizens (in fact, the majority), graffiti in Copenhagen suburbs, taunting immigrant girl cinemas. When listening to the Danish word, everyone remembers a different image.
