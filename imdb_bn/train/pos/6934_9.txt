Winchester '73 is a great story, and that's what I like about it. This is not your everyday western - it uses a rifle that passes from different characters - as a process to tell the story of these people. Rock Hudson plays an Indian head, Jimmy Stewart plays a great leader with heart and strength, and Shell Winters plays a girl to deal with the reality of her husband and the wild west. It is important to look for politically correct types - many of them in this film kill Indians without regret. According to today's standards, it is still quite violent. But it's a great story and worth watching. Enjoy!
