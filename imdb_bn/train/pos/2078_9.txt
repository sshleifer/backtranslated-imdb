Pearl S. This adaptation of Buck's film is certainly a classic. A true Hollywood epic, it has a great Hollywood film that has everything: birth, death, happiness, sadness, joy, frustration, etc. Just one thing that irks me. I know it was a sign of time, but the two main characters are not played by Asian actors. Paul Muni was a great actor and he did a commendable job as a farm owner of Wang Fung in China. Louis Ryanier plays Olan. She does not even look at the Chinese! I think he tried to take the role, but his role should have been done by Anna Mayang. I know why they are not, and Mrs. Ryanyar is very good at the film, but they tried to "make" her appearance pure. It's still a great movie, especially if you read the book (I was in high school several decades ago). One must definitely see her, just look over the welding. I think you can
