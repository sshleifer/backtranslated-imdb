Gentt McDonald and Nelson Eddie, this "modern" musical star reflects McDonald's classic skills. 40-year-old musicians seem to be having fun at the 40s fashion as per the current trends. Eye-popping clothing and sets (yes B & W) add to the supernatural, dream-like qualities of the whole film. With "Handsome in Yuri Eye", along with a funny jitterbug number of Movies with Movedonald and Biny Barnes, the film promotes many good songs. There are also huge cast edward avartan horton, regalen owen, mona meris, Douglas daumril and anne jeffres. Extended bits are found in Esther Dell, Alimira sessions, Grace Heil, Gertrude Hoffman, Rafael Otieno, Aadet Mirtail, Sicil Cunningham and many more. <br /> <br /> Excellent look at McDonald's is fun and beautiful. In her jitterbug / vamp routine. She could do it all.
