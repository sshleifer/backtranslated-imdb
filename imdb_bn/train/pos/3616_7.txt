Unknown Michel Rodriguez as Diana was a stroke of casting talent. She is absolutely perfect. Her acting inexperience actually works for her. We've never seen him before before we really feel like his story. He brings genuine power across. Although this works against her, we do not suspect her because. He does not want to win because he does not fight against a warrior, he does not seem to be able to beat. So as a boxing movie, it fails. <br /> <br /> Again, this is not a boxing movie. How do you want to be a boxing boxer who does not have a boxing movie? You do not But kareen kusma anyway Like many Indie films, "Girlfight" reflects classification and it stands in its own name, which can happen in real life. <br /> <br /> Diana is working badly in school.
