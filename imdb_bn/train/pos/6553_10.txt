It's a comfortable wind breeze when a movie actually gives you a start, middle and end, a nice, cute mystery, which gives a story line with an interesting heroine for all ages, who conquers us with our wit and elegance. The film of Andrew Fleming is really a modern phenomenon, which is an old-fashioned old story of the Hollywood model. He kept away the dependence on special effects, which now exits for entertainment and gives us a great movie with a very capable young actress and a talented supporter Cast. <br /> <br /> This movie is an old book, but it has updated enough updates in this century; However, the props might be different, the heart is still a good mystery, and here is the tricky, one that is the old tradition and the varied relationships of contemporary youth. Emma Roberts is an old fashion girl, who believes in good behavior and respect for others; Boring absent details from today's movie. He is still good enough to get the attention of the boys but he knows how to respect the present poise and self. He earns his medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little madness when needed to achieve his goal. <br /> <br /> During our California vacation, our heroine dragged me into a mystery of Hollywood. Actresses who were victims of playing fouls; Suddenly, he "inspected" his ghost and closed it to a series of events that could be a solution to the mystery, or it could be a bit awkward. The film is quite entertaining because it says that its preamble is nothing compared to the scene in California, and it is well presented without being involved in unnecessary pornography or any graphic or excessive sexual intercourse. Finally, the viewer has considerable control over the viewer to make it all the kind of entertainment to viewers of all kinds of viewers. This is a movie that is worth seeing, praising and enjoying, it's a rare and dramatic movie, and is not afraid to be classified as fun! Five stars
