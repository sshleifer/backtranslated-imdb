It's actually a fun show, like Tim Burton's film, in an extraordinary way. It's a look, worth as much more creative than it sounds on this season show. After all, this is not a "reality" show. I wonder why people are ready to accept public shows (which are lacking in creativity) and are so ready to ignore wonderful things like this <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > It's really unusual. More enjoyable than "ghost whisperer" and "medium" I think this is the most interesting thing in the tube, "My Name Yearle". <br /> <br /> Oh, and the description and music are wonderful. If you see that Pete's stone looks a little bit away, then I would recommend it. It's not weird as Twin Pix, but it's got a serious knot for it.
