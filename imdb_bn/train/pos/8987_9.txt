I recently heard it from IMDB.com and I am confused and confused in the premises. I knew very little about which of these bands, but I think "the last junket of the world is not before you" before and by Danny Wahholes. Who says, my perspective about this doc is: <br /> <br /> This is an incredible topic about this movie, which does not require any prior knowledge of these bands. The director (Andy Timner) did not waste time to attract the audience and to get acquainted with the people of this movie. I quickly became animated in both Anton and Courtney and their respective bands, The Brian Joanston genocide and Daddy Warhols. I think this doc does so well and this is what makes a main documentary, Andy Timonar. <br /> <br /> I also like how the "stories" of these bands are told. The most tour you see in the band is the band. Both bands start out struggling to struggle in small places or in the recording industry. Throughout the film, each band is unique by the norm and the effort to remain uncontrolled. But it makes these two bands the same, and in this way a bright perspective about how the two bands of feather can go. <br /> <br /> I basically recommend for someone who likes movies in general. You do not have to have a special love for the documentary, or the band. Compassion helps in music, however, the music takes a backset for love / hate relationships between the Brian Jonastown genocide and the Death of Death Warhols.
