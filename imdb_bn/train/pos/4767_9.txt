I do not see how this event is like OC. <br /> <br /> First, Oasira is trying to overcome the lives of adolescents and their parents. Workers at a North Shore Hotel are trying to run hotels and at the same time doing social life. Second, the OC was held in California. North Shore is held in Hawaii. <br /> <br /> Why would Fox do the same show as other shows? I think in most cases a great show with good actors. It has a good story and plot. I like events and how people care for them and their work. The recent episode is astonishing by how the story works. Most of these shows were not predictable like most stories. <br /> <br /> I hope Fox puts it in the air.
