Well, it definitely looks like something else managed by Lynch. No supernatural elements, no violence, no prejudice Yet, it's a nice flick. It was a bit slow but perhaps deliberate because it's an old-fashioned 6-story story (this is my best estimate for its time). Characters are everyday people and thus, they are trustworthy. The performance was good and the final scene was incredibly touching. Anybody can have a sibling related to it. Lyle and Alvin have nothing to say. For a moment they come back in the old days and forget all the war.
