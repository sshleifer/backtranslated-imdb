It was a very enjoyable film. A ridiculous, but moody appearance family, and the obligation to come with it. A man's story while coming to town from his parents' bathroom in a small Chinese village town. There he learned to earn gratitude, and he also concentrated on what he had left to go out of the house. The film is visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful.
