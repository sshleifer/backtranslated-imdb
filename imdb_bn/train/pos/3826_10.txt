I love Korean movies because they have the power to capture real life (in fact silently). I tend to see only the Korean movie that reason alone. I've seen this director other movies before. The closest thing to me that comes from me is that of Osce and another awesome movie, The Charming Girl. <br /> <br /> However, my title summary can be found from a Christian perspective so I'll start <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm always waiting for a Christian film that really illustrates dark shades of life in the church. Because Christian movies speak in a language that wants to talk to them in different languages. Many movies with religious spirituality, although in spite of good intentions, only resonance with a Disney movie or school is particularly important. They need to show life as they are. The real people curse, the real people want, the real people fall. And although Christians believe that salvation is found for those who find it, we are still challenged by the daily fears of this life. And the character of Do Yen Genes is a completely honest and almost cruel illustration of a woman seeking God, but because of the nasty realities of life, she lost her love. He does not deny the existence of God. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "If God is love, why would he let such terrible events happen?" This image does not answer, exactly so. And I believe the last 10 minutes of the film, though open to explanation, leave us with hopeful future for our original character and "concealed sunshine" brings the idea of ​​full circle. <br /> <br /> I do not believe in one second for this movie that it tried to be religious or tried in any way and set it up. It is false because it works more because. It's true, it's honest. And because of that, the short story of the real Christian life I saw in the film briefly.
