A meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a Plesiosaur that used to terrorize the area near Crater Lake long ago. Locals tried to eat locals and they tried to kill the giant. <br /> <br /> Recent efforts to send old horror and science fiction movies like the Lost Skeleton of Kadra and Alien Trasas, when there are movies like Crater Lake Monitor found for your screening. It's a movie that robs these movies and only sends it. This is the film that only cheats on the cheek and it tries to make it even more fun. It's a real drive-a movie that's coming up with unfortunate fate like Star Wars shows our special effects. A mix of monster, stop motion and a life-size head, a ridiculously short little creature. Movie makers are the giant and his danger often damaged the audience with the shot. Sure it's all fake, but do not film about the suspension of disbelief? Actually I think it's really cool about monsters, which has this. <br /> <br /> I like this movie on low budget drives in a way. Any remote eyes you want to drive a real authentic genius movie. This would be suitable for a double or triple feature with the same lake giant films (Boggy Creek etc.).
