Although it's crazy as the classic predecessor (ZOMBI 2) as I actually like this one is a choice. This is because of faster speed, better settings and great 80 soundtracks. It has loads with action and the sweet elegance effect by Lucio Fulci. Zombies 2 do not look quite nasty as ZOMBI 2 but they still look good. It has been created quite well but it definitely has it's share of kindness; For example some zombies move really slow when others ninjas as fast as possible. Some are curious when others say funny lines, but who is expecting the continuation of the Italian horror? There's even a flying zombie head! How is that red? Of course a gorehounds and zombie fans must definitely see. It will probably also satisfy the maximum number of fans of action films. Also check out Zombi 4.
