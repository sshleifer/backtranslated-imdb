First off, it's a nice series, although ours have a James Bond effect. I think the new Casino Royale incident happened in 2006, it gradually became the first 007's courage, Dr. No. 1 (1962) Second, Golden I., Pierre Brosnan's first movie, Judy Dunk, has been mentioned. As a new replacement for the male "M", how can he possibly start it before the bond is doubled from the age of 14? This thrilling one "poetic" license is less or less.

They had colonized it, they could reinstate it and eventually destroy themselves, but they could not send themselves "raggetag" forces before finding the mythical cataclysm, only a habitable but obsolete planet can discover, that they become human beings colonies Who had finally discovered the ceylon. Time break? Of course. Which one came first, chicken or road? Who care? It is fraking friction!
