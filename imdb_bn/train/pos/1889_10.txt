Since my first appearance in the film, my family has seen Stumble and Stormer in Arthur Bachch. We have memorized most lines. I saw it two weeks ago and still shows the picture of Doodle Moore after seeing the usual humor and visions. Liza Minelli has done a great job as a side kick - though I'm not her biggest fan. This movie makes me just enjoy watching movies. My favorite scene is when Arthur is going to his drunken house. Side-spitting her conversation with Butler and Susan's father. Butler's line, "You're waiting in the library", Arthur replied, "Yes I want, the bathroom is excluded from the question", my new mail notification on my computer. "Arthur really is" fun thing "!
