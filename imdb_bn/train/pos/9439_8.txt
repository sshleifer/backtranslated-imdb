Before watching this movie, I have heard a lot of things and saw some scenes from the movie, but I did not do it for listening, so I saw it and wow! Ned Batty, Ronnie Coax, John Voight and Burt Reynolds have created an interesting group of people who make the Kahalawesi River final and the worst events move on to all of them. The developer of the character may take some time in viewer with a better understanding of each person, but eventually you know these friends that they are your friends. Acting, the conversation is very real, near realities you can get to play Hollywood. Reynolds's character "Lewis" was very interesting, which became very difficult, but a very soft and broken man (I was influenced by his performance!) Under Manley Cavalli, seems to be the most characteristic of Zone Voight Spotlight, finding the unfortunate situation that he is in the corner They seem to be putting them out of the mold, and eventually they are different people (His character conversion was excellent). Neid Bati and Ronnie Cox really feel like a stupid Lunankhed, they just do not like to have fun, and if they do not, they do not seem very serious, and they ... I really am surprised by the views of Dick's novel Boorman, very influenced. You can not go your whole life without looking at this picture. I figured eight out of ten stars, highly impressed.
