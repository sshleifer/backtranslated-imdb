This picture was pounding my heart. The acting was great, boyfriend music and beautiful women added this one winner up. When the main actress expresses her feelings that she has no time with her husband, she agrees to join the Accord service. She is the step of being another woman in her first client in a completely new world. This is definitely a movie that you definitely do not want to pass.
