First tell me the director has some wonderful use of the title in his shot. I really enjoyed them. I really enjoyed this movie but it is quite unlikely that Greg Kahn is to say beside Pierce Brosnan. Brosnan melts very well in this character, it is very hard to remember that this same man played bonds. It shows its range and depth as an actor. It was kinda like an Indy Flick and especially with mainstream movies, the films were nice to watch in the year's flood. I found letters to be well matched. The twist in the middle I was particularly well felt. I like how the characters come off realistic There are so many images in our film that are not actually letters but walking-stereotypes ... I like the different ways of this film. I think of this movie when I think, but I think it is more spectacular and overall a good film ...
