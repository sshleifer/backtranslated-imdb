A season that has seen all the seasons, I can say that JG always surprised me. I mean, you see her moving away from laughter to Panooa and after every little gesture of her, you believe that she is a gangster, you yourself think: OK, she is a good actor and she can go into a gangster's skin. But after opening his eyes and struggling for his life, I mean that he was "pained" about that I almost felt he was going. I touched her performance so much that I immediately thought of Robert De Niro, Marlon Brando and Al Paseino. These guys were definitely even better in their generation. But nowadays they are old or dead (Brando) and it's just that they make less movies and their performances are "lighter" than them. I can not wait to see the Gandalfi in other movies where he plays a completely different role. Can you recommend me some of her old movies where she gives a memorable performance?
