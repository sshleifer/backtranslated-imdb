At the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably in my feet. Never film, and I never mean, lets give up the action. It may be a light action, but its step. Once again each member of the cast fits perfectly. The explosion was realistic, the Chase scene was feasible, and the war was incredible. Matt Damon will be forever in Jason Bourne. <br /> <br /> I really want to say that every Bourne movie gets better and it's no exception. Action, occupation, plot How do they know how I do it I appreciate everybody in this movie for writing plays on the screen. Because if he did not do such a big deal with the first movie then we would not have to talk about this. <br /> <br /> So do not go to see it in the theater, experience the theater if you are still there, but if you do not go 11th December, you come to Bourne!
