I do not expect this picture much and did not know much about it. I love it A very good, tight plot, ugly, lean, deaf girl, and a curved hook as a former angle, and a speed that rush fast. <br /> <br /> The same director, De Batter, is a much better film than Mon Coeur s'est arret√©, which was boring and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> The only thing that did not quite work is that the ugly, fat girl was not ugly or fat: difficult, of course, and away from the traditionally beautiful, but with so much character in her face when she was taking the screen. Fantastic I hope he has more films, and generally better ones than he. I saw Gilce's wife a bit and saw a bit of difficulty, and both of them saw garbage, and I saw all the batsmen, and that's definitely the garbage. She seems to be coming some, so I will keep my fingers crossed.
