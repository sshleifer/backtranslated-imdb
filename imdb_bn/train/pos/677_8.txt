**** Spirited Alert **** All of Australia becomes the result of summer rains and the size of baseball sizes like hail cities decreases. Under this violent situation, tax lawyer David Burton, Richard Chamberlain, was involved in a defense attorney, involved in the death of local indigenous people living outside the local Citizen. <br /> <br /> Billy Karamen, five casualties indigenous Aboriginal colonists were ordered to be executed by the policeman on death penalty, that Billy did not sink due to violent crime in his throat and shoulder. Yet instead of killing five people in the court, instead of murder, they have decided to file five cases against them for genocide. <br /> <br /> David did not receive any help from them to defend his defense. Billy took him to himself and took what he had from the court. David Gulpilli, an opponent of David Gulbilli, really wanted to tell Billy about his death that David's dreams started to attack. <br /> <br /> David initially did not understand his Christmas dreams seriously. That's when their court meets him when their real. Chris saw Chris in his dream that he found David's dream of showing a strange look black rocks. Later, he met Chris, and what happened was a trash of Shaman, Charlie (Nand Ji Warna Amaglua) who came to his house in the evening, told David that he had got spiritual powers like Charlie that he had inherited from his mother's grandfather. That power will reveal him in the future, which is related to the strange weather conditions of the flood in the Australian continent. Earth, Chris tells David that smoking with the old world is going through a smooth cycle and the new world is ready to take its place. <br /> <br /> What is confused about both David Chris and Charlie Tell him, but the rain continues and sea waves are starting to grow, something seems terrible. David wants to know whether it is all indigenous folklore or some scientific information, or logic, at the end of their worldwide expression of expression. Now it is clear that both Chris and Charlie are an indigenous tribal member, the modern Sydney heart rights. That alone can stop Chris to kill Billy, as well as get his four friends. As the Australian government does not succumb to tribal indigenous people, they will leave without any trial by their tribe. Yet Chris denies that he is a member of a local tribe and he and his four friends have been convicted of genocide for Billy death. Within a few days the judge will hand him over. <br /> <br /> Chris was taken into account by Chris because of the reason for Chris Silence and finding out why Billy was going to die. David has discovered that Billy has betrayed Chris's members of the tribe, not accepting Bill as a member of the African indigenous community. It has been informed to David that Charlie and his rituals are rave. Both Burton, David Parslow, have said that he himself had a spiritual connection with the Austrian indigenous people. <br /> <br /> Now the stage is set for a great and final clean cycle, which David sees both in his nightmares and day-to-day outlook. It comes from the Pacific Ocean in the form of a tidal wave in Sydney on the Sydney coast of Australia and then sunk the entire continent.
