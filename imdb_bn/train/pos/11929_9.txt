However, the premiere was held at the lasting The River Rivers Stadium, which was then home to Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Stirlers (pirates) now in Phenic Park and Stirlier in Henze Field.

Danny Glover, Tony Dances and Christopher Lloyd were present for the applause of thousands of sports fans.
