I had this a very good movie. It is very nice to see that two sisters have seen a little more about the movie, before they die, they liked the same boy. I am sure that if the movie was done in such a way it would have been very different there, that is why this move made good films. It shows that it does not matter what is happening in your life with your siblings that you can always get through it, and if it is 2 sisters who deal with a boy, (the same boy) that works with pain and injury, they will be better and easier. Is. 2 of them work out. It is beautiful to see stories of love that in somebody's life life there is such a terrible thing that you can still get closer through it. I really enjoyed watching this movie, and it still comes when I'm still. Every time I come to it it seems to be found in the observer. If it was part 2 of this movie then it would have been better, perhaps it would be a great end to the story after the death of the older sister and to keep her baby, thus it will be alive although she is alive.
