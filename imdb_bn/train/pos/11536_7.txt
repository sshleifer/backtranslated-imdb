It is difficult to show the film without worrying about the television show, especially if you like television shows more like me. But there is a lot to say about the festival. <br /> <br /> One of the top authors of the Oscars Madison (Walter Mathew) New York City Sports writer who lived in eight room apartments himself, a separation and his own lively sloppy mentality. Enter his friend Felix Angar (Jack Lemon), his wife needed a place to live after threw him for his vivid neatnik mentality. As a result, one of the most favorite movie adaptations of the train debris and a Neil Sim√≥n stage play. <br /> <br /> First thing first: I love that apartment! Poker table, innovation dart board, pictures of baseball players, empty bows and beer containers, even a pair of Roman columns. This is a place where men can be boys. Simon and director Gene Sachs, take a bedroom and kitchen arrangement to open a single set of stage in Oscars's living room and jump over the head of Oscar and Felix. <br /> Blue Hewitti's score was heard on a TV show, but as it has been, it has not been so clearly defined that whenever it is played, there are several different arrangements for creating on-screen actions. Manhattan's actual location work and night shots give the film a general power for the films that are shot at that place and time ("Budding," "World of Henry Orient", "Midnight Cowboy," "Manchurian Candidate," "Rosemary Baby," etc.) > <br /> Lemon and matro are too heavy compared to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman? To be fair, the film is considered to be a more serious matter, to deal with frustration because of the continuity of medieval divorce and not being able to build relationships. Simon "paid more attention than entering the Felix and Oscar in the Battle of Wits with" Passwords "or Howard Kosel. But I do not know <br /> <br /> Both Lemons and Matthos were great actors, especially during the middle of the film I often enjoy, as I often do in their separate movies, but I never understood why they were a great comedy team Regarded as. Here, in their best-known partnership, they seem to be acting in two different movies; Matthau in a comedy-drama between Lemon and a Frenchman. At the beginning of the match is great, we are charming with the lack of teddy-beer around the poker table, but at the end of the film, he made many changes like Jack Torrens "The Shining", Felix was cleaning and serving his apartment <br/> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When I tried to kill myself, Felix stumbled upon a lot of humor No, no, but it's a great way to get into a great comedy, before setting us up with some real life pain in order to bring warmth and smile. (There are some great shots in the city's urban areas.) The film was a misconception in the middle of the film, but it worked as a way to act as a felix pain and a feeling of sharp relief. We can see the Oscars and his poker friend being abusive and militant. <br /> <br /> Simon's line is so big. They are the underlying power of the film. She gets the bakery just right and real, and still makes it fun. "I'm not talking to you, Felix. You got something to say. I'm afraid I'm starting to listen." TV shows have shown how wrong it is to always think that the movie is good, in fact TV shows have made a good point about "some" concept, but the film creates a solid foundation and enjoys its own right.
