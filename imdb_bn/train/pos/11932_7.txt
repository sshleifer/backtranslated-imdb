I watched this movie on TV many years ago and when I got it on tape, I saw this movie. I thought this was reasonably well It was not the best of all movies, but it was good enough. The film has considerable talent to inspire many people, especially young children. The acting was good, with leading leading of Danny Glover. The plot line was not very credible, but the script was well written. This movie may be the interest of bright baseball fans. It does not apply directly to action-packed sports movies. It is directly applicable to a great movie that you can watch with your family and learn some hidden messages in this movie. Overall, the film was good, but not great. I give this a movie a 7/10.
