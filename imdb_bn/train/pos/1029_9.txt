I've got the perfect 10 rating for the series to develop 10 outstanding and consistently high quality stories and characters, it was not for the last episode of Season 10! <br /> <br /> In the final episode of "Ending" in the 10th season, where (it must be present) Asgard was too stunned, obscure and very unknowable fashion, I left him in disbelief! <br /> <br /> From the very final end of the series, it is clear that most of the story's arcs can occur at least in most seasons. I guess they quickly accelerated these stories for the Stargate SG-1 franchise for two upcoming direct-to-DVD moves! <br /> <br /> Asgar will return to SG-1 film in the future, a very good explanation of the "obvious" extinction), I think that fans have been deceived by an unexpected dry clean up <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
