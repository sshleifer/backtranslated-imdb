Cowboys James Stewart and Walter Brewin take their roles to seize a demand in Canada from Seattle to Alaska and Canada. Once there, they have to fight with the seductive, submissive businesswoman Ruth Roman and ice-cold, happy-lucky villain James McInntire. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some nice, hard-Western Western, with some great director Anthony Mannar. Actually, I'll take it, its robust action and fine melodram, any day in North-Alaska! <br /> <br /> There are some exciting scenes and painters in a distant country that should definitely be shot on the widescreen. <br /> <br /> Also, always reliable Brainen, Roman (who is superb), incredibly cute Corin Calvert and some of the strongest supporters of James McInntire, who play one of my favorite kind of bad guys do not take themselves very seriously. <br /> <br /> It will create a large double bill with the recommended Manchester / Stewart Western Western Western Bed of the River.
