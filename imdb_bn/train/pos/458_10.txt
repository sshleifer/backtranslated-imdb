My wife, Kate, and I absolutely liked the series and could not wait for the next (hope to have a signal here!). I want to know what the interesting song says and who wrote it, because I think "old and gray" and still feel interested in life :-). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, looking forward to seeing a show that contributed to the society which can still be made by adults with special skills and experience. An important part of the show, showing the interests of people's interests and the interactions of young people around them. <br /> <br /> This series is very entertaining and highly sophisticated, similar to some of our other favorites, "Spooks" and "Hostel".
