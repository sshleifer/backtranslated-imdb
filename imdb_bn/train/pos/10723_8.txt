I have read something from other users' opinions and decided to appoint one. Some of the users are stuck in a 'realistic' mentality. This picture was meant to be 'fantasy' .... a 'what will be' funny movie. It is not meant to be 'real' or serious. It was completely enjoyable for everyone after knowing it - even though the shadow of the Challenger explosion was spreading ... I was 30 and enjoyed it completely - my little boy also liked it! Later, I shared with my daughter and she liked it too. SpaceCamp is a fun family movie that should be fun - fun. All the 'realists' in the world should be mild or see documentary or documentaries and avoid any other type of movie. The first to watch this movie is that those guys were sorry and then were able to go to the original Spacecamp (one of the albums and one in California's Vandenburg AFB) - they might have been looking forward to finding a similar environment that was portrayed in the movie and then 'Letdown' felt. I guess their parents do not explain the difference between imagination and reality. Well good If you like fantasy-funny movies and do not see it then I highly recommend it! Enjoy!
