Jim Henson's Muppets was my favorite from childhood. This film seems like a kid again to me. All right, Muppets came back with Miss Piggy and Frames and his friends, Chemert. That's because they are trying to go somewhere in Broadway on a musical show where other than New York City. You can see the camouflage by the Mayor of New York City by Ed Coach. However, the film is 25 this year and I hope today's kids will learn to appreciate the Muppets gang's heartbeat. The problem of this event is lost to Kimit and the gang will have to find him in New York City. It's valuable for kids, even for me-seeing adults like me.
