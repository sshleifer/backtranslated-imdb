A classy film pulled two sides. Its advantage is managed by Wesce Crane. Looking at the TV budget, what could be more with a big budget. Susan Lukasie attracts her sticky Robert Uriachammy and tries to persuade her in secret to her health club. His latest invention, a spacesite that can analyze humans or things, becomes unexpectedly useful in the new surroundings. Anyone who sees this Susan Hide will pay attention. His appearance and performance were an unexpected response a few years later. Actor, scientist and parasychologist Stefan Armura is a fan of this movie and wrote a review of this movie. Lucasi became the subject of a portrait by him as the basis of Catherine's work on the sitter. Black Sunday's Lucy and Barbara Steel portrait was used as reference for Catherine Portrait, which was immediately withdrawn by Armory. Perhaps due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine. So by watching both films we can get an insight into another story and the presence of an unknown woman which can create an interesting movie.
