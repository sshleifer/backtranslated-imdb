When I started watching the show then I said, "Oh, no, it's a lie like Elphon and not even bloody!" And in fact, the setup is almost identical, the single young boy lives in all of his own house, and then suddenly gets involved with the fantastic courage when a sexy young girl is with her. <br /> <br /> But where stoppage of duplication The story of love is just as intense and intense as the Inuyasha, although little comment and behavior is small. The historical setup is a little less, because it is about seven people fighting with seven servants, holy grills, a famous of all the servants, half masters from the same teacher, the rules of indulgence etc. However, soon <br /> <br /> I actually saw all 24 episodes of one day and did not like it that I liked, but I was from other styles. I would say that I was very happy
