This story is a complex and surprising story of the latest harem of the Ottoman Empire, well-spoken and excited, we have seen the internal activities of the world that we now see and know about the people living there. <br /> <br /> I Enjoy stories, characters, acting and scenes Some of the Gulf's symptoms and designations quickly disappear from rapid editing, otherwise a wonderful piece. <br /> <br /> The main character, Safia, has performed wonderfully by Marie Guillen, who made me feel extraordinary. To do it The scenes of him and Alex DÃ©sz (Nadir) are charming and lovely. <br /> <br /> I recommend this picture to anyone who sees less than a Hollywood and is more faithful around the world.
