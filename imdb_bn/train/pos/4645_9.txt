These pictures are very interesting. I saw it twice and thought that the glove hit nail in the head which he wanted to claim. The filmmakers have expressed clearly against our careless corporate drill that an attack on each of our media centers, and the culture that we are going to should not "think" due to corporate media control. . The disturbances expressed by the "harmful" elements of Glover films are both aggressive and euphoric in its poetic power. I'm glad I saw this movie and it is even more evident that Glover is interesting about two parts of a triangle It's good everything okay. See that. People who dismissed this movie as "unintelligible" or "offensive" really do not have the boat. This is an intelligent film. If you can see it with its live show, he does it with his books before, it is also very angry. The way you get into his psychic is really something. You will have an experience!
