Absolutely fantastic trash .... It has everything: nudity, good fight scene, gore, action, explosion etc. It also stars the wonderful Belinda Mine as Ingrid - not as another reviewer as Olga - although Olga has become ingrid after filming (you will see it to see what I mean). <br /> <br /> I will not be bothered to go through the story because it is very long wind and not very interesting. The relationship between Ingrid and his brother Bo (Robert Ginti) is interesting - see what I mean to see the towel stolen scene. <br /> <br /> The war scenes were quite good and then some really lazy people were affected by the group that they were walking, the city of the dead (ie strange blood coming out of the neck wound). <br /> <br /> I would suggest fans of low budget trash to check it out if they could track a copy - although it is very rare and I do not ever see anyone annoying to republish it so it's all in a few years It will be rare. <br /> <br /> Anyway I'll recommend it completely for Belinda Men's great nude scene! That lady is a Fox!
