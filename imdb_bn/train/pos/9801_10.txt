The original animated dark knight returned to this great adventure film, which is fancy mask rival in its coolness. There is a lot of style and intelligence in Batwoman's Mystery, Batman is more than ever or more than Batman and Robin. <br /> <br /> Gotham has a new crime warrior on the street. He's a bat-like dresses but he's not a big up Batgirl. And Batman denies any affair with him. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne has to deal with normal romance and detective work. But Penguin, Bine and local Mobi made things more complicated. <br /> <br /> I did not have high hopes for this energy because I gave up firmly but weak Batman: Sub Zero (Robin Ison 't featured so many here!) but I have a fantastic and exciting set piece, cute plot and humorous feeling I was glad with it. This certainly should be a movie without any fan batman. Keep your ears open for a truly interesting song called 'Bachcha Neva' which has been specifically excluded. <br /> <br /> It's embarrassing that the DVD is not so cool. Do not mistake me some great features (small 'Chase Me' is awesome) and very good Dolby 5.1 soundtrack but ... The film is presented in Pan and Scan. Batman: The mystery of Batwoman was drawn and 1.85: 1 was shot, but this DVD was presented at 1.33: 1, which was cut off on both sides compared to the widescreen screens shown in the features. I find this extremely annoying fantasy mask presented at Anamorphic WideScreen. Warner had to reproduce dozens of literally literally DVDs because people complained about the lack of original addiction ratio in some titles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it's a shame because the widescreen will complete a great DVD package.
