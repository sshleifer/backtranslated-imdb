Richard Dreyfas's greatest performance in this movie is included, an actor who plays a dictator and ensures that his own motherland does not detect fraud. Also, this movie is funny, yet there's a serious side as well. Particularly playable about this movie is Madonna's character who is the mistress of the dictator, but eventually becomes the leader of the country. Evolution from Madura's political leaders extends widely with the quality of the story and the entertainment value of the film. And the main character, who is a struggling actor at the beginning of the film and a bit of a buffoon, also develops and reveals the end of the movie. I like this movie.
