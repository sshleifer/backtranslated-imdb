Yes, this product is long (good news for Bronte fans!) And it has some dates, but casting and acting are so bright that you do not want to see any other version! <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton Edward Rochester ... It's very easy. I do not care to criticize other critics that he is very handsome. Dolton is interesting, of course, but no beautiful boy. Actually he has kept a harmful, angular dark charm, which is mysterious in my mind, enough to protect the lady. He took Rochester's tragic, tortured personality so cruel. When the scene calls for him, he expresses anger, but shows Rochester's flexible, enthusiastic, emotional side. (IMO is suffering from new and e production in the Sierra Hind - the ones I usually adore - it seems that they gradually slowly and slowly gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually gradually <br /> <br /> <br /> When I reiterate the novel, I always see Zelah Clark as Zen. Mr. Clarke, I have my own Describing (and narrated by others) as Jane. Small, short, eloquent ... Although it is true that actress does not see 18 years, she has portrayed Jane's features very well, and another review claims that her performance is wood or irrational , One should remember that greed has been spent eight years in character and is trained to check his emotions and "emotional nature." The main inspiration was his childhood friend Helen, who was photographed images to submit. However, its true nature was different, she started to learn to dominate his temper and his charity of students 'school' was going to go to the school goals. Jane became rich in Rochester's family He would certainly * speak * him as equal. Even after he received it, he remembered that his station was better than his employer. However, if you read this book - this product is surprisingly close - you can clearly see little struggles like Jhelah-Zen-Zen because he controls his emotions to keep his emotions light and even tempered. <br /> <br /> Chemistry between Dalton and Clark is OK, I think. No, at least not like Hollywood (thank god, it's not a Hollywood book) but a romance that is true, cruel and trustworthy. And for a woman like Jane, who never believed in any love, the way came, it is a minor miracle. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is horrible, and I really love the character from the book that is present here. So, many of the very rich, poetic main dialogue. This version is the only one that I know to include the lovely, infamous 'Gypsy scene' and in general, is more humorous than the other versions I've seen. In particular, mutual teasing among the main characters comes directly from the book and is so much delightful! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jane Eyre was one of the first atheist women in many novels. Finally, as Rochester's real equal, he accepted his love independently and freely. Just beautiful
