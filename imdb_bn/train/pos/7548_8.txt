Short, but long enough, cat soup is a very wild trip to watch. One day, I searched my on-demand list through the animation section and came across it and decided to look it up. I originally spent the whole time sitting with my jaw agape. The whole time I thought I thought, or cried a screaming, "Stop it !!!". But I do not. And actually, I'm glad I did. <br /> <br /> animation is stunning. Extremely artistic, weird and dark. I personally like it for amazing animations, but the seemingly empty story behind it is equally responsible for me. <br /> <br /> A little boy - Well, cat - goes in search of his sister's soul. In the first part, he became ill in bed, and soon passed by a visit to a cow beam. His soul is divided into half. The boy of a cat has returned, the other half lost. <br /> <br /> Then the rest of the picture is lost to me, really. I hope they will go back, and their world ... is probably going to be gradually separated? Perhaps the absence of the soul is the answer behind it, the rest of the film has different steps in the world, which is inside the Earth. First, there is a huge flood, and later it dries in a deserted desert and everything is frozen (thanks to God or luck, you have to see). Then I believe they find sister spirit in the form of an orange flower. After that the whole world disappeared. Oh, did not get it completely, but it shook me under my spine. <br /> <br /> Despite this visually random view, I'm sure it's a deep message behind it to see it deeply. Some research Personally, I love trippy stuff like this, and would like to spend time understanding it. But some people probably do not have their cup of tea. It comes off as extremely annoying, so if you like your direct front anime, it's not a movie for you. If you have an open mind, I highly recommend this movie.
