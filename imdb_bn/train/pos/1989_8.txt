I accept that Oliver is not having that love! As a small child - it's long, and the story is moving at a slight pace due to all the musical numbers. As a teenager, I discovered that the fun of this movie itself is an experience. Instead of thinking of it as the adaptation of the Oliver Twist, think of it as the classic story celebration. Adaptation is the best, but indeed, if you are watching a musical, you are not there for the story. <br /> <br /> Music is the core of this movie, and it is a huge majority star and very interesting. Most or all custom musical stage versions were involved, and it shows their performance - and I consider this plus. The performances are in the more "staging" style of acting like most old films and they are very entertaining. The exception is Oliver's baby, whose work is going to stay beautiful and away from the way of real actors. <br /> <br /> The original star of this movie is Phagin and Dosher. Oliver Reid also makes an excellent job of maintaining an awesome screen appearance as tricky bilikes. Even Sykes's dog keeps a good performance at Boulouse. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. Those who hate the musical will despise, as it would take music very seriously. Defective historic descriptions or free stage-type bad behavior, condemning wrongdoing, will destroy somebody's benefit. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment - if you feel it, it's a lot better to remember as a musical, it is not a strictly organized, rigid adaptation around an imaginary book.
