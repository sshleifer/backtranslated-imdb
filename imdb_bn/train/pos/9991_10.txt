I was violent in this movie. I've seen it many times and highly recommended. Mel Brooks, was nice. Cast was wonderful .. I do not understand how the movie can find 5 rating 2. I like it .. I saw her other movies and they were funny, but due to the humor it really stuck in my mind. I can not say enough about his movie. I regularly look for it but it's not enough for me. People playing homeless people compared to the funniest standard. Keep this movie more often I can not see it enough ... Leslie Anne Warren was also my favorite, from Cinderella. I always thought that he was not really funny but liked his acting. He was very funny in this movie ... and did a great job with him and Mail. They should keep more movies on TV.
