After seeing Deliverance, the movie like P. Fiction does not seem so extreme. It may not be so radioactive by today's blood and bullet quality, but if you think that it was 1972 and the film is truly the core core, then it seems different to you. <br /> <br /> When I started seeing this movie I did not feel unusual until I found the "Dueling Banjos" scene. The film's ruthlessness and extremity are really visible in this scene. I saw Drew (Ronnie Coax, Robcope) heading around a seemingly rebuilt young boy, it really shows how these films can get. When you think that the child is small buno, which he may have probably made in hand, compared to the draw's excellent costly guitar, you really have to understand how many people in his fours are there. <br /> <br /> As the plot goes very credible it extends past its limits. But how does the film differentiate itself, almost four businessmen who received more than the application for the canoe trip, is the director John Burman (Xalibur), who keeps away all the characters from general character or stereotype. So the movie goes into complete horror and mystery as I really care about four to four men and what will happen to them. <br /> <br /> Acting is a wonderful public. John Voight (Midnight Cowboy, State Enemy) and Burt Reynolds (Boogie Nights, Striptease) lead great cast. John Voight probably made the most difficult work of this movie and it transformed the family into a very credible person from its warrior. In contrast to Reynolds, whose character is turned into a warrior, Viet's character, from the beginning. Ned Bati (life) is also very good in a very difficult role, when the time came to be raped by a mountain, Ronnie Cox became a credible performer. <br /> <br /> One thing that has really strengthened these movies for me is that villains were horrible as I have ever seen. Bill McNoney and Herbert "Cowboy" were excellent and very awesome as the covered mountain. <br /> <br /> The overall distribution was extraordinary and I advised anyone other than weak stomachs and babies. 10/10. See this movie.
