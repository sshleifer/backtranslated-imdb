The nightmare of an insomniac is an incredibly interesting, well-made movie. I liked the way to touch you in the subconscious of the main character without coddling the viewer ... The top notch was played - Honestly, I would see reading Dominique Monaghan phone book! - But everyone else, especially young girl, was great as well. I was very impressed with the look of the film. Generally, the "Independent Films" is a stained, eye shot-on-on-my-camcorder, but this director knows what he's doing. Lighting, cinematography ... quality work. I'm looking for a feature length work from Tas Nanavati!
