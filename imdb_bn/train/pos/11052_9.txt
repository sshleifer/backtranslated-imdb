When I was six years old, I learned about a series called "Los Campones" and even if I was just a little boy, I did everything I had to do to see my parents once every week for "Champions" and "Avengers" . . I think it was the Golden Age of the English series ... (I already own the whole cycle of "The Prison"!) But after a few years "the people of the past", "the worst witch" (I was just with me), or of course This girl's "Harry Potter", as much as I would like to be in the "Campianos" zone 1 or Zone 4, I'm waiting for "Dr. Hu" (a whole series pack) a set, ohmm, maybe 300 dvd, please, i For more I could not afford, 8), "people of tomorrow" and a few other 'low budget', but great stories can be found in my reaching area. Speaking in English and understanding, but not all my relatives, including my parents, who introduced me to these great stories ... I hope some people can feel the attraction of this series and then I will be able to see them in fact. Dubbed or subtitles, but in the same format I saw them. Remember, Zone 1 or 4 with my TV set is OK!
