Some of the key issues in this country's design (in the US) are alpha and omega. We see all the relationships at the university setting for the film. Exactly, obvious versus students. Teachers attend But the film relates to its relationship with its value: male vs. Female, white vs. Black, and person vs.s. Society But the most important and direct relationship between all other relationships is the person vs. By myself <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the bureau had instructed bilateral outlook to show racial relationship with the campus. Most of the movies usually show sorrow in other aspects and display injustice on the other side. This picture showed the injustice and misery of both parties. It did not try to show what was right, although I used to say that the head of the skin was shown to be much ruthless and deceptive (quite clear at the end). Discuss the film sex and rape. It is maliciously this injustice that combines two nations together in some ways. Lawrence Fishbar has a top-of-the-top performance as an impressive Professor Phipps. He destroys the idea of ​​enjoying the nation and instead shows paralyzed and lazy parallel with laborers and positive people. Other stars who have created this film include Omar Eps, Ice Cube and Jennifer Connelly. Michael Rapaport has expressed a distraught distrust of the confused youth who is looking for recognition. Teera Bank has made its first film and proved that supermodels can work. <br /> <br /> Getting higher education classes and having a paper piece gets its name in college. In fact, I would say that this movie is a mockery of a university as a genuine education, instead of some dry books, interacting with students. This is a life learning process, not a curriculum. I think you will find "higher education" in many universities, and even in ordinary life. 8/10
