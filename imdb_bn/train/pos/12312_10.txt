A movie that is good in 1987 can not believe and is practically unknown on the west. Do not repeat other reviews here. Scores are very good and moving. Literally means "don do not come by please" - when it comes, beautiful ghosts and lovers will be separated forever. After 24 years, Joel and Leslie are still looking great. I've enjoyed many Leslie films including Jewel Jewelers and Assalamu Alaikum.
