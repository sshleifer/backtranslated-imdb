This movie is uniquely neglected ...... A different story shows exactly how it will survive or maintain, if someone has an open heart, then find the power of love. An open mind. I first saw it on the wire at the end of the 70's and it actually portrayed the limitations of the lesbian community. I believe the film was ahead of its time when portraying a small part of a vague path. It was really a forerunner to be portrayed as a classic in that sense it elaborated family. This movie should be found in DVD / VHS so that extra general performance of Meg Foster and Perry King can not be acknowledged, but how far we came and showing where to go about relationships.
