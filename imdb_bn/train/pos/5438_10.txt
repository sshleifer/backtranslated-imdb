Rudyard relies on the same poem of Kapping, the Ganges DIN follows the journey of three military officers in the 19th century India. Magnificent threesome will dare to diverse various dangers including a series of three battles and a temple full of gold. After more than six decades, their screen events are thrilling, and almost everything from Clifanger-inspired space Opera Star Wars (1977) encourages planned raiders similar to ARC (1981).

Chemistry is not only developed in three actors, and such warm and believable comrades are missing from most modern action pictures - and they get extraordinary support from incredible Sam Jaffi who overcomes extraordinary physical miscasting and makes headlines. Character is a beacon of human sweet and calm power. A huge hit on his day (the film was the second biggest builder behind The Wind with the fierce success of 1939) and it is reasonably present as its best film.
