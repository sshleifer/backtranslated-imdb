I love this episode of Colombo. Perhaps it is surprising as Ruth Gordon's cause and an American version of the successful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, Dame Agatha Christie. Delicious as her nephew died in a sinking accident when she suffered a terrible loss as scary, loving writer. He blames his nephew's husband, nephew. After the police left her, she planned to kill her to retaliate. I liked to play Veronica other than Hertley in Mero. I personally do not like hearty. And of course, there is some laugh with Colombo when he questions Veronica in a stomach-dance class. Ruth's Abigail is a smart intelligent herself and she matches wits with Colombo always played nicely by Peter Folk.
