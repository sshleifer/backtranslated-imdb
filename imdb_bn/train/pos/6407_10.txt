I went to this movie because a cast and crew show my friend, a producer invited me to the movie. Forget about what you saw in advertising, forget what you have heard, watch this movie for yourself. I was more surprised by it. In a world of The Greenwich, Charles Angels, 6th Day, immune, here comes a movie that is worth your hard work! Fantastic scenes, wonderful cinemtrophy and a cast you want to eat with your heart. I found it with mostly orchestrated powerhouse films and reasons this year. Robert Deniro deserves an oscar wishes. You can give an oscar to everyone involved as a package, this film will be.
