"Coach: The Night Stalker" is a very entertaining TV series, a pushy, satirical, forty-something reporter, often drawn in a fierce battle with miracles (and sometimes out-of-the-universe) forces. Based on the coordinated TV films of the character of Calcutta, this series died rapidly in the mid-1970s due to low ratings, but it still maintains a strong culture. But the average modern day visitors will be able to dig the Calcutta and what will happen with their weekly clashes? <br /> <br /> This is a really hard question to answer. This series of arguments is a reasonable and frustrating date for detectors. On the other hand, fans have reasonably written, well-played, and sometimes really spectacular. And I? I have a foot in both camps. I recently enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Calcutta on DVD, although I can easily see that there are major errors in this series. <br /> <br /> I will first ask about the "Formula" story of Calcutta. Now, I think we all agree that most TV shows have formulas - for example, according to the same pattern each episode of Column is released. Repeat is not necessarily a bad thing in itself; In fact, critics have long recognized that viewers often enjoy and actively seek, for repetitive entertainment. However, the problem of Calcutta is that its formula is strictly - it is very repetitive by very liberal standards. <br /> <br /> In almost every episode, Calcutta investigates a murder and it proves that it was committed by some form of demon. He said that he tried to publish a story about the giant, but his editor Vincento has always blocked him, that there is insufficient evidence to support his evidence to Kolkak that the supernatural forces are working. And, lazy, Calcutta is hampered by the police. So, to the end, Calcutta has done some independent research on the monster, statistics on how to kill it ... and then kill it. Without a program, or awards, or for writing a great story about it. <br /> <br /> You can see where this rigid formula can be tedious, is not it? I was especially deceived by Vinsenjo - if Calcutta always blurts on the road, and Vincenzo never believed it ... why does Vanzenzo not fire the coalition, or promised him? What would be a normal boss? But the series avoided such fact and kept Vinsenjo and Colechak a ridiculous rival. As a result, most of them are incredible together - although they are quite fun. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some types of unexpected packing This election phase is good enough that I think they are largely resistant to the general criticism of the series. Some of my favorite things are: <br /> <br /> Heights in the Heights - an episode that is significant for being rural, inventive and socially aware. The Calcutta dialog is an unusual sharp and dinky edge. Although it closely follows the Coalcak formula, the script (written by Hammer studio's experienced hostage expert) is uniquely educated, and it deeply deports the demon. <br /> <br /> The Devils Platform - A possible inspiration for "Women" films, this episode is standing near me because Villeen - very young Tom Scarit - Calcutta is dragged with the slave contract full of slaves (and, doing so, the reporter This is a bad reputation among fans, but I enjoy it. Bo is a great red herring, because it is really unclear, some are troubled-monster. <br /> <br /> Although I've gathered these three episodes for praising, I would say that most of the stories are at least entertaining. For my money there are only two complete turkeys in the 20 episodes: the Primitive Scramm, which continues to be heavily in Chicago, Monkeys and Centuries, which show the characteristics of the least visible creatures makeup in the illustrated entertainment history. And this assessment is coming from a doctor and Hugh Godzilla fan in a lifetime!) <br /> <br /> If you are balanced, then this is a good series. A little repetitive, perhaps a little chessy, but it has the element of greatness. Even during the weak episode, Darren McGuin's superb performance, such as the Kostik, the world-tired, endless fun cohesion is really bright. He consistently carries the series, just as, for example, Sarah Michelle Gella has never been operated in "Buffy". McGuin was a great actor and this series is valuable to see him alone.
