This was different, that is sure. Just look at the cast! Talk about strange. <br /> <br /> William H. Messi and Ben Steillars were big, although a bunch of actors have shared sparklights around, in this love with Superhero-Vanbybis. Paul Reubes was the most fierce actor of "P Way Harmon". <br /> <br /> There are many humor, girl colors and no lull. This is nothing but a fantastic entertaining, lightweight comedy, fools, all of whom want to be heroes La Superman, Batman, Spiderman, your name. They have talent in strange areas, however, do not make real heroes (and do not want!). It's silly, but you're going to do that. <br /> <br /> This is a movie you can see in installments and will not really miss any consistency. It's so violent that a long movie for a long time, so here's a break and okay. That's why children could enjoy this so the kids could enjoy it. Actually, here I have no oath, no one else is saying, "What a fool, f --- ing movie." I thought it was fun two hours but I'd rather watch the DVD and want to take some breaks.
