Also known as "Water Lily", this picture tells the story of two girls because they fight their way in the love and sex world. This story is called at a slow pace and that works very well. It gives lots of time and space to know different letters and connect them with them. <br /> <br /> Using a small cast puts some extra pressure on people because they have more screen time than usual but people playing this movie are good. Everyone is completely trustworthy. The visual setting is great, especially the swimming pool water shots add a great effect. Many movies have been made about the same thing though it is not really standing on any of them. It works out some "standard" pressure methods outside of the high hat and on them. It's not bad, not all, but it's certainly not great and I think it might be better if it's been searching for something less good. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, 7 synchronized swimmers
