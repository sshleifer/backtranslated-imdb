Rosenstrasse is a tactful story of courage in the teenage. Reichdeach found that women have been locked up to postpone their Jewish husband's demise. An elite person humiliated by his family, Lena Fisher, as the sister of General Guderian, found himself in the crowd. But no special consideration for medal and special privileges. <br /> <br /> The husband in the West Front does not serve the ray as the prisoner. Among the most horrific scenes in the film, the guards took wedding bands given by their soldier husband. <br /> <br /> If you think that this is Germany's cruelty, then we are today ordered to arrest Gold Star Mothers without knowing Lady Bush in America. Sad, sadly, Der Fheher has changed from Der Fumbler to 60 years. Fortunately, an eight-year-old girl ran away from Ruth's capture. <br /> <br /> <br /> Fisher was unwilling to accept Ruth first, which we usually accepted as German. Even Lena Fisher's brother Colonel Arthur von Eschebatch also knew who was aware of the Holocaust and warned Lena against him. But Lena preferred to embrace this idea with the American rebellion, even named Helveta Lehmann after Ruth's name. <br /> <br /> This blockade ceases favorably to Rosensstra√üe, but Lane expresses mourning: What happened to Ruth after the war? A few years later, Ranna's daughter Hannah came out in search of her mother's past and called her 90-year-old Lena in an attempt to write the personal history of the war. <br /> <br /> I was thinking that Hannah wanted so much to look for her family but she did not finally test the fate of her grandfather, known to serve in the West Coast.
