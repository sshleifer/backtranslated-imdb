This film needs to be seen. The real picture of what is seen in the world since Darwin's nightmare. See it! And if you're lucky enough to open it in your city then do not forget to watch the DVD instead of the big screen. The writing is sharp and the direction is good enough, although the ideas can be perfectly perfect. Joan Cusack is amazing, and the rest of the cast is very good. It is encouraging that John Cusack made this film, and I believe he had to use some of his money to do this. It's a wild, weird journey, probably made without the resources it needs, but still successful. John Stewart, Steven Colbert, SNL, and even Bill Maure did not dare to say this movie.
