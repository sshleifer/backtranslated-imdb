This one grew up on me. I'm RD I love Burmese music and despite the story's crude content, I see many moves to show the film again. Brother sister's plot lines are strong, I thought; There are more likely compulsory elements, bar fights, stories of a cruel crime, etc. That is just confusing. (Although not unnecessary to a particular perspective.) The English translation was obviously for somebody, for which it was a little expanded and as frustrating, I am grateful for doing it. <br/> I have seen that like most Bollywood movies, it is a musician and opera-like, in which a small boy sang a song first to encourage his mischief and unhappy sister and then sang the same song 12 or so Year later, the man who tried to reconnect this girl with Kathmandu, she grew up (she seemed to be dead to her brother and mother Shot), with drugs that damaged her pain. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary thing about the 1971 film Hippie movement, which came from the Indian perspective to the searchers of India, which makes them fail to lead them towards India by their spiritual hunger. Their own society, but still, in India, this moment lives for the pleasure. Hippy singing-dance-impressive scenery is really unique and correct in their voices (I'm old-fashioned to remember), and I'm sure the people of the young white zone-out kids are genuinely hippies extra, as if they have got such a work of Bollywood about the caravan kids. . <br /> <br /> This is not the true story of the Hari Krishna movement, although the movie Hippora sings Krishna / Ramchand, as is the genre of true Indian fans, not related to Hippi, in the film's first scene. <br /> <br /> ~ Virginia
