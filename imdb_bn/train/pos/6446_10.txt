"Sam Monday in Hemelen" was probably one of the three most beautiful films of my life. It does not win Oscar, I will not tear a tear. This movie is in its own category, it's an Oscar win probably will be cut off from it !!! My favorite friend Anders (Niiberg), you have made true magnificence with your pen here! Whoever contributes to your creation and everyone, you all gave us the gift of love to the world. Enter the points of entry into this world, then get out of it - you can really say that you did it better! A special person is thanking you from all of you, you bring some precious memories back in the second decade of my life. I grew up in Sweden, and my young mind and current Beijing is composed of many beautiful Swedish influences, individuals, heritage, music and nature and shaped. All of you are my blessing with gratitude. With love and light, George-Gabriel Barkvivitt SÃ¼llahler, Johannesburg, South Africa
