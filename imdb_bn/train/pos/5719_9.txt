I have seen many IMDB comments, some critics have claimed that the films they have seen are harmful intelligent plots that have their own stupidity. I'm not one of those people. If I look at an action film, I would like to see the explosion, gunfight and heroism. If I see a comedy, I want to see the tears of laughter in my eyes. You get the idea. So, seeing a horror movie, I want to be initially scared. The Grzez is a very scary movie, it's both well-effective 'jump' scenes and it's unclear imagery. I've been a horror movie fan for many years, and I'm talking about Master as Dario Argento instead of some of these days slow down trimmill tin tin durations. If you want to be scared, check out this film. Way Skari compared to the original Japanese Ring (which I think is a great movie).
