This is the best movie of all time! Sorry, Hollywood! I saw it in the 70's, as soon as it appeared on Bulgarian TV and I liked it immediately (I was 14 years old). After 25 years I bought it on a video tapes, and a few months ago a DVD was finally shown in Bulgaria. I live with this movie 35 years ago, and so do all my friends and my family too. When my son watched for the first time, he was a teenager and he liked it very soon (and this generation, which is seeing only Hollywood movies and speaking Russian or growing bigger!). Danelia makes this masterpiece so special? Not to say that beauty is difficult to describe, but really you can see this movie again and again, as it was for the first time. I can not remember any other movie, how much does it cost, how much was cast ... Chapao, MÃ¶rania! Bulgaria loves you!
