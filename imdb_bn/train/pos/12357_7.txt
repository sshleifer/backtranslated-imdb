I really liked this movie, and in one week it went to see it two more times. <br /> <br /> Mrs. The detector nailed the performance - he was hungry like a hungry cat with prey. He took angry and wishing, "very young lover", and his terrorist fianc√©'s mother's fine earthy piece turned up to the floor. <br /> <br /> The picture is beautiful. Messerati, nice dress, flower box next to the roof. I especially enjoyed the ancient Greek class and 'antigon' text. <br /> <br /> It was a feeling of 'story of a'- that is, where nonsense people are victims of sexual abuse. When he wanders in a magnificent apartment in a torch, he can easily keep it - and why not, "Satan in the devil" can be prevented? <br /> <br /> The whole film is real behavior!
