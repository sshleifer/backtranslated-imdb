Eugene Levie, one of Johns phenivist, is also a great idea, only the studio has the idea that it should be in the DVD, I have it on the video tapes, but it seems that this movie is suitable for DVD (and additional will be great) Kung Fu University (Kung FuU) Skit too Funny, as well as his scenes with the whole movie, his girlfriend and his family, this movie is never on TV. I do not want to, but it is the highest loser during editing for Broadcast TV, if you can find the video, I suggest you buy it (I have a good place to get a copy of eBay) I will watch the DVD for a day I will be watching my VHS Will keep There are so many great movies that are not yet released from the DVD, and it's still one of them.
