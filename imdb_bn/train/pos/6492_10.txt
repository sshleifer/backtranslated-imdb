I'm not a very good writer, so I'll keep this short. World War II WWII Documentary I've seen. I have seen various WWII documentaries (not just English / North America) and the entire WWII documentary I've seen in this documentary I think it could talk a lot about the Great Depression and why / Hitler came to power, but it does a very good job by covering the war. It seems fair and purposeful / fair for everyone. It does not diminish or diminish the ambition of different nationalities. It has lots of footage, which has color footage and many surveillance (it was created in 70 when there was a lot of live). It has great music and narrator. All of this I gave a 10/10, because it's good. (I did not see anything special in the DVD version so I can not comment on them)
