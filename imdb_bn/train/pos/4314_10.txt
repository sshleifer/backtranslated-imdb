To make the top ten list of the 1990s, I reviewed the Grand Cane earlier this year. I saw the first 17 years old movie. How did I hear about it? It was reviewed in 1991 by Siskel and Ebert and highly recommended and I finally got caught in the video one year later. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie, a powerful film, a healing movie, listening to power, really listening to each other. I saw it six times now, and it inspired me with entertainment and every next visit. But why are poor reviews for this photo? Maltin's movie guide gives two of fours. Very Mid-Dramatic, too much coincidence, very sad, the expression that I read most. Yes, there is a melody in this story, and yes, there have been many incidents here too. But it delivers with an intensity and force that looks plated. All the "plots" in Grand Canyon, such as driving shooting, a police push, an earthquake, a love affair, the discovery of a child in the bush, another shooting, a new accident driver and a global advice from homeless people, this film is Kevin Kline , Steve Martin, Mary McDonnell, Alfred Woodard, Danny Glover and Jeremy Siesto smart performers Won the seer. This has been successful due to the guidance and writing of Lawrence Kassan. You know that it is not another movie to consider a sequence at the beginning of this movie, which is harassing four black young men Kevin Kain. Danny Glover plays a tower truck driver, who helps the cine character, but is also not harassed by an ankle leader. Listen to the conversation as the child recommends Glover, "Are you afraid of me or my gun?" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Steve Martin should be nominated as the best supporting actor for film producer, whose heart has changed and Then change the mind. I think its character is an alert which can lead us to "good", that is a good quality of idealism, but one that depends on that we must constantly fight for. <br /> <br /> I can be the grand canyon that will be lost forever in a new release desert in the video store. But now with lesser releases than 99 cents, I have seen any reviewer reading this review with the deal that thank you after you rented it, the grand canyon is something special If you like Magnolia, but another movie with a big shoe of deep human themes, you love Grand Canyon.
