This outstanding Argentine independent film is making a wonderful quality film from South America, from America to 2000, with the best one since 1999, including Argentina. In 2000 alone, Argentina was released in many quality films, which are Argentina B Recorded. Internationally acclaimed at two and a half dozen international global festivals. After watching this film, one can see how Argentine films were able to recover 20% of the national film market for how Argentine films were accepted. <br /> <br /> This film directed by Argentinean director Daniel Burman inspires global globalization by examining the effects, but emphasizes its impact on Argentina, and especially the Jewish community of Buenos Aires. Daniel Hendler is wonderful as a wonderful Jewish boy, trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate. Hector Alterio, Simon, the Jewish father, who has acted independently, is one of the best actors of Hispanic film worldwide, he is perfect among Spanish and Italian stars. <br /> <br /> Many current themes are searched for urban western society, there is not enough space for my details. Daniel Burman cleverly weaves them with the plot of various diversity personality characters. Do not miss this picture playing on a festival or video near you!
