I'm so worried. 428 IMDB users who voted in front of you did not give this picture more than 7 ratings? - It's a C! If I could frown 20 people, then I was happy. This film is based on the modern comedy Pantheon as one of the most ridiculous movies of all time, as well as Half-Buck and Mueller. If you know _thingthing_ about rap music - you will see this !! If you do not know anything about rap music - learn something!, And then see it! Comparison of 'Spinal Tap' failed to grasp the inspirational genius of this unique movie. If you like Bob Roberts, you'll love it. See it and it's a 10 vote!
