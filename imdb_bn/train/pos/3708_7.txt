In this adaptation of the summer novel, when a woman is involved with a fatty person, a lawyer is attracted to the cat and mouse dead game. Altman creates a suspenseful, Gothic atmosphere but the script is weak. Playing Southern Droll, believing as Brunga's lawyer, and Davytzatz is lucrative as the purpose of his will. Downey preferred as a personal detective. Duvall has a small role, which does not allow him to do much with his weird character. Hannah and Berenger round out the impressive shield. After an interesting set-up, the film fell and did not really give it its initial commitment, but Altman always valued a look.
