Recently I saw this movie during the Boston Film Festival. The film was very entertaining and I believe the world and ready to watch black America. It's great in comedy, drama, soundtracks. This is a good film all around. Characters improved well and the film had a variety of famous actors, such as Wood Harris (remember Titans, Pad in full), Brian J. White (Troyes 3, Mr. 3000), and Wonderful Joe Saladana (drumline), Caribbean pirates). The film nowadays deals with many relevant issues in society and does it with class and grace. This is not just a story about the life of the hospital, but it's a story about the people and their personal journey about which they are, or who they are going to be.
