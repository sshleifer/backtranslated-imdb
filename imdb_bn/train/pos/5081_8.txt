This movie was less than awesome and even strong belief, it is still good to see. The film begins with marrying Claude Colbert Robert Ryan. When the minister asks whether there is any objection, a man gets up and declares that Colbert can not get married because he has already married !! Callburts insist on this fact, but when they investigate, they judge justice and others remember their marriage and even a signed marriage license is available! Gradually, it has become clear that the clutad's mind is diminishing and the people around him are deeply suspicious of his connection. Then, when the supposed first husband is murdered, all the evidence and doubts fall on the Caliber. <br /> <br /> This movie is a sensational suspense movie, which I have described so far as this is the first half of the movie. What follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating. Unfortunately, the conclusion, though, is somewhat down-down, because the directional forces behind it come "straight from the left ground" - and it's annoying to guess that it was impossible and impossible to guess, However, despite this, the film was so good, even I can excuse the long end. In particular, Robert Ryan did great job as "fake-biting" mother tongue, although other performances from him were also excellent.
