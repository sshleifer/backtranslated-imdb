At this moment I was watching this movie for the second time (on television) and when I was in it for a second, I read it (I think I have seen this time 2 more minutes). This film is really impressed, looks at Goldswari nature, changing nature You never think, really amazing. This whole movie gives you a warm feeling, seeing him with love, playing around with the world around him. Or just covered with his hands, dirt and broken fingernails, it just touch you.
