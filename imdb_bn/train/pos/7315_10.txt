A classic, highly influential low-budget thriller that gives birth to a horrifying icon and launches the career of Directors Currenter and Star Curtis. <br /> <br /> The apparently unstable escape from the murderous mental institution and comes back to his village where he started a local criminal on Halloween. <br /> <br /> <br /> Halloween is a film that fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carter's horror stories and clever instructions give life to this film so beautiful that it must be realized! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that even a small city neighborhood makes really everyday wonderful setting. Most of the time Carpenter makes its hiding and its flashing flashes the most amazingly amazing, which only a few of the most awesome filmmakers manage! Besides, he is quite knowledgeable to give us some really favorite young characters and a scary villain to make us stronger. Most of the Koduo carpenter is easy, yet go to the terrificly protected music scene. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror movie! <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. The young jammy Lee Curtis is very handsome as Loving Storr Loving The Babysitter, before she breaks into a big movie, she will be in many other horror films. Great Donald Pleasants is the perfect performance as a Maire Doctor, who is frustrated to catch him again. Kumari Loomis, Souls, Castle and others are very good. <br /> <br /> Halloween, like its villain, is an unstable power that is thrilling and does not jest. It's a must for all genre fans! <br /> <br /> **** of ****
