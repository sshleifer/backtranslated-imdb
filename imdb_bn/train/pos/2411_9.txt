This movie has succeeded as one of the most successful efforts for some confusing questions arising out of recent scholarship related to "Passion" (Christ's Sorrows and Death) in the New Testament. (Does not the meaning of Jadas, if the Secretary-General can meet on a high holy day? Why was Pilate frant?) This is serious, a film for Christian thinking: fans of "imitation of Christ" are no doubt frightened by gory spectacular and lack of arcade character Will be. For my own sake, I have found the portrait pictured here - due to the will of the common man, at the risk of their own interests when the general dictator is sacrificing self-sacrifice - until now, more realistic and deeply uncertain. (Disgraced, "Just Doing Me" look at the face of the person who first nails in Christ's wrist, like Chilingling at any moment in the film.) The film does not claim to be "authentic", but many of the settings and gentlemen are more " Right ". This is a gradual film, however, if you take it self-imposed limits (it is, above all, "death" - not life - "Christ"), finally a very fruitful one.
