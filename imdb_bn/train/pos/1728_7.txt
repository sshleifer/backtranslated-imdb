One of the first "great" escape stories of World War II was a wooden horse, in October 1943 to tell the real story of Eric Williams and others in their escape from Stalag-Loft III in October. I really like this movie, but it is VHS from Amazon in England and it is transferred from the Palette format in the United States. When I was in high school I used to read the book, after watching a part of the film in the early 60's, Peter and John's Tutor tried to play in the realm of realism more realistic than the counter-attacks of the Great Account to flee to Germany during the war. This image is a lost treasure, which should be made more available to American visitors.
