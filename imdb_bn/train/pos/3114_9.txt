I'm going to keep this fairly short about to loot something for you. This movie is awesome. From the beginning to the end, it is filled with genuine thrills. The scenes of war are fantastic, the chasing scenes are intense and it seems to be slow at the moment that it explains the speed, but it only appears to be slow before, but it only happens before it happens. Damon shines and has really proven a very difficult actor, you dare not believe in him in this role. She played this role. A welcome link to the David Streathren series (hopefully I'm touching the right spell), as a deadly CIA agent in Bourne. It is non-stop and will really leave on the edge of your seat for most ways. Some things on the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. Finish is open for seagulls and I'm sure they consider doing so much more because someone has got bad. Excellent film from all and a fantastic triangle is a fantastic finish. <br /> <br /> PSS Shaky Cam does not hurt any action, but I still think we could do it without. The good news is, not only do you notice when people are talking and not too much action to do it.
