We have a long way from LAURA. Once again, it has been ordered for the auto-promotion, a police detective named Dan Andreas Mark, and Gene Tearney, the beautiful woman who hunt her, but Sidwall Ends is nothing like the mystery of everyone's favorite sophisticated murder. Instead of deliberately quoted conversations, we get radioactive, heroowing realism. Although the previous movie took place on the rebel highway of New York society, here we are in the low-rent district of the dark streets, hoodlums, cheap restaurants and crummy flats. Tierney, as well as the former, now works as a department store manager and lives in Washington Heights (the area around "Doll" which once received Fox Fur from Lurar Mark McPherson). This is an old, sad, more annoying version of Andrew Trench Coat's cold cop, at this time, Mark Dixon. <br /> <br /> Where Sidwale Indicus is a sub-series silent, focusing on the cruelty of the police, who can not control their violent emotions. Like the character of Kirk Douglas in Detective Stories, Dixon insulted his father's criminal past for insulting him. Where Douglas is self-righteous and blind to his guilt, Andreas is understood to be suppressed by crime and self-hatred. He accidentally killed a suspect and tried to throw a thin gangster (Gary Merrill) suspiciously to his activities, which he has been following for years completely. Instead, a well-behaved car driver suspects because he is the mother of the deceased person and the father of humiliated wife Morgan (Gene Terni). Dixon, he fell in love with the wife of the murdered person, tried hard to protect himself from the father himself without distancing himself. <br /> <br /> Among the heroes of Noor, this was the difference between Andrew Andreas: He was incapable of being intelligent. Even playing an average jo game, as it usually does, it always adds abnormally sensitive and sensitive; Even more, his air to be very thoughtful for his own comfort is scary to him - and hunting - quality which gives his essence as an actor. He played ordinary boys, policemen and soldiers, but always wanted a sad behavior and too much to know. Her righteous protagonist is characterized by fatigue, crime, and sometimes "light up" inability. Other actors could bottle up anger, slow-burning pain, and Mark Dixon's angry temperament so well-expressed. She makes a humble softness, a muffled warmth and even ridiculous that makes her heartwarming. It comes when he regularly brings Morgan to a restaurant, and for the first time we see an insult with the satirical waitress of this cold, cruel business, whose curiosity can not hide his affection and anxiety for him. Dixon asks his partner for a job as a lawyer for Morgan's father, though he recently gave a reason and Dixon threw a punch to him. There is no word about loyalty or he has put a good person deep down in order to know, but we see the man-made pain and his wife's resignation to keep him a bit of jewelry. Dixon's goodness came from others' reactions through Andrew's deeply running performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> Although Dana Andrews was a minor star, he could be a distinguished fifty people. He sometimes goes through some movies taking off his overcoat; Moderate Century Silhouette, Fedora, more powerful by Glass Bosbonne, when talking to cigarettes, he does not come out of the mouth, he sees the imprisonment for men of firmness and tenderness. Although many hell romanticized two strong strong people, where Sidwale Indses basically show an ongoing picture in terms of the reality, roots and spirit of violent consequences and violent consequences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its low-key performance is much more compulsory than Wyqing Maxx). Fortunately, Andrew appeared in some films that confirmed his immortality, and now finally this little known movie has his best performance, it can be seen as a part of the great Fox Film Nire set. This series includes several series, including title titles, such as Nightmare Alley and Thieves Hewlett, which suggests that the film came to silence in the thirteenth century-Fox may have the best record of all major studios.
