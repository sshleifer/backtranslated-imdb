Personally, I see the movie quite well. It outlines the real situation of Hong Kong triad and shows a glimpse of how audiences organize the triads. <br /> <br /> This does not just show the audience that Hong Kong police control the triangle situation and why police simply do not go out and do not wipe out the trials. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is rather fierce due to the gangland system of killing and torture. However, this film considers the true world to be true, thus reflecting on what actually happened on the screen. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to a tragedy / mafia movie fan. Another good watch will be the Dragon Squad. There are more guns in this movie, as in this movie there are more knives than guns (I'm not actually seeing single guns).
