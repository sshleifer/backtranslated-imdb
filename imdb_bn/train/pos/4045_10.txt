I'm very happy that I got a chance to see this rare little gem in a movie. I saw it at an independent film festival, so do not expect to come to your town soon. During the filming, I saw about 10 people walking and walking. Very bad for them (down here, people do not like to read subtitles). The movie starts at a slow pace, but the dialogue is so rich that I do not bother. When the action finally came, I covered myself in the scroll so that I was rolling a roller coaster. <br /> <br /> I got a big stick in the chapter titles present before the chapters, especially those that introduced the characters as shown on the screen. Gelda (Time of Okrina) reminds me of the level facing the boss. <br /> <br /> If this is the future of "video games / comic books", I welcome it.
