I'm not the fan of Adam Sandler. Actually, I do not think that I've ever seen him in anything. The first scene of this movie confirmed my worst fears. Adam Sandler was, some ridiculous looking characters playing around motorcycle scooters around New York City, desperate and losing. Usually Sandler-type damaged character, I thought. I leave it around then and there. But then, I stuck with this, I discovered something I never knew before: Adam Sandler can work! He was truly outstanding in this movie, Charlie, lost and alone, whose entire family (including the dog) had died in one of the 9/11 abduction planes, and as a result, it lost all touch with reality in reality. Don Cheadle plays his former college roommate who unexpectedly reconnects with Charlie and to help him get better as his mission. Of course, Chadle's Allan Johnson has his own problem and source of sadness, and in any case, these two men have been able to help each other through their problems. Two of them formed entirely trustworthy teams and Sandler, especially Charlie Real, worked through his emotions and feelings. This is not a Sandler comedy. For him if you are looking for something else, sillier, stuff to go. This is a very heavy movie - sometimes sad, sometimes optimistic and always engrossing. It has some fun parts. I liked the scene where Charlie asked Alan to meet her friends, how hard she was at college and her next conversation was after. James's an evocative patient Donna, as Saffron Burrows added to the movie. The only reason for the character was thought of as Charlie's late wife (based on a flashback), but it never really improved and I did not care too much about the character. Check out the judge's part, however, acting by Donald Sacharreland, I thought that the quiz was over. As far as I am concerned, however, it is in Sandler's film, and in line with it for a great performance. Of course my opinion is his best. 8/10
