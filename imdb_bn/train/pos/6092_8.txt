Cult classic prediction is almost impossible. Who can imagine that Vision Quest, Fight Club, and 2001: A space releases, critics and audiences released by the film were released the same way, would they become very popular? Like many IMDBs, I consider myself a film expert. Contrary to most of those who hate it (proved to be inferior to 4.4 ratings), I have seen that one of the most energetic movies in the last decade is one. <br /> <br /> The plot of the movie is ridiculous. The dialogue is not tricky, the scene has a slight consistency and the script seems to have been written by the fourth grade. But why is this picture so ridiculous? As you can see, in order to appreciate the accidental talent of Iniar, you will have to enjoy the movie from a malicious point of view. <br /> <br /> Why do I love envy? Because the movie is bad that it gets better. It is a recipe for a classical classic, and fits the bill wisely.
