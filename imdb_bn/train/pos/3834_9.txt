A great film! Slowly: Yes. <br /> <br /> ... but root, deeply atmospheric, dark and scary, perfectly sunlight (feel like a nightmare). <br /> <br /> I'll compare it with David Lynch (Eraserhead, Inland Empire, Blue Velvet) probably mixed with a little bit of Barton Finck and nude lunch (insect!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br />, Barber's The Forbidden and Solomon - They should combine the concept of dark night at least ... <br /> <br /> If you are an antigenic and / or spiritual movie (i.e.) you I'm going to like this one. If you expect anything like a movie with a plot, like a movie, try your luck with something else. The final word: The plot is very strange and unusual, and probably it's # 1, because most people hate it because they do not appreciate this movie.
