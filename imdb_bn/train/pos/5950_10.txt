This movie is a great one. This plot is very true for a classic book written by Mark Twain. The film begins with a scene where Hanke starts singing a song with a bunch of kids "setting your toes on the moon". It reminds me of Sinnaratra song Hi Hope, it's funny and inspirational. The song is wonderful all year long and my favorite song is composed by King, Hanak (Bing Crosby) and Sir "Saggi" Sagmore. OVerall is a great family movie or even a great date movie. This is a movie that you can watch over again. Princess Pretty Played by Rhonda Fleming I love this movie !! If you like Danny Kaye in Court Jester then you definitely want this movie.
