After being a huge fan of Japanese singer Gagt and Hayd, I was very excited when I saw that they had created a movie together and achieved its goal in my life. I was not frustrated. Actually, this film exceeds my expectations. I was brave because of being a singer more than both Gacht and Haida, but was not really ready to fully fill them, but both of them were happy to keep me silent and to believe in the story. Moon children have the right amount of humor, action, romance and serious, heart-twisting moments. I would never say that I sometimes loudly loudly loudly loudly aloud loudly in a film. The war scenes are absolutely stunning and within a few moments of uncertainty, you start entering the film and bond with letters quickly. I recommend this picture thoroughly, especially those who are fans of Gate and Hyde.
