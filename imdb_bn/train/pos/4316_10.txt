I have to say that the Grand Canyon is one of the most influential films I have ever seen. I have seen it many times now and I still feel like it for the first time; That this film, itself, a post-graduate course in a film graduate can create a full syllabus. <br /> <br /> The film trailers promised a long time ago, "It will force you to laugh, it will make you cry." That is a very trite and shorthand method that describes the Grand Canyon. It takes you to the best places of human experience and the next moment takes you to the gates of Hell. <br /> <br /> Most of the images take place in the back of the happiness and behind the horrible intimacy of the same person. It's always a small step, too. Just please be able to manage that swing and show it false or too much without the talent of the director. <br /> <br /> Spoiler (kind) is coming. After using the back of the back through the emotional spectrum of the audience, the film does not return to the valve with a sequence and threw a curve with a sequence but instead escalates from a common marital spot, through a sudden self-inflicted knife, to run the character from the house that is cyclone Wounds that may require stitching At the time of their relief, forgot the logic, forgot the finger, and the earthquake survived, a neighbor said that her old husband was broken. The couple rushes for her help. I cried when I saw this sequence. I saw it every time I cried. I'm crying now. It's not that sad for me this. This is not a particularly sad sequence. I have tears that this few minutes of film was perfect. It's perfect! Shocked (spoiler end) <br /> <br /> There are a lot to say about the Grand Canyon. It portrays relatively ordinary people and it uses the audience to take advantage of them. They are not showy or overblown and there is no long break to carefully examine the moment. Moving at the speed of the film life. Even when the characters try to understand what has happened, still what they can achieve from their experience is uncertain. <br /> <br /> Grand Canyon is a very human movie.
