A bug's life is a very good animated feature. This movie is for young children, but it's a great movie for my age. The story is about a weevil called Flik. He devastated his colony when he destroyed the food for the higher grassroots. She gets deportation and she will find big bugs to fix the mess. This movie is a classic because it is a good movie and it's a Pixar movie. Especially for the late 90's the animations are bright. The story is good, but a little more detail will be enough. The voice acting is as good as the most animation movies. Music is beautiful Nothing special, but it has earned nomination for a music division. Overall, this movie hit me as arrogant. This is a good movie for all the families. I rate this image at 10/10.
