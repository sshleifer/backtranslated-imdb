I saw this movie in a college film festival in the 70's - I'm waiting for the video to be released (finally it's over). It was made in Brazil, so I do not think it was made in the video. I have been checking the video stores for the past 15 years and I'm waiting to come out of this outstanding movie! This is one of my greatest all-time favorites - but be careful, it's weird, as Warner Harzag is weird - his oddity arose from his super-realism. <br /> <br /> This film is based on the real story. A few centuries ago, during pre-colonial times, when Europeans first met the tribes in the Amazon. A white man makes mistakes by a savage tribe of cannibals as their enemy, so they are willing to kill him. Before they send him, they make him part of their tribe (their own) The whole film is like watching the National Geographic Documentaries, because it has become an acceptable member of their tribe. That's it. Cosmic Platoon? No Different types of insights into human life? Certainly <br /> <br /> Be careful ... this movie is perfect nudity - this is not a mockery of Hollywood is striking about extraordinary savages ...
