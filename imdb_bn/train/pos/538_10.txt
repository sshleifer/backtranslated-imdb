Perhaps back to the cabin by the lake is probably a few sequels which can live up to the original. It was Black Humor, Good Suspense, Nice Liking Girls, and Off Course, Cyco Slayer. What do we miss? I do not think anything. We left the small amount of gore and nudity because it was made for television. In addition to being one of the best Sequels, it is one of the best thrillers to watch as a family. Recommended for everyone.
