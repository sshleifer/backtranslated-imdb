I went to a small advance screening of the film on July 19th, some of the actors did not know anything other than this and it was a sort of fantasy / adventure quest. <br /> <br /> <br /> Nothing like really I saw, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with the things that are coming in the theater or coming soon. Despite what the first impressions could offer, it is not chessy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually very entertaining and fun. The flow is done quite well, nothing seems to be rushed or dragged out. Soundtracks, magicians and movies add much more to the lack of good words, often oppose silence on movies or TVs alone. And even though I know what's going on in the points, I still can not stop watching the screen; In my knowledge, the single person did not leave the theater during the whole film. <br /> <br /> One of my clothes seems to be that there is almost no marketing for this movie and why I am so brilliant.
