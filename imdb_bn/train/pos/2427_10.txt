This is really a wonderful unknown movie. Effective dialogue about general clinic This movie was based on the talent of the actor and it was drawn. It had some comedy, but it was not overdone. A crime drama should not be supposed in life once in life, usually it does not affect garbage especially with garbage. I especially like its various aspects. <br /> <br /> Now in front of actors Lawrence Fishesborn was a nice criminal to play in the criminal. It is shameful that he has been allowed to show his talent in his own movie. Titas Winnie was fond of Fisborne's junk half-brother. Eamonn Walker has already added the taste of the perfectly spiced film. Paul Calderon was perfect as a Greek monkey / drug lord. I like his acting from "King of New York". But the best actress of this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, who completely linked the two Henneren of Kredderon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
