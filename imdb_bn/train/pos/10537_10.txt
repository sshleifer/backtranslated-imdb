This movie was very funny, I could not stop smiling when I saw it and I have already seen it twice in two days! The film is unique among its comedies and visuals, both horror and other (more serious) film gems are equivalent to Cub and Cipher. I've been a fan of Vinsen√° Natalie on seeing Cipher and what he's doing is all very interesting. <br /> <br /> Very popular about this movie is David Hewlett and "lost" characters of Dave and Hewlett. Andrew Miller (co-author of the story), I like both actors. Also in the X-Box Dead or Alive Fights (you see Halo playing on Dave at a point) and Andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> About me You have to see it!
