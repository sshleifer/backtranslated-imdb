In this final episode we deserve. At the end of last season, there was something left in the mood of 'life continues', which was not the availability of this realist series. Although not a happy event, this series is always one that you think (a rare thing on television), and this is no exception. 'Death justified by logic?' 'Is morality a reflection of society, or a society shaped by morality, selected by some in society?' 'What is just a death, and can it exist?' All these questions, and more, are expressed by the author of this show every week, and this is their final thesis. Fine performance, great writing, wonderful camera work, brilliant editing, clear direction If you have seen the series and you miss it after running the first one, copy it in some way. If you have not seen the series running, it will stand on your own, but it can be that what all the letters are and how they say it in different positions. It is very satisfying for us in the last two seasons that this series is one of the brightest spectators.
