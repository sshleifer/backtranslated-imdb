Straight Story is the story of an old man who decides to visit his sick brother who lives in a state queue. She decided to trip on her lawnower because she can not drive and she wants to rib by herself. She touches the film nicely on her journey and life. <br /> <br /> Richard Fernsworth plays beautifully like another cast, especially CC Spacesk played his daughter and Harry Dean Stanton in a small but infinitely important role. <br /> <br /> At first, I felt a story of old Giza's trip across the country would be disappointing, but soon I discovered that Lynch would recommend this movie to all the insights of human life.
