(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> When historic accuracy can be suspicious ... (And with the wrong appeal of LOTR wrong .. Such things are now excused more easily) I liked it's art fascination. While not really an art house movie It gives a little emotional charge view from time to time. <br /> <br /> I have two complaints. 1. It's too small. And 2. The sound you hear from time to time is not explained. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 7/10 Repeatable: 5/10
