When I first saw this animation (I could be 15) I was really impressed! It has completely different styles than the Japan animation and I like it better. More terrible and darker than the full print of the film ... the colors are not ... colorful. Characters do not speak too much, it has no long and annoying conversation and it (like the devil of Satan). With its dark pictures, strange creatures and magic ideas, it is such ancient Scandinavian story, full of enchanted forests and deep caves, dragon, throlls, orks ... and stop a mysterious hero to stop evil!
