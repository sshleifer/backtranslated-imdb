This kind of delightful world has been created for us in a bug of Pixar; We can be documented these enjoyably in a film which is submerged in a universe, but more precisely a universe which can only be documented through the animation world. Can a great amount of global animation and lots of people who forgot? When is it right hand ?? A bug's life is a warm reminder. We are walking with the same warm feeling in the film, and only feeling the satisfaction of high-qualified film productions. <br /> <br /> This is the only Pixar second animated feature. Disney's sub-group made their gorgeous greetings and possibly completely unrecognizable marks around the world of film three years ago in 1995, with their landmark film Toy Story. It was a movie that denied the convention, re-invented and animated the new life and defined a whole new dimension. Now, they come back with their sincere efforts, which are honest, before watching the film creates satirism among all of us. <br /> <br /> Finally, it's a film about pests. Well, all the paths of insects and bugs are covered in a bug's life, but it is the center of the film, which is mainly the theater, romance, and other central centers. How can a protagonist of a movie, how the small species of organisms, as an Anti Act, provide the whole compound of non-feature films? Of course they are Jess. However, we have forgotten in the Toyo Story that a group of toy-box items have been able to become the most inspiring and loving group of all times, the greatest, lively hero and villain of all time. Pixar people are able to pull up the same feat and perhaps you can manage the dirty and smallest bugs in the most favorite and happy gang of any face-to-face confrontation. <br /> <br /> They all are completely fun and favorite ?? Sight is not an unpleasant character; Even the villains are riveting characters ?? But they are colorful, they are eclectic, and they are idiosyncratic. And the arrays of letters are also gargutuan for the lack of a good word, only the stratospheric strings are already plastered in a bug's life from the beginning. We will begin with our main character, and our hero. His name is Flick (David Fellie), and his character is generic to say at least. Thousands of faithful and ceremonial worker goats, in the ants living in beautiful snow island, they are considered as the 'black sheep' of the dynasty, in the first moments of the film when they unknowingly harvest the season. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When they look at Anne Island for their annual dinner and their offer ends, they become mad for lack of a good word. Hooper proposes to save pests from the total extinction in his pack; However, this is a discussion that is impossible to simply fulfill. Cuck and clock work in Flick's mind is still steam in spite of his crime and shame, and he can leave Anne Island in search of some powerful bug fighters, who came to the rescue of the colony and could fight with Hooper and grassroots. <Br /> <br /> If you think about it, A Bag's life is very similar to Akira Kurosawa's classic Seven Samui plots line or the US chemistry with the Magnificent Seven, in which a helpless but happy village is threatened with a ugly And by the evil enemies ?? Only villagers live in large cities looking for help, find it and come out of the temple to return to the colony. In this bug life, help comes in the form of a down-out circus trump, wrongly perceived by fick as bar-room cats fighters. <br /> <br /> Many scenes from these scenes come, and many amusement comes out of this circus troupe bug. Among them, there is an isolated stick insect (David Heide Pierce), a side-splitting thick German caterpillar and a soft-female fatty bodybug, which is actually a reti and manusuline ladybug (Dennis Hooper). These bugs are very enjoyable on-screen, because it looks at bugs and insects interact on-screen, like the entire movie collectively. <br /> <br /> As I said, many rejoices and pleasures come between their characters and pleasant interaction with each other, which is the ridiculous line of ridiculous lines, surprisingly suspicious and thrilling situations, and a spectacular movie as a whole. Does a bug's life make it even better that it is not limited to children to children, though it will actually find more entertainment outside of this movie? Clichédd kid-friendly situations are a lot more lucky than we'd like. However, this guilt is easy to ignore, and it is very easy to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Although a bug's life can not reach fixed and landmark standards determined by its predecessor, it's still a great movie, and here's something to start with. Pixar has proved that they are not the only hit wonder, but rather the talented and gifted groups of many Hollywood filmmakers. They can increase the bar continuously and when someone always leads their values ​​to top, it is only themselves. And what's more without the bug's life: see it; What we saw from the people of the Emirivillan in California is not good, but is it a lot frustrating? And if I do not have the best animated features of 1998, I'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
