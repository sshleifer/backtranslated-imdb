We have high expectations with this one. . . Because of its official series of Zombi 3 Zombi 2 and managed by Lucio Fulci. . . Anyway . . Bruno Matteira (from the Night of the Lomes) and not written by Dardino Souchi, but many of Claudio Fagasso (Lights Night) and his shot in Phillyin such as the Lights of Night of the Lomes and the Lights of Night of the Lome are dead). As a result, it is like the assistant of Hell of the Living Dead, rather than Joomro. 2. Jaberi 2 and his editor Tomasese (?) And produced by Efex Giantto de Rossi, Faberio DiGalis gave the magic of Zoomer 2. . . Zombi 3 is not the witch. . . It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich without peanut butter. But for a few years, I grew up to accept Zoomie 3. I can swear that I saw a version where a soldier's hand bitten and went to the hotel room. . . A stupid Fulci was cut and one of the Maddy / Floe cut DVDs.
