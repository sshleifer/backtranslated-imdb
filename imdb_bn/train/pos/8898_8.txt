60's a great movie about the Hippie movement in the late 60's (I saw it all in a single night). Although this title would otherwise recommend 60 years of the first 5 years of the film is not really important. <br /> <br /> The main character of the movie Michael, who travels the streets in the United States, is a political worker. Vietnam War. There he meets his girlfriend Sarah. Michael's brother Brian went to fight in Vietnam (what a surprise!). He returned from war and was born on July 4th, "Tom Cruise" Hippie. His father is a Vietnam war veteran (What a surprise!) Michael's sister Kate Rock and Roll became pregnant with the artist and moved away from home and went to San Francisco in the summer of love. The end is very poor (the father became generous and everyone is happy), but I removed this vote away from my vote (the rest is very good!). <br /> <br /> Actors' performances are quite good and the soundtrack of the film is absolutely brilliant. All major events of the sixties, such as JFK and Martin Luther King's murder, big hippie protests, summer of love and Woodstock! Watch Wavy "Woodstock Speaker" closely for Gravy (Woodwalk festival is what we have to think about breakfast for 400,000 beds!) <br /> <br /> Finally, 60 films about a beautiful one beautiful decade! 10/10
