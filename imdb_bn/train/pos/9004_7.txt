I was skeptical of other love stories, where the inactive people get money and freedom through honest communication. And it's still not at the top of my list. But Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Branagh and the competent, almost amazing performance, and it is only to be retrieved from another tear-jarker. An ALS Hunter Carter's illustration firm, probably sometimes overdone (sometimes its conversations are fragmented satire). But the overall effect is pretty and rewarding. Branagh could be the perfect compliment for her performance. <br /> <br />
