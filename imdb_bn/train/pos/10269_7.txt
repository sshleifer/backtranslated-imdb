In the spirit of the classic "The Sting", this movie hits where it really hurts ... in the heart! A primary, suitable female psychologist, hungry for adventure, met with dirtiest and scoundrals scottrals. The weak doctor carrier falls for Badman, and wants to be involved in his operation. The film is slow, but it is climax and the end is stunning! Do you particularly enjoy the doctor "forgive yourself"!
