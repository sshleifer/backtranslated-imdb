I do not know why critics trashed this movie. I never agree with them. <br /> <br /> The movie may be a little harmless - I do not usually go to horror movies! I had to pay attention to myself even during the day. I need not bother! ;) (The movie was full of children, hey!) ... Liam was always good. I like Catherine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lily Taylor (Elano-Nell) <br /> <br /> The room is very gothic and a wonderful way to look beautiful. Special and sound effects were great. I gained musical scores, especially the melody for Alanoore and his journey to save his children, his permanent routine and life, and finally got his strength, peace and independence.
