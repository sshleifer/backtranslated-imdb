Much more than Hidden Frontiers-Fan Fiction - It's a good idea to keep Star Trek's world alive and growing and a well organized series. A fun little fan project from now to a well-known net series; Hidden Stars is a bit of fun for every star track star. Setting up the Letter Star Trek: Next Generation / DS 9 and Vioagara Time Line Hidayen Frontier brings a series of stories and problems raised with other stories and set stories with set stories using a better advanced character, plot and story arcs. Star Trek Hideman Frontier describes this story in a social context that Gene Rhondenbery has failed to screen, and has shown character development in long-term space assignments - with exciting quadrangements, exciting local war and contradiction sci-fi - drug addicts know and love. Completed a "green screen" studio; The hidden frontiers bring a rollicking shield on the screen and in your hearts regularly. Throwing a big pair of actors together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project. Innovative use of green screen technology, props, make and costume work Star Trek fun and credible hidden frontier worlds. Some of the world's science fiction strollers where hidden Frontier has gone, and once they get there thrived. The Hidden Frontier offers interesting discussion platforms, creative, production and acting staff and a wonderful bonus feature with a fun weekly chat feature. I highly recommend taking the load and watch time.
