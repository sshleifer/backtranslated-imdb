I went into this movie to know nothing about this, and really end up enjoying it. It was a lack of authenticity and credibility - what the characters said and what they did was completely bizarre and many scripts seem to have been deed (perhaps it's Woody Allen's ideal? Forgive my ignorance) but the entire audience was so laughing at the theater. It was not even in the film competition, but in the whole film. Reminds me about the acting of Cinefield, where he does not try to smile on his own joke - they are very shocked, but if you do not take the film seriously then you can humorize the actors, not the characters. If you are looking for a random movie, and you like Woody Allen, I definitely want to recommend it!
