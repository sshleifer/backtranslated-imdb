I did not see this movie, but I must I have been actively looking for a copy of this movie after reading three books of Thar Hiirdhal three books (Kon Tikki, Ra and Aku Acu). <br /> <br /> Theos that the Peruvian migrants have migrated to Polynesia, are alive and well. This crew did not have any GPS and had only an old fashionable valve (tube) radio with 6-watt output, its journey was heroic at least to say. <br /> <br /> If you can, please reply to this message Please answer me a copy of this video. <br /> <br /> I would love to buy it.
