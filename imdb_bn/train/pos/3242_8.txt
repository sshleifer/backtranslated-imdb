I saw this photo with my dad. I used to be young about 15 years old. It was in an afternoon star movie. The movie started somewhat unusual, but you can say that robbers gathered to score. After the first half an hour it really caught the speed. <br /> <br /> All actors are superb, especially Blades and Lau Diamond. I suppose it's ensemble, they just play well together. I can see this movie anytime. I think it is trying to confront the relative stereotype of the plot and the characters are very curious. Curiosity is not fanciful, but they are very subtle and extreme, which makes them very happy. <br /> <br /> A lazy afternoon is a perfect comedy.
