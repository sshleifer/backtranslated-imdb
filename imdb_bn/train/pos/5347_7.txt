Another Spanish film about the 1936 civil war. This time we talk about Carroll's story (beautiful acting by Debutant Clara Lago), a little girl who comes from New York to live in a little Spanish village. This is an early visit, and soon he will find out about the human race, their foolish fights and contrasts, their injustices of conflict. <br /> <br /> Imamal Uribe created the best movie from "Dias Contatos". 1994) Such a silent pulse, a beautiful photography, and an excellent script. He tried not to participate in conflict, he only showed us some information and let us decide (OK, these facts are clear enough to determine which band is within us). And he took advantage of the presence of the young and the young actress couple of Tazza Clara Lago and Juan Jos√© Balestro <br /> <br /> Production of a good care <br /> <br /> My rate: 7/10
