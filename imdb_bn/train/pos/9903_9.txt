Hi, thanks to IMDB and Google, I have been trying to remember the name of this wonderful movie for more than 15 years now. High kill, man! Hello yes <br /> <br /> I'm not going to raise you with a plot summary, actor and addict, because you all know what happened. As you can here because of why here but why. However, what I'm going to do is explain the memories of the joint collective memory of these 80 D-Movie Slashers. <br /> <br /> In 1987, when I was 7 years old, my father hired all. This horror movie Would he care that he had seen them with his kids? No So, at the young age, I saw higher education. I watched the movie stuck with me for a long time. I did not see it, but remember this day that most of the movie's ridiculous death. For example, sex scenes (why have a metal bed in school) become electrocute. Or, the guy is drowning in a ces pull. Come on! My personal favorite, though ... to burst from the beer bursts of stomach. Amazing! After 10 or 15 years, such a letter finds a beer of beer in a abandoned school, how can you hate a film and think it would be a good idea to drink? Then its stomach explosion? What !? And that's great line: Let's take my car ... it's always starting. Classic shit is all the way <br /> <br /> I mean, about 20 years later I look back, and smile at it. But when I was 7 years old, I was afraid! That jester hat (or was it a mask?) That the killer freaked out me freaked out f * ck! <br /> <br /> All, yes, a crappy movie. But for this nostalgia purpose and ridiculous factor, this movie gets 9 out of 10 out of me. Stay true late every night and hope to catch it in the same latent movie show, or look for a VHS copy and close your VCR.
