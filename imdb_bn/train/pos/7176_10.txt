Okay - You want to check how comfortable you are with your adolescent and change the shameful and psychological threshold - If you respond immediately to seeing this disproportionate document about creating horrible fractions socially relevant to the 80's tribe. Even more than I have seen a movie, this film refers to sexuality and arrogance in a way that is completely human, sometimes brutal, and destroys the youth's inherent religiousness, which is distorted by the horrible adult adult world. Some of the distractions from youth quirk madness are allowed. Mini-Mughal Darren Stein seems to have reached the conclusion of his childhood as a parent of the world of harsh children and a deeper understanding of the mistakes. What she finds between herself and others is not always beautiful - but it shows how someone can improve and meet with age. What is the average change without reflection? I like this movie.
