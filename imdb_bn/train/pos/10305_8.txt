If you want a serious smile, check out this movie and Bruce applies the issues that his fellow Newscaster has applied. Deleted scenes are invaluable. I do not know why they did not include them in their original movie. It can not be for a long time, because the film is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carey needs medes!
