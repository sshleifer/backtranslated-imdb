It is one of my favorite Kung-Fu movies and is known as the most popular Shaw Brothers since the late 70's. The plot is attractive and twisty, the characters are cool with their own style - the tad, the snake, the camouflage, etc. This action is limited in comparison to other Chang Che / Genome movies, but what are interesting with different cookie styles is shown from different characters. I recommend this movie which most of the movies of Shaw Brothers, especially Chang Che thinks the same, most of the films generally focus on the 10 tigers and the violin versus Manchu clashes. Fresh air breathing than this picture.
