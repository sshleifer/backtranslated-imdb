In 1996, it was so interesting to see the theater. My movie is a guilty pleasure angle of taste that really appreciates Shankar's film. <br /> <br /> "The Dentist" is banned sometimes because people usually have strong feelings about dental matters. Perhaps the campaign against the ADA is to be apologized for the film's report in the dental report and for "The Marathon Man" (which is just a view compared to a scene compared to many in the "Dentist"). <br /> <br /> It's awesome that the movie was shot in 21 days, according to the notes page. Of course, production of postage can sometimes take longer than movie shooting, and the editing of "The Dentist" is perfect. The quick cut tension increased so much that, apparently, there were only two quick cuts to show what was happening to the dentist "taking care" of his wife. Rest is our very fertile fantasy left! Carbin Burnson was a good choice for the role because he had a lot of experience playing his "closed" characters mentally and he sold the emotional obligations of a dentist fully. <br /> <br /> The film's pacing for me was okay. Filmmakers express their arrogance in the right way only. All of the dental office characters look like the real people they work in a real office. They have many tactics while dealing with unexpected people waiting for the arrival of the dentist. Meanwhile, a huge psychological breakdown of the dentist was stopped! Contrary to so many movies of this genre, the script is very strong. All victims are trapped by a dentist in a very calculated system. Two law enforcement types are involved in even a small sub-group that eventually creates a shadow of a showdown. <br /> <br /> Definitely recommend for a real roller coaster ride and widely savvy gorefests fans, not for ambiguity or dental-phobic heart.
