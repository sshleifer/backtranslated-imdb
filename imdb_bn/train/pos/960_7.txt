This is a movie which is a lot of things that only Japanese understands. Even better translations, some things that are obviously a personal joke or regional symbolism My guess is that it tried to send some kind of message, but it was destroyed on me. <br /> <br /> - What I felt is a middle-class film with a special effect. Some children become "one" and in the end there is no relevance in any yoke war which does not give any sense. It was good to know what they were talking about, but Azzimi washed the beans, in Yokiyay and a big umbrella umbrella (Rihanna eats your heart!) I do not really understand the plot. <<br /> <br /> The bottom line: Excellent visual, the baby shout, the river princess is awesome and the rest is painful.
