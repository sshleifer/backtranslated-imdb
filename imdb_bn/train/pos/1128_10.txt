Although recently the piece of Homer's "troy" with Brad Pitt was being reused, "Effective" with the sculpture Irene Papas was exciting. As Greek actors speak their own language, disobeying natural settings, such as authenticity. I have been interested in many movies channels of DirectCTV, despite my density problem due to this opportunity of meeting with this film. There is no shiny or "shining" in this movie, an incredibly rich story that is accurately spoken by the actors, so someone truly think that they are hiding in the real family of a cyclone. I think even Homer, if he really exists, would be proud of that. <br /> <br /> <br />
