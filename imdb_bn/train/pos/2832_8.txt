I saw this movie in 1969 when it was released at the Camio Theater in South Beach, now the famous Krrab night-club. It was the last year of wild 60's and this movie really hit the house. It got everything; Conflicts between generation gap, sexual revolution, finding success, and pursuing "tradition" to family to find its way through life. <br /> <br /> This is a fast, ultra-pleasant movie. It was the glorious peak of Vegas, all the city's San City. Beautiful women, famous chemo, smile, conflict, romance, even a happy ending A very enjoyable time on all. <br /> <br /> This photo poster is sitting on my bedroom wall. I look at it and I go back in time; My youth and my father are my time, a great time in my life.
