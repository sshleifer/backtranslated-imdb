It is one of Dev Anand's movies, which gives a great and independent film in the history of jihoor thieves and guidelines like Hindi film industry. The story is short (if you ask me what the story is), the plot is simple - a brother looking for his lost sister. Smoke in the pot and lose the voice of Rama Hare Krishna, who joins Hippi. Yet 70 of these films accept new culture like acceptance of Hippi culture, their narcotics, independence, family responsibilities, and eastern (which was new to Saadada). They are fully managed. Genet gave her best and as usual she was extraordinary. The songs are best used in this movie (they are not abused due to the song). They are lost A perfect example is 'keep and give ... Ram is not bad name or anyone'. Each word of the song is very philosophical and meaningful. Last but not least is not the main point of the movie. Devi, who believes in the creation of various movies, has succeeded in showing what she wants to show here. A Hippie culture and the beautiful Nepal experience of 70 will be seen.
