"Read my lips" is a strange Symbiosis that develops into a common, socially maladroit female office worker (Devos) and its workplace training, a peculiar excon (Casel). The film throws these unlucky ones under their IDs when they get together cool in mind, each one uses others for selfish reasons because of their extraordinary results. Good thing for anyone in the character-driven films with strong psychodramatic undercurrents. French with subtitles and easy to read better translations (B ++)
