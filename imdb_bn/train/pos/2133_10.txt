I've counted the number of times I've seen this movie - maybe I knew the whole dialog behind - but I grabbed it again and again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Eligible graduate "Crawlik" who became a secret supporter of Margaret Sulvan's innocent "Clara". Crawlick secretly became a friend of Clarar's pen and together Kajar believed in the script of his croalic letter. Clearly the chromatic is deported with Clara - but he is unable to express his feelings while competing with "Pen-Friend". Confused? Well you will not be - this story is sweet, almost sweet - but we all know that we all want it to end. <br /> <br /> Other franks are notable that Frank Morgan is playing his normal role, now the owner of the shop "Hugo Matushek", Felix Breast, as the "Pyrovitch" believer of Crikey. Joseph Schildkraut as the woman's arrogant "Vadas" - played very well that can not help you but hate him right from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Finally William Tracy operates a shop junior "Pepi Katona" who manages to handle all of us with her confident start. <br /> <br /> recently played Tom Hendes and Meg Ryan for "You've Got Mail" as not rebuilt as my original - though I doubt the younger audience <br /> <br /> This picture is in your area on Christmas, but I will give you a wonderful glass of wine and keep a log in the fire and keep the box of the Clenix.
