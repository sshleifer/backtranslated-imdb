I do not laugh this hard at a movie for a long time. I would go to screening an advance, and I was thrilled because I was dead to see it. I had many tears in my eyes from smiles all over the movie. The audience has shared all my smiles, and mostly was screaming and yelling throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Kidos Steve Carroll (which I already had a fan) She proved this tremendous talent for her movie in this movie. She has a style that I have not seen before. And Catherine Keener is always as nice. Thanks to God was not a cameo from Will Farewell (loved him, but this saw him a lot more this summer). <br /> <br /> This movie was part of the comedic jeans. Thank you partly to Carrell, and partly thanks to writing (also Carrell). The candlelight scene and motion demonstrator were completely violent with "obvious problems". <br /> <br /> I'll see '40 year old virgin 'when I'm released. My suggestion: Huge smile and go to see it for an incredibly enjoyable movie at the top.
