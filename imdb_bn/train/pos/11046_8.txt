Malayalee is a very interesting movie. It is a refractory alloy of win and failure. The central concept is that with a great, malicious personality, three prisoners join in (who identify the listener) and they try to escape from their cells with the help of magic books found inside the wall of the cell. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is fully stocked, it reminds me of the challenge to be on D'afe (before and ending Cristo Count) of Edmond Dantes in the Challenge. The director sets this feeling that the characters are bound to the cell, especially the character that we want to mark (a carrier - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specific, but it can be a formal proposed fraud). At one point, when Carrother Dethar leaves the cell for exercise and her door is closed; We will not leave cells, clustrophobia breaks. There is no shot in the prison outside the cell, and the bar is a long lasting sunset on a general prison wall. Although the film seems very modern, it is a very old prison in the whole world. <br /> <br /> The letters are confusing. Our Marcus, violent pre-transsexual transsexual, is playing a disgraceful young woman as a trafficking young woman (French for the future). Pacretret likes to eat everything she gets beautiful, and unfortunately this includes her baby sister, hence her current situation (I liked this comment on internalization, very primitive). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It has a real life ring. Quite easy to back up this soundtrack, with each step deep in quicksand with a gong's dull ringing. I'm actually listening to the Ganges when I do some self-destructive things. <br /> <br /> I think one of the plot problems is that the end of the characters does not consistently strengthen the message, especially in the case of career, the concept of the book seems to be changed throughout the film, or in a series of publication. I think some of the images we see are a little amusement, more effective than "the eyes", and the design of the lasel sodemy, designed for me to be full hollywood images. Finally, the movie seems like the director is getting involved with it and some things do not seem logical, for example we were motivated to believe in a variety of things about the child of the careers. This fact does not change with us, even though what we have here is rare birds, a "pure" horror film. There are no comics or similar sequels like Cube (1997 / Natali), it's a clear film to compare, it's a total immersion experience, where you think you're in cells with letters. This last comment I think is a "pure" experience about it, I think others have also mentioned that this is a fairly single point. <br /> <br /> Talk about Lasalle about my past as a librarian when my favorite part of the movie on private personal notes. He gave a scene description where he went to work one day and sat in his normal place in the middle of the house where all the books were arranged in a circle around him. Books seem to shout to him that he will never get their knowledge. Lasalle prompts this to go crazy That's really the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge. One final comment is that several well-established comments on the board have confused the names of characters. To satisfy yourself with the old lingerie character in Lasale, just click on Philip Lundenbach's page and you will see that he was born in 1936.
