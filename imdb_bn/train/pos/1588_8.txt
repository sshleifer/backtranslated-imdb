* What I like about spinners * Teenager Holly Tyler (Amanda Bains) goes to live with big sister Valerie (Jenny Garth) to avoid going to Japan with her father; But she is not from now, her sister Gary (Wesley Jonathan) and Tina (Alison Munn), Boyfriend Henry (Michael McMillian), Venice (Nick Jono), Valerie's lover Jeff (Simon Rex), the first boss (then the firefighter Then husband) Vick (Dan Curtis), the annoying colleague Lauren (Leslie Grossman) and the second boss Peter (?) Have a funny bone in your body, avoid this; If you only like veeeery sophisticated comedy, this is not for you; If you are looking for a fun, sometimes two hot dog touch show that works on lead (and popular customs - from Leslie Grossman to the fabulous 'Mary Cherry'), what are you waiting for? Welcome to Casa de Tyler! What do I like about you (2002-2006): 8.
