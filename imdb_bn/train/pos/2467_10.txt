Why does not this take a bag full of Oscar? This is an amazing explanation of an anti-field / performed piece. Visuals are exciting (especially on widescreen screens ... Pan and Scans really kill cinematography and sets of this movie). Each frame is a painting. Shocked The game is almost completely intact, and Branagh's passion for it is clear from the opening title. Not here Jeffreye, only the movie can only be a great story, but rarely. Jakob is particularly perfect as Hamlet's killer aunt: he does not play him as a ugly criminal, but an impressive politician who allows us to see why Hamlet is suspected of killing him. Brangha carries the left / right nail of the line between Hamlet's fake / real madness and burning revenge. And many of the chemo come very well, all of Billy Crystal and Robin Williams are Gerard Depardo and Charlton Hesson, if you are silent as Branagh's view, then it's ineffective. A mesmerizing piece.
