At that time, as a young teenager, AirWolf wanted to look compulsory for a generation, who wanted to burst his "Cowboys and Indians" amazing gadgets and witz-bang. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the show was originally a night sky rider: Similar comic-book technology, a central character, which was originally a loner, reflects the idea of ​​reflecting one's idea. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, in a significant way it was different from Thermically Night Rider, Street Haq, The A-Tim and other programs. Somehow, the original foundation of the series is not made on the basis of the will of the people in need, but by the possession of Airfowle, because of Stringfellow Hayek's largely selfish reasons (to try to find his Mia brother, Saint John). And then there is a dark edge available in series based on the series of 80-second Shawl War, which is complete with Soviet espionage and dictators of Central America, not to mention the enemy. Of course, the team has steadily decided in Vietnam and the party's resignation, but it usually ends with a light touch and it is rarely in the center of the plot. With Airflow, the plot was the key to the voice and the sound - although it continued (weakly recommended) when the series continued. <br /> <br /> In the winter, the cold war setting clearly dates the series, most of the stories are cracky and converged, and whatever AirWolf is, it is definitely impossible with today's technology. But that's not really the point. Airfluff Hello Girlfriend is funny, it tried to tell funny stories rather than just on big action sequences, and it is not a sugar coat because of someone who miraculously died. Sometimes it fails, but it is often commendably successful - and to boot into a TV budget. <br /> <br /> For readers in the UK, DMAXX (Sky Channel 155) has started (January 2008) the start of the Airwolf's re-launch every day. Set your Sky + box for this explosion from the past - we can even get re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly inferior) the fourth season, which never showed up in my knowledge in the UK.
