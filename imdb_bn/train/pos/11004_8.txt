In the near future, on any suspect from Morgan Sullivan (Jeremy Northam) on the coast, the general people are appointed by Digicpup, a huge corporation, which is employed by their competitors, Snezes as spies and secret secrets. Alongside his training, Morgan has brainwashed, Jack Thursday speculated on a new identity and traveled to annoying speeches. In one of them, he contacted the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster (Lucy Liu), who advised him that it does not look like any. Morgan recognizes a new reality, where he can not believe it. <br /> <br /> The unknown "cipher" was a wonderful one for me. This film was not released in Brazil, but the engaging and thrilling story is quite complex, with many plot points and great screenplay, complexity and direction with performance. At the very last moment, I remembered Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Total Memory". This film must be able to see more than once and I do not like the last scene when the free spy settles the disputed discovery of the sea. Only fantastic "Cube" knows the director Vicenzo Natali, and I see this second work is stunning. My vote is eight <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
