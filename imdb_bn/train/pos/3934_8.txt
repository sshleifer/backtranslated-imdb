Young Mr. Lincoln is a poetic, beautiful film that holds the mythological story of the most revered personality in America's history. Henry Forda was a hard task to portray a mythical picture and simultaneously make her quite human to care for the man. This is probably the best actor. See how he stops a group of people alone. Alice Brady plays the role of a simple farmer's female spanking. The last part of the film is played out of court and there is only the negative thing I can say about this movie. Most of the spectators from the judge have been given a number of ridiculous sunny lines, which prevent them from serious prosecution. But I'm totally using it because humor is a Ford trademark. Helpful parts by Word Bond and Donald Make are very good.
