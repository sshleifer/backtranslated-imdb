I saw this picture at the Santa Barbara Film Festival, and there was no dry eyes in the house. It is impossible to see a great person like Darius, but how much the rest of the team is commendable and at such a young age. <br /> <br /> It has given me an opportunity to express how embarrassing MTV is and how to engage and inspire a positive way, they deny it. It shows you whether they really care about young and their visitors. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful and true story of heart warmth ... Accept your tissues but it is very good to see what today's caring and inspiring young people can do.
