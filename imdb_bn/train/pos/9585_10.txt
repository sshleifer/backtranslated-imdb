Wonderfully united ... I want to follow some of this lifestyle and celebrate the lost life. This documentary has to be followed ... there must be a part of it. It was fantastic ... this picture was not enough .. I want to know why the creator of this movie did not follow !! It is very important for this community time .. If you are reading this, please consider another document like this ... I am tired of hearing from innocent writers how they are when AIDS and men go together. Actually it was a hterro that we needed to watch. This film was not even bothered to mention HIV or AIDS and I was very happy about it. I also broke broken and really appreciate the definitions. Thank you so much for having this film available.
