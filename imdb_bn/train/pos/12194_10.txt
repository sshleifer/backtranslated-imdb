"Real," General-Defining Classics "The Multish Falcon," "Double Compensation" and "The Postman Always Rings Tuvis" is soon to be released soon after. Wells films should not be evaluated against others. He was playing by different rules. Actually, he was playing. It starts where other femme fatale movies run away, so the vaguely logical (but interesting) velvet is probably deliberately one of the Welsh scenes (usually fast-fire style), the dialogue (many "hard high" philosophies) and extraordinary performances (probably Harry Potter probably deliberately Dimensional). Wales "style" may mean "formula" but its "entertainment" likes to use "mystery" as the background.
