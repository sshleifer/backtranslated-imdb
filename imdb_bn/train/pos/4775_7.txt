If this is your action and adventure in a film, you will be advised to look elsewhere. On the other hand, if it is a lazy day and you want to go along with that mood to see a good movie, see "Straight Story". <br /> <br /> Look at Richard Farnsworth's gentle and gentleman Alvin straight, to see the stroke of his untamed brother in this true story of Ashwin's journey across three states. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth is perfect in this land, as long as he travels his long journeys, making friends of strangers and advising the family on the path of deviation like grandfather. The story is slowly running on the races, but the spectators are watching that viewers are watching Alvin's offer for the next life. <br /> <br /> Extend on the sofa, take a break and enjoy. The only way to watch this very good movie, which is 7/10 rate in my book.
