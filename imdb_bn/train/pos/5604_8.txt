If you like Roman Polanski's "handicap", then perhaps try "The Tenant" as well as playing "Poissansky" or "Skinophrenic Waco". It is actually one of the favorites of his films - secondly, after "Rosemary's Baby" - and moving straight to the mental decline of a person who went to a former apartment of suicides. All the residents of the building have all the flaky and stylists - even the slightest 'titter' becomes a big deal to keep noise down, and Polanski, who gradually becomes strayed and successful in successful self-hallucinations by carrying the film. Over. It's a matter of time before it is played like dresses and ex-tenants and where you realize that it's a dead-end window to rebuild the deadly jump ... Although the film is slightly slow and dawling for the film, if you ever have a romantic movie in Roman Polanski You see, but you should know that it is ending in a bank and this flash is not frustratingThis is also the best, if you do not question the complexity of the premises and it is considered to be an insane descent, it is also the best, because it is surprising for most of the time. Polanski is very awesome, very good as a sincere resident, since, sometimes, Ishjani never famous attractions. We see him running around drag, which is boring and ridiculous at the same time! Great, she makes for a ugly chick! So, Polanski fans - who will actually see his thirty-year-old pedophile charges - should enjoy "The Tenant" as a psychological head trip ...
