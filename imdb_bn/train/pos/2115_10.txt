After seeing the mail you got and feeling frustrated, I decided to watch the original movie, which inspired it, The Shop of Corner. I was surprised at this movie. It's a real jewel and one of my favorite movies at the moment. Acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, if you have not seen it, then I want to see it today. I'm not against rebuilding and sometimes I like a newer version than the original, but at the moment you have to admit that this is a bad adaptation to the matching classics you have. Do not miss it, go to your video store and rent today's corner shop!
