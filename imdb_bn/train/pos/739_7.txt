I had both kids from his Disney years, since I was a Jodie Foster fan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> comedy ("Little Darnings", anyone?) as the masked, Jodi seduction and addiction to their death by robust plunder The dragged teenagers went for the sad and tragic stories. <br /> <br /> This was not Disney. This was not turkey. This was not "Halloweed". It was a dark and powerful story of the destruction of the youth. Sadly, it's a story on a daily basis throughout the world that this movie can be replayed (with current soundtrack) and can still be completely relevant. <br /> <br /> This is not the best movie ever, it is tired in some parts, not all performance is particularly outstanding. But Jodie Foster continued to show her chips as a real adult actor (she started trending at a very young age on the taxi trick). <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 people
