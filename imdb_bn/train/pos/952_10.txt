So this TV site scored only for a 7.6 this site? Ah! Humbug! Without question, the classic 1984 edition of Dickens is the best of all time. And yes, the Hound 1951 version saw what was good, but was not good enough. The lack of color was probably the biggest lack of that version, though the acting was surprising. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott is incredible as simply Ebenezer Scrooge. We all know the story of this statistician who is inspired by the ghost of his deceased partner, then after that evening three spirits Scott is properly gruff as Scrooge. Really curious for some critics, who claim that he is unable to get the new found gly of the project, after the spirit teaches him a valuable lesson to wake up in the Christmas morning. But this is George C Scott. He's not going to dance down the street. He has great dignity, and his scrooge projects his passion in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> Assistant performances such as clothing, music, and scenery are absolutely excellent. Clive Donner's dreamy style came to life in the 19th century London. Borders on the scene in the film, even in different scenes involving spirits. Although the important stories of morality shines through through each frame. <br /> <br /> You often not broadcast this version on television, and that is a disappointment. The 1984 edition of a Christmas carol should be a necessary part of celebrating every family of the holiday. When the decoration comes out of the basement, this film must be directed to the DVD player at least once during the season. <br /> <br /> 10 10 stars <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
