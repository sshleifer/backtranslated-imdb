"Radiofresia" is still a good surprise to Italian cinema. This image was based on a book by Italian singer Luciano Ligabu, who runs the film and writes music scores. <br /> <br /> Portrait of life in the northern Italian province of Emilia Romagna. Region. In 1975, we created a "Radioprintus" among the first free radio time-film boys. Youth, love, friendship, love, sex, personal drama and unemployment themes are among the themes, but the film also talks about drugs - Frescia, the main character, the victim of heroin slavery. <br /> <br /> without boring and morality, the story flows very well; Actor spontaneity is strong and as well as the means of instruction. Obviously Luciano "Liga" is not Ligabuo, neither Philinia nor any movie professional, she is the first musician But he succeeded in making a good product. Unfortunately, he did not repeat the success of his second film "The Zero A Daiichi". All right. <br /> <br /> "RadioFrescia" is not usually very famous, the only star of Stevenano Accorory - one of the most popular young Italian actors. See a small role in other Italian songwriter Francois GÃ¼cini, he is a wonderful Communist Burman and football coach!
