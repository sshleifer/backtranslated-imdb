The first film was beautiful, but it was such a wonderful animated classic that I was not as good as being temperamental and respectful. This series is inferior, but not all bad. Of course the slapstick is too much, the script is uninspired on its weak spot and a tad of plot. But dogs are very intelligent here, and ridiculous as Arid Idol Maco. The image is beautiful with stylish cinematography and eye-popping clothing (especially of Krula), and the music is beautiful. Most of the acting is very good, Ion Graffood applying and Gerard Depardieau have enjoyed a good performance as a co-partner. But the best asset with the first film was the glamorous Glenn Close, which was a taste for Krubella, which was worse than ever. Overall, excellent. 7/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
