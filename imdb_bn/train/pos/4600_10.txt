This movie is topped, it should have at least the top 250 movies. This is the best action movie ever made. Today's action movies have been done badly by actors and action directors how to fight it and do not stunt properly. How to do it mostly from Hong Kong like Jackie Chan. Stunts are so clever and wild, I do not think we can see as before. Shan and his team began to move the hill car with a hill city where it started just amazing. The last fight stunt is the best film stunt for me to hold sometimes. The last stunts were hit badly by pushing across the glass.
