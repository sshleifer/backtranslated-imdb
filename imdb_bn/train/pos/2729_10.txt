I did not play well for good acting, voted for excellent. After reading the book it cooled me down, then saw the movie. Two former ears are traveling to their destination in order to loot the family of money from secure money for security while in prison. During the journey, tensions started because of the film's soundtrack being integrated into the overall context. Following the completion of their work in the murderers' farm, friends of the resident's daughter's church were found in the morning the next morning. A bloody scream, the scene inserted the cat cord into the telephone, really my blood became cold and cooled me. The killers who just fulfill their fate are a small consolation for this decayed family. Robert Blake was pretty impressed by his performance Perry Smith. The book was written by Truman Coppto.
