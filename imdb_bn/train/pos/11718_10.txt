Those who loved Elvira, I would love this movie as I did in the late night movie hostel responsibilities - he is very easy - his car is very cool, and he's a bit of transylvanian dickie part - he's time too innocent and stupid - and always sexy - plus, Mae West More than a touch - <br /> <br /> The set is well done, and comic cast is great, its usual best plus Sally Eddie McClurg Kellerman ridiculous as Patty. Anytime I have to do some crushing for topping, how do I differentiate alivira potato chips - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie will be seen at once - only For fun. Now I have to get a seagull, Elawyer Holded Hills, and see if it remains there ----
