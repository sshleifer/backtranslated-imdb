Tolstown version Hello, Dolly! Like this, Joe Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Era Levin's hit Broadway thriller could not wait for Shatter's incarnation before placing it on silver screen, so the producers wisely run its longest White Way! The opening and closing scenes of the mid-sized music box theater in New York, where they played DeathTrap for almost five years. Even theatre Marquee is a version of the famous fadeout StagePlay logo of the movie. (Even though marketers decided to go with Rubik's thick icon for the movie more fun.) <br /> <br /> In a low-cost DVD release, the DeathTrap seems to be as fresh and innovative as before. Cast is just right (better than their stages) and location scouts should be appreciated for finding a suitable spooky house for our "one room, two act thrillers". Wonderfully simple and innovative way by director Sidney Lewitt wisely tags a "new" element at the beginning and end of the film and releases Levin's evil exclave center. <br /> <br /> The last scene of this film is a big Hollywood exit from the board and a little less. Levin's plot is already in the movie [Helga (almost impersonation) in the film: "Another woman will be used to play."] Like Robert Oatman's player, however, our newest finale again helps to trap the image and stages, screen and (this could be?) Embrace the lines in real life!
