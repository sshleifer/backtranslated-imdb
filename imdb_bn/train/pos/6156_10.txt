This movie has always been a Disney movie in my favor. Then on 11/21/01 I saw the 30th anniversary of the movie DVD. WOW I think why I liked this movie. DVD is so great, it's an extra 30 minutes that was not original. I do not know this when I first see it. Made so much more from the movie. The song they are cutting will have to be left. You have not seen this movie until you have seen the full 131 mini version. Many people say that music is forgotten. I think every song in this movie seems to be, by its own voice, it comes with its own skin, and a hole as well. When I was young, I remember the song "Eaglantine" for a day was stuck on my head. As well as "Brini Sagar" (the song that was meant to marry Poppena but was dropped from the film) Please see the new Oscars 30th annual film and vote for this movie again. 10 that really is it
