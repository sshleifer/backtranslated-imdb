Although it can not be the so-called so-called "classic" movie, according to today's standard, but it is still valuable. Because the main reason for the experience of this film is that more than 60 percent counter-cultural idealism, whether you feel good or bad, you feel. I saw it in the English literature class in Sanni Janeso, and although it seems to be a fictitious composition of the first 60's icons, the film is just far from "throwing together". <br /> <br /> If my point is unhappy with the film and leave the feeling of confusion, the film has done its job: it has released a lonely scene in the future that makes you feel uncertain and angry. It was probably the same feeling that this film wanted to discover the young. For example, "Jabersky Point" may not be very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters can be unilateral and predictable. However, both Mark and Daria must express it with this transparency, as well as the rebellious desire to be separated from the sharing of it. Even anti-establishment students are inhuman because they are not rebellious.
