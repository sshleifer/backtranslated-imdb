The Way, NAFTA was drafted long before the 1980s, and the corporations started running their national identity, the United States and Japan were knocked on each other in world manufacturing competitions. Remember, 'union is yes!', 'Japan is taking this country,' and 'Americans are lazy?' '<br /> <br /> The Reagan era has collapsed and the corporations are heading towards the world market, director Ron Howard has traveled with his 1986 comic' Gang Ho 'in a comedy style, which is more than $ 36 million in US box office receipts Earned. Although, in many ways, Howard's tongue-in-the-gole story tells the story of the conflict in the workplace, the harsh truth for today's art life. <br /> <br /> 'Gong Ho' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Cutton). A small, depressed city in the foothills of Pennsylvania, Hadleyville, to automakers union rep. Stevenson has been asked to meet Tokyo's seat motor company (Real Life Toyota), which considers a US operation in the bare plant of the city. Along with hundreds of residents' work and the city's collapse, Assan agreed to decide, and Stevenson was hired as a line of assembly between the company's officers and employees. <br /> <br /> A humorous look, their strengths and weaknesses on these two sides are considered equally: On one hand, the American heritage which values ​​its heritage is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade union; On the other hand, Japanese workers are highly dedicated to their jobs, but there is a lack of personal satisfaction and sense of self-worth. In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the ability to chat with people through wrong wit. Stevenson has kept his staff alive and most of the headlists in line, Stevenson proves to a person who does not want much more than a fair chance, though his cleverness will make him suffer a lot. In addition to responding to Asan's chiefs, we saw a fine balance between Stevenson and his fellow union members, among whom he grew up. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Tarturo), and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron's brother). <br /> <br /> Goddess Wadeb, led by Japanese cast, who is' Soland Mandels' and 'Volunteers. 'Watanabe Kazihiro, who plays down the plant manager on his fate and starts feeling sympathy for American life. He is the Saina (Sub Shimono), who is the nephew of Seatan's CEO, constantly shadowed, who is frustrated to take his place at the order of the chit. Although given a light touch, these characters are very good to explain the Japanese work culture concepts. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> 'Gang Ho' is actually Slam-Dunk's success for Keaton, who also meets Ron Howard of The Paper of 1994. He created this movie in a string of lighter, which is' Mr. Mr. Before joining Mother, 'Beetle Juice,' and 'Dream Team' 'Batman', 'One Good Cop', and 'My Life'. It is not very difficult to pick Gededee Watanabe's acting as a weird man who wears shameful Japanese rib before getting together with Stevenson to get together with Stevenson. <br /> <br /> Nike like Sekamotro, CEO of Ascend, including Support, Cast, Warrent, Torrento, Shimono and Soh Yamamur. Mimi Rogers offers a romantic interest in Audrey, Hunt's girlfriend. Edwin Bloom, Lowell Ganz and Babel Mandel gathered together for a strong write of Gong Ho. The compilation music, received by a Bogra Film Music Award, was compiled by Thomas Newman. Gong Hoi's soundtrack songs include 'Do Get Me Ring,' 'Tough Enf,' and 'Working Class Man' from 80 to the wall to the wall. <br /> <br /> ABC led a short-term TV series. Twenty years ago, as a social commentary more impressive, Ron Howard's film still has a comic value. It is available as a part of the Paramount Wide Screen Collection collection and a tad changed very short. Audio options are provided in the English 5.1 area, around English Dolby and French 'dubbing' but subtitles are in English only. There is no extra, no theater trailer. Plus, the credit of opening the digital transit of the paramount is quite good with a little grain after the high and low sound. Although there were some extra help - especially the 'Gang Ho' box office success - there was little to complain about the film's presentation. <br /> <br /> *** 4
