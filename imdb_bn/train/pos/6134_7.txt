I just have to go outside and buy it until something holds me in the DVD. This was one of those movies. Like many others here, I remember seeing it as a child and liking it. I did not know the scenes and musical numbers were cut, so I can see what they might be. I agree that the "Portbawlow Road" sequence is now quite long (such as football play), but in other words, I could not find any qualification with the rest of the scenes that were brought back to their respective places. Probably Disney had the original version (retrieved version) with the version retrieved by flip, then people can choose what they want to see. After all, it is still an entertaining movie which still managed to recover my childhood memories.
