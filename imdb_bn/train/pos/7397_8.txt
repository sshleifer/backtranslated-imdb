"Xizao", the story of modern life and ancient traditions, and clashes of its influence on a family of China. Da Ming (Quanxiu Pu), a businessman who believes in the letter sent by his brother, Yeh Ming (Wu Jiang), his father Liu (Zhu Zhu) died. Her father is still alive, as well as her old neighborhood and her father's old business, public bathrooms. He has seen that this film is centered around The Ming's family, and how he must learn the importance of his father's job, something he always considered an old tradition that was soon to die. Also, film Ari Ming, who is mentally challenged, and bathroom problems and bathrooms are a place that not only purifies their bodies but also their souls. The two main themes of the movie, family and progress issues are incredibly well-managed, and the movie is never trying to make it lose, both themes are very well developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs <br /> <br /> Director Young Zhang told his story in simple ways, character characters work. This is a very easy method, but it fits perfectly with the movie and I am very doubtful that another style fits this good movie. Zhang has a lot of potential, because he can tell stories in a scene or with camera tricks. <br /> <br /> Actor is outstanding in her natural outlook, everyone works very naturally and it shows almost as if they were shooting real people. Three main characters give extraordinary performance and Uy Jiang, like Ming, certainly stole the show. <br /> <br /> Even the movie can "clutter" the old days to make the message safer, even a balanced attitude, as the progress seems to be good, and we must proceed, but we are from where we came from Do not forget and maintain balance between modern life and old traditions. <br /> <br /> is a remarkable, and touching film. 8/10
