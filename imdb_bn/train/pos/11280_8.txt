A very interesting entertainment with the charm of old movies. At the moment if it is needed, Tarzan faces the greatest danger without risk, and we all enjoy it with its success. The most enthusiasm for me is that without a special power the person beat him with a special power and man's skill. (He was a great swimmer and had a great scream)
