Chris Girolmo is taking care of us that we will not only be given a list of people named 'Jack-The-Stripper' to be killed: he was born in a psychological way with convincing results.

Which makes the film more like a hazardous account of Rastov's Butcher's history. Supporting actors, especially Mac von Pido, have done their part really well. Good directions Photography was very good. Not saying that this image was shot in Hungary, some of its obstacles were created, but, really, giving the storytelling and interpretation of depth, we can completely forget that little Turkia. <br /> <br> Once upon a time, a movie made from HBO to TV came with tips. Recommended, especially if you want to forget some of the characteristic analysis and morbid scenes ?? That is, I'm quick to add, never exaggerated.
