I grew up on the time that this movie was popular in the music. Good time for music and dance! My only complaint was that I was too young to go to the USA and Nightclubs. It seems as if I was living in the past (I have excellent memories) so what's wrong with that? !!? World War II was a terrible time, where the song was concerned. Glenn Miller's death is a terrible sadness for us. This movie will be my favorite. Cleo line was nice; What a beautiful voice! I do not know how to miss this movie. The main reason for this commentary is to alert modern generations as alternative to rap and new age music, which is objectionable to me. Please watch this movie and give it a chance!
