An amazing film, filled with great understated performance and sharp, intelligent dialogue. The film really does make a difference, but it is a matter of grief. The story is subject to issues, loneliness, suicide, frustration, fear of losing a job in the world, where it has crushing consequences. Most of it was established in a world that was separated from the beginning of World War II around the world. In fact, if you compare the percentage of serious scenes in a comic scene, then the film is just a comedy. Yet the funny thing is - listen to the harsh dismissal of Margaret Sullivan of Jigy Stewart and see his sad expression, he replies that his comments are an extraordinary mix of "poetry and money". It's funny, points, and once sad. Made an outstanding achievement and the ten greatest screen comedy.
