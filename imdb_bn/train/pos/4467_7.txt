Frank Sinatra and Jane Kelly, as well as the most enjoyable songs and dance films played by Katherine Greson. <br /> <br /> This image is George E. Won for Stall's score and Oscar, and nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as Best Son nomination for the song "I Paul in Love Yolly". <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story about ink that her father helped her to get to the girl Sinaata. The lovely Greson (New Orleans Toast) surprised us by singing her songs, and Kelly and Cinetra, and piano-conductor José Iturière had many of our songs and dance routines. <br /> <br /> gone by a classic Hollywood music from an era.
