If you have heart and compassion for people, at least it's a hard movie to see it. <br /> <br /> This is in the segment where we see a pretty little child beaten and after that a disabilities (mentally challenged) people are deeply endowed after witnessing this cruel treatment against the child. It's not a nice element <br /> <br /> However, it is a good movie and well played. <br /> <br /> "Dominic" is played by mentally disabled guy and Tom Hulce. I think this could be Hulce's best role. He played Red Loyotta, "Eugene", who played with Kevin Coster's "Dream of Field". "Dominic" is a heartwarming person who loves "hlak" comic books and wrestling. He is the type of "slow" person you can not help but loves to live a happy life and the route. When he is frustrated, it's a good reason and ... well, watch the movie for the whole story. It's worth your time but is ready to go on the real emotional roller coaster and perhaps some things you see are very annoying.
