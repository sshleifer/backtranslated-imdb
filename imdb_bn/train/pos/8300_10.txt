After all, there is nothing to be surprised about after creating a tumor on his sinus hole, this film is also a bad decision, but I have fully enjoyed it. 5 minutes in the first 5 minutes most reluctant; The annoying, the bad dialage and then, with Spiderman's stance, the worst line of any film on the subject is suppressing the bad line ... "Your worst nightmare booth!" I'm nagging my eggs so hard so laughing up. That line is very similar, it is also on the top of the cloner's notorious "High Fridge, I'm Batman" line. Other classic moments have always been annoyed by reminding people that he killed his former CIA partner ... who shot him dead in the chest (which made everyone possible with the order of soup-speed flashbacks, which looks like the color of the paint looks dry Is exciting) There is an ashre in the face of the face, face on the face, and a "that was not my fault and you know it!" Well, this footage shows him in the absence of the bad guys and killing his friend ... so loudly, his ex-girl friend has left the grenade on the ground to be able to run away - a plan that is all about logic, physics, and absurdity. And to the end, when Macbayne came out of Thunderblast during the intense guerrilla war, and prevented and obstructed a small object, I kept myself wet. Buishi's best works are far away, rent or buy "Boothorn!" My vote is a perfect 10 (that's on the pool meter).
