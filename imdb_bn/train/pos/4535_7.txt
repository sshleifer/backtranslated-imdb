The first 50 minutes of this movie were quite annoying. It was the personal issue focused on the death threats by fans, including his sick wife in Vienna, a pushy publisher and mentally ill parents-related crime. Although these issues had an important effect on the life of Dollex, I was more interested in the birth of Sherlock Holmes. The last 40 minutes was excellent. We finally saw a look inside the dail head, how he made Holam and why he had to kill Homes. The actors are excellent Tim McInnney, Arthur Conan Dowell, Douglas Henschal and Brian Cox played an engaging role playing 'Roll Model' for Sherlock Holmes. Bell. The location is good, especially for a TV movie and camera work. If the first 50 minutes is good, the last 40 minutes it was a little masterpiece.
