This movie is a very relaxed, romantic-comedy, which is quite enjoyable. Meg Ryan Albert worked very well as a gifted beggar of Einstein, though he believes in his own skills. Tim Robbins works an equally good job as mechanic that falls in love with her when her car stuffs up into her shop with her drunk then. I love Walter Mathew as one and only Albert Einstein. This movie has just a very comfortable feeling, though it still has some importance (if it is possible then it happens here). <br /> <br /> I personally got this movie very entertaining, especially old scientists - I thought they were happy and ridiculous! This movie seems to be poor outside of understanding. If you have a cheeky sense of humor, this is the movie for you!
