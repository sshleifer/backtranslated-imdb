The best animated movie ever made. This movie is not only with the wonderful effects of modern animation, but also the human mind, spirit and branch of philosophy. There is a family of cats in the story, where a big sister dies, the younger brother sees this and rescues his body, but when he wakes up, he goes without the spirit. So, the two siblings started a journey to find it in the cats. I much like this journey. The history of the world, the Bible, the cycle of life, and every time I see it I discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors. If you are not in its physical perspective, you still respect it. Animation will be sparkling, and creative scenes will be attached to the screen. For example, frozen during the ocean, God eating the sun from Earth, Hansel and Gretel have a strange and little SNM retelling. In conclusion, cats soup is the perfect treatment for a person. <br /> <br /> PS-Including free violence, not for kids.
