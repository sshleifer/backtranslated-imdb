Wow, this image had a huge impact on me, it moved me, This is an extraordinary story about a Cambodian girl selling sex stories. I can not think of the fate of the little girl called Holly. The film's setting was realistic, the film was an eye-opener, I could not imagine that anyone is moving away from here and wants to help change with this awful problem. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was very moving. One of the best movies I saw this year is the one. <br /> <br /> The girl who plays Holly does a great job with her character. Ron Livinston gives a fantastic performance. The film took me to tears, it is an important message that needs to be heard worldwide. Everyone will go to see this picture. I think this film will make a difference, I like it!
