The film is basically a stupid Robert Taylor focused on a ruthless torch hunter and those with him. Set in a search to reduce fragile numbers, it illustrates the end of a sad era of stupid killing and is full of drama and remorse for both Buffalo and Native Americans. Taylor is blinded by the hatred and darkness of Indians that shepherds will never disappear. At one stage, he shot animals after animals, on the other hand he killed Indians and then consumed food cooked in their fire. This unscrupulous outsider is an unsuspecting person who has fallen short of begging for her colleagues (Stuart Granger, Lloyd Nalan, and Ras Tamblin). It is not the most entertaining of movies and it is filtered by the play made, which leads to a neutral and very suitable conclusion in the membrane.
