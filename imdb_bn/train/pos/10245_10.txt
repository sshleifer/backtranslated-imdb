It was my personal favorite when it was small, it was all great with the movie of 90's kids ... loving dinosaurs, cute kids, an extravagant villain and a few great songs (and usually little miscarriage / beauty, and type of animals, But those who are at least recreational)! I recently ran into this movie again and I still love it as much! I recommend that everyone of every age should watch this movie, and I must think that it should be started for the younger generation! Sorry, not the most informative, I'm slow ... just trust me please. Those who go against this photo are killing their infant child!
