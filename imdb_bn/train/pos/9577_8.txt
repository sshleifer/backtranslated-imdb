Finally, in our summer 2006 season we have a third movie. The equal parts are made from cruelty, crime and passion, dog bite dogs are not only from an appropriate headline, but also benefit from flexible aspects, excellent cinematography and respectable performances from the most involved. Of course there must be a catch here, which has been published in the form of several fuzzy inconsistencies, but everyone has been told that DBD represents a mature attitude that HP would like to see in the mainstream. <br /> <br /> It is also the return of the arrival of the audition chain, which is not long after a preliminary startup a year ago. Chen's protected machismo works wonders for the movie, but it was rough against Sam Lee, whose comedy plays a solid role in the change between physical comedy (Crazy 'n' City, Any Problem 2) and Eccentric Damage. Since he was made in Hong Kong, he has been seen. <br /> <br /> Together, two dogs make dog dogs, and hope Edison is going to break easily from now: his touch has transformed the project from Prince D. Infinite Sages Saga, and still she remains a rare event. <br /> <br /> In most cases, the DBD shows some sparkling imagery, playing fantastic tricks with light, shadows and perspectives. The soundtrack enhances this atmospheric effect, which adds a complete overall mythical mood to the film. As a result, most of the combinations are likely to be done with the author Matt Chor, who previously had similar horror three extremists. Dog bite dog retains many features from the horror project, such as the randon urbanscapes and some floating air hiding around the corner. <br /> <br /> Make sure to rest, this is not a horror movie, instead of a classic one night before the monk, a path has been eroded, though it is more than a mile from the opposite angle. We have Edison to replace Daniel U's unwanted mainland murderer's character, under undisputed unnamed killing machine in Cambodia. Sending a single target to Hong Kong, almost silent killers take care of the business after the arrival, a process suddenly shows courtesy of the bright visuals of the film. <br /> <br /> While becoming a professional since childhood, Edison's intended wild dogs are still human weaknesses and leave a trill, taken by a CID team sent for investigation. This gathering also has a great show with great support from view-movie Stewart Lam Sueut and TV star Owen Lyai. However, Sam Lee's Resumed Officer conducted the y-charge, expressing himself as a very annoying person but a nice police. We gradually learned Y's internal conflicts that his father's police had drowned from the background of corruption, which undoubtedly made unabashed efforts that make the giant easy. <br /> <br /> The number of a small body becomes transparent, because Edison prisoners are non-no. Most of the shop's violence is quantum, although Gore seems to be down in every second place, and the adult language creates only a token look. Once more, no nudity, one after the other at the end of Cat III is being handed over immediately. Still, DBD is a relatively mature theatrical release, and we appreciate its arrival. <br /> <br /> In a fight, fighting, hijacking, hacking and shooting, even a career killer needs some romance, and like Sisteria Chung is a nightmare like Daniel Woo, so cruel Mr. Chen gets a sweetheart, nicely done by the new comer PEE . His prolific character (such many emancipation) combines Edison with a strange exile landfill, seeking insulting madness and exemption from his father. When the killer robs the HK, he agrees to take her with him, and they move around together, they love to return to the road. The movie does not depend on the boyfriend-Dove staff, our heart enjoys the tragic character of the PEPE and its endless suffering. He presented a terrific but brave hero in a nicely, that there are no good or bad guys established here, it has been published by a very enthusiastic end. <br /> <br /> Director Cheyang Soehy's portfolio, the latest mysterious thriller home sweet home and war zone of love with Ezan Chan, probably due to the harmful behavior of dog dogs, two figures exceeded the maximum. Chang flows across DBD and considering the various parts of the game here, the climate created by public like Jonny Towler criticizes the epic epic missile. Edison fascinates two glitches to impressively chest on the chest, but these are very forgiving. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We would like to come back to the city's cinema, do not stand out for doggie dog stories. It has a strong firm imagery and style, a deep aspect for the Thespian muscle strength and the visual and ultra-sensual impression. <br /> <br /> Long-term storytelling story with HK changes during city night-ego, some dog bite carries lovingly, does not have a proper run if a firm runs amount. <br /> <br /> Ratings: * * * *
