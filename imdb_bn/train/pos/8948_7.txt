This is a kind of movie that was made today, perhaps it will play Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant; In fact, now I think about it, it is quite responsible to re-schedule it one day.

This is the only actress in this movie, in which Kaviaks, in the role of small supporter of an aspiring writer, whose performance you can say "intellect". (** 1/2)
