Some pictures should not be simply rebuilt. This is one of them. And it's not a bad film in itself. But the 1963 film of the same title failed to catch the smell and terrorism. Liam Nisson was always nice and with the exception of over Wilson, most of the cast did not feel the right of leak character. But the main drawback of this version is that it spread far beyond the story of Sherly Jackson, with Grandoj's efforts, and lost some romance in the previous movie which was closed for special effects on snapshots. Again I would say that this is not a bad movie between it and myself. But you enjoy the old version of the hate of terrorism.
