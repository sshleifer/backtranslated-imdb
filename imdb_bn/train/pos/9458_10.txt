This is a wonderful part of filmmaking. It flows at the right speed. The accompanying music fits perfectly and the ear is very joyful. The comic part has a lot of fun and the film has done more than the depressing tragedy. <br /> <br /> However, there was some sadness for me to look at this despite having many comments about the underlying tragedy of the story. I've enjoyed it in a way that I did not feel for a long time. That is to say, it's superb and yet as with all the usual impressions of modern film; Gender, violence, and unnecessary special effects. <br /> <br /> 'Dan in Real Life' lacks nothing to do without regular weaknesses. This is a perfectly mature plot that is not required only, and in reality it will be destroyed by a decoration. At the same time, the theme is completely adult. This is an art that infuses you in yourself and itself and you do not want much more than it already has. <br /> <br /> There are some scenes that 'Walton' feel a little bit, but it really gives it a completely correct idea as long as they are in contrast to more effective moments. Rasa creates a path for grief that gives the idea to darkened ideals. This undesirable landscape of emotional cinematography creates perfect balance and puts the viewer at the stability position of lithium. Peaks and velvety are mild, but they are more than enough to raise the joy. <br /> <br /> I usually recommend viewing this type of movie that you normally enjoy. It must be seen as to remove an ancestor!
