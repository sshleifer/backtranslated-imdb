One line summed up, when I came out of the theater, two movies are making such comments on me. "Echo of Story" with Kevin Bacon and the second was "Vanilla Sky". <br /> <br /> If you sit in the theater seat deeply and stop thinking about someone around you, be amazed at whether or not the film ends and accelerate the movie wherever you want ... Something like going out of the movie It was strange, it looks like you have been sick and can not remember anything. One of those people that you become one with one another and thinks that nothing more is left to you than the movie's image. <br /> <br /> One thing is sure. The actor is awesome, the soundtrack is excellent and the movie is all about 9+. <br /> <br /> Of course I have seen one of the best movies, and the movie that makes the best and most vulnerable is my life and my purpose in this world.
