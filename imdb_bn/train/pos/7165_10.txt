I recorded before this age but only got round watching today. I got sick, so I saw the stuff! I am very glad I saw it, and which is how I remove my memory and I can see again for the first time. This movie is so wonderful! It reminds me a lot of fried green tomatoes at Whistlestop Cafe. <br /> <br /> The story goes back again and at the end of the movie we can see what the links are. Some people say this is a children's movie. I disagree - it can be made by Disney and many characters are children, but I'm 23 years and I like it! There was a moment when my spine tingled. The story is full of contrast, unlike any other film these days. I just ordered the book from Amazon, I can not wait!
