Although I'm not a big fan of musical instruments, Fred Fraser and Zinger Rogers have liked movies because they are very fun. Of course, they can be a little startup, but what you know is happening, they are still very happy to see. However, despite this, I was a little disappointed in this outing. This part is as shown in the top movie, so the film does not have a great supporting cast or we dance. Apart from Edward Everton Horton or Eric Blora, the film lacks a little - especially in the "fun" section. The stupid antics of this supporters give other films the chances that you simply will not follow the Fleet. In addition, in contrast to the normal character acted by Astaire, this one's more of the wounds - such as his fat head repeatedly gets the Rogers. And, as a result, it's hard to like him and to see them together at the end of the film. Plus, though the music is by EVIL Berlin, the song just does not seem memorable. Actually, the songs were not any special and I can not remember any of them though I saw the movie. Although it is still a tricky and worthwhile film, it only lacks the flashes and magic of some other movies. Well but far from great
