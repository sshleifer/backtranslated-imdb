The Finnish version of Robert Ottman's "Short Cuts", set in small village Ã„nekoski. These episodes present a calyidoscope of eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and confusion, frustration and death. I was particularly impressed by two episodes. The first is the story of Wet Wetres, who tries to raise a romance for his colleagues: he radiates a great joy in love and life. He represents another episode and dies in an old hospital and his wife is trying to die by dignity. Especially suddenly, the old couple have to follow the path of their abusive behavior in the hospital and the "routines" of the crew (despite occasional symptoms of sympathy) against their loneliness. Compared to Altman's classic, this film is probably less professional, but it is certainly a great part of the industry.
