This is a fun business, movie review. These days, when "internal emotion" and "emotional isolation" are favorable on the straightforward feeling, then it should be hard to stay faithful to your true feelings. <br /> <br /> After operating the jury duty at 58th Berlin, I was managed <br /> <br /> <br /> After screening, I dreamed theater, pirates, men, women, and critics alike. Even the director of Berlin, perhaps the strongest filmmaker, admitted that he was unaware and watched himself crying three quarters of the road in this uncomfortable feeling. <br /> <br /> But am I really surprised that the reviews came later. Despite the inexperienced movements by the film, many critics chose to be cruel and emotionally unseated in their writings. Apparently, crying, they kept their "thoughts hat" and as a result, I missed the feeling I felt was the talent of Kabaeei. <br /> <br /> <br /> Let me explain. <br /> <br /> The Eastern War set in Japan, the story of Kabaye revolves around the author's family, and after firing her fortune, which was described as a "crime of thought" against Imperial will. Through long-term mental scenes, do you know a person with us, his faithful wife and two daughters, as well as the three side characters? A person's strong sister, a fool's former student and a uncle's cad? ? Everyone in the family comes to help with their disaster, in the absence of homesteads <br /> <br /> The story continues in a slow pace while the story continues slowly and suddenly all of us are all capable of being suddenly. to guess. It certainly makes the audience impossible to get very emotionally boring by any dramatic event. In other words, although you learn to love family and their supporters and they are sympathetic with their unfortunate circumstances, you are so frustrated by the assurance of this plot that you are expecting yourself a special kind of end. However, two hours in the film (Do not worry, Yamada provides visitors with enough gravity and tide along with you), she slaps you with what I can only describe as "sting". What is the story that you said about everything that was the story? An innocent man jumped from his trusted wives and daughters ?? Now suddenly a family helper point. Anyone you've got to grant so far has now been thrown into an unexpected twist of luck. <br /> <br /> At this moment, there was some strange phenomenon in the theater I was in. Everyone started without little or no interruption. <Br> <br /> "My words!" I muttered under my breath. It hit me, then "Kabi", in final analysis, was more than a film about a family separated by an empire at the end of the war. In fact, it was a common human intelligence test: how worried we were about the secret feelings of our closest people. <br /> <br /> Now, the most common criticism of the film was technically difficult, but lack of innovation. That's what happens when critics put their parable thought cap on, I guess. With Kabir, I believe, to touch a unique aspect of dowry, he knew what Yamji Jamada is going to do with the technique. He used shamelessly in a great old strategy, Tiara-Sun series, and later, at the same time in Sebeye. <br /> <br /> After putting the audience in a comfortable cozy area, he dropped us into emotional states and rarely searched the movie. <br /> <br /> This is my most effective cinematic tool. One which avoids detection, but deeply affects. And its effectiveness was one thousand wet pieces of the Clenix, thousands of Citro films were thrown out just a liter bent outside the hall. <br /> <br /> Now, if some critics keep getting caught up to be smart, they really forget about the movie. Human emotions Pure and simple
