With plenty of sunshine, gauge lights and shadow filtering through windows and rooms, running shots on the mob with cameras, hand-held shots, quick-edited editing and extreme close-ups, photography is an interesting, interesting thing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot of this photo begins with a little falafi about the beauty contest. This film began on a warm Sunday in the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely Lucien Ur Lulu (played by Luis Brooks) - PoulaSide shows some of the show-offs before Gouqing's men, he soon decided to enter France to represent France in the beauty contest of Miss Europe. For, his very jealous, stick-in-the-mad fiances (a very annoying colleague , Real). By reducing the runway, ten contestants showed themselves in swimsuit, the winner was selected as the longest congratulatory competitor (I was thinking that girls can not run slowly to extend their deadline - and thus worship - on the catwalk?!). Lulu is soon pursuing by the Prince and the Maharaja, but his warm head does not like the attention given by other men or his people.

Even though the version printing was very clear and nice contrast, I just tried to ignore the problem of the sound and see the movie visually, and I found the movie to be nice, to see it. Law.
