I saw this movie as a teenager and quickly identified the script of Reese Witherspoon, a 14 year old Danny Trant, in the rural city of Louisiana in 1957. He thinks that he has seen his elder sister, Maurine (now rarely) Emily Warfild), and feels from the place in terms of her conservative Baptist encouragement. Then seventy-year-old Court Foster (Jason London), son of close friend of his mother (Gail Strickland), goes to the next post, Danny gets his first crash experience, when the court enjoys his company and deliberate spirit. Danny succeeds to get her first kiss from her, but whenever she sees Morine, he bowed down on the heels for him, leaving behind the rug. The close bond of sisters fell seriously because of the rebellion, which is only deep when the court dies in an accidental accident. Girls have to realize how much each other needs. <br /> <br /> Sam Waterson and Tess Harper's boyfriend are perfect as parents, trying to balance the personality of their girls together at the same time family together. Beautiful cinematography, and the Elvis Presley Awesome Soundtrack, The Plotters and many more are astonishing in the atmosphere of the simplest time film. <br /> <br /> An upcoming old movie with an uninterrupted message.
