Afterwards, I saw movies ... I thought, "Why did this film achieve so much success in the Korean box office?" Even the film seems to be a tricky / unreasonable scene, the performance was not good and the letters were not very interesting. For the Korean film ... I liked war scenes. If you want to see a film without thinking, this is the film for you. But I acknowledge that the film was like a baby ... 6/10
