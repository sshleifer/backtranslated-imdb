I know it's weird, and I know that it's not on all the PCs, but it's very interesting. If you can keep it from the point of view in the 80's and bear all the stratotypes of its timeline - and the film still leaves you almost exhausted with laughter - it's really a good comedy. Thousands of years of comedy is going on with her heritage, the film is very much felt. If you can suspend your political purity for one and a half hours, just wait to see it, please than watching it <br /> <br /> <br /> Anyone will insert it into the DVD, this is no longer It is very difficult to find VHS.
