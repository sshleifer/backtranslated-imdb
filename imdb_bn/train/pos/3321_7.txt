I saw "fever pitch" sorted by accident; It was flying in Europe, the plane was playing. It was not actually half bad. Ben (Jimmy Fallon) is the # 1 Red Sox fan in the world, but he can avoid his relationship with Lindsay Max (Drew Barrymore). How this movie can affect the people's relations in world is fairly interesting It has been particularly noticed that Red Sox ended their 80-year losing line. I guess these things will happen all the time and we just did not notice them. Not too bad. <br /> <br /> Another example of the unusual relationship of baseball is the "Frequency" of 2000. Check them both.
