In this theater I was one of the few movies I met twice. I really love this movie for her to say in life of this atmosphere and tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He made a lot of mistakes but got the chance to get a chance. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time, I thought that after the election, after the election, the movie will end - I did not know the book. So during the dramatic hiking, the boy was wrong! I was overwhelmed by the perfect power of the last half hour of the film. <br /> <br /> Many people here are totally disliked in this movie. I do not understand that single bit. Perhaps those who read the book first - with screen adaptations of novels - often disappointed that many things remain incomplete, invisible, unknown. But as a movie story telling a tale - a family story, the rise and fall of a man, deep compassion of a woman, the power of love and hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is simply awesome! In addition, the soundtrack is incredibly good and Cast Wonder - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> So a movie was created for the movies!
