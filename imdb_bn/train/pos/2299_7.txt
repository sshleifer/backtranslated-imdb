Is not that an educational movie genre that is horrible, huh? Thanks to this wonderful little movie for Hammer, I do not know at all that a strange visitor in my own home should give a piece of salt with some wine or bread, because he can be just hypnotist and this combination will give him control over my thoughts and mind forever For! Thanks Hammer! I wanted to see one of the tenth episodes of the House of Horror series, mainly because the man in the director's chair was Don Sharp; One of Britain's best filmmakers, but still sadly involved. Sharp was responsible for very good Hammer films, such as "Kumar of the Vampire" and "Raspatin: The Mad Monk", as well as some independent productions such as "Dark Spacees" and "Psychomania" are applicable. His contribution to the House of Heroes is easily one of the best in the series, it outlines a complex but impressive plot and rolling in delightful hidden themes. The plot focuses on two antique vendors, which blur on a strange object similar to a mirror, but it is actually an ancient screening device that can be used to call the moonlight; Unstable monster protector. The mirror is greatly preferred by a satirical god, because it requires it for their programs, but Michael is unwilling to sell it before knowing the actual value of the device. When he presented a clearly dressed girl running on behalf of religion to refrain from the sacrifice, then Michael became deeply involved in a secret conspiracy. Devil discipline and youthful women's festivals are usually British horror, but David Fischer's screenplay is never absolute and proposes lots of tiny plots twits, among which a very innovative measure There are lots of excuses for the praise, the dialogues are intelligent and the performances are excellent (especially John Carson is truly cruel as the leader of this religion). Recommended!
