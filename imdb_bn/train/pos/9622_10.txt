I just saw this movie in Showtime. Actually by accident, quite a lot. If I do not sleep for only two hours for the last two days, I would not return home from work. If I did not come home from work, I would not see this movie. I did not know what I was missing, but I missed a lot. <br /> <br /> This movie is like this. It is playing around Kevin Bacon effect. That and causality (hence above my verbiage). Never character is intertwined in some way or another. Action, feedback, interaction, non-interaction. This movie is just amazing. I'm going to find a copy of the buy.
