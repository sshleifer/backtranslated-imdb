I have seen this picture 25 years ago, and I have always said that this is probably the best movie I have ever seen. It seems that there was no oral dialogue and only in the thought dialogue, I saw the film get excited and I kept my breath in myself so that there is no sound. I highly anticipate this film, I wish it is available on DVD.
