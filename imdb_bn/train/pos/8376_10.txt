There's one of the best movies out there. Yes maybe cinematography was not the greatest, but an excellent plot and idea. Great for time and brilliant and creative ideas. Something different from normal movies and great fun Anyone who likes my favorite and creative and imaginative movies will recommend During the First World War 3 and Giant Robots, during the war, the actor gave a great performance and made it worth all. The set is not surprising, but easy and work for the overall appearance of the film. This movie is very hard to find DVD, but also VHS. Check it out because I liked it since it came out. Do not look like a mainstream flick and you've ever seen it. Take a look and feel like a baby. This is a great view and very funny.
