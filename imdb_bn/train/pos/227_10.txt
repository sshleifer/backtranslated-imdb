According to IMDb.com's movie databases, Robert Duval Confederate General Robert E. Direct descendant of Lee. After watching this movie, you may think that the appearance of Duval is the resurrection of the best. One of my favorite movies. I wish for a composer, Peter Rogers was a melnik's CD or there was a soundtrack. Wonderful scenery and music and "all very true-life", especially for those of us who live or have gone south. This is a "real moment of time." Life is running slowly, but "we are not strangers."
