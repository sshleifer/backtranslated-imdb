The same store (James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan) is a warm, sweet and extraordinary charming movie about two Antigonic workers who know how to manage romance through a mailbox. The key to the success of this movie is that Ernst LÃ¼btich absences no feelings of absence and tells his actors to give low-key, irrational performance. As a result, you really fall in love with all of them. <br /> <br /> Running through this movie is unfortunately a strong undercurrent that I appreciated. Loneliness is a major theme, representing the character of most store owners and manager, wonderful performances by Frank Morgan. He discovered that his wife misbehaved him and realized that he has lived a successful life for himself, when he is not a sharing partner, then his loneliness is not enough to feel. It creates more horrific romances between Stuart and Sulvan, because they both can reach this invisible, who everyone thinks of sacrificing before meeting. Finally we know that everything will end in the end, but the movie does not let you forget the uncomfortable feeling, if they find that the reality does not live with fantasy. lubitsch fills his film with a crackerjack cast, which carries chemistry. A small group of shop employees mentions themselves as a little family throughout the film and how we feel about it. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, impossible romance. <br /> <br /> Grade: A +
