Tom and Jerry are well remembered when signing a peace treaty. The things are idyllic for a while but, predictably, it goes freaky. Perhaps the most memorable moment was the pipe, frying pan, and a baseball bat that was attached to the beginning and end of two plus pups. I enjoyed a bunch and you should try to catch it on the cartoon network.
