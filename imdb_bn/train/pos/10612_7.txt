It's Chess, it's weird, it's fairly, but that makes it so much fun. It's just a little ridiculous that got on top of melodramatic moments. This movie is great to have fun. Rent it for a good smile. <br /> <br /> The film is centered around three women journalists, during the earlier period of cell phones. They cover a festival entering a small town, but they can not get a room to stay at night. And when they meet Ernest Keller. She is a psycho kind way weird. And he allowed them to stay at home. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the movies are uninterrupted, although it is very interesting to find out the truth of Ernest's family. <br /> <br /> It is a look to see this cast in this scene. Barbara Bach and Doug Bar make candy in good eye. <br /> <br /> I consider the movie an old jewel, looking for it and valuing it.
