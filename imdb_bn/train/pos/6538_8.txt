I liked this movie very much. It has succeeded in doing something that now makes several movies; It gives me family value while entertaining me. Nancy Drew is looking for a role model for a heroine and young girls for all generations. I enjoyed the movie with little girls and we were talking about Nancy after coming out of the theater. The film has fewer problems for the family and I do not think the parents will get bored sitting in the theater. No, it will not win the Oscars and it will not show exceptional special effects or even show an awesome mystery, but it made me happy and it was true to the book's soul. I would definitely suggest this movie to a young girl (she would love it!) Or a fan of the book. You do not have to be frustrated.
