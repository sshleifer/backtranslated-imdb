As most people did not already have a shocking aspect of the dentist case, this small movie will make sure you paranoid patients squirm. A successful dental hygienist visits his wife in the pool (all day on the eve of their anniversary!) And throws big time into a great anger. After closing the dog's head, he wanders in the work and then plans to do what the wife should do about her "whore" till the end of her marital aggression. There are also bigger shots of mouth-jabing, tongue-cutting and beauty queens, as well as the extraordinary performance of Corbin Bersen. It is difficult to see if he strongly relies with his wife and gives gas to his wife before shouting his teeth tightly. A dentist clearly defines the wrong kind of person and the film to get out of the extreme depth. "Dentist" is incredibly entertaining, fast-developing, and poor at humorous times. Look at it!
