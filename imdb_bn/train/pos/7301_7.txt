When I got rid of the "Hummerhead" from the DVD and finally found it in my local DVD store, I think, "Well, just another cheap giant movie in the picture." Those people around Boise Davidson and AV Larner are inexpensive but very entertaining B - taking pictures in the last few months but some frustrating movies. So I did not expect much, especially after a rather frustrating "shark zone" a few days ago. But "Hammerhead" turned out to be a wonderful resurgence of giant movies of the 1950s. We have a crazy scientist, a group of people in dangerous situations, distressed women and virgins, people eat plants and of course animals, there is a huge mutant mixture between a man and a hammer shark. Everything you need for an entertaining giant movie. The missing thing is graphic sexual scenes and nudity that you expect in such movies, but since the film was made for TV, understand why these scenes are missing. And since it's "Hammerhead" is not functioning since its functionality and its terrible entertainment. There are two reasons why I have kept it seven in ten points: First of all, the giant is not seen often and the vacuum is very fast and badly done with the destruction of organisms and secondly, the right man for the "For the hero" of William Forces "hero" and fall in love with the fantastic Hunter Tylo Not for Other than that, I can highly recommend this movie for any giant movie fan there. Take yourself a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. Jasper P. Morgan
