This movie can be a suspicious descendant because it was made for TV, but it was one of the best movies I've seen. The film and its actors won various awards. It's gripping, interesting, and it will completely absorb you. Ironically, it will be a fantastic story by a Russian assassin's story, who are interested in risking their careers to try to save lives of future victims - but this is apparently a fact. I highly recommend it.
