A warm, sensitive movie that has a fantasy-like quality. <br /> <br /> Ellen Berlin is always pretty fantastic. <br /> <br /> Samantha Mathis has given a lot of great performance, but it's okay to lose some of your memory. <br /> <br /> Most of all, you've seen these amazing 5 years. Old, Jodle Ferrand. I was so quiet in his presence, I had to buy a movie so that I could see him again. He is a miracle of God's creation. <br /> <br /> Judging by the high IMDB ratings, I'm the only one that was gentle by the only actress.
