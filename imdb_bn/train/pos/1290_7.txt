Yes, I have to remember this one! I've actually seen it many years. The story was completely real, but still great! Those who remember the ratings and review reviews should remember what the target movie is. This is similar to "First Kid", which follows a similar pattern. Some movies - like this here - just look at the general and ridiculous ambiguity. Such movies can not be rated from a hypercritical critique perspective. Of course, these films lack quality, lack a sophisticated story, often lacking first-class performance, but if they meet their initial premises - all right. I'm not on the list of the best choices at the moment, but I was still funny, had some enjoyable sequences and made a good story. Brian Bonsall is a smart actor anyway.
