I only recently saw it but I was aware of it for several years and was always stimulated by its title. It's now one of my favorite movies. Discovery of Messel is difficult to describe, but everything works fine. This is a number of memorable images and moments where you feel you are feeling very immune to the personal world. I fell in love with this letter and the characters in it. It seems that the filmmakers have thrown a spell of the audience and brought us into the strange world of true elite families, malicious adults. This is a real environment and I have found myself wishing that I can stay away from here, cook my corn on the table in my bed. It has an air of peace throughout life. This is a fall to greatness for once esteemed family. Money has gone but their air and graces, as well as their beauty remains. It attracted me from the first frame and after the end of the film, I was surprised by the fate. I think I can still hear Old Eddie's voice on the walk while walking along the East Hampton Beach, and see Sinha, danced in the window behind the light eddy blue blur. Unforgettable.
