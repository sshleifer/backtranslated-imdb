I have to agree with most of the other posts. Was it a comedy? A drama? To me it takes a little bit towards the comedy side. I could be a great movie without comedy and it was terrificly concreved. Jamie keeps running in Julio and what is her name In New York, you know how many people in the downtown Cleveland can find and how to dig the Yankee stadium to hide Robert Patroly gold. Again, a comedy drama? But it was particularly entertaining on Sunday morning. I've enjoyed Kimberly Elise's performance, she must have taken a beautiful actress and her joke seriously. She is going to be effective that is a small actress.
