This makes an amazing film, 1950's appearance neatly stylish. Kim Novak is impressive and compulsory as a modern day witch with Manhattan's legs and modernity. All the supporter's performance is extraordinary, as Jack McMenan is his boring nick, Arne Kovacs is a magician who works in Maghatta, a little battered with Elsa Lancaster, and Nikki as the author of Wicked Annie Quinnie as a Zodiac Writer in Mexico. And then there's a cat - I have no idea how many documents (beside me) have given the name of a cat's pieetet but indicating a Jillian. James Stewart came out of the place, but his character is just like the pattern, magic and witchcraft in this strange sub-world. Perfect. And this is the perfect romantic happy ending, which we believe because these alcoholic movies are the happy ending. After the African Queen Rose and Charlie Allanut, Jillian and Shape are certainly likely to be happy. (Another great movie)
