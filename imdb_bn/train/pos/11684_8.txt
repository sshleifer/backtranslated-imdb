After killing the audience directly with three very different episodes, the series continues to be about the fourth generation of the largest peasants in the series, and the audience is very curious about the presentation of 'The Twilight Zone'. 'The Solan-Millimeter Shrine', one of the more different episodes, is that the failure of old age film stars to cope with changed times and unable to present a supernatural piece in the last minute. Due to this approach, this episode is initially under Veliming, but the next scene shows that it is a perfectly classy and beautifully written short story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main issue of this episode is the 25-year-old actress's incredible footage incredible. When young tricks are playing while playing Trent in the Middle East, lupinos look similar, and as a result the tragedy of the situation is significantly reduced. Thankfully, his socks work because of our firm beliefs about his disappointment to return to the late lupineo past. This is a situation that can be most sympathetic, even though Trent is far away from a sympathetic character. He is a prima-donna who does not care about the feelings of people around him, such as the devastatingly dry co-star, who has been foolishly stupid because of how he remembered his glorious days earlier. However, a little surprising, then he is rewarded with a happy ending. We look at the huge projection screen which is going to be clear and it gets pre-cleared in an early moment when Trent is scared of his maid going out of the screen. What is not clear at the beginning, whether the projector is being sued, it will prove to be a reward or a rigorous lesson to appreciate what we have and how we live. As it turns out, Trent has allowed him to return to the past, a rule of how deliberate thinking might be strong for humans. <br /> <br /> 'Six-millimeter discipline' is better with everyone. . Top genres create and play a small game of huge forces by combining pure and creative acting that reflects people for a long period of time, although we can never return. Except Twillight Zone.
