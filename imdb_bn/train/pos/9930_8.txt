I am mostly surprised at the comments in this forum, and many reviews. I think Tony Scott made a good movie here. Yes, it is highly stylized, flashing and top, but it is very entertaining. I'm at least agreeing with Abert and Roper :) :) <br /> <br /> This movie may not be for anyone, but if you like top-of-the-top, dark humor, great action and dialogue, you should See. <br /> <br /> I saw Scott's Man on Fire, Crimson Tide and the State of Demi - all the good movies, but I like it more. It's a roller-coaster ride that is great soundtrack selections, visual styles, and when all movies seem to be pg13, it's nice to see that no one is afraid to show nudity, minor violence and clear dialogs. <br /> <br /> It's too hot, and even this breast does not even show ...
