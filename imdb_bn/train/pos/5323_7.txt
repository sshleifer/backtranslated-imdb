There are many things that are not right, even though it is not very important anymore since the debate is going on. When I started playing Bruno Cosmicer's Kaiserkelare, I think that most intelligent freedom, when they played Indra and later went to Kaiserkelare. <br /> <br /> I agree with Semipineni 20 that the film was biased in the version of Pet Best, but if she is a story consultant, I think she calls the shots. I agree with the seminar that the recording of Pitt Best was the last word about why he was fired. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not a great product as the next picture "Backbeat", I like this picture because it's a good script with a more accurate, and deeper character. <br /> <br /> This film is full enough - such as Brian Epstein, trying to hide this issue, he has "queer-bashed", only the band knew that he was gay all along. Just like a band, going to a caf√© and ordering "Karna-Flex Mix Milk". In my favorite scene, which is actually some basics, in an Audition in Stuart Sutcliffe, it only bought his lightning guitar, but it can not play, so he is standing beside his back and trying to fix it, but caught up. That rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br /> Good observer value.
