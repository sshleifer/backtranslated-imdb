This is a very fantastic short film by David Lynch and says that David Lynch is probably enough for many people. This is your usual lint brief. A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room. The blonde is crying, the brunette is speaking threateningly to blonde, and it's about her. <br /> <br /> With many silent moments, but there is a strange form of mystery about hunting music from Angelo Badulanti. This brief is called 'Mohahlund Dr.' Looks like this, I like the movie, and so I like it too. This is probably especially for Lynch fans but you have a chance to like it.
