I saw two movies on weekends, one was "black" and another "walk". Both movies are made in "Bollywood" but they are different from the world. The fundamental difference is the story and the director. Vipul Shaw has made its unique symbol, "Best", one of the comedy Hindi films. Tareque casting is perfect. Apparently the story taken from Gujarati play is fantastic, with some exception the treatment is great. When Bollywood director is kept in Bollywood together for the first time, a Bollywood director signed a music director for the first time and this guy (in this case the middle owner) was forced to make six songs to meet his contract. So a good director, like Vipul Shah, has to use these feelings not to get enough of this feeling of the financer and grandmother. A music director can definitely clearly brandish good songs in this movie. There is no song lyrics and they explicitly infiltrate the description of the story without the background of the background and the western version of India-Natyam. Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have played the role of duality and role in father and son. His stunt scene is definitely outstanding. A good director surrounds himself with good actors and is willing to wait until a good story like this super movie is coming. Then we have a cheap classless fools producer like Hakh Khan, who will push a trash like "black" to embarrass the industry for at least the bottom and plug them down and they will surround themselves with range talent and they will restore the sound Invest before it gets The victims of the official audiences for the "Film Faces" award for Bollywood Teams, who prey on Bollywood pilgrims, and most of them are in the media.
