I do not want to spend long here rambling about plots here - you saw the trailer, and you do not find it online. Although I do not recommend to see it - it was created weakly and did not pack any laugh or magic from the film. So those who are avoiding this image have to give it a chance because of their shy trailer. It's really fun. I was blown away by cleverness and fundamentalism in this movie. In the first 40 minutes I was on the floor in a violent way - my only problem was that it was unexpectedly developed unnecessarily in the last 20's Austin Powers film. However, one of the few movies where the campeen end does not dislike me the rest of the pictures (which is usually the case). Everyone gives a great performance (especially the young man Cusack) and there are some really great moments in the whole. I personally plan to meet it again - when I was going to be smiling at the first sight only to catch all the details!
