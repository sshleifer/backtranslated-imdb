Excellent slow camera - a remarkable film associated with the drama that makes it a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma is a super-hitchcock-emotation (its name is "Riff") and the 2.35: 1 Widescreen video camera must be fully appreciated, which is lost on formatted-for-TV tape). <br /> <br /> At the bottom of the movie, there are at least any moral criteria, this is the general laziness of all the characters, including the police acting by a pre-NYWD Dennis Franz (here's the hair!). <br /> <br /> Even after the release of the release scene, after 25 years, Angie Dickinson's fairly long shower scene has been threatened. This movie has a number of erotic scenes like Dickinson (if it really turns out) and Nancy Allen is not shy to show her body. <br /> <br /> There is not much dialogue in the first 20 minutes and there is no bad language until after the Franz assassination. Although it is definitely the first 36 minutes to slay and killer, it is still very nice to see all the way through mysteries and fun, fun, especially for men fisting of nude women.
