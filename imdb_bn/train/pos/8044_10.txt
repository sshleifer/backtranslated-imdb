First of all, I sometimes saw this funny movie. It includes full-time snapstick, sex humor, and a cleverly-worried stand-up. But it goes deeper than that. The opposite of Souler is a real love story (some that we do not often see) which gives me hope that there is love; Two people who love each other can work through danger; And such a humorous life (some I believe all of us should have) can be acceptable by acceptable people. Chris Melney has given such strong performance as Barry Singer that he won an Oscar. The image was brilliant and I hope we will see more movies from all of the future involved.
