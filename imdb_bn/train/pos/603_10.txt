The music of Albany's music has spread into this picture. Once and when it plays with original materials (eg piano, but never full orchestra), it is often reworked with various contemporary ensembles (eg guitar) and treatment (eg jazz piano). Sometimes the music is the only focus of the film: the music is mostly dancing, often in Flamenco but not always. I guess that's 12? There are 14 scenes, which are not united by a plot. All views will not reach the height for a separate viewer. Nearly half of my case reached the final, although the rest were very fine on their own path. The people who worked for me brought me the fun and fun of meat; Actually, the final scene is crying to me. And in some very magical way it brings you deep into Spanish culture. If you do not like subtitles, do not worry. The film is virtually unclear, though each scene carries an albanyese piece title. Seeing this very beautiful movie, my complaint is intensified that a solar film is not available in the United States DVD. I'm particularly concerned about the Flamenco version of "Carmen", but there is not a great work in Europe that is available here (European DVDs will not play in American DVD players). This is a scandal.
