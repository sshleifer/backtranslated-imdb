I do not know ... maybe it's just because it's some Muslim religious action (Hajj) is an impressive tribute, but I felt that this movie is so low. I can not believe that this movie was voted by 223 people, which was created in 2004 and still won many awards. About the movie ... Because it was sitting for a well-played sweet beach, a French teenager asked Reda to take her mother-in-law to take her to Mecca. It seems that (if anyone does not know much about Islam) parents want that boy run them from their home in France at a religious pilgrimage from Saudia Arabia. Generation gap between father and son is simple terms ('you know how to read and write, but you do not know anything about life,' unnamed father to his son) but some types of bromidic generation can avoid gap literature. Their frustration in them is loving. Dad never speaks French, although Rida understands Arabic but can answer in French. Although they face many people on the street: "On the way to Belgrade, they are the scary elderly woman, and Taktiv Mustafa (Jackie Nareshiasian), who can help them on the border of Turkey, the shameful women wearing barkas on the way to Damascus" focus always on isolated father and son Remains. There is no conversation in the film which makes your eyes enjoyable. Check out the amazing scenes from the cities you are going to. The director shows you even the blue mosque and Hogia Sofia, even if the film is not long. <br /> <br /> I usually do not like movies which are not enough conversations and take them to the camera subtleties but this was really great. Some improper details (such as Reda's invisible French girlfriend) film senses senses. Remember the great work of the industry and this movie Ismael Ferroukhi's debut
