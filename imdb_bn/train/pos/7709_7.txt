I know that I should like this picture, and I work mostly in part, but as the others mentioned, it's a little long tooth. I found raging hormones of all male crews to be very annoying. It's a wonderful event that they do not scream even on the moon. I have to say overall, movies leave me cold. It is a very ruthless atmosphere that carries the film. Plus side effects are great (except cartoon monster), such as impact, props, costume and of course Robi. If this robot is not in this movie then I do not think it was popular. The second end of the movie "Steam" picked steam after starting the forgotten gadgets. Every time I've seen this movie, Crawl is still gripping me on my head, just what they were or what they were. In addition to "Island Earth", based on the production at that time, the fadide Planet time is miles more than the average of si-fi movies. The color is being added to its joy. Of course his own rights, errors and all, and deserve a classic.
