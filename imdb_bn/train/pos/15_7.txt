I think if there is a movie magic, I do not have to be fluid or solitary. It can avoid background information, may go very fast in some places, very slow in others, etc. Magic in this movie: Library view. There is a lot of minor errors in Stanley and Iris, but they are not frustrated by the overall positive impact of helping each other in a way that they feel completely unconscious, it is difficult to solve. Both characters are smart. Still Stanley does not understand enough to work because he can not read; He could not read because his childhood was very brave. Iris, though well-educated, did not have enough courage and could not understand how to move before he could take his life away. Both their faults and strength appreciate the characters, each other. It may be an extended part in whether Iris will work for a year in a factory or whether Stanley can never utilize his stupidity or any other good salary task. And when this "mystery" is explained in the story, their revelation seems somewhat narrow. I did not take any time to reconsider the script. Even, is it a good movie ?? Imagine that De Niro, Fonda, and Supplier did some work on the screen!
