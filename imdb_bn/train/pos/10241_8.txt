I did not try to take the IMDB rating heart, but when I saw my rating 5.4 rating on my childhood, I became flabberburst. It does not love me much at the age of 17, but as a family movie it is a sweet and well meaningful movie. The kids will certainly like it and do not remember the flaws, and adults can guess the actors behind each character and send the movie the supernatural message. No film was circulated in any way, it is actually a sweet message that is associated with its sweetness. Although I am on the thin side of the story, and some scenes like Screw's death (which still mislead me) may look horrible. But animations are excellent with nice colors and good character animation. James Horner's music is very beautiful, and the featured song is memorable, interesting and engaging. I really liked the characters, Louie probably had all their depths, but the dinosaurs were at least compelling. Martin Short's comedy was both ridiculous and brilliant, when he told the screws, "I'm gone!" I was sewing Although my favorite screws, is an effective villain who is tricky and I feel intelligent. Anyway, however, I should keep the film about the film losing its eyes and fearing why it is afraid of the crosses, because that can be better if it comes in terms of depth. The script, though Oscar is not worthy, has fun and heart-warming parts, and should entertain kids and adults. Activated voice cinema has made me. John Goodman, Martin Short, Riya Perlman, Felicity Kendall and Yardley Smith gave a strong demonstration to everyone, but the special mention would be to Kenneth Mars because he is Squay and almost unknown. All in all, this is a good movie. I do not get ratings, honestly I do not. Of course this movie is not perfect and it is not as good as dinosaur film that lands in the past, but it is a great fun. 7.5 / 10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
