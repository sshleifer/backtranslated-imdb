All dogs go to heaven I've never seen one of the best movies When I first saw it 3 When I was 12 years old and rented it, it reminded me of things and it brought many memories, who were "days". I like the song, love Charlie when coming to heaven, I love the song "Let me be amazed" How do I look at Charlie and love her voice, Bart Reynolds can only play this wonderful Charlie's voice? I love this movie, the first one is the best because it is really original and cool. It can not really describe anyone who can bring memories back, even me too. If I could return that day I love the characters. If I come back to memories at the age of 12, I think how I will feel at the age of 19, I hope I will be able to see it when I am old. When I first saw it, I never knew that I want to see it again and feel that way, hopefully it will be available to watch. I am very happy that this movie was made and amazing ideas came to mind and heart. Scale to 1-10 I would like to give it a perfect 10. It's an amazing movie. It is very difficult to explain feelings when I grow up and have my children, I hope they can feel this feeling.
