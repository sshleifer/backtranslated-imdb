I believe Sarfina Huipi Goldberg's attempt to make an effort. Besides that, there is no star in the film and its role is smaller than the title character Sarafina. Since I work with urban children in a high school, I think it is an important film to show the history of apartheid nation South Africa. Sarafina is a film about education and teacher relationship with her student Sarfin. I have purchased a video in VideoVorest. I saw it and quickly progressed through musical numbers. But I firmly recommend the film to the understanding of teachers and their students. Now when I do not know other actors and actors in the film, I guess they are very popular in South Africa and I am glad they excluded Goldberg from small lands and portrayed South Africa's cast and crew. If people can see this movie than to reach Hippi appeal worldwide.
