We often talk about movie landmarks - why, The Godfather, A Boat de Soufel. One movie but "serious" films are often ignored by critics. I'm talking about the Classic Doc Savage (MOB) <br /> <br /> This picture is not only exciting, but it is important to investigate the exploitation of developing countries by US imperialism seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although annoying, this movie will be able to find - it will return ten times your search efforts.
