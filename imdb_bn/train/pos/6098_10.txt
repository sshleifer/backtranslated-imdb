This is a terrific movie-based TV show which gets it right. There was no connection to the 13th series on Friday. Poltergeist legacy: I'm not so sure. It can rarely be connected to movies. It looks like they have thrown a famous title in a show so that fans can see it. <br /> <br /> It shows Freddie Burning by the parents of Eldie Street (I believe in the first episode) and the amount of parenting was depressing. She hoped to be more parents, with all the children targeted at the first 3 films. But oh well <br /> <br /> Originally describing for the show Freddy He sometimes sees the action of people in the real world involved. As other stories look like cryptic tales, there is a supernatural or wonderful ending point. <br /> <br /> There is a lack of acting but do not believe: Violence is sometimes more than a movie. This event lasted several seasons and was created during the fourth movie. I heard it was rejected by the protesting parent. I saw a lot of rated stuff as a kid, so his shame was for every parent and mother to destroy it. After the series there were 4 more movies, so it was not a total loss.
