I think this movie was much better than giving credit to most film critics. Although its plot is a confusing part, it does not interfere with the understanding of your film. It is said, if you are not open for more liberal political ideas, then perhaps it is not a movie for you. I thought all the actors in the film were outstanding. Each character had their funny moments and the whole audience of the Tribeca Film Festival audience smile. I thought the cat was a tad at the top of a particular area, but deliberately it was done. Although John Cusack is set in the future, it really lets you see the current.
