I can not remember the name of this show. I used to see it at the age of 8. I think it's late when I do not think I can see this show. It was the best show for me. From what I think it is, it's still great. It shows Lucas Black star as I was the first boy I ever had a crush. I am from the country, so there is no appeal to me for a pronounced boys, but for that I must exception. That's why you see Crazy in the album, watch Friday Night Lights and Tokyo Drift on Friday. She is a great actor and she has been from a kid. I wish to miss this show and come back. Please email me anytime someone looks like they are selling the season. kywildflower16@hotmail.com
