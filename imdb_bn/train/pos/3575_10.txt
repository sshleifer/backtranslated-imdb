Both Robert Duval and Glenn closed their role with this credibility, I only started crying. Glenn Chloe's role as Ruth, she wanted to deal with the situation, but she was under her husband's supremacy. Robert Duval's character Joe said, "Let him think about what he needs to do." This story portrays a rural family as "The Stone Boy" related to the accidental death of a son by his brother, which means he was so confused and frustrated by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then when Jason Press's character Arnold, it was a stranger who was released to all, I broke up so much for him that I really thought of doing some terrible things in my life. I identify with the personal and his character. The role of Frederick Forrests and Gail Yongs, added more to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's protester, the female brother Andy, who quarreled, who tried to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Yong, acted like an ornament, who apologized to her own problems and blamed her for her pain. I really can not feel sorry for these two. Although Lou tried to marry her together, she failed. Both do not effectively deal with their problem. They did not really do anything for the film and were completely ridiculous. The small role played by the grandfather of Velfed Brimmie was the only character he had shown to Anar√°n. I felt his role should elaborate. What the players felt was enough and enough. However, I really loved so end, I actually cried tears of laughter and joy. I felt well. Hilmaran was again a family. I actually wanted to be a part of this family. They were so realistic.
