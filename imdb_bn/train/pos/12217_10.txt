As a 2005 Fantasia Festival kickoff, I went to see Ashur. Man, that was a cool kick off. The director was supposed to be Montreal for the Canadian Premier, but due to health, he is still in Japan ... O Lord, I hope he will become better and make lots of other films. <br /> <br /> It's easy, but a bit real ... Ghosts are roaming in Ido in Japan and the Swords are killing them by the name "Damon Wardenes" and fearing the resurrection of Ashura, who is asleep and fantastically very kinky ass. <br /> <br /> It brings us to Aujoomo ... What kind of a noble sword is the name "Daemon Slayer" and his friend Zaku, which is usually violent jealous ass ... <br /> <br /> Looks boring? <br /> <br /> Ezumu retired from the time of killing Rahul, because he "pretended" a goat that he was the giant, he never knew, but He killed him. So Izumo went with his life and recycled himself Kabuki theater. A beautiful night in a boat joyride, Izumo spotted a girl hidden on a bridge and turned it into his life and donated the demons ... because good reason, love ... and fear ... the guy knows how to manage a sword and a Entertain genocide genocide. <br /> <br /> While carrying the film until playing the Aizoomoom ... he is the total package ... He knows how to fight (hell knows he knows), he is wicked, he is cute and he has that tights. You will never have to scream: "No Aujoomro, it is a trump." The person already knows that he has a general idea. She is really the perfect hero. <br /> <br /> As far as cinematography goes, the esthetics are quite interesting. It is far away, Munger has the highest number of movies. It is special effect and nothing is creamed full, all costs will prevent this movie to look realistic ... It's quite amazing. Many colors are other than a "unreal" photography ... it is quite straightforward ... but I said, the main character is carrying the movie, it must be seen, a story with a commendable hand
