All films made before 1912 really need to see a sense of time and space. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Lumia's family man [father: Antonio (1840-1911), son: August and Louis] owned and operated a factory that built photographic plates and paper. Not a small initiative; The factory had more than 200 employees who got pension and social security benefits - for that time innovation. It is located in Montpelasier in the Lyon suburbs of France. What was the reason for being interested in Louis Lumiare's cinematograph in 1849, was open for speculation. My advice was to provide catalysts for the appearance of the ketotoscope (pip-show machine) of the Edison Institute in Paris at the fall of 1849. <br /> <br /> Dixon of Edison's staff, in February 1832, discovered a patented photo camera camera. It was electrically operated (using power from heavy storage batteries.) This large device held a lens in about 40 frames-per-second (FPS) of celluloid film strip (newly developed Eastman Company). It appeared as "unpredictable object" in "Black Maria" (originally in the first movie studio). Kinetoscope machines showed staged presentations (this was featured in the studio. <br /> <br /> In 1894, Louis Lumiai applied himself to the discovery of a moving photo camera, and decided that even 16 fps of celluloid film, the human eye / brain firmness -Vision allows for normal motion sensitivity, its camera dubbed cinematography, it is The big shoes were in the box size and it provided a separate movie magazine supply storage for a considerable film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> May be transferred (if enough sunlight is available.) In the spring of 1895, Louis filmed: some cavities by rice men Health; Burning a house burnt by firearms and the entry into the water; And a number of other scenes in and around Leon. Using a multimedia bulb, he turned the camera into a projector and presented his film to the scientists gathered in the reception room of Resu Generals Des Science. The picture is displayed on a screen five meters away from the lens. The screen was expanded into a door between two rooms. In the same year, at a meeting of professional photographer, Louis photographed the upcoming delegation and showed the motion of their arrival in the evening. <br /> <br /> Scientific and photography decided to remain Louis with respect to both the community. At the end of the year, his discovery is a public exhibition. Since every film of her will be one minute long, she needs at least one dozen films to make a good presentation. For one of these films, he set up a camera at the entrance of his factory, while taking pictures of workers during the holidays. <br /> <br /> The public venue chosen by Antony - who was himself "Fairground Barker" for "Filmography - Golden Salon of the Grand Caf√© in Paris at Boulevard des Capusin, on 28 December, 1895 it was a winter night on the night of 1895. The first audience sat Sitting on the outside of the Lumiare factory, the scene is visible in the outside world (close door.) Some people are angry Lumiere photographs slide show that they are going to see routine, but the camera / projector crank was turned on and the movement started.Lu was an inborn sense of motion for taking motion picture.The film has a start, a middle and a last. And people start to leave their workplace; In the meanwhile, people flutter - many of the cameras and cameraman sub Try to wait before redial, because they seem happy to leave behind them a day of labor. In the end, the plant is shut the door. <br /> <br /> This is the first film and the general public for entertainment.
