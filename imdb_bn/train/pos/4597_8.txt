After winning fame with the first drunk master, Jackie Chan entered the spotlight once more with Project A of 1983, which is a huge pirate Flick, which re-establishes him as the main star. Two years later, the police story was released, the extraordinary propaganda surrounding Jackie reached his genes, and came to see the crowd of stunned stunts, brutal war scenes and suspicious comedy of this crowd. It breaks records of countless box-office records and increases the police recruitment by 50%, but, for 20 years, is it any good? <br /> <br /> Police Story is standing as a Action movie for now. There are several awesome battle scenes, some stuntwork that reminds Chan's hero Bastar Keaton the best and is an attractive one for the most violent climatic tissues. Jackie's performance is also very strong, and in the work-comedy comedy, it often reduces the effect of the movie, its charisma. In addition, in presenting our hero as a border path psychopath, whose helplessness puts others in danger, Jackie has taken a significant gambling ... though no one remembers the incident! The film's transparency was disrespectful by praising the police story as a simple 'Good vs. Evil' battle critic, and when it portrays uncertainty, it was rarely for Brother Karmazov, but the film represented a significant and commendable transition of the conventional ideas. In short, this is a quality "Popcorn" movie * (although you can empty your stomach but submit or submit glass showcases in the final scene of the film against many villains) - this is a strong, enthusiastic entertainment movie. Which is the place with the best of its time.
