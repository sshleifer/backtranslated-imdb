Instead of panic scarcely before 'Texas Chess genocide,' 'Suspure,' and 'Halloween' films, there was a less violent era between a Gothic and Style. Films like Hammer Horror Series and 'Rosemary's Baby' were in the early 60's and early 70's, what a terrific and thrilling audience. I can not tell you how many times this movie rental during this childhood, but I did it because there was something about it. I did not want to limit myself to the slashes and zombies of the 70s and 80s, and famous movies like the famous movie, but sadly the long-term Amicus film company started well. <br /> <br /> Professional: A grand, eerie music score. Rigid performance from a stall cast. Brilliant cinematography. Lots of old fashion threads and cold, especially the first and the last vignettes. Some hunting moments and images At a slow pace, but suspended motion. The house is a distraught, tortuous house. Great production design and set decoration, which give a real old gothic horror feeling to the film. It relies more on the mood and bloodless coolness than the cows and unwanted nudity for the thrill. <br /> <br /> Cons: Half of the problem in the first half. As well as 'The Clock', the rest of the stories seem to have already been done. Clich√©s Gallery The second story, 'Wexworks' has good acting and its moments, but in the case of fear and mystery, there are four weakest. The low budget actually shows occasionally. Final Thinking: After seeing this picture for the first time for many years, I see why I rented it so frequently. This is not a great composition in any way, but it is a good example of an example when it was created with horror film genre and class. See with lights off this. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5
