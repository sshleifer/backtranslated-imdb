Seven young people went to the forest to search for a bell. They were all crazy and seriously killed a Vietnam Vietnamese. "Trumpa Infernal" is a fantastic entertaining Mexican slash, which reminds me a lot about "Zero Boys". There are some good death scenes, such as slushing or neck abdominal slashing or ax. Unfortunately, there is not much grouse here, so fans of the Grand-GaiaGol will be disappointed. See this annoying look if you are a fan of Slasher movies .Exexican awesome flicks are quite vague (I only saw "Alucarda" and "Panic"), so this might be another reason to see this lovely slasher. My rating: 10 out of 7 Highly recommended.
