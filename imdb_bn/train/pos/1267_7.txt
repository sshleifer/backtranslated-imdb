Just because a strong but decent film is strong performance and some creative (though highly anticipated) texts held together. Shan Connery is a death penalty convict who came to save an unexpected innocent young black man (Blair Undead) from the final punishment. In order to properly set up the issues, Connie stepped in to the scene of crime, where she should not only fight with time intervals, but an intermediary Sheriff (Lawrence Fishbourn). Twists and active and role reversals too much - some surprisingly, nothing is - effort to expose the mystery as a growth crusader. The climatic end is a bit ridiculous, but just because the slow night is worth a look.
