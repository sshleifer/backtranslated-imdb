I like this nice composition and, in most cases, I found Mary Poppins (though I love Julie Andrews and Dick Vandieau), to be stupid and devoted-sweet. Angela Lansbury plays her character in perfection and I do not know why people think this movie is distorted. It was magical and it was so much fun to see. Each scene held a certain charm as you got to know the letters better. Despite your age and differences, you see how this little little family together learn how to bond with each other. I think the letters were well developed, especially Charles, who was at "The Is of the Living". Mary Popins may be more popular and cherished by others but this little gem will be one that I will always love and cherish.
