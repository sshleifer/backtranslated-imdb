Mina Kumari has shown many more styles and grace, which you stand standing for in the floor compared to most other films. The director will be able to think that it is possible to have the beauty of the more memorable scenes produced. Music and Dance are the highest possible quality. You can notice in the first dance scene: There is all kinds of things in the background of the director: Another girl danced, drunk stairs down, many activities, but she knew that we would look at Mina dance and I did not notice you until you saw this many times. All, perfection. J Q
