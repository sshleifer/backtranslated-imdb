I thought it was a very funny movie. I like the dog movies and comedy movies so well they were twice as good. K-9, K-911, and K-9 Pi are my favorite movies. Jim Belushi is violent and Jerry Lee is colorful and adorable they make a great team. The only doubt I did not understand is that Dowlio's wife died. Before this movie he died, but how? If they say I missed it. Even so, I give it two thumbs / tails up! Those dogs (Jerry Lee and Zeus) had many training. They were very funny and while talking to him on the dolly, all the emphasis was on Jerry Lee. I liked when Jerry Lee sang and when he blamed the people, the information got a lot of fun.
