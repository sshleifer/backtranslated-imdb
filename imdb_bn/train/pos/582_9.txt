As a habit I like to read the 'Hate It' review of any given movie. Especially one that I would like to comment on. And it's not a point-counterpoint sorta deal; I just want to see what people say on Flipside. <br /> <br /> However, I want to fix one thing. Many people hated it, 'beautiful but shallow,' some even say so far that his brother's disability disability was still impossible, <br /> <br /> I would like to disagree. <br /> <br /> There are similar illnesses like brothers and sisters, I can be related. Every day, you see their own misuse, only their current path will certainly lead to self-destruction. And when they are not specific about what they do; How and why Paul decided to take gambling and associate with suspicious people; It's really how they are wired. On the one hand, they are genuinely gifted and, on the other hand, painful self-destructive (many people like hello hughes?) The same force distinguishes the same forces for them to run and when you see these, you know this, and what's worse, you realize that You can not do a tremendous thing about it. <br /> <br /> The mechanism of the ideal, to run a river through it was probably the way to find an answer that happened tragedy, and who was to blame. In the end, there is no one, and often, why not. But in reality this perception takes a great deal of personal hardships to come. Sometimes it takes a lifetime. And sometimes it does not come at all.
