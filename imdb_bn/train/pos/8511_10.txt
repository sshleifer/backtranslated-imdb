This image repeats the term "spring breakery". The group's fat Hans has demonstrated its talents as Chris Farlele of this generation. Johnny Kansas, "King of $ 1 Bits," shows that he is consistently increasing in the cancers. Kyle's smile is really contagious, and offers a little eye-candy for women as well as for women (like Matt). Dwarfs, while having their moments, Mexican hat dance does not claim it as justice. And last, there's our hero, Ed. He hopes all of us are frustrated, stumbling, abusive, pale people who are still searching for that special person. And hopefully, a small place known as Cabo San Lucas. This blockbuster should be hired only if theater misses it, because we can all be related to this Spring Breakmania.
