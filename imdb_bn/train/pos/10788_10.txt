The big rock candy candy is amazing. When I was young I saw it, and still do this day. (Senior in high school). If I could imagine heaven, it would be like that. I could live in large mountain candy mountain where the plants on the candy grew. Jake Hymn profs, and my best friend. Little rabbit foo foo people It is so unclear and colorful that it dreams about it in the night. Actually, my 18-year-old friend saw it and liked it for the first time. I recommend that all ages will see this movie. I'm having a huge party this weekend with my friends watching this incredible movie. We are going to order pizza and watch Teddy Bears giggle. I am constantly looking at the clouds and wish I could visit that little girl. Thank you. Bye
