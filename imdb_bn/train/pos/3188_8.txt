I just had the worst days of my life. Then I put on this cute movie, saw it, and now I'm ready to go outdoors to kiss the street. <br /> <br /> I must admit, I only saw this for 2 reasons: Verla Ellen's leg. But that's really a lot more. The plot is actually quite cute and creatively woven. This is a Shakespeare comedy with almost all the delusional misunderstandings. And of course ... Vera-Allen's leg. <br /> <br /> The only unfortunate aspect of this movie is that I bought the version ("100 Family Classic" collection collected by Mack Creek Entertainment), and I heard the same about Alpha release. Brightness and contrast are a bit more, so most of the scenes are analyzed, especially when sheep dance to white robes. But I think you can compensate with the control of your TV set. I can imagine how it looked at the big screen on '51. Stage set, dress and color is otherwise superb and delightfully vague - sort of into a "Dr. Calgary Cabinet". <br /> <br /> As far as romance goes, it is perfect. Not sad, not protected, not melodramatic. Just 100% Ahhah Too bad, you poor schmucks, your sad life will not be as charming as this. Rate rate rate Wait, am I laughing? My life sucks just as bad as you. Oh hell Time to see this movie again.
