(Some spoilers) I'm James M. I did not read Keane's novel ('The Postman Always Ring Ring'), where the film was based, so I can not compare the version of this movie, but I have seen and read the 1946 version of the US (Postman owned). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, well, no matter what? The pioneer of neutral movement of filmmaking is a fine part of the film which is the rest of the rest. Why can one surely see ?? Whatever has been done strictly, social and cultural, and a wide sense of personal persecution, hanging heavily on the drama, thereby facing many limits of life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> In Giovanna, he had a way to look, even though he had to move, because Giovanna was forced to pay his elderly man some money to her loveless marriage, her job (working in her husband's trateria , Behind bars and outside the kitchen), and its gender. In the past, there was a limited alternative, and the owner of the restaurant / gas station (played by Juan de Breanda, Juan de Landa), whatever, he decided not to marry him knowing he was happy. He told Gino that he felt ill every time he touched him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gino won the favor of Briangla (promised to fix broken water pumps? ? Which symbolizes life or symbol of its lack) and goes alone with Giovanna. They immediately start a warm, enthusiastic, yet unstable love love. <br /> <br /> Jino feels soon to be stifled by the relationship, and Giovanna suggests that her husband settles when he needs to go again. If you want any part of it, Gino does not leave the city on a train ride, which he can not afford, and a fellow trainer named GP-type Man Spanola paid him a favor. Gino, Spain, represents a type of independence and they become friends (Spangolgo symbolizes the morality and conscience of Gino), working together with carnival and finding out. Eventually, the Gino has permanent employment. For her frustration (she's still not in love with Giovanni), it's been a month since Braganas and her wife went to the Carnival and agreed to go back to home and work with Brega Jino, because she's easy to find. <br /> <br /> Very weak - willing to resist, knowing that he and Giovana will be reunited, agree with Gino and return to stay with the couple. After a while, she demanded her to get rid of her husband. After the bad work has ended, Juvana has become more cold blood than before, it seems that there are very few consciences, even though crime and shame in Gino are crime and shame to hurt a man that never harmed him. As soon as he wants to leave him? She said briefly again, they are now connected internally, and the consequences will be faced. <br /> <br /> I like to return to Gino's life as the judge of the wrongdoing spongeboos character ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is better to focus more on the psychological impact of the crimes on the lovers alone, the lawyers of Ossessione. It gives more force to the final outcome and strengthens the helplessness of society, giving a strong statement that the characters must be born. <br /> <br /> A small stain: The amount of time (rarely) that are filled before the love of filled love ones, how quickly they kill the husband (there is no such effort as the US version); Very fast-growth relationship with guno dancer / hooker ?? They quickly express their love, and he is willing to take a great risk for just one man! ?? The most unrealistic, is not it? I found this time frame problem quite confusing ?? It seems to me that I missed something. Otherwise, the viewers value a good time. Acting and direction were both equally well across the direction. Recommended.
