I enjoyed quite a lot of this movie. I've always been a fan of Hypie Goldberg and this movie only emphasizes it. She has portrayed a housewife in an African-American family, which has enhanced social discipline as an attorney due to the success of her husband (Danny Glover). She is friendly, where all the white surroundings come in, a little weird towards her. The various incidents that took place during the movie, are made for some laughter but appeal to most emotions. This movie is not so comedy as a drama. I give it a strong 8/10. I highly recommend you to catch it on TV or rent early.
