11 years ago when my former College Accounting Professor recommended this to me, I saw this picture almost 11 years ago. I was surprised that a 1968 film could be so coherent and ridiculously describing a computer's crime. Maggie Smith is delightful and Ustinov plays the "Retro Hacker" drama. "And Nolo Mia" !!!!!
