In addition to a very funny movie, I did add the dress and the scenery was nice. This kind of funny, loving woman was a great deal. Unfortunately, he had two greedy daughters, who were concerned about his hand in hand. This husband was lonely after her husband's death. She is going to break that that was proposed to him in a theater. To prevent that, he bought it. His daughters feared that he was throwing "their" money and decided to take action. This photo was also a great plus to the actor's character. I will give almost everything to keep a copy of this movie in my video library, but it has not been released yet. Sad
