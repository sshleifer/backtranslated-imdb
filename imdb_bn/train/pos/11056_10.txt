Following 'The Baron' with Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner, a fantasy series about these three supernatural spies has surpassed 'six million dollar man'. It was my favorite when I was young, and I still enjoy watching it. There was unauthorized on-screen chemistry such as Stewart Damon and William Gant's Craig Steering and Richard Barrett, when the delightful Alexandra Bastdo went on to the path of Sharon McRicher playing the role. The late Antoine Nicolas made the template wonderfully. Tony Williamson, Terry Nation and Best Predictions written by Brian Clemens compared the comparisons of Spooner's own 'The Quotation' to 'The Prisoner'. I'm sorry that the second series was not; The idea was so much left of life. Craig and Richard Cherrun were competing for love? What will happen if you know about the power of chamber champions? Have there any power other than the champions we saw? We found, alas.
