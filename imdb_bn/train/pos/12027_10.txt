I watched it and I like it Melissa plays well in her part. It was actually credible. My brother looked at my sister and when I mentioned that I and my sister I forgot it was based on a real story (I saw it a few years ago). He said, because in his lifetime you feel it true and I was like my sister and I, however, I was surprised that anyone knew that it was a murder or actually who was involved because I wanted to prove it to him. I love life cinema, especially those who teach the truth, or just a better less than that. I thought I saw it almost a week ago but I can not remember the help I would appreciate.
