Booth puts a whole new wrap in your usual J-Hor movie. This movie keeps the protagonist involved in the shoes. The director wants to see what you want to see and think. <br /> <br /> The story tells us about the realization of the work, life, and love of our heroes, and how people around him can understand an old radio station DJ Booth. The film returns to the back of the original character, such as an onion like flashbacks in flashbacks, and we have learned that things do not always seem to be. Most of the film took place in a small, outdated radio station studio with mostly bad history, where the original character was forced to broadcast its talk show because the process of redrawing the radio station was in progress. It comes from a limited location that this movie grows and you feel very clostrophobic and very dangerous. At times our hero can not determine the strange events in the old studio which was caused by some conspiracies by ghosts or colleagues or it was in his mind. What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers show you the face of the main character and paranods like you. This movie is very smart, less than the 76 minute film.
