This movie was very good. If you like to watch a horror movie, I recommend it. The acting was very good, though I thought the actress could feel more passion behind her line in Julie. Alan was very good and I thought cinematography was amazing. I was on the edge of my seat when my friends were shouting very excited. It was a complete success in my opinion and it should be made on big screen. I give it two thumbs up! I want to say clearly that if you have not seen it already, then rent it. If you have seen it and do not like it, then see it again because here are the parts that were completely unreal. I like how the film was played around and on my school campus.
