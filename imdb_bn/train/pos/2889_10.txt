*** It can not be considered to be a spoiler, but I rather be cautious than helpless *** *** When I was young I did not see this movie. For the first time I love seeing this with my three-year-old daughter. I can see it over again. <br /> <br /> Short act starring Elliune Woods for her lifetime, she was a wonderful word for Cinderellar; Very interesting; Very credible. Music really fits perfectly the movie. The acting was great; Love the mouse !! You really love Lady Tremain and step-sisters ";" They were just awful. Cartoonists portrayed the worst behavior. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing movie, especially if you are in love story. My daughter watched movies about 25 times and finally got excited.
