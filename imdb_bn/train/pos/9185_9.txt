Double exposure was a tremendous surprise. It has outstanding acting (especially from the underlying castle), fine films and an intriguing storyline. In other words, it was one of the greatest horrific efforts that emerged in the 1980s. <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing a fashion photographer, who dreams of killing his models, when he reunited with his mentally unstable brother. (Who will be missing a hand and a leg). When the dream of killing model Klan is actually leaning towards death, the photographer begins to doubt his own intro ... but there is more to the picture than the picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image has never been appreciated. Most critics and filmmakers enter into it with Slashar films released at the same time, but it has saddened a lot. It is tricky and unique, which can not say anything comfortably about most of the movies in this genre, but it is passionately created and performed. A type of double exposure is a gem.
