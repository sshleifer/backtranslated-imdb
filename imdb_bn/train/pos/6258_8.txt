They probably could have dropped a bit at the beginning - I'm not sure why this started in the Asian part of Turkey. If they could start from the modern day Lebanon due to the start of the Mediterranean, a camera and crew came to the Bakhtiyar tribe, it was an extraordinary 48-day journey. Nearly 50,000 people, including nearly 250,000 goats, camels, cattle, and horses, make this amazing journey across the Karun River. They use rafts to keep afloat by inflating goat holes - you can see where the head and legs are removed. The other "bank" of the river was very steep - I'm guessing it increases to about 60 degrees. <br /> <br /> It was incredible to see, but there was much more. To get pasture, they had to cross a large mountain that was about 4 feet snow, not more. Being able to climb this mountain was pretty fantastic and itself, but they (and all of the creatures) get this mountain barefoot! Yes, empty birds <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br />, or the incredible challenge that this tribe faces only, but win. This is an incredible document that is known to people to face all kinds of challenges.
