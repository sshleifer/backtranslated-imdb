Paul Werewrov's De Vieed Man (The Fourth Man) is one of the most fascinating thrillers ever seen. It was really a beautiful surprise. The story is concerned about two sex-writers Gerard (Jeroen Crab), because she was involved in the relationship with beautiful hairstylist Kristin (Ren√©e Soundandzec), but there may be something else in Gerard's hideous mind. Werhovan and cineographer John de Bont created beautiful and thick atmosphere full of beautiful and sick sex, it actually dragged you into the story, you do not want to see, but you can not move yourself away. This is by far Verhoeven's best film (probably Robobop II only). Truly the fourth person is not for everyone but sexual scenes are quite vulnerable (just ignore them, but believe me, if you look for at least ten minutes, it will be connected to you. This is a film that you need to know how it ends. To know, Hitachot tradition, it is compulsory, controversial and thrilling, it also likes the spider parakeet. <br /> <br /> 8/10
