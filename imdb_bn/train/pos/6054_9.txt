I saw a preview of Freebird on the Isle of Man TT because I heard about it in some motorcycle mags. Although I was originally racing, Phil was interested in seeing Phil Daniels in the movie, (yes I love everyone else like Quadrophenia) was proven enough to take me away from beer and partying. Finally! We did it! Our British have actually made a great motorcycle movie (and it's not like torque), it's the Sheraton of British comedies. Mark my words, it's the best screen performance of Phil Daniels and as long as Geoff Bell is concerned, a new British legend feels his name. I like Gary Strech on Shane Mounds's fantastic Dead Man shoes and here he gives calmly tender performance, which he can proudly add to his growing film fame. It's not just a bike for us, but I think everybody (even my girlfriend likes it). I hope it will get the same bright response on the mainland like Island of Man. I will not go to the details of some classic scenes of this movie, (watch out for the store), it will ruin the fun, but I would say, watch and enjoy one of the best ways you made a movie at night. I really think this could be a religious classic as well. They're saying TiTi ... Simon Freebird!
