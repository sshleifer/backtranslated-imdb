Wonderful acting, music A simple and clear plot but it kept me captivated and captivated all the way through me. I do not know why it is so fantastic but it was easy. So many letters were so real. It has been removed and I think I want to look better. <br /> <br /> The concept of a school trip as a forum for such amazing plot was like a gifted concept and a lot of people were like people who faced daily by teachers in the classroom. <br /> <br /> The film tackles issues of religion, prejudice, drug friendliness, memories, difficult experiences and simple issues of diversity.
