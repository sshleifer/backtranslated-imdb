Trick or treat is "Message behind music music" bandwiggins, which is a classic example of Hollywood jumping, and Tipper Gour and its Washington Weis kick-started in the mid-80s (other, fewer successful entries are awful black roars and silly gates in this short description). I had a sophomore in high school coming out of trick or treat and could not wait to see it. By the end of the 80's it became invisible from the video store, but finally I picked a valuable copy of a budget, and came back a few days back and brought back many metal memories. In a teenage Metal Nerd, Eddie "Ragman" can be related to Weinbauer's trial of the Weinbauer ("Marks of Family Ties") because preppy "beautiful" people in his high school have oppressed him for his heavy metal fashion and musical taste. Eddie's favorite rock star is Sammy Carr (who watches a lot like Tommy Lee of the MotoCrew), who was killed in a hotel fire at the beginning of the movie. Inconsistent until Sammy's final, album album is tested by Eddie is an outstanding album by a Radio DJ (James Simmons in a short camio). Eddie soon discovered that the LP, when played backwards, let him communicate with Sammy's undesired soul! Eddie is suggesting how to get on with his preppie abusers soon, but when the messages are frustrating ("Waste is all ... no false metal!") Eddie tried to destroy the album, causing Sammy to return. Life through Eddie's Stereo Speaker Eddie went on a high school dance school and agreed to rush into the street, and Eddie broke some unfortunate "false metals" before saving his day and his dream girl. (Not SIGH), it was not terribly scared in 2006, it was not even scary in 1986, but Trick and Trait is a film that will smile face to face with a Metalla of the 1980s and it will have a kick-ass soundtrack courtesy of the Rest Band Fastway Good value to find out if you have ever played your head or have a taste for the B-grade horror movie (or both, like me).
