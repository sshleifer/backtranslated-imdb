I know many people do not like this movie, but I think it's adorable. There's a lot I can not say, but the movie I guess is a well-good movie. The songs are beautiful, the clothes are beautiful, the voices are beautiful, and there are many funny lines in the film, especially about the work of the brigatiera and not the society. If you like musical instruments, I would say you like it!
