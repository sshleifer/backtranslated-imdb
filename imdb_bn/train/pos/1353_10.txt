Cast different and now they have taken a different approach to the road smart party "Networth" vs. The supposed professional team "Magna" but if the boy thinks there will be a problem with the smart smart team, you will be right. During the clash of Magna teams occasionally, the street team has been isolated in the week after week. <br /> <br /> Repeat for the first time "Apprentice 3" Some of the same rude mentality (to trump) and the game of this series: If you are a good project manager, you lose, but the team will bring you back and expel you Even though your backstabing team colleagues often work for half of the jobs. Just unreasonable, any game show that demands the best candidate appointment is actually "weed" is considered to be good, but effective candidates do not interrupt each other and that is the best one. Lol <br /> <br /> Anyone in this season, we have seen roughly curse, backstabing and even gay aggressive stereotypes because the groups are trying to campaign. <br /> <br /> As far as the list of victims is Cast, they are Dowdell, Audrey Evans, Danny Kastner, all three, I think Trump was abducted unfairly, others are really coming because they only suffered conflict, anger and suffering. It is amazing that a candidate, Audrey Young, says how he did a good job and how his teammates in this game are in the game. <br /> <br /> Yes its game, it's "apprentices" where manipulation, backstabing, and always popular "mentality rules" associated with everyone's project manager. <br /> <br /> This was an entertaining journey, although the layout of the candidate's photo shoot has been designed to create a mini golf course to build a new golf. <br /> <br /> Although it is still "beginner", it is largely astonished at hospitality and lucky people of chaos. Is the winner.
