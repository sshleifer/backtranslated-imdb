"Who did this?" There are many sure faughs and gags. This is not one of the best stogyj films with Shame, it is one of the best short comedies produced in Colombia. Director Burns originally wrote scraps for Stuuges in 1946, but when Curley Howard had to face a professional last stroke, it was ready for Shilling and Lane's Columbia Comedy Team (their version was released as "Parade My Terra".) It is probably Stugus Pass Was very good to do, and finally was featured by Stuigis at the end of 1947 Law. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When they reached her house, Goodrich disappeared, and her nephew and mixed thugs tried to get rid of stages. Will they find the goodies and judge the beggars and goons? <br /> <br /> Shem is particularly fun in this picture. After Christine McIntyre's miki, his reaction was fantastic; He is trying to smile his trademark sound (Yeh-e-i-Ibb) and Miss McIntyre! Other Funniest Scenes: Closing the Peacock Mug via Camera Lens; And all cast members involved in dark wars. <br /> <br /> One of the most unusual looking characters in the film Nigbo The Gun (played by Duke York) is one of Stugge's films. With his curly hair, he could almost pass for stews, if he did not have towers on others! "Who did this?" One of the Shame Stages movies is a gem. Even dead-hard curly fans will enjoy this one! A true Stooge classic. 10 out of 9
