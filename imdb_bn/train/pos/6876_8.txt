"The Grove Tube" was originally shown on the video on the first "Video Theater" video in Boston. In one room, small groups in front of the movie had a high-end TV monitor with an old movie theater seat. Pepsi, and York Papermint Patisser's basket were old refrigerators. In a second, a small room, no seats, just a big pillow. That was a 'smoking room', that is, people got high there. This work only adds to the joy of the video. <br /> <br /> I was 'frequent visitors'; I like the scenes and remember this day: Koko the Clown, The Crape Family Kitchen (Crump Easy-Short Shuttoning), Protection Sam / Vdi PSA, through the Chawy Chase Hitahikar w / nude jungle, runs a fungal balloon, finally what a woman nude body Was released. The latest item was late, incredible Ernie Kovacs was very memorable. Now, I lost readers under 48 ("Arini Kovacs ??") but believe me, this is a fun thing. <br /> <br /> For one reason I was a frequent visitor. That I, and my friends, will see it bring another "Grove Tube" virgin. We would sit and look at the faces of 'Kumari' and 'Security Sam' will play PSA. The camera gradually zoomed into "Sam", we were "Oh!" Will wait for The recognition of the 'virgin' face. Each time was more fun than the end. And then that 'virgin' would bring a friend to see the show then, what we did to repeat. To get this trick, you must watch the video. <br /> <br /> Yes, its some dates, but most of the plays, movies, televisions and videos are now available. Just watch a video made in the 1980's. <br /> <br /> I found "The Grueau Tube" in a theater like a video, a charity transfer from the original video. It has been cut, and some of the original high-point scenes are lost. <br /> <br /> The "Saturday Night Live" event with the first Chatter Chase, "Your People" is "Groove Tub", so it was a precursor to shave. <br /> <br /> If I do not hear the voice, Sharon caner I can not look at the "Cruff Easy-Lube Briefing ..." and "Kramp Holiday Cooking" recipe. I always laughed at the grocery store for baking. <br /> <br /> The first part of 70 was helpless; " Groove Tube "fresh, new, and really The time was 'ridiculous.' It was a 'hip generation', comedy that no other format / medium was found. MJH
