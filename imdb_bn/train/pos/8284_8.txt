This is one of the most horrific films that needs praise so that the word 'horror' is more mature. The man does not understand that this story is told by showing the little boy and young children are easily scared. Basically because he does not understand things, why his father has no favor for him. From seeing the film you can show a balance between husband and wife while working in conflict with your wife and you can easily understand it, but the younger boy does not. A boy may also be afraid of timber, since it was established at the beginning of the film, the family came from the city. Also, when the family runs home, they hit a deer, then hold it, then they dispute it with the locals and the little boy must have not been happy with this role of wood. <br /> <br /> "Wendigo" is finally created to explain all this to her young, innocent mind. There are American Indian legends, but seeing the scene where the little boy hears about him, this is explained to him slowly and simply. The reason is not really what's really about, but he understands that way. When you see the movie from this scene, you can really start to appreciate it. It was obviously low budget and shot cheaply, but jumping motions, light use, and more general interest than preparing for it. And the final question is if the film asks: Is this within your head, or is it really out there? <br/> <br /> <br /> Writes: Prejudice, Violence, and Sex Scenes
