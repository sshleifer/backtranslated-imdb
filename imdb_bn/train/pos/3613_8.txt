When "Girlfriends" comes out, reviews are appreciated, but I'm not too close to seeing it. I finally saw it after the video was released, and realized bright reviews. <br /> <br /> The movie is open in a high school in the middle of a veto. We quickly introduced student Diana Guzman (Michelle Rodriguez). She has a bad ass on her face, and Diana's idea that we can come out of this expression is sure to come soon when she comes to the war. Diana gets hurt for this, then we fill her aggressive type with her father, her right hand; Obviously we can not blame Diana for her attitude. <br /> <br /> The film really comes up because the new thought worsens in Diana's mind: Boxing as a way to escape from this deadly existence. His elder brothers have already gotten into boxing, but his father probably will not be allowed. Only Diana could decide what to do. <br /> <br /> In just the first few minutes I realized that I was very scary, non-Hollywood, but the little presence of John Sales actually played a supporting role. Sure that. Even before the scenes of boxing, you feel as if you were confronted by seeing the painful life that Diana has seen. And when they finally arrive at the original story of the movie, then they do not go back. <br /> <br /> I certainly recommend this movie to everyone. I will admit that someone has chosen "Rocky", "Millions Dollar Baby" for several years using boxing as a way to try something, but I still think they have done a great job with it here. In fact, it may be customary at its peak. Really good It is very bad that Michelle Rodriguez has ruined herself in this Hollywood movie.
