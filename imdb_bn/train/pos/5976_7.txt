Trick or Treat, Quikiew Review Around the Junkie Roop 80's Heavy Metal Culture and Awesome Movies - Two things I love. So, you can imagine, this movie appeals to me very easily. Also, due to any apparent reason, Ozzie Osborn plays a preacher. <br /> <br /> This film is about an informal high school youth who, like all of us, "evil" sank into the heavy metal world. Her favorite MetalDude died and, of course, miraculously resurrected - to play back her latest unreleased album. This corpified singer allows people to go around killing people with demons and help sh *. <br /> <br /> Well, it's quite a bit chessy, but you know? It's got a wonderful number of good qualities. Great acting (including Gene Simmons as a radio DJ), excellent special effects, very short nudity, decent atmosphere ... Above all, it's actually a decent horror movie. But what really sucks is music. Modern, huh? Well, this "uber-evil" metal guy is the most eccentric, high-spoken, screaming, the Matley crew rejects the planet - and "metal" is slightly more than 80 pop / hair metal. He hits all the clich√©'s here, from prancing near like a gay fairy, looking for the meaning, "Rock and Roll !!!" King's Diamond Poke is a pitch high enough to make. As well as that brutal musical presentation, it's actually quite good. 7/10 <br /> <br /> www.residentHazard.com
