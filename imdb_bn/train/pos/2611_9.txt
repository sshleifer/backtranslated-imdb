In Australia it is widely seen as one of the universal copper dramas ... and for my money, anywhere. It is raw, great, the characters are real, the circumstances are believable, and it is not ashamed of the dark side of everyday life in their orbits by police and criminals, victims, lawyers and other people. <Br /> <br /> This show ran for 2 seasons and the show was closed because the show did not sell well abroad. We all are sorry for its loss: however, like the Fowlie Tower, we will be able to respect each other as a limited-length series.
