Joe Dawn Baker is a handful of actors who are often better off his material, and almost always under appreciated. He is a heavyweight or heroic film, and Wallace Berry has had a strong, strong presence for half a century before that. Any unemployed content can be provided that is ridiculously coming out of another actor and it's so awesome about him. He really seems to be thinking about what he is saying about Tommy Lee Jones, Oliver Reed and Don Stroud in his league. Watching toll trilogy has done so well, and the same magic is here in the final justice. This was a significant hit in theaters and videos in the 80's and it was much better than most well-known works of the era. By removing actions from Texas to Europe, a real timeless quality that does not remove you from the screen. To be honest, I've always enjoyed Gradeon Clark's film, who was a no-nocesense director in the same vein as Clint Eastwood of 1970, and this is her seratum. The last trial is one of the lost gems at the end of the 80's, its true screams and people like fire in violence. I think if they rebuild it with a rock, then I would love a whole new audience as much as I love.
