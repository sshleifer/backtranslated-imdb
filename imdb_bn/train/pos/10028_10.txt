When I saw this movie, I was surprised that this is a great movie. This is the only movie I think I'll ever give 10 star ratings. I'm sure this movie will always be my top 5. <br /> <br /> acting superb. Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet are their best. I do not think anyone can have a better job than Kate. <br /> <br /> <br /> If rain is on the day and can not decide what to rent, it's just one. You love all acting, special effects, and more. <br /> <br /> If you do not rent or bought this movie !!! You do not regret it. <br /> <br />
