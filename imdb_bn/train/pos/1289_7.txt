First of all movies, an impressive work of art (cinema). The plot was filled with amazement, a small child was worth a million dollars and how he spent. I mean how to hack this out Walt Disney really outdid himself this time. Comedy is expected most of the time but unexpected other time. I was right in this movie or was this movie just right. It teaches a lot about the wise men and I'm really smart about this kid and a little while smart pants. But it sucks. How to hack that a guy like a child could get a hot police babe and let his parents go free to him. The way the killer was freed for ten years. If I could do that, I would be beaten with a 'soft jack' (a huge stick that your butt is really hard to use to bench). That child is really lucky. Return the story. The filmmakers really knew what they were doing while making this film, but it is still not perfect. The acting was good and bad. The father or the child did not have any chemistry, but the bros were excellent. On the other hand, special effects were lam. Plus this movie is not based on reality. I hate and loved it at the same time.
