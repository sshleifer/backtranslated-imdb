This is a complex documentary that shows a lot for the beginning of life. From the point of view it was the term used for the gay revolution, and Gekke as a narrator. Or is it used today? I believe most movies come from 1968 to 1989. It was released in 1993, so it was pretty close. <br /> <br /> I had collected documentaries collected for the love of one person in 20 years of the year. Expressed a love that could only be true love love. There are many scenes of incredible sympathy and pain with joy and pleasure scenes. There are life scenarios as a homosexual sex and life as homosexual. The film itself was a work of love, and I believe it to be diamond. <br /> <br /> At least one person can find this to understand the devastating effects of AIDS from this movie. When I write it down, I wonder how long this set seems to me. The progress of the medical, political, and social science and culture that started from this movie (about 15 years ago) is amazing. However, obviously, in the case of AIDS, we are not done yet. Hack I guess we are not all over the fronts. <br /> <br /> However, it's just a nice darn good documentary. I would encourage someone who thinks they do not fully understand the idea of ​​homosexual life, gay things, or the destruction of AIDS.
