Dana Andrews in the 1950 film where "Sidewall Ends" stands, which also gives the title of Gene Terni, Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Neville Brand. Andrews played New York City Detective SGT Mark Dixon, who is a bad police, who in the past faced the persecution of the suspect in the past. When a person was killed in a gambling club owned by a militant club, Schulz (Merrill), Dixon and his partner went to investigate. Why Snail is guilty of killing Pane (Stevens), who left the club after fighting with the victim, not just his wife, Morgan (Terni). Dixon thinks that the victim won a lot of money and died of the male brain. He goes to see the pine and does not realize that there is a plate on his head from the war, throw him on the floor and kill him unknowingly. Now he must cover the murder. As more complexity, he falls for Morgan; His father (who tully), who went to Pine's apartment, saw Pine hit his daughter, he was arrested for the crime. <br /> <br /> Strange handsome and neglected Andrews is a solid neurotic detective who believes his colleagues will have to step forward one step. The film revives him with his legendary "Laura" castor, Gene Tearney, and looks nice as a bad taste of a man, which is apparently used in a seemingly fashionable fashion. She knows a little, she got another one in her hand. Who does a horrible job as a tulle in his father, who despite some silly proofs his innocence protests Carl Malden is tough as a Dixon boss. <br /> <br /> I am the only problem with this well-known, fast-moving and dry film. By putting pure Hollywood and myself in place of Tearney, I doubt that I will respond the same way. A minor criticism and auto-promotion for a movie written by Ben Hect. I could not find it as scary as "Laura", but some things in this world. If you like silent film, it must be a must see.
