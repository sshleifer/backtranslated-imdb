Here's some bad reviews and I understand why this considers a low-budget serial killer movie and you can get more than this. <br /> <br /> I thought it worked in a way because later I felt dirty and wanted to take a long shower so that there is some degree of success? <br /> <br /> I would say, to get your skin down here is the right level to the right level, though the acting is probably a bit too slight. David Hess is the only one in Brillie, but if you like the Last House you will not get much hope. <br /> <br /> Another look is more than that.
