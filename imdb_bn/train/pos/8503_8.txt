Sherman, Set Wayneback Machine ... 1986. America's worst poster came out of recession when Japan was experiencing an unprecedented storm of industry. The production industry was still a significant part of the US economy and factory workers were a good example of "average American". The word "downsizing" has not entered the general vocabulary yet, but everyone knew the event. Bruce heard the radio singing, "Foreman says that this work is going on, boy, and they're not coming back to your house." Crisler is just hostage by Uncle Sam. "Buy American - The work you save can be your own." <br /> <br /> "Gang Ho" works better than just keeping the mood of American artwork. Other popular movies made in that period. Of course there are flaws in the film - except for Michael Ketan and Zidane Watnabe, some separate plot threads and medium acting work. But the story is about the meeting between East and West. Keton Hunt Stevenson America, Brush and outside are confident outside security. Watanabe's Kazuhiro puts Japan on top of the hip with a successful method, but thinks about whether to learn more from their Western rival. The plot of the film, it is defective, provides a framework only for the conflict, and eventually gives the synthesis of their two personality. <br /> <br /> Keaton's acting is overtaken by everyone, and in reality the film is made by itself. I always praised Keaton that the ability to supply lines of his feelings does not matter if he follows a script. His character, Hunt Stevenson, is a natural leader with a favorite, rich competitor, drawing a wise-ass. But he has done a terrible loss for many of us: He does not want to disappoint anyone. He will mislead the crowd with inspirational narratives, and lie rather than pointing out the ugly truth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, unwilling to be bad news carrier. Stevenson first came to Kazhiro with the accusations of career, with the workplace contradiction perfectly captured by the Japanese system. Kazuhiro replied to Stevenson's complaint "I understand what I'm saying", but will not refuse his request aloud. Stevenson misunderstood this agreement and goes away, "OK, we did that." (This is still a problem of Japanese-American business relations in the 21st century!) <br /> <br /> Finally, Kazhiro and Stevenson have the same problem: the factory works smoothly, fulfills the production goal and fulfills their responsibilities to the workers . To work with this goal, they need to take a page from each other's book. Kazuhiro family is a clear example of becoming more "Americanized". Stuvenson believes that when Kazuhiro was publicly apologizing to his staff for his failure, it explains that it was disrespectful - and after that, Stevenson did the same thing as himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> And its resolution is a little blanket, but hey, it's a comedy. If you can ignore movie flaws here, there is a great story about self-perception and free thinking.
