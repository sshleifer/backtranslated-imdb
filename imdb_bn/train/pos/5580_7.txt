Young Sunder Eva (Hadie Lammer) is married to an old man (feverish disease). Unfortunately he can not satisfy his sexuality and ignore him. Frustrated she plans to go home and get a divorce. Then, one day, she is dipping skinny in a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse closed her clothes ... and she runs after it! He met young and very handsome Adam (Arizbar Mog). They love and want to understand that the person he wants is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This leads to a sad ending. The end of the spinning finish! <br /> <br /> <br /> This horrible man was very bad in 1933 but by today's standards. Lammar's naked swimming does not show anything and when the horse runs perfectly after the nude, it is covered with long long shots or branches. Her breasts have only few minor shots. Also, when she is sex with Mogh, nothing is shown but her face but you see her getting orgasm. These days their views were considered quite extreme and the American release was completely cut. Now they're back again. This image is now easily available with PG-13. <br /> <br /> Shock episodes are all right. It is nicely illustrated and there is no dialogue next. Apart from the music score it can be a silent picture. Thankfully all actors are good - especially Lamarr and Mog and they are very interesting that they just take their breath watching them. Also where the order of love is easily one of the most beautiful shots and acting sequences I have ever seen in a movie. Sex symbolism scenes (there are several of them) Unfortunately today is pretty obvious today. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, I saw the movie moving slowly (beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me), a bit neutral, clear, static and a negative ending. I can live with the end but it does not excuse my other problems with it. The final order is also really weird - and out of place. So I appreciate this picture more than anything else. It works well and I would suggest it but with caution. Many people seem to love this movie so I am a minority. Use your own judgment.
