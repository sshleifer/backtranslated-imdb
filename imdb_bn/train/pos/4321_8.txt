I will put brief brief one of these. I believe that this is an extraordinary movie. I've seen other critics who wrote it badly, shot badly, have a terrible soundtrack and worse, that this is not realistic in the nature of its image. All right, so it may not be quite credible for the full length, but this movie carries a message of hope that something else has not been remembered. Hopefully many people will not be too late to save people from terrible things. Ganguly violence is real, right? It's okay, no! This movie carries an important social message that the seniors may dislike but is appreciated instead of denying it. I have seen this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times, with the same enjoyment every time and every time feeling that it can make the world better and it is not out of storage (well until 2008). For me 10 out of 9. It's almost almost perfect for my view. JMV
