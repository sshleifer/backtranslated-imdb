Adorable! I saw Philly Domestic Fabric in October with my kids. We all like it very much that we have seen it with my parents for the second time. I have not heard them laugh for so many years! Looks like a movie that my parents and my kids can enjoy for the first time. It's really cute and we can not wait to get out of the DVD. They have to do more movies like domestic import. It is refreshing to go to a movie that can enjoy three different generations (and do not feel embarrassed). I did not see this picture since my Big Fat Greek wedding. I love Mandy Sterling as a mother. He was Austin's power. Howard Hessman is also very much and he is very happy. I have to remember him from WKRP.
