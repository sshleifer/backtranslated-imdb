I picked up this picture based on plot summary and critics quotes behind the box. I do not have big movies in foreign movies, and do not have to expect. I really do not care for the subtitles. But I absolutely love! It's a simple, loving quality that makes you feel better about life. I found myself smiling again and again I would recommend this picture to anyone, even those who hate foreign movies with subtitles. This one makes it worth the effort.
