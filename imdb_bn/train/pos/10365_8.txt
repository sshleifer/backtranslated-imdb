This is the real story of an Australian couple, when their children disappeared when they disappeared. Merrill Strip is always excellent, and guides us to maintain interest, though he plays a character that is not particularly likable. <br /> <br /> The media frenzy surrounding the Australian case, Sam Shepherd's memorable homage in Ohio, case 50 These real-life situations show that how a lawsuit suits a criminal case can actually influence. I think the Cleveland plain dealer is running a huge headline "Why jail Sam's Shepherd why not?" The prosecutor finally leaned towards this unconditional pressure, and Shepard was convicted and convicted. He was dropped for several years in prison. <br /> <br /> I like movies that tell a real story, make it an interesting way, and create an important issue in the process. This is one of those movies Other good movies to describe the story of innocent people include "Hurricane", "Thin Blue Line", and "Breaker Mortent". In particular, the following Australian film was highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
