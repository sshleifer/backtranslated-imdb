A boy named High Marty killed. She is harassed, and picked up in high school. A group of kids played different tricks on her, and this trick was really bad. The last lip is sadly ended <br /> <br /> After 5 years. The kids gang met again for a reunion. They set up an old high school. The school is now abandoned, and they have to be broken. For some reason, the janitor is still there, but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him beer. <br /> <br /> They start partitioning, and look at their old lockers, and they see Marty's something. A girl is sorry for Marty, but another person calm her down. <br /> <br /> Once the kill starts, it's very good. Each murder is creative and great. We see an image of a Jassar mask, one of them hunting across the school. It seems that Marty right revenge comes back. After the first person was killed, they found that they were locked in the school. They start to find a way out. <br /> <br /> Now there are numerous extraordinary things in this movie. Above all, I do not know anyone has reconciliation for 5 years. Second, after the first child dies, the girl gets blood on her. They all run away to Pani, but he goes to the bathroom, and gets a bathtub. Well the friend has been killed, and he decided to take a bath! More importantly, why a bathroom in a bathroom has a bathtub. However, the bathtub does not seem to really work .... And he died a horrible death This is an 80's movie. This is a horrible slasher. WHO CARE If there are some irrational parts. I'm not for one. This movie has really great death. Last ... there's a wrapping. Recently I have seen the house tension, I can compare two. The only way they have the same, is a wrapper, no matter what kind of disappointment I have ... then turning right afterwards, if you do not kill the best in the movie then it is better. <br /> <br /> After the last murder, the murderer shows on the screen and some crazy too, and this is a perfect way to finish the film. It's me "wow ..."
