This film is one of the few Indian films that will not fade with the period and can never reduce its spelling, even if Indian films are artificially transformed into ornaments of pop culture, they also accept drill-based additions. Stylized film songs to improve PT <br /> <br /> Cinematography speaks of Joseph Warching's excellent expertise, which greatly enhances the impact of movie epic and movie opportunities. <br /> <br /> Great movie, when each scene is to be clamped many times and it is taken before finalizing, but crafting visible views and performing scenes. Some of these harmful scenes are filled with glorious psychological intensity, such as for instance, when Mina Kumari denies "yes" for the approval of Nikah (marriage bond) and climbs on the hill while driving barracks in the frustrating frenzy. At the moment, Raj Kumar followed her, and a strong melting of wind blown up Kumar's screen and Kumar's feet ....... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The golden words in the history of Indian film history to try to complete this movie in the recording for 12 years. Without a close distance to the minarear, some of the most important songs had to be screenplayed, because the lead actor Meena Kumari was ill at the beginning of 1971 and fought for her life.
