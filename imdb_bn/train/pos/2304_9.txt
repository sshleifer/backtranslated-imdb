I was working very well in this movie. Everything was right for me in the mid-1950's. It was well cast and trustworthy. I usually do not care much about this type of movie because they have no depth, but I feel like filming this movie in characters and you can feel how they feel, you really know them and take care of them. It took me back to my youth and let me make it more memorable about the time of innocence. This movie can be enjoyed by both men and women and all ages. After the film ended I wanted a part two. I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family. This movie is bound to be a classic. If you do not see it, then try to catch it on TV or rent it ...
