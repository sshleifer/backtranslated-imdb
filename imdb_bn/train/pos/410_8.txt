I hired this image in DVD size, I do not know anything about it, a winter marathon part of watching a movie every night. After some of the terrible American action adventure films (Ballistic, Daredevil, Life of Life), Zhu Warriors hit me brighter like the original film. The story is totally meaningless, but I found the film's sincerity, heartache and complete lack of adultery and the film seems spectacular. Of course, special effects are technically not as silly as produced by Hollywood, but filmmakers are wisely more interested in color, writing and movement than the shots and the shots are so exciting. In one shot, two supernatural characters are standing on two rock steep arches, a huge moon is raised in front of them, the image is completely balanced with three elements. On the other hand, a princess-warrior spreads like a heat-detective missile through the sky behind its bright sword. And the color shot is exploded from the shot, instead of representing the reality, it is used to express emotions. <br /> <br /> The characters have the same similarity and comic book characters, which do not give deep depth to themselves, but mention archeology that resonate more deeply. Physically, the actors have a lot of beautiful looks. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
