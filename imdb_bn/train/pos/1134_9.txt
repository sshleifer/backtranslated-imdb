The only part of the lack of this movie is that as a part of the movie, the girl wants to follow her "aunt" footprint as a soap star of the day. Otherwise it would be a perfect 10. Looks like every actor has enjoyed their share and enjoys their part in completing the script, and I'm a little surprised - I am surprised if there is a lot of ad libi. 'Part took place. It was a good cast and you will have some classic lines with it <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary movie that will be viewed at least once. I would recommend not to drink anything out of your nose. <br /> <br /> You must see closely the last scene, 'Nurse Nan' is a bit secret but she did not share. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
