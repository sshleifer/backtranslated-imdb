I'm not a college student and need help and comments from any opinion about mother's theme in mom. If you go through something similar or just want to comment and help me do more research on this movie, then a comment will be widely appreciated. Comments will be used only for examination purposes and will be included in my written exam. So if you have any comments, I'm sure I can use them and you can help me get A! I am studying 'A Boy Me' and 'Tedpole', so if you have seen these movies then I would be grateful if I wanted to comment on this page. Thank you.
