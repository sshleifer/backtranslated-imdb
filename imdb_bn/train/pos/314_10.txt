This show is a great history story. There was everything in the slaves, the way they were treated, religion was hidden in the hiding of the Jews, investigations, belief in African gods in Orissa, and women's beliefs with women. Even homosexuality down. The way the characters intertwined and that Violante way, that character saddens me. He is so frustrated that he destroys all around him. I am very happy that they decided to republish it in Tv. Again Although I would like to see the unedited version Xica has become my heroin. I look at using his power to help those who seek it. I love all the characters and saw that they can now be related to many people in this century. I look forward to my Xica every night It will be great for dubbing in English so Americans can love him too.
