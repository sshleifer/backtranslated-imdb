Like almost everyone commenting on this movie, I can only think why it has never been seen on the video. <br /> <br /> I thought I saw it at the age of 12 in "The Late Show" in 1972. I feel very poisonous gas attacks and weird horse horses. (I do not remember the more horrible bits described here; they were probably cut for TV viewers.) But in reality the scenes I really liked were those associated with Lord Kinchener's death near HMS Hampshire. 90 years ago The scenes of the devastating cruiser near the mine excavator in the storm was really memorable, as I think. <br /> <br /> Do not miss the musical score, but the comments of others are now looking strange to me. Find one of these videos!
