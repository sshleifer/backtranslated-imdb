This movie was excellent. It gives details of the collision between the intelligence group organized in the 80's against the ignorance committed by Russia's contaminated communist regime. I give this movie a high mark for any hands-on cast of birth and development of the community isolated (thanks to the "regime" community). This is a graphic movie. It represents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it remains tragic. There is nothing like "candy coat" with too much blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen. This movie is based on the Russian serial killer Andr√© Chicatilo. They are quite familiar with the real story, so deep understanding of how real they keep the film. This is not a comedy, but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor, this film must be seen.
