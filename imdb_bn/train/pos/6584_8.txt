Doyle Holls did not want to revive Professor Marriat with the joint death of his last death. However, due to financial considerations, he (1901) was prepared to write the house of Bishchervillas, which is still considered his best hometown and perhaps his best novel. But it was a "monumental" great detective written before his death. In the opening ceremony of the Impi House in 1905, he was more wounded than the general public to resurrect Holls. <br /> <br /> It is not that the new short story (and the last novel) is really bad. Maybe three stories are really terrible, but even terrible ones are too readable. The next few (like the solitical cyclist) are really good. But production disparity (especially after the story of his last story (1917)) became increasingly apparent. He repeats the story line, and he looks at Holmes really negative direction. The advent of three domes Homes in the story shows a cruel mockery of a character from Africa's ancestors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, little secret detective in the story An interesting example of how to build a highly readable story with the least intrigues in Dublin to do. Holbrook is hired to try to negotiate the purchase of a letter to Milterton, but it does not matter to get them back! Milworton is not only reluctant to consider a small amount of papers, but be prepared to protect yourself from Homes. Later, we know that Holes got a maid in romance in the house of Milton's disguise. Finally, go with Stevens Wilson to steal Millerton's house. He and Watson are at home when they find that Milwerton is waiting for some new business dealings in his study (including anyone who can use Milwortown). Consciously hiding, Holles and Watson look as a woman who has been subjected to temporary losses with Milwattern's past activities, and blackmailers are shot due to death. Before Holmes escaped, Homes and Watson were able to set up Milburnton's compromise for the collection of documents, and later discovered the identity of the woman. The police did not discover that two mysterious men were running from the house of Milworton and they were so disgusted by the activities of Milverton (they were never able to bring a house against him) It is clear that the murder will never be resolved. <br /> <br /> The story is not impressive in real-life involvement involving Spellled Band or Silver Blazers. This is a mood and a story of a late move - Will Holes and Watson get the papers on this or will they get Milworton? This is not one of the best stories, but most of the story looks really good and interesting. <br /> <br /> When he wrote Charles Augustus Millerton, his experience with Conan Doyle was a highly respected amateur detective / crusader who sometimes deals with his actions about the police. An artist was killed in his studio in London, and he started writing his opinion on the killings in Canaan. Then he turned off - apparently alerted by the Scotland Yard to his friends that watching the murder barely warned. The victim was a homosexual, and the police were sure that it was a terrible mistake in the spot of a lover. On behalf of Victim's family (in 1905) it rejected his interest in the case. So he was aware that sometimes British police behaved with restraint in matters that did not consider their entire investigation justified - like the restraint of Lestrade against the gentleman who killed the parable, Milestrove. <br /> <br /> It can be called the normal hour long series of series. But Master Blackmailer's telepillas have spent some time scary conflicts of Victorian (Victorian / Edwinian England). We see a promising young elite army officer who faces homosexuality exposure due to the great demands of Milterton, all at the beginning of the telepath. And it's not just gay. Men and women can memorize unlawful children or the underlying relationship of the past to achieve the hefajtian marriage. In fact, in the story, the woman who killed Millartan is destroying her husband (a prominent nobleman) by the blackmailer. <br /> <br /> Milwenten played his best actress Robert Hardy with his most toxic beauty, who, despite being unexpectedly unexpectedly injured, is completely helpless, out of his house at one moment). Brett and Hardwick are doing very well in their Holes and Watson's role, as expected. <br /> <br /> How serious was the loss of character by rumors or exploration in 1905? Sir Hector McDonald was the leader of the last victorious group in the Battle of Omdurman in 1898 to destroy one of the heroes of various empires and destroy the great army. In 1903, he was the governor of Sillen when he suddenly stepped down unexpectedly. Sir Hector returned to London and was waiting for some hearing. Later it came out that "Fighting Mac", often considered Britain's most popular army commander, was caught in sleep arrangements with native boys. Milverwater could feed him very quickly ... or his real life opponent.
