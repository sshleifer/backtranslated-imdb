Dad's family got new jobs, when a small family comes, everything is strange in Subbia. But no Paradise will be complete without its snake. Spontaneous joins the local country club as the husband, because it must be secretive. Parents are not a warrior, but there is pressure to join him, since no one is in the neighborhood and at work. Robert Irike's good man's part is slightly mild, but Joan Cassidy turns nasty seizels into a good housewife. Suspenseful and disciplined Chiller with a wicked Susan Lucci as the chair of the club. Look for civilized favorite Michael Berryman in a little part as a valet. The film contains panooya and is waiting to finalize special effects. I have seen this movie several times.
