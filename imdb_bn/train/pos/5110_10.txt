At about 11 years of age, I found out that I lived 0.48 miles from my uncle's house. Uncle home westway dr, diamond park, TX After filming, they added to the house. I do not know the house number but you can go see it. I am 21 years old and I enjoy watching this movie. Spencer bars do not have them anymore. Passdan ISD wants to create their school. The house passed by the house last week looks great still. My parents and uncle will go to the street where the house and the actors who are trying to make films will come home. People crossed 225 higher crossing railway crosses. When I heard John send his son off, that day he started thinking that he was the youngest cowboy at the age of 26 or 25.
