Holes, novel, I was forced into the education course. I do not think I want a child novel; Plus, other books I forced to read for class were really bad. However, my surprise, I absolutely loved the hole. It's really one of the most thoroughly written novels I've read. I think it has rare quality in it which appeals to pre-teens, teenagers and adults. Anyone read it, I think, a good person will walk away. Although I do not say much for the film, I'm happy to say that they got most of the rights. I do not think the viewers of this movie will walk as rich, but they will certainly be sitting, when they sit down, they will be frustrated. This is an intelligent story, and it is said very well. I think it moved a tad very quickly. Novel letter takes more time to develop. And flashbacks come so fast that they do not have much time to register. Feel more clich√©s and tricks than previous romance novels. And the end, which seems to be very ridiculous, all loose threads together. It's the same in the novel, but there is a strange idea that does not quite exist in the film. It works very well. I do not like the pop music crowd. I do not think such a need to sell Disney Soundtracks. Cast boasts excellent boards, young kids old professors. John Voight is especially great. Why do we need catwoman and trap, why are not quite sure. 9/10
