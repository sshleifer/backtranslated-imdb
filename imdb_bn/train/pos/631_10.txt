This movie should have a fabulous film, romance, cute wit, great acting and magic dosage. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed this movie perfectly and based on its original plot (based on the blue gaiman novels I want to read now) and painted in colorful characters. <br /> <br /> <br /> My most interesting thing was how it actually contained the story. Like many sci-fan fantasy movies now leave open ends and thus it was a perfect fairy-tale, it was satisfied with itself without any need of a sequel. <br /> <br /> original. Fun Feeling good fantasy
