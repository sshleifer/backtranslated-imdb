When I left, I missed this movie and thank you for last week's recommendation. I can honestly say that I can not remember another intimate drama film, which works very well. The text is crisp, realistic, different, and even moderated. Cinematography and editing diminish, but enlighten the stories of inscribed, visible stories, through incredible close-ups and framing of images, to achieve loneliness and isolation in the most memorable way. Acting is also surprising, because all the characters are painful and weakening in the most compelling way of providing a movie. They express their inner weakness with helpless, weak weaknesses. Roger Michael and Hanif Qureshi, and a real win for the rest of the team. A serious film will look for lovers.
