If you move fast through the terrible singer, you will find a classic fairy tale below. The role of Christopher Walken is very funny and amazing. Acting works well for Sly Puss in his trademark style boots. Other actors are good for their part. I did not find any horrible fake or strange acting. Although the King appears in a real dunce especially, and I wonder if he is supposed to be. I can not remember the original story. Special effects are more than eighty, but at least the fraud is not fake like some computers we see today. Overall, I recommend this film to children and adults who are children in their hearts.
