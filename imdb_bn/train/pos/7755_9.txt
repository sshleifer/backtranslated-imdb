"Lined on the Wind" is a continuous, wonderful, strange film, because the director could have done it. The image was sinking in full bucket of Freudian symbol, strange melodramatic and colorful contrasts. Connection between financial success and moral decay is the main theme of the film. SAARC thinks that sexual issues are one of the side effects of capitalism. However, I like to watch the movie as a prime example of what I can do with the pesticide material in Sin. Color palettes are particularly impressive. The film is very great acting. Rock Hudson and Lorraine Buckle were very shocked and kept the film in good humor, but the film was Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone (he won the best acting actress Oscars), who kept the film towards warmth. Frank Skinner's Pulse Score, the bright camera work of Russell Meteye (each single shot itself is a great composition) and consistent with the production design department. Also, the title tunes are a beauty. This is an unforgettable movie.
