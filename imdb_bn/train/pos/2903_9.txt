Tiempo de Valientes is a very funny action comedy. After his great fist cinema El Fondo del Mar and Los Simuladores in the spectacular TV Pro Gram, Damian Szifron did another great job. Tiempo de Valientes, for a moment, a movie made in Hollywood, shows Diego Pertie and Lewis Look two wonderful actors and here's their wonderful performance here. The movie is very funny and fun and it's a great moment. Tempo de Valentes is a very funny action comedy which I want to make you cool at the time and I have to congratulate Szifron for all its talent. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 9
