We should have more movies about our local Americans. I especially think that using actual real Americans will be the right thing. I know that Archie Bellaney, who played by Pierce Brosnan, did a great job in portraying this character, because he was an Englishman. But my advice to Hollywood, to play the role of more American Indians and not to use anyone else. The Sioux race has been long on the back burner. Their poverty is an insult to our country. It is my firm belief that the black beaches of our country will be returned to Sioux. We ask Israel to return their land to the Arabs, but we should not be doing any effort to do it, we should be ashamed of ourselves. We must practice what we preach!
