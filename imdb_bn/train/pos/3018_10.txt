This movie is an exception that is a series worse than the original. Her best of her comedy. This movie seems to be a quick step slapstick comedy where something happened every second. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, this is a Swedish film for Swedish viewers, in the decades of reality production TV series, such as a parody in the survivor (Expeditin: Swedish Robinson). If you are not familiar with Sweden and its language, you will not see it. Otherwise: have fun! Johann
