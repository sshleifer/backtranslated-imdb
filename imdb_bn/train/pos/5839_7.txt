Prior to going to Fox in the 20th century, the last of the films (I believe) was created with Hello Roach, this was the last really funny movie, which disrespected their talent. Even with a weak moment - the business with "lung tester" is, in some cases, ahahahahah ... (but precious, just to see "Dr." Jimmy Finson) - but bringing a full screen on the screen of Flickr is a good summary. Richard Crumar (unexpected) appeared at other L & H Flicks, and he is happily threatening as the missing Nick Granger. The boys will have to eat their own synthetic food where the scene ("Looks good, gets good smell, and probably likes it." Eat it.) A moment of my favorite moment. Stan and Olly will always be happy companions in the lives of millions of fans.
