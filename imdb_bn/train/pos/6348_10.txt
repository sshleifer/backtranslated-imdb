While Jim Carey is normal as well, and there are several "Jim Carberry Moments", it is certainly not "Jim Carberry Movie". <br /> <br /> This is the main target of most children and I have enjoyed it such as movies. It was promoted as another Gym Carr film, so those who had a strange expectation about the top comedy were disappointed. <br /> <br /> This movie has excellent moments and works well as a movie for kids. I can not say I love this movie, but then again I am not his target audience!
