I saw this movie at the Montreal International Film Festival of 1980 (this is the English title "Who is singing there?"). It then won raves ... and invisible. A terrible shame. It's brilliant. Glory, ridiculous, sad, and extremely fun. The script is a work of art. It's been 19 years and I've only seen a handful of comedies (or any other series that matches its roots).
