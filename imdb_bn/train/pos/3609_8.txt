Wal-Mart went and found this movie on DVD and I do not know whether I made a bad purchase or a good one. This is my next result to see the last movie from the beginning. Michelle Rodriguez, (Diana Gujm√°n), "Bloodline", "05 ", gave a great performance and her realistic research in the art of how beautiful her looks are, sexy, and simultaneously acting. Diana did not like her home life, and especially her father did not like to abuse her own father. She decides to get a local Brooklyn gym boxing training and is not really taken well by male boxing. Her high school has lots of friction in her female classmates and boys. Boys have a lot of lesbian bathrooms and references as private bathrooms. If you like boxing, and watch a hot sexy girl, do not be surprising in the ring and boys know what you do them, do it, it knock the film for you.
