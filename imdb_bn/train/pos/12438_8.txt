There was a long awaited waiting for the film, which was a bit disappointing for the expectation. I'll say it's quite OK while watching it again. First of all, it is not true (true) of original history and it is made to keep the movie right. Humor history is shown as children and the main truth is very true. The acting is probably not the best, and the plot is a bit thin, but when you compare it to 1966, the odd movie is even better because it is not trying to be a musical. Generally I would recommend it to supporters of Modie Blige or catch it on TV.
