Not everyone has ever released this film and who has never heard of it and shot very little in the short time with the company and the organization, but everyone becomes surprisingly great. Many of these 50 small movies have happened, which many have never heard of. Some of the '50's worthless precious to have some really unknown great little jewels. "Panic in the Streets" is another movie that springs to the mind. Both films which do not like the normal series Flickr from their time and are also made up of limited organizations. <br /> <br /> I was so surprised to love this movie. It really got a movie which improved it as well and got better. It starts at a slow pace like all the 'old' movies, but once you read in the story and its characters are the real treatments for this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a great story that involves the spy, although the movie is not that started. It starts film-shooting as a common crime-thriller. But the "South Street pickup" is not really a movie, so it soon started taking its own directions. This ensures that the movie is a wonderful reminder but refreshing it all over it too. <br /> <br /> I also liked the characters in this movie. None of them are really good guys and they all have their flaws and weaknesses. Really human This is particularly a great performance of Thelma Ritter, for which Oscar nomination is eligible. It really has been the biggest female role I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It's just a great, original, special small movie, even with a little less budget. <br /> <br />
