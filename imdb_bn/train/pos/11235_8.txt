Performed nicely, and with a "new journey" it's a great continuation! Check out "Fagil" for the recent episode James Cowley! <br /> <br /> I like the increasing characterization, and think there are good replacements for fan-produced pieces for our TV actors. This shows the show pretty well, as they say in the story, it has been enhanced with experience over the years and I hope with some experience, a powerful script editor and a pick-up in Timing and CGI will be HF <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > I said, "Lawer Lawer" is a little tired. Shellby is great (if he's taller) and he gets cooler than the ship gets. Commodore Ian is just like Fantastic (Fred Flinton), but there is a lack of commanding officer's great edge and it seems like Doc, Counselor and Rollins are my money, such as Wonderful Nechayev (which is a beautiful accent - a real Russian! (Well, I guess that Rain retired from the Czech Republic.) <br /> <br /> This is my vote, and CGI Kvalle. Some green screen is clear, but a small budget <br /> <br /> I'm really happy <br /> <br /> (OK, acting is not something cool, but it's made and so can be variables - sorry CMM Coal) <br /> < The gay element is too thick (Graham Norton will be embarrassed) Trek hetro do not give so much attention to couples so why not signify the GAYS with all snogging? No one wants to show sex to this extent - I hope they pull it down and Esther And Jane Tokay I do not behave differently with my gay friends, they are just regular people. <br /> <br /> Musically it's a mixed bag. I can call her all stock track OS stuff and work most of the time, but the time is now May be flat and then (reducing the end of "Worst Fears Part 2" and ending the edit. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Borderless
