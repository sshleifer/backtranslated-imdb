From the point of view of Agent Stewart through flashbacks, the FBI's history is related to the story of his personal life. Stuart and Miles (as his wife) are quite good, such as Hamilton as a sincere agent. The problem is that episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's an odd bit to see the bits and pieces of different movies, such as we can throw gangsters. Some episodes are too long, some are too small, and some are out of place (Stewart's girl's school order). Overall, it goes a very long way. Nevertheless, it is worth a look for its handsome production value.
