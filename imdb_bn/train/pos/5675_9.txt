Blackdaughter 3 is probably the BlackDader series that people have heard at least - this is basically the same principle as the second and fourth, and there is nothing revolutionary in it. But it's still awesome - Wellington's a burning Duke and a fat fool John Johnson (author of the first English dictionary) enables one to count the series. This series has more ridiculous one-fishing equipment, and historically accurate and enjoyable episodes - it brings humor in a less familiar era. The third edge of Blackdaughter is not the most famous and well-known, but Rotten Atkinson's role as a Butler in an intelligent princess is a fun and functionally accomplished, and the best variation in the series of Hugh Laurie. very good! 9/10
