It's a good family show with a great cast of actors. This is a nice break from the late reality show Blitz. There is nothing else on television yet, unless you think the Archdiocese's young man is similar because it also has a teenage character. However, the clienthouse is considered to be a perspective, because the original character of Jeremy's (Pitt Young) is an analogy and dinner that is appealing without excessive sweets and bunny. Dean Kain, Christopher Lloyd, Murray Winninger and Kirsten Storme have been members of the main cast members, and each one is very good in their roles. I really like Carsten Storm as Peter's sister Betsy; She is quite a pill, but she still hates showing it, though her mother and brother care about. It really can take a few episodes to find her legs, but the Cloughhouse can easily be one of the best shows that can come for a long time, so check out the people - you'll be happy!
