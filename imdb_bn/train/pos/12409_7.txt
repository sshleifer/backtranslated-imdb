The prison is often not raised during conversation about the best eight movies, and this is a good reason for it because it is not the best ... but if you step away from the past of the classic classics of the decade, it is certainly the best of the less known / short films. There are some links to pictures blockbusters; Initially it is an initial director effort for Renee Harlin; Die Hard 2, Clifhanger and Deep Blue Sage, capable of behind several action films; And secondly we have a primary role for the Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not original, but the plot line is interesting. We focus on a prison to be restarted after a few years. After being formed by Karl's governor in this prison, a person named Charles Force was sent to the electrical chair. Naturally, the soul of the dead person is not to rest in peace; And when the old execution room is re-opened, the soul of the corpse escapes for vengeance. <br /> <br /> This picture is not a freedom fighter, but it takes care of developing different characters and the main point of the film is always awful, it makes behind the prison drama for an interesting base. This is also a good thing, because in addition to the original foundation, there is no 'plot' in the film and we only rely on mutual communication between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror displayed in the film is sometimes fantastic, but it's never at the top, it's really because this movie is rarely remembered, being released in a decade more. Kill yourself rather good and fantastic, however, and provide some major highlights. The film continues, we start to tell more about the story behind the revenge cast of ghosts, and it is fairly funny, but does not understand anything about it and it puts the film a bit down. Yet, everything flew up to an exciting climax, and overall I would have to say that the prison is a movie's valuable tracking.
