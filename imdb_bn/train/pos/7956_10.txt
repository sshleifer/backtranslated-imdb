It's just a classic movie where people's voices are coming from animals, they really are their thoughts. I do not know if my video copy is missing a scene, but dogs never show how they came out of the pole. It also shows an animal survival instinct and power tracking. In the same location, people will be able to take out the helicopters. For the first time, a remake has been improved for a movie that has moved the voice over. Only the use of animals can work in such a film because the story should be torched by killing people, proving that animals are more attractive than animals
