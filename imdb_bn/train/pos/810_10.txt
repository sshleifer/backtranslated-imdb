This is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. <br /> <br /> The first aspect of the movie was almost like the quart of the episode - Specie cabaret music and the idea of ​​a cabet place, where the seriousness of Jabbar Haat was becoming more serious. He instructed to die in a basement straw by the crushing tooth of Bannah bone, who looked like a cross between a beer and a shark. Luke's Zaid's power finally ended the monster. Adding the shiny rescue of Han Solo, who was frozen at the end of Episode V, Jabba was very angry about that Luke was punished with death in a simple cage. <br /> <br /> But all Star Wars "good boys", especially R2-D2, had other ideas ... and other ideas that executed Luke's execution; In the end, most of Jabba's soldiers died, and Princess Lia Jabbar was able to use force to fierce. <br /> <br /> Like the episode 4, Death Star made his appearance in episode 6. I analyzed the rebel fighter aircraft attacking empire fighters around David Star, I thought, the use of the main laser surgery, as a diversion of a royal fighters. The 20-25 Star destroyer was ready to attack but they were called and instead the Death Star's laser weapon was astonished. Once the firing took place, the rebel boat's only hope was that the death of the Death Star was being dismissed, and Lado was so impressed that he wanted to destroy the Death Star, but he could not do it till the slope was removed. And it came out with London's increasing obscurity. Like episode V, Imperial Wakara has created their psychological look with Twin Canon, at least killed Ewoos ... but the Eaux ancient found is still an unusual way to deal with them. For example, one of the Chubkacha and other Yokak Walkers was able to enable the commander (and used to actually destroy the Walkers behind) and used logs to find out the other two other ekos. <Br /> <br /> It is nice to do what it can do with the lights of the light Saber, for example, the end of the scene where the luke reflects incoming laser shots from a storm trupper spider bicycle, and used to destroy Saber. Bicycle part Or, in a climax, Saber uses Saber to break his own father's hand during the final Sabe War. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Know the fireworks display, the trick of victory (for example, the Storm Trupper Mask), and Luke finally meets Leyer after Luke's own Names - Darth Vader, now dead, is burnt to a peer . The celebration includes singing Ewoks but I think Lucas does not buy it - even with the film's composer John Williams's strong respect. <br /> <br /> In the home movie version, I think Lucas wanted himself a different end. In addition to Andor's celebration, he wanted scenes of celebrating some surviving rebel planets, including a festive laser shot that destroyed the statue of Sith. The evekos song is replaced by an alternative piece of machine. Perhaps he wanted to prove to the extra staff that the balance with the destruction of the Death Star was restored to rebel galaxies.
