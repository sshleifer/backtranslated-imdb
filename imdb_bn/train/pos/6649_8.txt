Was it easy for Sir Richard Attenborough to make Gandhi (1982)? He described the story of a great personality traveling on this planet so long ago. Comparatively, director Firoz Abbas Khan had made it difficult for his first expedition as a filmmaker who was both historically practical and maliciously father and son to prevent an anti-hero hero against an international film for his debut as a filmmaker. Films are mostly practical. In Mahatma Gandhi's film, he showed the moral values ​​that follow the world. Yet these values ​​printed the desire of her eldest son, Harilal, to fulfill her education and to get a job in India and to become an honorable lawyer like her father in order to pay for her nuclear family. <br /> <br /> Gandhi does not ruin Gandhi and his ideals. For Gandhi, his mission was bigger than his family's ambitions. He loved his family and took care of them, even though his thoughts were blurred by his ideals of caring for the people. He stood for equality and dignified position among all and went on the basis of what he had been preaching by showing other qualified people specially to give opportunity to his son to be unreasonable. Does the film show an unusual case of parenting ?? Where an idealistic guardian is the place to withdraw goldpost for a lesser-prolific descendant. <br /> <br /> The image represents an unusual scenario that happened. A boy falls in love with his father, makes his father's heart sad. The father deviates from his son's educational ambition with a number of important rituals. As a devotee breaks the fragile link between the son and the father, the son wants to stand his own feet and take care of his atomic family. The father gradually becomes the father of a nation, the boy falls in search of courage and courage to live. Her marriage breaks and seeks comfort for religion, she wanders between Islam and Hinduism. Through all his hardship, his mother will have his link until he rides to get drunk. <br /> <br /> Firoz Khan is basically the director of plays. He wrote and operated Mahatma Vs. Gandhi's drama, which had a significant impact on the Indian theater community. The play and the mature film are based on two biographies, one by Chandulal Dalal and one of the Nilamben pakkas, the success of the film was a clear reason for commercial film actor Anil Kapoor to produce this notable film. Every time a good director of the plays tries to direct the film, there is evidence of lack of confidence in the middle. Peter Brook is a great director of the theater, but less efficient as a film director. Khan's opening shot promises a great movie? Harilal Gandhi was bombed (popular name in Mumbai), Bombay (popular name in Mumbai), Bombay (Science Hospital), Science Hospital, which is the father of the whole nation. Hospital authorities do not die from Mahatma Gandhi's eldest son, poverty and loneliness. Alongside the opening of the drama, the film unfortunately represents only a great story and some fantastic exterior shots of the father and son of worship in Silhouette. For the Indian film it represents some high production qualities, which are in the hands of lack of interest for detailed information (most Indian films are dust-free and freshly used in London, actors modern hairstyles, and even Shapali Shetty). A century ago Mahudeo Gandhi's wife broke the eyebrow), Ben in Indian cinema. Since Firoz Khan's theater personality, he has invested more efforts to work with actors rather than developing the characters instead of the details of the film; some are Sir Attenborough, who like a theater's theater (Dramatic Arts). In any way, it was very well known for criticizing Gandhi that even after facing any direct criticism in the film, producer Anil Kapoor made a remarkable decision about not setting up a film poster. The height of accessibility in India, fears that someone may sever the poster or deliberately or unreasonably disrespect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is saving father or son bonded to mother and son? Is one person less important than the larger humanity of the immediate family? Does anyone want shelter in religion and alcohol when facing the world's troubles? In this film, Harilal was attacked from one religion to another religion, when his father was beaten by the South African police believed in religious values ​​and thrown to the ground "they do not know what they do" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A sensitive issue is managed very well by the fans of Firoz Khan and Anil Kapoor. Performed and performed higher performance. I hope the international success of the film creates a way for some active directors to portray Tughlaq with other international cricket for one day with international standards.
