Because of being a fan of the first Leon King, I was definitely looking at this film, but I knew that it was not as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are aware of direct-to-video video, because I also have mixed feelings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw Lion King 1 ½, I tried to understand my own thing. The aspect was about this movie. Am I going to be so scared about Lion King that I will persecute in some scenes, or am I going to accept this movie as another form of lion King story? Most of the time, I feel embraced after myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> Timon and Pumba steal a show at the first movie and guarantees a centralized film around them. People just love these characters! In my favorite parts of the movie, the theme of Tiemann and Pumba is taking care of young soldiers and there is a wonderful ending of some extraordinary teenagers. <br /> <br /> I could have done many jokes in bathrooms, though the reason for knocking on baby symbha at the beginning of the original King of Lion King 1. I think this kind of joke is for a small set (all of which are considered target audiences.) I do not think many kids are concerned about Disney's profit margin directly - to-video movies.) <br /> <br /> However, I would say that I can see this movie directly from the original movie I was a bit annoyed when the bound. I was very familiar with the original that the scenes stuck like sore thumbs just to me. It may be somewhat different with music or voices that it will confuse me. <br /> <br /> This was not too bad for the song, but do not expect to come out of this movie any classic. At least LK2 had excellent ballad, "Love will find a way out." For the voicework, it was well done in this movie. Nathan Lane and Arnie Sabella have always done a great job, and even new cast members, classic comedians, Jerry Steller and Julie Cavner (also known as Merge Simpson), did a great job. You can enjoy these great voice counterparts even more by checking the virtual safari on DVD Disk 2. This feature is really fun !! <br /> <br /> So everyone, Lion King 1 ½ is not a perfect movie, but it's nice and entertaining. I think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for it - a fun, light-hearted look of Lion King Masterpiece from the point of view of our funny friends. <br /> <br /> My IMDb rating: 7/10. My yahoo! Grade: B (good)
