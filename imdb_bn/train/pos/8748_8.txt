I think this movie wants to tell us at the end of the movie! Or Australian Australian? I still do not know, but what I know is that I really liked this movie but it can not be my favorite movie! <br /> <br /> Great story with great actors but terrible end ... cry and say, 'Oh, that's good' ... Yet who did it? What was actually happening? That guy There is no answer to these questions ... <br /> <br /> Mysterious movie with a mysterious picture ... I'm going to give it 8/8 8.5!
