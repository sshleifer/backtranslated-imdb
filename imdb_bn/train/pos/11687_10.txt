My love for Chris Rock is different from his movies, I hate him after Leethal Arms 4, but after that I hate everyone in that movie. I like him when he is himself and does not return to Dogma. Well it's still her best, it was not expected to be good. My ass has been opened for the whole time. Chris Rock delivers a wonderful wonderful story supported by the most funny comedy seen in quite a few days. Love it
