I saw this movie at the age of 13. It gave me away and in many cases it still has. But I tend to see it as an accurate historical piece nowadays. There are precious little efforts to test and interact with racism - and thus fail to acknowledge that it is the most powerful anti-war weapon that is understood in the main part of those who perform it. Instead, what we get is a diabetic - on the one hand, bio and wood in the 3D panoramic sunny aspect - on the other hand, two dimensional characters are depicted as unreasonable untimely evil. <br /> <br /> It makes everything great. Movie story, but it worries me that people see the picture as 'right'.
