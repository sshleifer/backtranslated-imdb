I just need to throw my two cents. Cool, it's a comedy. Yes most part characters are widely written and played. I can not remember where not many comedies. This is not a new release, it runs in the air on video and cable almost every week. Will I see in a theater? Sure, I, when it came first. It's funny ... that should be enough. <br /> <br /> Even if I do not like it, I still want to see it on the cable for Michael Katon. She is an underrated and under-actor. I can not think of anything that is so capable in every way. I can not even think of someone who can not succeed. An actor who is an action star (short life span but still), who is a romantic lead, who is a dramatic actor; A villain and a hero. I can not remember anyone, not least in Hollywood. Of course none of those who have succeeded in all these styles. I mean, Tom Cruise, but to me he is better than Tom Cruise than the character. But it's Michael Keaton vs. Not about Tom Cruise. So I'll go ahead. <br /> <br /> "Goog Ho is worth renting, you can probably find it at $ 10.00 or less. Walmart. It is valuable to watch the cable (if you have a cable or satellite). It's one of those fun to see the movie. You can pause your brain, and just relax and chocolate away. <br /> <br /> I want to know more, in my honest opinion, a lot more is being asked.
