OK - I accept. I think Keny Datty looks amazing in this movie - but outside her good looks, the film is sometimes expected, but managed by a reasonable plot. <br /> <br /> Starting, we have three limited female films. A prime minister - is very concerned about his picture and is not married. A police officer - to go with the child and a bad ex. Third - Recognition and a power and status hungry Doctor on the eve of the three former. <br /> <br /> They are almost "First Wives Club", and indeed there are some verbal strife related to the former "He left the credit card" behavior. Character set - The movie continues. <br /> <br /> McDowell's character, Prime Minister, a funeral is delayed - where a young man meets the regular player (Dootie) with his eyes. Will his two friends talk about the upcoming miscreants? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All is a great movie which stands between the current choice of action, special effects and schlock awful.
