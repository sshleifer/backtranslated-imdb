A very good adaptation of Amitia Pritam's novel. Urmila and Manoj Bajpaye performed their best. <br /> <br /> There is a natural mood in the film and I felt it. Finally, its glamor has been released like Bollywood and some of the artists are acting on the screen. <br /> <br /> According to the content, the film expresses regret for a particular family and portrays many of what happened during the fate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
