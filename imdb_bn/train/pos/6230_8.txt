1936 was the most profitable year for Astaire and Rogers. The third movie of this collection for their second film for that year? Follow Mark Sandwich's 'Fleet.' At this time Astaire Pain is painful, uncomfortable like unemployed, which is a beach on vacation, which falls in the Sherry Waterfront cafe, where Sherly Martin (Rogers) blends romantic sweet notices in everyone's ears. Yes, you guess it ?? They are again warm for each other. Only this time, Sherry's spinster sister, Connie (Harriet Hilard), has fallen ill for the legendary friend Belle Smith (Randolph Scott) and threatens the fined romance; One type of 'em up and toss' kind of person is used to find out, in this way Sherry generally forces all sailors to reconsider their opinion. Ivering Berlin lends to an ambitious class of Standards Class with its best, dedicated score, including 'Let's Go Away', 'I've kept all my eggs in one basket' and 'Let's face music and dance.' A God-based inspired skit about modern suicide, which activates another immediately recognized and thoroughly glorified pas deux for Fred and Ginger. <br /> <br /> Move to 'Follow the Fleet' is a weak weak. The gray scale is well balanced, but now it is a thick thickness that is not as often as the previous title, but with the change of tunnel. Grain is still present. So age is handmade. Once you settled in a little dense and a bit more sophisticated photo quality, the overall impression is not acceptable for this movie. Audio mono but very nicely balanced. Extras include a featurette, dramatic trailer and concise topics, but odd ?? No audio commentary. Astaire / Rogers consider the importance of this film to overall canon from Warner Home Video to make it an uncharacteristic oversight.
