I love Uncle Horror, and Great British Hammer Studios, who delivered their greatest film with "The Devil Rides Out" (1968), has proved to be more than capable of heroes in this case. Hummer's short running TV series "Hummer House of Horror" (1980), this tenth episode of "The Guardian of the Abyss" is actually a vague entry of the series. Director Don Sharp, who previously made Hammer Oyw with "The Kiss of the Vampire" (1963) and "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" (1966), and further directed two "Fu Machu" films by Christopher Lee. The well-known name of the HHH Director, and he delivered it here. Antique Vendor Seller Michael (Ray Loneen) stumbles on a mysterious old skye glass. Skywing glass can be a devilish object of worship worship, who want to use it for their satanic genre. When he gave shelter to a beautiful young woman named Alison (Roslin Lander) who was sacrificed by this worship, Michael got a deep distraction with his religious leader and public leader (John Carson) ... although this is not my perfect "Hummer House Of Harrar "(The Best is clearly the seventh episode" The Silent Scrum "), it is a very awesome and atmospheric There are several interesting twists to this plot, and remain suspenseful and uncanny throughout the film. Ray Lonen created a good leadership, believing as young innocent innocent beauty of Rosaline Lander, and John Carerson was really vague as the leader of truth. Overall, "The Guardian of Abies" is another funny and obscure HHH story, and my fellow Hammer fans will not miss it.
