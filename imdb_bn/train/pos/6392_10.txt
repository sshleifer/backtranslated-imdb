This independent, B & W, DV feature finds the characteristics of shocks, surprises and consonants, and the humor and interest in it with the ability to create most insane situations. It's all ridiculous and ridiculous, yet it should be as ruthless as the film should be, there is a heart and a reality that stays in the film, keeps the whole piece full of madness and there is the real message here. How is this movie that we are all crazy to live in the world? Looks like the heart of the film. Get as crazy and as close to the wall thing, Leon, 30 years. The old paperboy-protagonist, always tried to put it together. She is like a child trying to catch the balloon forever, so that everything can work in the best way, so that everyone can achieve what they want. <br /> <br /> The acting could go a long way, but exceptional cast really kept the pieces solidified. Van Meter is perhaps the best of a bunch with a performance that shines through its obscure sick ticks. Like the characters of the film, we ignore his sudden blasts to see the real person below. <br /> <br /> Here is a true genius in Majkošky. He takes twists of absolute ridiculous plot and keeps them real. This is its script and its cast that helps keep the whole thing. It is the true connotation of Majkoški's skill and everyone involved that this film sometimes does not work nervous with the intriguing plot and characters. Majkovsky has taken a film that can be hateful and hostile, and it gives heart and humor in any way. This is a unique movie. Can not be missed. <br /> <br />
