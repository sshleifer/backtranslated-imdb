Maybe I'm very generous with ratings ... but I just love this movie! I have seen this many times, but whenever I see it, I love it again. It's just a simple romantic comedy, that happens to be huge or memorial. But I'm a great romantic and romantic * movie. I love Meg Ryan and Tim Robinson, and Walter Manu is very funny. Scientists make me so laughable ... I definitely suggest that nobody has seen this movie. This is a clear, good movie - and now these are very rare! My 20-year-old brother also liked this movie, so it's not just a puppy. ;-) If you want to laugh then I recommend it, or if you are alone and need to see a romance *, you can not participate in yourself. This is a good 'u!
