A new, exquisite and throttle film, "The Man in the White Suit", yet another breath of fresh air in the filmic format from Yanan Studios. Although I think some modern viewers initially see it in vain, but there is doubt that many of the plot experts will fail to be impressive, the movie and the characters will be relayed at the time of the film. <br /> <br /> In fact, Alex Guinness has portrayed another subtle character in a film, probably not as an artist since Yale's inspired "Cide Hearts and Coronets" since 1942. At this time, he played only one character instead of eight, but as the unreasonable inventor and scientist Sydney Straton, he always found the right tone and expression. With the fine performance of Guinness, the rest is effective. Among the main players, Sisil Parker and Ernest Thesiger are standing. Thesiger is helpless but influential as the business gregariously obligatory, while Parker is still vulnerable and credible as the owner and father of intense matches. The father, that is, Joan Greenwood, this impressive comic actress, who has been at his peak in this movie. Attractive and persuasive of perspectives and perspectives, he is quite unusual in this film, similarly unusual, but worse, with a fine contrast with Guinness. Apparently trying to seduce him, the pair acted so strongly that it is deeply appealing and interesting both ... <br /> <br /> The themes are handled very effectively by gaining an easy morality. The complexity of the relationship between science, business and workshops is insightful and enjoyable. Directed by expert McClintrick Alexander, this image is technically adept in all areas; Evolution photography, sound effects and music and a wistful script fitting, all affected quietly. A thoroughly satisfactory film with guinness and grenade gorgeous. <br /> <br /> Ratings: - **** 1/2 / *****
