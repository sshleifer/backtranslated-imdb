This is my favorite movie all the time. When I was single, it was a Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle liquor. I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity. I was in the second grade. My love with Travalta and Love was my new friend. Bid Sissy left many comments about why and why Sissy married "learn to work". But come back and look at the second look: Spillade - Now my interpretation of this film, when I was not at eight years of age, Bid and Sisira's relationship became bad because they made her fool by the Gilli horse. The bull They get a huge fight. Bid Sissy tries to jealous while saying pam to dance. Sissy then thinks two mistakes will make a right and Wes asks him "if he needs any help". Pam asks, "When will you take me home and rape me?" Palm Answer: "Whenever You Prepare Cowboy". Bud then went home with Pam in his condo in the house town of Houses. No daddy was bought for his oil money and for "all that matters". He cheated CISC. Waiting for Sissy Bud while returning home the next day. One of those who leave Sissy Boad. Then, it is a real "cowboy" of Sissy and it's up to the proof to win it back up. <br /> <br /> However, it's my explanation. Everyone is sure of them! I love this movie. <br /> <br /> And believe, I found myself a real cowboy! I love him too! :)
