There are many reasons to see this movie: To show the reality that the corruption of Latin America on extortion, extortion of police, we can see corruption in so much reality among the residents of Latin. <br /> <br /> Danger Wahington's performance was brilliant, this man is running as a great actor and it's going on in this way. Acting in Dakota Faning for just ten years, I became an actress and I congratulate. The rest of the movie was amazing, it's in my collection. <br /> <br /> I hope they have come together with Hollywood producers to make a movie in Venezuela, where they show our reality better about criminal, drug or political problems. They have made several films playing Venezuela's land (for example: Araknofobia, Jungle Jungle, Dragonfly), they have to do more in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Song "Una Mirada" I hope that I leave in the soundtrack, it's nice. My vote is 10/10
