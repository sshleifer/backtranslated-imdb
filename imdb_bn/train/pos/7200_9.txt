DeathTrap gives you a turn every turn, every one turn, in fact its biggest problem is that you have many twists that are not adapted to the film, and this often does not give any idea, though they are usually caught by surprise. The story is a lot better, it has many twists. Screenplay is great with great conversations and characters, but you can not catch all the developments due to twists. Especially performance by Caine is amazing. The direction is very good, Sydney Lumet can directly. The visual effect is fair, but again mostly in a game and in the mesh. Twists are a lot of ways, but still working and worth watching.
