Challenging some genuine and true writing Even better to learn how to shoot it together and putting it together is not trivial. The movie of Isaiah Sexton is one where you can recognize life through all its similarity and beauty. I was touched by "Big bad swimming" and from now on, I'll promote as far as possible. It's just a shame that I can not show anything to my friends (like a DVD ???), because it's good to talk ... but it's good to see something good. Not everyone can be motivated to discover pearls and this film should be really out of the box! Thanks to a big thank you staff this master piece, and I'm waiting for it to be delivered.
