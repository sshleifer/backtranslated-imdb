You have to pay attention to the 'twelve monkeys', but if you do it, you probably will very much appreciate it. I know i have Police with the story interesting and traveling time. In 1997, the virus killed many people, and a man named Col (Bruce Willis) was sent in 1990 and in 1996 for the virus. He was arrested in 1990 and is placed in a psychiatric hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Gains (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He is a psychologist. Catherine also met the railway (Madeleine Sto), who did not believe in him in 1990. When the coil disappears from a psychiatric hospital, he is kept in orbit and locked in a cell and again seen in 1996 he began to believe in the stories of Kathryn Call. <<br /> <br /> The movie is playing with constant time. Cole made a phone call and in 1996 left a message, it is sorted in the future and "they" send someone. Someone calls for a call after just a few seconds to call. Such incidents happen throughout the movie and hence you must keep your attention. You can ask some questions but you can not answer yourself because it is good to agree with the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Baro monkey' with some pictures and dark atmosphere works as a science-fee. , And it works as a thriller. You are never sure what will happen next and it helps the movie. Maybe there might be some error in the story, but it is a legend like time travel, it should accept what you say and try to enjoy. It was an easy part for me.
