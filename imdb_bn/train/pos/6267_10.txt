I think the film's genre was fantastic and charming, as well as trying to stay at the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> As I saw the original, when I saw it Sci Fi Channel - I do not know this remix was deliberately created for Sci Fi - I knew what it was in the first few minutes. Since I like Richard Bergie as a character actor, I want to see how he can turn it off. <br /> <br /> Author / Producer etc, "Modernizing this movie has been trying to explain the plight of the Eliens." "Using the same pseudo-science in our ears in the 90's, they (they can no longer reproduce their own and necessary help), maybe it has added a little bit of polish for the film. <br /> <br /> This film is a film. ? This product leads to a more shocking endeavor than the main task - mainly collapses between the young and the alien and the solution to the problem of Alian It has become a trend. <br /> <br /> I think that this repetition has become contradictory to female Boogie / Alien - I think it might be better, but the end is only finished, and the sun is in 1958 science fiction pall The fragrance of the stock was fundamental. Many great science fiction stories were written in 50 and some of them even made it in the film. It's a delicious thing to look at for days or something.

I really enjoyed quite a bit. <br /> <br /> But if anyone really sees this story Wish well, I recommend the original version of 1958 with the original Gene Fowler Junior directed by Tom Teron and Gloria Talbot.
