I have no idea what any other critic is saying - it was a wonderful film and it made sense of time like travel. The characters are really young, a powerful match for Mary Byron, Claire young man and a bad boring, polymerist, a treacherous pit-down syncfun ... all beautiful, passionate, and fierce ... they are horrible ruins in Gothic. <br /> <br /> Gothic Shock acts as an independent part of the film, and I like it for a variety of reasons, but it works like a commercial and ivory film and my text From the index it would have felt like summer was the best capture. Romantic, yes, but every time I think about the film, Shelli and Byron's life revive my interest. My favorite one all the time.
