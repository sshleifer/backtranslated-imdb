To communicate essential issues of life - such as life, what does this mean? - Impossible to impossible. Of course the possible answers to these questions are displayed in each film (story), but communication appeal requires direct appeal. If the input from the senses overrules "Input" to our mind, this happens, such as our thoughts. Some directors know how to communicate the necessary things. Tarkovsky, one. His "stalker" shows images of existence, communicates with life as it shows, and still escapes your mind. I think DG and De Graph do the same thing.
