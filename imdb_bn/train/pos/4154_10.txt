It was always one of the best episodes. Officer Shan Cooper was killed in his Patrol car at age 68. A man executed for sedition has been told that he stole the heroin block from the car after shooting. His case is reintroduced again that he was polluted as a policeman. <br /> <br /> As a police officer, further investigation into it and a man expressing a war veteran involved in banned love. Such love was considered shameful and at least there was something to keep secret at that time. <br /> <br /> Although I personally do not support such love, he is still a policeman and people and shoulders are not killed for it. The soundtrack was wonderful (shows me DVR), and it was particularly interesting to emphasize an object with a mixture of black and white color and give special feeling of a scene. I will be repeating this one watching!
