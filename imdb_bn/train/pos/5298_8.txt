John Waters gave us a truly enjoyable film. This is not without its shocking Waters-esque moment, but it is less than the old culture stuff like "Pink Flaming". "Pecker" returns to John's original mainstream stage so that it reminds the viewer of similar humor to "Polyester". Overall, a really fun comedy with some great moments!
