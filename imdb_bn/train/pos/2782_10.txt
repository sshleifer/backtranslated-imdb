"Bend It Leak Backham" is a movie that has got very little exposure to the United States. This is probably because the film was firmly in conversation and terminology and faced much with football, (football here), which could be a problem related to the United States. It's unfortunate because this movie is pretty fantastic and here's more coverage. I think the basis of the story, (following a dream), can be related to many people, and in the end, "Bend It Like Backhum" is proven as a well-meaning movie with a source of inspiration and really well-played. I was not really excited about watching this movie but I'm sorry to see it now. I highly recommend this movie!
