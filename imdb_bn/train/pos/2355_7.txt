... but I enjoyed this show anyway. I've been reading the comment before telling some of the previous critics about this show, and I am totally ineffective of my own criticism (except one: the show was old; this program was something but old). People bring in a lot of money with the problem about this show: proactive; Forced; Extremely excited; Frustrating for attention; Annoying is the current description. But you know what? I really liked it. It was different, it was original, it really trades; And that's all made for minuses. The show was bright, oral, fast, malicious, funny, funny ... you know, it was once a week, I can accept it once a week and wait for it and enjoy it. I will mourn his forgiveness. But I think nobody will come back in this life.
