The 12th animated Disney classic is a reasonable story to say through a simple storyline. Although it's a little date, it's a place in the Disney classics list. <br /> <br /> This is not one of Disney's top works, but satisfying. One of Disney's most "simple" works, yes, but keeps a certain magic and intelligence (which is well known in old Disney). It was an important film because it protected Disney from a delicate situation. If this is a failure, then no Disney Animated Classic will be there. <br /> <br /> Fairytale story genre brought back to Disney's first animated classic ("Snow White and Seven Dwarfs") because "Cinderella" is somehow returning to it. The story is not clear where it happened, but I think it is anywhere in France because it is the basis of a story of Charles Perrault. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " King and Grand Duck <br /> <br /> Jack is very smart and fun. I love his voice. There really are quality like that of the mouse. Gus can not be that smart, but he's ridiculous. <br /> <br /> The King is ridiculous, but I think that makes him so funny his tiny temperament Grand Duke is very cool chap and fun. They are responsible for my two favorite characters and most entertaining moments in this film. <br /> <br /> Prince is certainly the most compelling in Disney. There is no doubt that Prince Philip inspired this prince from "Sleeping Beauty", because they look very similar. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Lady Trimain (Parents) is not considered to be preferable because she is cold, jealous, bitter and cruel. His daughter (Anastasia and Drezeela) is not much better than that. However, the child is not annoying as her ugly and selfish daughter. Cinderella, the main character, has nothing to do with them. Cinderella is gentle, kind, beautiful and lovable. However, I think his pretty pink dress is far worse than the given by the Fair Gadmader. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Destroying the image makes him funny. In spite of personality he is much more like a father in personality. He always agrees with Cinderella's attitude towards parents. Lucifer has the right name for him because he is such a devilish and average cat. Yet there is nothing boring about him. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is simple but lovely, although Disney is not the best. The best song in this movie is "Bididi Babbidi Buo" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, however, the King Palace is a spectacular masterpiece, really royal and plural Being
