I can not understand. Not a critic, I'm not evaluating the quality of acting, which I believe is a good thing. My confusion is lying with the content. These two unfaithful women had justified their unfaithfulness towards men for war and bloodshed to ensure the continued independence of their country and that nobody else was sensitive to it. If men made it a home and if so, how could their treacherous betrayal of "wives" affect us, but we should not have given any suggestions to them? Although these women were laying their lovers out of loneliness, did they think that their husband is facing death every day or enjoying a firing? They do not think of all of their husbands! Just myself. Forgive me when they wish their husband to be dead at the time.
