Along with another movie related to trafficking and child sexual exploitation known as Trade in the film through the International Film Festival of the Sea, I also saw Holly. I said that the water is out of the water. <br /> <br /> Holi is a powerful and amazing movie in many different levels. Purely from an artistic and cinematic perspective, it's amazing. Sound-milling, camera angle, direction and acting are all spots. <br /> <br /> In addition, the way to handle this issue is delicious and unsatisfactory. It presents child sexual abuse in a way that is both educational and correct. The movie makers paid attention to detail in the amount of attention, in fact, the idea of ​​child sexual abuse and trafficking pandemic was found. Often, when talking about such issues, rape, and the graphic scenes of violence, the temptation to disappoint the audience. Holly is able to achieve all this without falling into that ideal Hollywood trend. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed watching two separate movie festivals, once in the United States and once in the Netherlands. I can honestly say that I have not seen more movements of viewers. By listening to the conversation after screening, people ask what they can do personally to fight child sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it for the senior standard and its content.
