For the adults, the story is a fantastic film by discovering stories and fantasies as kids. The child's drawing is becoming a place where he can physically visit and affect it. At the same time you can get the psychology of all the children about it and say that he is really seeking his subconscious, just as we all dream of our sleeping. My father's paper is in the house, and behind him, which gives me a hound-pimple. The only thing I can not stand is that it was sold as a horror movie ... it's not really that. You want to see some of the British with lots of stories that make you guess without the usual cheap thrills, but most of the movies will be used, then see the paperhouse.
