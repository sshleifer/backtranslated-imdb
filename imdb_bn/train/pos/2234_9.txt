Although the film's "special effects" and technical features may actually be ridiculous to some people, I'm never able to portray this film on my young and printable mind, when I saw it at the age of eight. The story of this girl's survival and her tests she endured with had me in these years, and I think again more than once, how far she is far away from how I saw it. <br /> <br /> This is a true story, and when I saw it, I was only a small one, it could be the reason behind my high rating of this movie. The film should look at television every time in the 70's and 80's on television, I can not explain the drinks in the taste of each scene. I think it's an adult observer for the first time (and with the splendid view of the world) it can not be enjoyable at all. I actually got out of my way to get a copy so that I could show this film to my son. <br /> <br /> This is not like many other movies. If you are influenced by extraordinary people's survival stories, Peru / Macchu Pichchu and / or partial partners of Amazon, I believe that you can enjoy this movie as much as I enjoyed for the last 30 years.
