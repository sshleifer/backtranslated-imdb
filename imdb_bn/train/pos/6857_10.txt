"Dresses to Kill", is one of the best thriller ever made. Its behavior with sex and violence creates a film for adults. Brian de Palma, again proved that no other director can tell a story using the camera. He gave a lot of scenes without dialogue, and he strictly views his view, and through his brilliant score of Pinto Donagio, he tells many stories. In the film Panavision, the film must be seen on the widescreen, because D. Palma uses the full width to tell her story. Croped, video, "Dressed to toll", is rarely the movie. Rigid performance from his cast, superb direction, and perhaps, sometimes written best film scores, will be a "definitely dress up".
