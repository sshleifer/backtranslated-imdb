A scanner Darkly, minority report, Blade Runner, Sina City and Sky Captain and tomorrow in the world ?? It would be better to verify if you are a fan of them. <br /> <br /> The French animation project 'Renaissance' took seven years to create a shoes budget and tonight. A personal screening for the Stockholm International Film Festival. My spontaneous responses are scared; My more reflection of 'Hah, Shubh' and close analysis is sadly a barren 'meh'. It's a fantastic science fiction winner over the surface, but it's also digging or even pushing it a little bit and it becomes glaringly clear of unnecessary complex plot, as flat characters. <br /> <br /> It is also clear that the people of the Anix film have made some sights with the aforementioned surface. The visual is shouted. They used live-action motion captures in key-frame animations, starck jet black and bright white contrasts and a heavy galaxy rotoscoped background. For those who do not have 'technical lingoes', the film looks completely animated like Sina City. Its liquid, transparent, dark and styled templates are complementary by great cramping lightning. This is a vision. Yet many credits are due to the effects of heiming future surgery, suspicious music, heavy rainfall and broken glass shatter breakers. This is the dream of every tech-breathed dream ... <br /> <br /> This image zoomed in vibrant, shining, futurescapes Paris, in which a large corporation named 'Avalon' started living. Surveillance Citizens (think fluid clear screen from minority reports) and genetic engineering. Later, the young researcher Ilona (voice by mysterious roaminga garai) was a mysterious abduction. Cut our hard-on-high suspension and dramatic carrot (Daniel Craig) ?? A man who takes law in his own right? Elona was found and the recovery case was recruited. In this case, he is being helped by Illon's sister, with whom he started a love affair. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Director Christian Valkomman takes a fair jab while ruining Noor themes, and as a result, a city jungle filled with hay, conspiracy, fatal, and lonely innocent people who hide behind the shadow of the seduced slam. The problem is that the makers felt very explicit in the story and felt the need for spell--end archives, or the film was "too much surveillance" for the mainstream viewers because of its Lined Animation format. Then we follow that we have many clean letters like bad-comedy villains, lazy criminal bosses and hard-boiled kids who smoke. It shoves silently in our mouths, and it does not need it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems as though each line exists for the only reason to run the plot. This is not a serious cause, because once the plot becomes complex, it requires some clear direction. Daniel Craig helps here with bringing a dirty attitude to his hard-core pool character. At one stage of the Renaissance, he watched a lively car-chase, which is one of the most adrenaline-pumping and top brutal images in the film. Unfortunately, the novelty of the sci-fi visualization has been refined after this Chase Post and 'Renaissance' can be benefited from being a little lesser. In short, a very interesting but flawed futuristic comic book experience. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
