For a long time in my life, I do not like this picture, or I like this picture but not much. I recently saw it (sleepy enough) and 6 or younger because I liked more than I did. I appreciate more now, as with some other Disney classics I've seen recently (like "sleeping beauty" and "pinocio" or you spell it out). <br /> <br /> I now appreciate the animations, the shiny "Disney" plot, the humor from the mouse, the expression of passion and the plot. Animation is done very well, often it seems that you see any other character where they are. Animation also illustrates the background style of the city (which is briefly shown twice). Disney is changing it from the original fairy tale in an amazingly good way, changing the shiny plot, such as creating a mouse cloth and a key part (Generally I do not like Disney movies if they are not like the original story, but I'm not too upset with it. Looks like they made it necessary to create a good Disney movie. Often I do not think Disney has anything to do with them The book has been changed to bite well). <br /> <br /> You already know this story, Cinderella is working for a lady and her parents. She goes a ball with the help of her angel godmother and lose a glass slip ... <br /> <br /> It is a very film to meet with another man. Immediately the family is not good enough. To enjoy this, let me see you with friends (and immediate family, if you like. :-)) <br /> <br /> I recommend to people who love at least Disney, for those who like fairy tales and who like the mouse. Enjoy! :-)
