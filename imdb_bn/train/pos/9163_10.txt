My college-age old girl was in preschool, these miniseries appeared in A & E each morning from 8-9. My neighbor and I made an agreement that we would not miss a minute from Jane Eyre, and our kids would have been late for the whole week in the morning. Good choice <br /> <br /> I forgot how long I liked this movie until I found my old VHS copy. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. Tempered illusory demean with dark, sticky face, humor and softness was directly from the book page. Although Dalton was eating a little bit of the scenery, I could not sit with Wimpee William Hurt or Garcia Sieran Hind's adaptation. The magic here is that women love Dalton and get caught in romance. <br /> <br /> I would like to know what the Jella Clark has become. He is as quiet as Jane, formal, but says volume with a look. Given his eyes, he gives a glimpse of the power of the spectators and the nature of the soul which helped Zen to survive the lasting torture of the Youth. Criticism of its performance as "wooden" is wrong. A servant of the right English family only maintains such abusive behavior, but when he is defeated with emotion, he speaks worldly. Unlike other public screens, he feels as if enough is visible to Jane, which allows enough viewers to attract Rochester to the audience. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It is intact Delton and Clark captured the mutual performance between Zen and Rochester with intelligence and quiet intensity. Like Vanilla Custard, Zen feels genuine and sweet, but she refuses to shake by the dark, Blastry Rochester. Two Leeds play pretty close to each other. <br /> <br /> This is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novels of all time.
