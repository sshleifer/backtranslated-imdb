"Garden of Allah" is one of the first feature length, 3-Strip Technicolor film. To improve a previous poster, the first technicolor feature (after Disney's 5 year Exclusivity Agreement) was "Bikey Sharpe" in 1935, a clothing drama that uses color for her girl's clothing. <br /> <br /> "Garden Allah" seems to be shot after years such as cinematography using shadow rather than color. After watching only black and white movies, it was amazing for viewers to see a colorful feature. Unfortunately, cinematography does not stand up to the movie. That said, the film is valuable to see as a visual treatment.
