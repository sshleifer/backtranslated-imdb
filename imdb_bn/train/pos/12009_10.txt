I really thought that they did a nice * job, there was no mistake with that, I do not know how the first commenter could be called a terrible thing, I was moved to tears (I think it all moved away in tears) but I I do not try to cry in a movie because it's shameful but it got me. It was good yarn! I hope they will be released from DVDs because I must buy a copy! I think it renewed my belief and gave me a hope that I could not explain, it wanted to strive to be a better person, they had passed so much and we had guessed it. Compared to that, I think nothing of our own tests. Well, nothing, but they rarely match what they wanted to do. I love it Who played Emma?
