Maybe I have to check my head, but I thought it was a pretty movie. That's not too bad. I've seen more bad. They were animals (and by animal means I used to be good and bad snake). The action scenes involved in the snake were really good, I thought. Sometimes there are some mistakes in the argument, and stories do not always have the knowledge. But for an animal features, there are many bad ones. Many other creatures seem to have emerged from other animals, so it is not entirely original. I think the origin of the story is original though. Yet some of the analogy of Godzilla (American version of big budget) which is very much liked. Like this movie, but I still say it was pretty good. I also like the song. Finally, I think the dragon war is almost 7/10
