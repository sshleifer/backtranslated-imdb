The artist says, it is a beautiful movie - cinematography, music and costume spanking. Actually, this movie is much more beautiful than Akira Kurasawa operated. In this case, he wrote the film because it was created a few years after his death. <br /> <br /> So far as far as it is written, the dialog writes well and the story is sometimes fun. However, the story was rather dissatisfied in some ways - after all, it is a group of women working in a prostitution story. It is interesting that although prostitution is seen as a more acceptable business in Japan, women still live a better life. It reminds me of a lot of filmmaking, although the character of Sheem's character is much less likable and one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Overall it gets 7 - in most cases everything but. Writing. It is very bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story of the great Kurasawa.
