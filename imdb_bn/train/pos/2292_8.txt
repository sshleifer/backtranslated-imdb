Linked to YouTube as a link to Thadblog, this is the first bug Boney (for the first time he has named here) and Elmer Food Cartoon. This was the first time that Chuck Jones managed to "run wildly" and this resulted in a different voice of Mel Blanc than Brooklyn / Bronx that we are more familiar with. In fact, according to Thad, he knows Jimmy Stewart (his "shy boy" type person is that time). However, after Elmer purchased his pet, the radio jumped aloud loudly, his master repeatedly pulled him out of the shower and said, "Turn off that light!" When Elm grabbed him in his bed. Even with various voices, the bug certainly has its rogue self and I laugh at myself the whole time! According to Thed, there was an extra scene at the end of Elmer, after which he left the house only in the bugs, but it was probably considered to be very sad because at that time he suffered a psychotic breakdown, so it disappeared visually as the scene. However, I highly recommend Elmer's pet rabbit.
