I enjoyed this movie. The old did not see Andy Griffith and he felt perfectly fit to play this role. I've added him with a comedy but he is very happy to see it very versatile. <br /> <br /> I can not be Dotty's "anxiety disorder" from a mental textbook. There is a fibia and neurorian Jilian and they can take quantitative and qualitative forms in a broad way. He is understood by local Indians but not by any Anglos as sensitive with additional sensitive definitions. <br /> <br /> This character is considered to be a light family film, but it is really sophisticated. Also, at the end, the Hieram Twist came as a surprise surprise to me and united all previous work together. It is fun to think of the possibility of such spiritual guidance.
