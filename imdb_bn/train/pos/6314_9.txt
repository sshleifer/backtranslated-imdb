I went to the movies with my two friends, and pulled this movie out of the hat, I did not fully know what to expect. And it turned into a very enjoyable, dead-laugh experience! This is an unexpected story, very nice dialogue and crazy laughing a wonderful movie. All the characters are definitely made in the style of "Allan Ford" (Italian Maritime Comic), but that does not bother me for a second. In fact, such harmless-line-up made a movie quite unique and interesting. Sam Rockwell has a very strong and strong role, Willian Messio, Clooney is very well recognized and bright. But the actual star is actually Guzman. He played the role of his life in this movie! The film is so annoying when his character Kaseemo dies in the movie that he mocked me and almost died with him! All "Allan Ford" highly recommend for fans!
