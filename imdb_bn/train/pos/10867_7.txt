I saw the guide in the list of films for the Santa Barbara Film Festival, where I went to Hollywood, this picture was screening. Originally a selection was held to elect the new Chairman of the Hong Kong Teards Oo Singh Society, so you can imagine how much violence will happen at this time. Struggling between the "candidate" Lam guy (Simon Yame) and Big D (Tony Lung Ki-Fi) to control the oldest and most powerful quarterly sections of society. Jimmy Lee, Nick Chung, Jat Lee, Chung Siu Fei, Lynn Suat, Big Head and Lam Ka Tung also played as Kuna. Some good realistic themes of corruption and moments are fairly effective steps, outside of the police that may be involved, but a siege is followed, so this is a pretty crime drama thriller. very good!
