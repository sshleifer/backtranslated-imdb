24 Best Broadcast / Adventure Series TV has been broadcasted. The whole idea of ​​telling a story of a 24 hour real duration is fantastic. The filming and the style of panning is our hooks to see it. And Jack Boucher is one of the greatest plays of a TV series over the long run. I rate this rate with my three most favorite TV series The Simpsons and the X-Files. <br /> <br /> This first episode began with the conspiracy to kill American Senator David Palmer, who is also running for the President. Bauer was called to his office along with who could discover behind all this, and at the same time, his daughter's road was stuck after fleeing from her bedroom. In this way, an adventure begins in the best political style, and the best of all, it is always played in real time, which makes this TV series work theoretically where almost every program on TV seems to be shown. The same thing over over us.
