A message movie, but rather a good one. Outstanding Cast, From Bottom To Top Originally back story in the interest of Bate Davies Plot Line! Very negative reviews (combined with a very negative comment about screenplay / playwright, reducing the name of 'Engels in America' etc.) is very publicist about Germany's WWII in this movie. Gosh, this is the only ultimate concept of morality for me. <br /> <br /> This special movie will not be created after 70 years, with the time of the theatrical and film production, and the style of acting. Yes Casablanca is a good movie (I guess), but in the same year and both of them create Nazi, Casablanca is primarily a love story. The story of love in this movie takes second place in spying - more of a thriller. Both have a rather large number of Chess accents and wonderful character actors. Children are a little tedious and can be edited
