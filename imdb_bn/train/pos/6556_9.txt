I liked this movie very much. I am a 17-year-old girl with single parents, smart, athletic and talented. I've used myself very well to crime my daughter and help others! So for me, perhaps this PG level Fantasyland I have read many nanseo drum books many years ago. Certainly this character was played by Emma Roberts, but I was not like Neczy Drew by reminding me of books. It's not played because of the script. <br /> <br /> Emma plays a confident, industrious and proud character with a adorable teen, good debut and good taste. He is not caught in the competition around him. The plot has some vulnerabilities, from books in the same way as Nancy Drew, and we are trying to determine the decade we are in. (Eg, who, who?) <br /> <br /> I read IMDB overview before watching the film, because I was in Rachel Leigh Cook's study of other films. This is not one of his best roles, but I'm looking for more of his films. Rachel was too old to play this seat, but as the mysterious child, he worked as a center for orphans. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed in another review written here. Some books hope to have perfect connection with, hoping for some more credible situations or adult action films. What i hope Good entertainment is good young teen girls, and their fathers who want to have good kids with high quality behavior and achievement targeted. This is not a teen pg movie, James Bond! Want a role model for your teenage girl?
