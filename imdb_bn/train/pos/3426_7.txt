This is not a criticism of the film, but how we are blind in our own past. <br /> <br /> I recently saw the winter soldier, and Ground Truth was like watching a remix or a seagull - instead of Vietnam, instead of Iraq. As a one-sided message, like the Winter Soldier, both films describe how we indulge in a conflict based on false propaganda and allow our young and brave (and often inappropriate) to bear the gains of this greedy war. Both films effectively show that mentality forces the minds of the young people and willing creates a machine for their efficient killing, but the training rarely weakens for diplomacy and police skills, which they think is the fight to win hearts and minds. This has finally vanished from the Vietnam War, and probably lost the war in Iraq. <br /> <br /> My only negative comment is that this film can be easily passed as a left-hand publicity. Not by me, you mind, but those movies and messages notice ugly. A more balanced point would be to talk with a larger audience.
