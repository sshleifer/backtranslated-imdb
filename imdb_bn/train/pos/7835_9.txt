I saw this movie in a special movie theater show in Nuremberg last night, and it was fantastic. I must admit that the solo player and screenplay / gyelophone player's original music composition has affected the mood of the film, but the film also strengthened the painting of his tragic Nibelulen Saga. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in silent movies or NibelulNyneid, then I highly recommend this movie. The dresses were superb and creative, the sets were plenty and exotic and were dramatic and exciting (like silent film "Tragedy"). Unfortunately, I did not see the first part of the movie worried about Siegfried. After the death of Sigfried, the story of this second movie began, when Cromheld (Gudun in the story's version of the story) began to take revenge against his brothers. <br /> <br /> I also saw this movie in Germany; I have a native English speaker and a basic German knowledge. Due to the old style German script, the first time subtitles (what do you say in the silent movies?), I recommend that if you see it in Germany then you are in your "K", "F's" in the old script, and " S ". :)
