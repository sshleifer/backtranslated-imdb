A really great movie and true story Dan Jansen is the greatest skater of all time. A touch and beautiful movie can enjoy the whole family. Jane Jensen's story fights with cancer and Dan Jansen loves his sister. An important statement from Jansen promised that his sister won gold medals to prove that Zen had the right to believe in his talent for speed skating. This image is worth the time. I would like to make more films in these quality. Thank you for a great movie with excellent actors and a wonderful story. It is a very sensitive story about a beautiful family support for their children and a special dream for faith and their little boy and his sister.
