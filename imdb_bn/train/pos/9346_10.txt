If you do not enjoy this movie you are dead, or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Chadle. <br /> <br /> A nice cast, who gave everyone good performance. Despite the critics' sayings, this film proves that Adam Sandler is a good actor. Adam Sandler is becoming a very respected actor. It started with his performance in Big Daddy, then he did a few bad films, then 50 First Dates, The Longest Year, then click, and now I have broken through Ryan Ina performance. <br /> <br /> Return to the movie. Adam Sandler is a man who has lost everything. The most intimate thing in her family is a mother-in-law and her father-in-law. After her old college roommate (Chadell) ran into her, she surrounded her life. I will not say anymore, because I do not want to overturn the movie, but firmly recommend this movie. One of the best films of 2007.
