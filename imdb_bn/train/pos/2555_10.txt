The movie was not that great at all. The book is good. But the film was not so bad at all. It was interesting to say the least at least. The plot was a mystery enough to keep an observer, even though I did not say I was really interested in movies. Both Jane Turner and Antonio Sabato Junior are fantastic enough to see you :) They have some interesting scenes that should appeal to romantic. Overall, I'll give the movie 7 or 8. It was not bad, just a few plots scientist.
