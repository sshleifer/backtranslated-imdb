I get 10 out of these 10 points. I love it very much I'm 80 years old and have been in heavy metal for many years. That's why I love this movie a lot. The poster (Judas Priest, Leighy Borden, Ren√©, Twisted Sister ...) and his Vinyl Collection in the boy's bedroom (Mysteries by Oscars, Shock Metal Master Empler and My Business by Killing Megadeth) The fast track also makes soundtracks completely incredible and fits very well with the plot. If you are in metal then trick or treat your friend. Do not buy or watch this movie for Ozajee or Jane Simmons because it's in the movie for a few seconds, see this because the soundtrack and the story will bring you back 80th. You will not be the same person after.
