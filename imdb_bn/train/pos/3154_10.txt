This show is sunny freaking! Jokes is real, God and I love Eric and Kelsa! Yes I know what they say, it's no longer fun after the 8th season because Eric and Kells show no more, and Randy is a real dumba. Compared to Ardie and Kells. <br /> <br /> You can not accept the most fun characters and can switch with the kind of "I'm a cool guy" type (Randy). However, this is not his fault, but the authors are trying their interesting fun fun 8th, it is not just like the previous seasons, but it's right. <br /> <br /> 360's great, great circle, red is a real mental-abusing parent :) And the cat always gets half a half. Hyde tries to cool all the time, she has her moments too. At least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. They are cool, but not without Kells and Eric. <br /> <br /> Great exhibition Good!
