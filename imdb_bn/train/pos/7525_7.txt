The Betty Page was a suppressive icon of the 1950s, when she represented sex independence, which was still a decade away, but there were many teenagers and adolescents' expectations and dreams. Gretchen Mole is a small town girl with this fancy ambition and a great body, who has done a fantastic job in drawing the tarnished Bettie. Her acting career did not go anywhere, but her body brought her fame to the fame in a admitted fringe case. Black and white color photo has been created while coming out of the world of exploitation in New York, the production of this TV (HBO) film has a good production value and very reliable supporting cast. The problem is, it is mentally flat. It is difficult to create an attachment with the character, because the business was portrayed as high and neutral due to the business that was given to it. Self-service government investigation was given at the time of the screen, which eventually slowed the film. But it is of course valuable for the history of time, and there was a feature of fifty to see the government regime of great interference. 7/10
