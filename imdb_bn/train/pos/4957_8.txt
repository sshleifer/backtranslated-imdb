Writer / director Brad Silberling was created in a small budget of 10 items or less than 10 weeks, only a small photo shot in Carson, CA, which looks like a complete story, in the best sense of the word .... Between her great projects with Spanish actress Paz Wagger, there was a good fortune to combine the silhouette's late actor Morgan Freeman, and as a result there was a dialogue between two people from different facilities for the improvement of the lives of two people. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman has played himself - yet the part of the comedy is that he has been portrayed as an actor who has been working for four years, finding a location for some futuristic movies that goes back to the stream. His 'role' can be like a market manager and he is excluded from market in the form of taxonomic terms, where he faces a scarlet, a suitable 10 items or less checkout lines among others. Scarlett does not get tired from his static job, he is usually angry with his fan husband (Bobby Kanavale), now the lack of scholar's lazy colleague (Anu Dudek) and his ability to get a suitable job elsewhere. After some joint problems two pairs and they have a 'road trip' which leads to the result of growing up to the presence of each character and life story. <br /> <br /> This is a simple story, simply said, but it works very well due to the tender relationship between Freeman and Paz. This is one of the few films about human relation, where the change and exchange is weak message. It's good to see, and it's a DVD which features features, informative and ridiculous - a joy to see.
