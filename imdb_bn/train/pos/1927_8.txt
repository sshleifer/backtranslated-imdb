With the death of Georget Nader on February 4, 2002, I thought this was the most interesting event, although it was only a small run, it was a great idea with the symptoms of good story all over the world. If it disappears for 40+ years, it will be re-seen. The opening credits show a lot of different images, one of which was a snippet of Colonel Johann Paul Stap, who sits on his famous rocket slide, where he is often called "The Fastest Man Alive".
