demonicus rocked, you guys need to understand how difficult it is to rocked, unfortunately, the sound needed to explain the amount of rocking has not been discovered. For a small idea, E-50 hits like pop, Washing Death Factory wait while waiting to call Jesus, Jesus is waiting for the call, you're in the phone line with Will Smith on the initial line. Seriously, that movie ... so good. You need to watch it at least a 4 times to catch all the subtleties ... well, not so much subtleties as long as the movie takes, 4 times in order to think why the moon is allowed in humans, live, and b, reproduce. What is our world coming?
