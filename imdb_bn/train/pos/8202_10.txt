It's the best of "Dirti Harry" series without any doubt. From opening credits, you swim in a revenge story that is hard hit and deeply angry. Sondra Locke is the perfect role of an traumatized woman for revenge. There are several "side" sequences in Eastwood that have nothing to do with the plot, but Harry looks the best of his bad ass. Small role should be loaded with unforgettable characters, this film should serve as the standard for stones and intelligence / action flicks. This is a poor Harry flick which is raw and no "fluff" is ineffective. I can meet this repeatedly (okay, not sitting in one) because it is a vengeful "out of vengeance" yarn Speed ​​fast and scenery are unforgettable. "Go ahead - make my day ... you're lucky, Punk? ...." Classic Eastwood can only make Eustund, its pain, Robert Expression and comedy, scary voices.
