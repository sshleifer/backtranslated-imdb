Some critics found this movie silent, but for me it was good humor and optimism to overcome this impression. For example, the girl's silent and positive character reflects the center of the movie, often setting and plightline unhappy aspects. <br /> <br /> The film is full of original ideas and characters, and the final outcome is not predictable: I felt that it was gone anyway. <br /> <br /> However, many reviews I've read mention the use of black and white, but the print that I saw was shown in the whole of the SBS TV network in Australia, in full color. <br /> <br />
