I saw this with a few expectations and absolutely loved it! Like Beckham, it's a fairly identical artistic girl. It is a breakout role of Parminde Nagra ("ER"), a teenage boy from England who is in love with his traditional Indian family and football (which is our North American football). And although he is actually much larger than his character, that role plays a pitch-perfect role. It is about friendship with Jesses (Keira Knightley), a film about friendship, her colleagues also going through family problems, especially with her mother, who wear polished nail polish and short bow in her shoes, and Jules Wants to be more feminine, wants to wear lacey underwear and flirt with the boys and is scared that the play means that their girl is lesbian. Both Jules and Jess love to play this game and after their dream they are trying to please their family. Unfortunately, both of them love the same man - Joe, his coach (played by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). Love triangle creates some pressure in their friendships. <br /> <br /> In some spots, Bend It Like Like Backham Clich√©s. On the other hand, the scenes may drag for a much longer period of time, and this film might benefit from overall strong editing. <br /> <br /> But it's a growing picture, a clash of culture, and a fun photo for the love of football. It empowers women, pursues your dreams, and supports your friends. Funny, charming and funny, Bend It Like Behum is a little picture ... ... <br /> <br /> Excellent. 8/10.
