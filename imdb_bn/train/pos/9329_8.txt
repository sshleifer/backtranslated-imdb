I saw the perfect son about three times. I fail to see how this photo is a gay movie, I'm not even gay, but I do not see it as a gay film. It's a movie with a gay character, I can not see why every gay character film should be strictly a movie about homosexuality. I found the film to be sympathetic to the study of death, your daughter's death. I think Theo lives very fast after his rehabilitation because he wants to meet his death in front of his brother and reinstate her life. Theo told Ryan that when she got to be a father to get too old, she found this conversation, Ryan said that she does not want to know about things she does not want to see or share. Is that terrible and sad? I highly recommend the film.
