Your average gardens are closed by various psychological nutcase (deliciously unhearded glee by Steven Sachs), your Dataton Hall, which is being closed for destruction, to the different dim-witted young "adults" (very little to use the term). Terrible acting played by Cast Caste (Daphne Juniaga has done her humiliating and bad movie as Debby, it's a Bimo, whose head is torn by!), 10 giant body tales, ok by f / x good by Matthew, some bloody Murder (baseball bat blueszoneing, chicken strings strangulation, your mental drill through head bits, the kind of great thing), a disappointing Unfortunate ending, which later became Christopher's unclear score "Inroadrador" "Heliester"), little smidgen on unused female nudity, and sympathetically inactive direction by Jeffrey O'Brien and Steve Carpenter (who has supplied us through "The Power" and "The Kindred"), This entertaining endless atrocity is a dab of intriguing dopey and drecky low grade fun As the size of the deal up.
