A few years ago I saw this movie in the video store and hired it. My husband and I enjoyed it so that we bought VHS and enjoyed it since then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This point of view deserves the repeat view of this movie. The Americans, especially, are not going to get jokes all the time. I do not know. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, touching, sad - at the same time. When Roy proposed toast on her daughter's wedding, then it was cringe-education. When Karen tried to kiss her, Tony called "Brian", it's frustrating. When the voyons finally fall into the corner by the woman in black, then it is very interesting for the words. <br /> <br /> and music: I've heard for many years that it's just like a movie soundtrack. I was dancing in the living room "all over the world." <br /> <br /> Every performance is absolutely perfect. Bill Nayyigh is praised fairly for Ray's screenplay, who has made a lot of bad travel to a man. Stephen Ray Tony as the perfect, loving keyboard player who has borne a torch for all these years Karen. She wants to hug her to the women who have an attractive hangdog look. But all actors are equally bright. <br /> <br /> Ignore what you read any pans about this movie and see it. This is a jewel.
