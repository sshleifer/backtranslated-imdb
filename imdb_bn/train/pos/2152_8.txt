There was a great moment to portray modern-day life (not everywhere in Japan, but everywhere). It shows how much the culture can be interrupted and it wants to get out of the mold created for you. <br /> <br /> There was only one song for the dance, "If you love against the ideals, do so". Instead, Billy Elliott I would like to say. I enjoyed that film as well. <br /> <br /> Humor was a good time, and the sensitive moments felt so real, you can feel the pain in Sujiyama and his wife, the dance hall's tantrum. I love Akki - he and his goats and dance floor makes me so much easier! <br /> <br /> Actors did a great job to everyone, the story was well written. I saw it a second time and at first sight I caught a little bit of feeling. Good entertainment!
