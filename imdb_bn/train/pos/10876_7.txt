I was really excited to see this picture. I thought I was finally making a good film in Australia. But I was wrong. <br /> <br /> It was never the most kind of effort in a slashher film. I am sorry for coming to Australia to create a terrible movie near Molly Ringwell. <br /> <br /> The actress was terrible (especially the Australian man who tried to speak in American accent), and the plot was very bad. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about the film coming out, I thought the title was merciful (because it sounds like a schematic 2 of the film "Stab" of Schemes 2), but I was a good movie if it was Wish to slide <br /> <br /> WARNING !!! Chief Speaker !!! Perhaps the worst thing about the movie is done. I was amazed at the killer ... but the killer was not even the man ... which made this realistic slash film a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Do not see this picture. You will probably be frustrated!
