I have not yet read Kart Vongut's Mother Night (although I read her other books, all the great pieces of taunts and fragments of the game changing novels). After seeing Keith Gordon's picture in his book adaptation, it must be read immediately in the near future. This is the element that I am certain that if it was not made in 1995/96, it will be taken in today's time when most of the post / present-hallocast / W2 movies are quite popular. The approach is even more intense, though the nature of the role and the real intrinsic horror, the horrors of living with the war after the war, and even the reader say. This is about the real danger of fighting the war, which is really a spy on WW2. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Kambel (Nick Nolt), which is there. But it is the only firm credit of cinematic technique. Keith Gordon is not such a person that I do not usually think of the real firm element as a director (more than that, so I think he thinks as an actor, he returned to school with Vongtuts quite a bit at the peak stage), but this is an expression. He took the story of Campbell's story as a broken life: a German media ("America left to Berlin"), who is actually spying for Americans, but can not reveal his identity and before a playwright who really is "one of the two nations" He and his wife (Sheryl Lee) were there. Following this from his prison cell, because he was waiting for Israel's trial in 1961, he wrote his memoirs and talked about his confusion about being a semi-hidden in a dramatic Nazi, and then in 1960's New York apartment, where it was called <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br>> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gordon, on the road to Vongut, gave us a firm perspective to a person. She is a painter (Alan Arkin, very good here), her friend goes to her own devices, and then after a white maximum newsletter, the Nazi- It is found as hidden, which manages the vacations in his apartment. On the page it should be a straightforward spy story, but one thing is not straightforward. The 'some' of this human life is amazing, but ultimately its own choice. Campbell is one of those characters, which can be analyzed for analysis for details, but can be reached with the same conclusions (and by one means, the Line Gobbles line mirrors): False, the more people believe. Apart from the selectors, who knew the lie and knew his secret and power. <br /> <br /> Oh, if this is not a wonderful and tragic-funny story, it would have been different. He showed some amazing performance (which: Nolt is very good here, and Sheryl Lee, who can remember us from Twin Palmer as Laura Palmer, stanza on multiple grounds, especially when he reveals that he is not really "Helga"). This is a nicely shot film, captivating light and shots that reflect the character's mind, or only show dense density or sick colors (see the scene where an old Campbell shows a movie of his little soul. Runt, face juxtaposition is great). And the music selection increases the level of tragedy. It may be advisable that some music is too much, but at other times it makes the elements past its own natural dramatic dimensions and makes it effective for human nature. <br /> <br /> It is not always a simple film to take mentally, and twists some of that tinge that "wow" as any spy story. But it imitates death by imitating life by imitating life by imitating life by imitating life by imitating life, imitating life and performance, which shows and makes it worth remembering. Although the book is better (or any other way) than the book, I have no idea, but at this point it is not hard to recommend anyone looking for the best composition of the WW2 / Holocaust post.
