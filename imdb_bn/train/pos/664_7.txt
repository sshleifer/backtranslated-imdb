From Crypt to Tales: And Ellis Elizabeth (Mary Allen Trainer) kills her husband, Joseph (Marshall Bell), starting Christmas day before, she is ready to drop her body down well, but while missing it, missed an important news bulletin on the radio Said that a hurricane maniac (Larry Drake), decorated as a Santa Claus, escaped from local psychological shelter. Has gone and already killed some women with Elizabeth on her list, but she has other ideas and she is probably trying to introduce dangerous situations <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story was a part 2 of Season 1 from the story of the Crypt, the show's regular executive producer Robert Zemkis, and an overall direction directed by All the Throw The House of the House. The Fred Decker script was originally based on a story based in the comedy 'Vault of Horror' and it was originally turned into a movie as part of the Brightness Horror Athology Film Tales from the Crypt (1972), which played the role of Juan Collins as a murderer. Here comes the character of the wife acting by the instructor. This special edition is good enough but something is not different or especially and it is considered a classic as a bit too linear and expected. It can only run at a good speed of 25 minutes in length, the story is only sufficient to Macau and it usually provides entertainment, and I rarely like it till the end. At this time, the opening and closing of the Christmas theme is complete with the usual puns sections of the Keeper Keeper (John Kasser). <br /> <br /> Director Gemeckis did a great job and there is also a nice winter atmosphere with a hint of Christmas effect. . There is not much gore here, some have pusher stuck in the head, some are cut off by the head, some of the hands are cut by an ax and some blood is blurred, but usually it is not graphic. Actually played by a small cast is quite good. <br /> <br /> And the house is not the best story of the crypt, but it is similar to all, watch value, but after the comic book story, did not we really need the 1972 film version of the original?
