Time and again, I said that if people do not make remixes or seagulls, they will stop seeing them and instead enter the independent film. Although I said, last time I saw an independent movie six months ago easily. So here is a review of India that I've attracted my attention to YouTube; Treatment. <br /> <br /> Well, you can say that this film is going to be a vital film system, which is telegraphically used for extreme close-ups, scopphilia, and quick editing. It's proud of how it looks - and it has the right to do. In most cases, it is a case that looks very neatly composed for a small part, 180 degree rule and an inefficient negligence for a playful bad gun effect that seems to be a calling card for short-meaning projects. <br /> <br> However, despite these amateur flaws, most of the shots are actually a pleasure to see. We use promos and positions in good use, good visual acting and some very atmospheric, fluid edits, which are presented as more praiseworthy, because it is definitely something you can not see often when you submit to YouTube. The plot has broken and even though the basic premises are fairly simple, it may be difficult to follow what is happening, but what we are seeing here is the story of the ant-garde story; You can not really expect a simple three-action structure and if you are not ready for such a movie then <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film unfortunately will be reduced but the word is unfortunately. What you're about to hear is a distorted voice-over which seems to be often disrespectful and bad, but still continuous background music, which goes through the lowest change and does not add anything to it. Audio is given so much attention to the verbled neglected words and it becomes really clear when you realize that you have missed only four sentence statements and need to backgil your viewpoint. <Br /> <br /> So, give it a watch, but do it with the word close. <br /> <br /> The last thought; Remember the cover of Dougher's Red Darf's novel "Last Humans"? If you have a book, I know what you know.
