Before the White Code came into effect in the early 1930s, the film was one of the more black black and white films of the period. It's the story of a young pretty woman to go to New York and using her body as a tool to go there, she made the way to the top of the business. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who work fairly well with its performance. Lily comes to New York and leads her business place by sleeping with all the men. Stanwick has done a remarkable performance as a powerful woman who once used to be a man, for them it did not have any embarrassment as if they were scrambling. Lily Powers is a woman who does not love power and money only for her mind. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie was a little different, then I saw other movies because I did not hear any background music. I believe it is only because of the words and dialogue between people in the first movie people of the people. The music starts in a few moments as it shows how she made the chain its way. Filming and different scenes were something fantastic! The director of this film has done all the right angle and all the right techniques, the film is filled with reality. <br /> <br /> This movie was a good film together. The end of this film was not as good as it should have been, but it was not completely destroyed. The baby face is a slow moving scene across the film and probably some predictable parts like he would sleep next time. But this is a loving movie which can be taken once and proposed to some people and friends.
