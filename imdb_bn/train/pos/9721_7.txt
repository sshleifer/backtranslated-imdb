How to lose a friend and disassemble people is a decent comedy with a romantic approach. <br /> <br /> This is actually a story of Sidney Young (Simon Peg) that breaks the business of writing journalists and magazines, which is the fun way. Simon Peg is a normal look, a little worse than his usual. The movie is not sunny or funny and it's nothing but its moments and those moments are really fun. <br /> <br /> I recommend this funny proposal and America's cream comedy to everyone who is watching America, just sit down and want to enjoy the movie for it. If you are going to see this movie in a critical way, you do not want to be frustrated and you have to pass it until you start trashing.
