The only show FUTZ was reserved in the 1960's New York's experimental Theater Movement (Source of Offroad Broadway). Although it is not for everyone, it is truly brilliant, dark, funny, love, sex, personal freedom and a deeply annoying story about revenge, a more serious morality story that is now more relevant when the Congress wants to disable gay marriage. Our constitution wasted. The story is not about being gay, but - it is love and gender that is not in line with social rules and therefore should be removed through violence and hatred. Spreading, it tells the story of a person who loves pigs, but like any great character, it's not about animals, but it's a bigger thing in America. <br /> <br /> <br /> The stage version won international acclaim for its original production, it has traveled the United States and Europe, and it affects almost all theater that comes after it with its other generations. Thankfully, the main event and the original director, Tom O'Hargoan (who directed the Broadway hired and directed Jesus Christ Superstar) was originally supposed to be, we've preserved this event here. <br /> <br /> The mainstream of the mainstream of the studio is not a mainstream, it is an offensive, turmoil, a glorious, deeply emotional, fantastic fantasy of storytelling, which you will never forget. And it may change the way you see the world ...
