Beautiful pictures from Preminger; Occasionally as a laboratory, it sets up sets and locals from different corners and perspectives, as it explains how and how they live in modern cities. In this sense it is visually appealing and regional, because its hero, good policeman with bad temper, falls in very hot water when he accidentally kills a man with a plate on his head. <br /> <br /> Wings Andrews did not lead it as Hamlet, and it has not been well. The story may be pure melodrama, but Andrews weighs and often reaches the tragedy level. As her daughter, Gene Tierney is interesting but unmarkmarkable. Gary Merrill has created a very interesting villain, his usual warmth provides an excellent contrast to the coolness of Andrew; Her hilarious, touching-seemingly bad person seems to challenge her devotion that her openly openly openly openly and wounded moralists followed her. <br /> <br /> There is no big surprise in this picture, which seems to be transitioned for all concerned. For director Premminger, it is a kind of reunion with Laura Starr, Andrews and Tierner, who often passed his career peaks during the making of the film. Supporting Cast, - Merrill, Carl Malden, Neville Brand - It is understood, they are more optimistic, because they all went on their way. Premaking, like an observer, makes an obsession with a ruthless exposure without disclosing a strong perspective, because the morally vague ending is somewhat frustrating, because the cat and mouse game between the two opponents may seem larger and more archaeological than a mere movie. There is a lot less solution. <br /> <br />
