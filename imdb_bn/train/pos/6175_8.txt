When I first saw this pilot, and I sure countless "soul" fans hate it, because, like Batman, Green Hornet, it took the character "camp" direction. But I obviously did not get enough of Batman, because I think it was entertaining in similar ways in the show. There are two parts to stay with me. Firstly, when Danny's partner was severely injured, and he was always standing for the law and made a dramatic speech about complying with its correct letter. Then, he said something, "Son, I was stupid!" Instead, Danny is not saying that, instead he (which is the type of TV Batman). Then, trying to persuade Vilnese to leave the scene where she kisses him, but she is not fooled, because she must be honest enough to kiss her kiss! This was a great example of "camp", it was both "actor" and actress.
