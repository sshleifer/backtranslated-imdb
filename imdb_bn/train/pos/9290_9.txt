This is not like a movie known as John Wayne. He is a diplomat, a man who gets done through physical actions instead of words and provocations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are two Interview stories. The big story is internal, separatist Japan and exotic, expansive America when there is conflict in their interests. Small, human, the story is looking at the external hostility (Owen) and the initial hostility of a civilized Gisha and mutual respect and love. The story of human beings reflects the big story of two nations. <br /> <br /> The movie is done very well and all actors perform well in their role. The fulfillment of the two lead roles is performed. John Wayne Townsend is excellent as Harriss, and he participates in a mixture of right and proper forces in his dealings with Japan. Echo Endo is very nice, charming and delightful as the same designation Geisha. Interaction between his character and John Wayne is particularly illustrated. These two people behaved exactly (as they were portrayed in the film). <br /> <br /> The script is very well written. It lacks all the pomposity. And a realistic illustration of the phenomenon that can be illustrated. Characters are genuine humans, self-consciously "great" figures from history. In addition, the conflicts of culture and interests are illustrated with great skills and subtlety. Indeed, a traditional, and traditionally strong, separatist conflict between Japan and the ocean has been described very briefly in exchange for a growing, new powerful country, John Wayne and local Japanese baron. Wayne complained that the ship crew was helmet when the land was given to the sailors in Japan and the passenger ships could not enter the port for water. Baron answers that Japan just wants to stay alone. Owen's character replies that Japan is moving towards the increasingly important crossroads of the international ship, and if the race continues as before, the nations will not be regarded as more than the band's band at an important road. Both countries consider themselves to be right and think each other is wrong. The conflict between the two self-righteous people, along with contradictory interests, has its reflection throughout history, the current ongoing and future ongoing themes. <br /> <br /> The painting of cinematography and mid-nineteenth century, was followed in centuries ago, before the sharp rise toward industrialization was excellent. Japan's ancient civilization is a visual treat, and an enlightened insight. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance, then I would recommend to John Oen to see this movie. Just be aware that it is not an action film. It is an interesting place in history and a presentation of time and a slow-hearted love story (to surprise them) comes to dominate the personal life of two main characters. Watch this movie without the following ideas, allow yourself to immerse yourself in the story and you will enjoy it completely. <br /> <br /> Everyone, a nice movie.
