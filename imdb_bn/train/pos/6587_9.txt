Short story of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventures of Charles Augustus Millverton", which I saw with the first feature length of the story of Sherlock Holmes, Master Blackmailer. The story is interesting and dark. The film has some great, sad feelings, but it is quite entertaining (especially with some fun scenes). <br /> <br /> * Spiller * Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson has tried to uncover a misleading identity. Blackmailer publishes a destructive private letter in one of England's most prominent families, which will destroy their lives in a way or another way. They finally find out that he is Charles Augustus Millverton, who is a "artist", after some tragic consequences for paying damages. Our heroes will have to help the next Lady Eva Blackwell, who will have to provide money without his or her money or else the closest marriage will most definitely be closed. The host and Watson steal in the Milworton room, the scene is intense. Although the film is a happy ending, it is tragic and sad. <br /> <br /> Exceptional performance as Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick (normal) and Robert Hardy's extraordinary villains (most visitors probably recognize him today) Harry Potter's Cornelius Fujus, Lady Eva Blackwell as Serena Gordon, Soft West like Lady Swinestead. And Sophie Thomson Agaga (the scenes associated with him and the riots in Holam). I give it a *** 1/2 out *****. My only approach Lestreda the inspector does not have enough. (I would add a little scene at the end of the story, in which he gave details of the two thieves, one of which matched Watson.)
