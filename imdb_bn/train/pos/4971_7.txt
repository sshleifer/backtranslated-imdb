This is an absurdist dark comedy from Belgium. Pink is completely hit in black and white, an angry, passionate father in small, inexpensive Belgian mining town, like Benoyet Powellworld (man bytes dog) Roger. Roger is a photographer who goes on a road accident to take pictures with his little girl Louise. By getting into the competition for breaking the record, he was annoyed to win a car, and he decided that his son, Michael, could try to break a record of walking through a door - he even trained him by appointing overweight coaches. There is a radio show on Alice's Michelle Shahidul and a radio show called 'Cinema Lease', where she described the mistakes in the film. Neighborhood Felix near Luise, friendly with a pigeon fancier. Roger is a cruel figure, because he crosses the length of the record attempt and hits Michael directly, which is almost as a result of his death. Surreal images like Magritte intergrased throughout the film. It's arbitraryly charming and well worth your time.
