I like this movie! It is really wicked, very funny, shocked, malicious ... There is no meaning to say about the content of the film, because I'm giving results! You have to see it before you know what you know about it! Everything is connected and why and why. It starts continuously and then everything starts moving fast and fast until you can imagine the most insane explosion ends! Once you know all the "techniques", once again the movie is more fun to see. The actor is excellent, especially Ivan Trojan, whose final scene is a real master piece! I highly recommend this film, it's one of the most original I've ever seen!
