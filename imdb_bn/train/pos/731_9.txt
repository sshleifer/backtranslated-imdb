This movie is SOOOO fun !!! Acting is funny, Ramones sexy, Jokes are fine, and every high school teacher dreams of doing what he wants to do in his school. I absolutely love the soundtrack as well as cynicism. If you like Monty Python, then you like this picture. This movie is a tad bit "Greece" esk (without all the annoying songs). Music that is liked by music; You can sing these songs once through the movie. This musical my musical number second (next to the second blues brothers). But please, do not think of it as every musical; Seeing how liked the songs are, it is difficult to perform a dancer scene carefully. I think more about this movie as a comedy with the arrangement of romance. You will think what you think was to be a rebel teenager; Do not say, you will remind your old high school day after seeing this picture. Highly recommended for both families (It is very young but also for adults as well as many jokes to have fun with age and experience.
