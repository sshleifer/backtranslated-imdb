Wow an episode! Last week, Melissa continued to see Kyoyo about Annie and Brandi's friendship, almost in the pond. But after being expelled, there was nothing that Malicea did not see. Realizing its laziness around her cast was the most ridiculous thing on TV ever to find out pornography and shout someone to get her purse. He continued to scream people set off to get his clothes continued "all the other" someone else would wear his hideous outfits Melissa, are you at the age of 40 and you still have to put the tactics? Then Joan began to call every name of the book Anne and Brandy, and rose up and shouted! Both of these rivers are spoiled brats who are left only to hold these ratings in the river. Mellisa cry and refuse to interview a departure, just think everyone in America proves, you are a spoiled baby. WAH WAH I can not get my way! I love how Annie told the camera that she could use Malice to think of her way, and then did that. Melissa is so ridiculously competitive and obviously able to win the whole game.
