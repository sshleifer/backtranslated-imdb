Finland director of Helsinki thinks it will not do any good work to manage America's horror films (especially inside the United States prisons) - see it to prove yourself wrong! It was made after 80, and the film was more suitable for a modern DIY company's TV commercial. (Something I think is that nowadays someone will actually notice how really the budget of 100 million dollars addicted to everyone is unfortunately suppressed by the industry's mind!) Mr. Harlin's first major production and - at least that which is considered a star-cast nowadays. I still think that most of the full Nordic contribution to the film industry can do more with the presence of Stalman Sturger's screen (at least not mentioning Mr. Bergman's directory effort) - at least for all female viewers - but this flicker is truly our true talent beyond the United States and Hollywood. There is a sensation in us Show films made. If you are not scary pap, watch this movie and see, IMO is certainly worth it!
