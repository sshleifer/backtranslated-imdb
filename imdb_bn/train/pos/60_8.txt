"Home Rooms", like "Zero Day" and "Elephant", were inspired by the latest wave of school shooting. But unlike the other two films, the "home cell" focuses on two living (bullets or those not killed) after a shooting. It is less exploitative and more beneficial because a little effort has failed to answer the question that does not have any questions. <br /> <br /> Do not give up this little film in the first 20 minutes, it should be set up the real story but plays like a rejected "Hill Street Blues" episode. It's too long to bear with it, at least it's enough running length pad to get a classified movie as a feature. I recommend avoiding this completely and going forward to the hospital scene - there is nothing you can not get that from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> Like many small films, it was creative, Paul F. A person like Ryan was both the writer and director of the exhibition. This system does not guarantee a good movie, but it is usually a good sign because it refers to a specific unity of construction and execution that is often lacking in the dramatic features of big budgets. Because the script of "home cell" is its true power, it is fortunate that the author also produces it and makes its view on the screen. <br /> <br /> Ryan finally takes a huge opportunity to check the sensitivity tolerance limit of the average viewer. He runs it straight up to the edge but cries instead of cries against all logic pages to cry. Why the final work requires some adjustments for a reward after the end of this type of journey, the song (Sarah McLaughlin's "sweet surrender") ends and the final minute is an amazing edit. <Br /> <br /> Other power in the film is played by Bassi Phillips (Alicia) and Erica Christensen (Dinah). Although Philips has played his mentally disconnected naughty and Christensen, a good family's intelligent girl, they both bring their intensity more intensely than before. Family life of both girls is more than Ryan satisfactorily and little interest. What's going on despite the story surrounding a fairytale about a wonderful police detective around the city trying to drag Elisea into the sole shooter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the clich√© and predictability. Instead, his script has attracted him in a fascinating and treacherous sparring match, slowly running towards each other and sharing weaknesses, only to get back inside. Dina's "I'm going to die inside" line just separates you- I can not remember the moment in any other film that I felt so deeply. He strictly requires a connection that Alicia just as strictly prevented. When he turns back, the wings only progress. Visitors expect a group alignment that can never happen. <br /> <br /> Finally, it only creates many mysteries, but you appreciate both the characters and the two actresses. <br /> <br /> Again, do I know? I'm just a child.
