I first saw the thief as a child who thought of me as old as a gin. Since there will be no children, I was excited about the imagination, the inventions and the power of the film. Several years later, I realized that the ridicule and intelligence of the script that I was missing at the first sight was I have never had an opportunity to intervene to see it throughout the year. In addition to the script, the production crosses the fantasy genre. This is his very good storyteller Korda. When you see a thief like a child, you know that your time is very good. When you see a thief as an adult, you know that you have seen a great composition. It's as storyless as it's timeless. A wonderful job. <br /> <br /> Thomas McCarthy
