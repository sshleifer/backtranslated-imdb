This movie took me completely by surprise. I saw it 2 or 3 times. I really like this picture. There was so much to bring in this movie. I love all the characters in this movie. This movie gives a lot of knowledge because society "goes further" culture becomes loose? No word of promotion I can really relate to this movie from my kids' hood and lose the separation of my life that will never return and will never be the same. I've never seen this movie in my top five movies. A raw fact that I feel when I see the film and it is not true that you have to dig right in front of your face. The creator of this movie has done a great job and I enjoyed this movie a lot. This movie may not be for everyone but if you have an open mind, then you may like it.
