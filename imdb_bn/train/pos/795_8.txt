Very bad a couple of comments before me do not know the incident in this case. This is based on the real facts of Willamington, D / Philadelphia PA region, from 1996 to 2000, a highly publicized disappearance and murder case. I would like to admit that how Hollywood will dramatically dramatically make history and events dramatically and I was extremely skeptical. In fact, the stories of the local newspaper and Philadelphia Inquire were quite influenced by how closely they affected the news about the news. Of course, I immediately congratulated that the actress (I really like the cold case) did not see anything like the one who played Faii (Anne Marie was really nice). Mark Herman revealed the true personality as a caponor and I really admired the way Cappano did during this period. The details of the case were correct ... any deviation from the dramatic effect ... carpets, guns, furniture and even colder down. In conclusion, I wanted to add that I met Tom Carper with many functions in various functions (despite being a good man, politician), and I'm very happy that he dragged the federal region strings required to solve these serious crimes. It is very nice to see people like Kopon are real and keep them behind bars.
