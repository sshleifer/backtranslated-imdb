In addition to the fact that I wanted to see a huge Jane Austen fan and a feature-length movie (as little as possible as a true fan and could be achieved only in a mini-series) as well as it was really great. Guindy Paltrow has taken a really strange but well-established rich girl and Jeremy Northm with her mood and merit. Nightly I was not very thrilled with Ian McGregor, although I love him as an actor but do not think he has spoiled the movie. As I said, there was something like Jane Austen fan which I did not like to include, but it would take much longer to get permission for a feature length movie, and I felt that they really hold the story well. I have seen every adaptation of this book and felt that it was the best!
