What's wrong with you, if you do not move the action car sequence and Jessica Simpson into the hot body, you're mainly screwed in the head. Of course, the film is not an excellent composition, I do not think it should have been noticed. It was funny and funny, I was never small, I recently saw one episode, and when I saw the movie, I thought it was the same atmosphere. The movie seats were really shaking, and the car order was good because it did not bother me and could pull something like 2fast 2furious scenes. And Jessica Simpson is yellow hot, I just wish they had used her more in sequence order sequence. Above all, I had a hell while watching it and I would go soon and see it again and I would buy it on DVD. People, enjoy it for what it is.
