"Addiction" is a specific adjective that I have heard many times while listening to several shows. Recently, plays such as Lost, Heroes and Prison Break have achieved this narrative. However, as they are mandatory (and they really are) I can wait a few days to see the next episode of the series, even the Prison Break is classified as something that is stylish "New 24" even though they are. With all due respect, there can not be any such thing and for a good reason: No other silver-screen thriller is based on the real-framework. 24 sets are separated from any show, and that is why I have to watch the whole season (DVD) for seven days or less: After the start of the Freakin clock, it is impossible to protect. <br /> <br> A episode was published in one day by NYPD Blue (and recently, Deduved) was a trademark; With the whole season of a new series for the last 24 hours, every single contest (the actual running time is 41 minutes; the rest 19 advertisements occupy advertisements during the time of the telephone), the most important concept of mainstream television from Hill Street. Blues tells non-linear stories (nowadays a compulsory element). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />), Perhaps we received the hero in the first light of the heroes because it laughs about the bright environment: Very discouraged, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sucherland) is enjoying the chess game with his daughter Kimberly (Elisa Cuthbert) and after a few minutes (Leslie Hope) With the tender, with whom he just met. Like the Sopernos, although there is a little unexpected and frustrating behind the corner: Kim has not just sped up from his room, Jack accepts his phone call and urges him to act immediately. Midnight I'm afraid: Bauer has gained a reliable Intel regarding the potential injury of the life of a CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit) agent, and his boss David Palmer (Dennis Hesbert), the African-American presidential candidate will be Los Angeles for the whole day (Oh, well, I Almost forgotten: the president of the President of the President of the President of the President of the United States). There is no time for snacking, then Jack will have to spend the next 24 hours to work in this case. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to ignore its protocol, and it does not sit well with George Mason (Jander Berkeley), a thin man in the department who is asked to interfere with the operation. <br /> <br /> Too often, those who work hard to recommend for a short short time, but anyone who wishes to give them any attention will be rewarded immediately: sharp and precise writing, draw attention to attention, and Suspension is consistently in the sky. Thanks to the high, primarily true joke, which boosts the level of Adrenaline in plenty. <br /> <br /> Another great quality of this pilot is characterization: the main genre (science fai and thriller) and then thereafter define them (a textbook example is CSI, where the character development is low, but then in the unique style of the show ), And there are 24 totally round people in the first half of the series, among whom Jack (Sutherland's best role - ever!) And Palmer (the show Original release) after only one episode stands as fully described in the (first divided between job and family, but also humanitarian obsolete, the respected and accomplished with great integrity). Stereotype (especially Mason and Tony Almeida) should be considered a couple of parts to support the boundary, but two reasons should be considered: a) This is the first episode; B) Most viewers are running so much that they will not even complain about "errors" or two. Above all, how many network programs are managed by a conspiracy, a missing teenager and a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfactory elements for the rest of the season? <br /> <br /> Tick, Tech, Tick, Tech ...
