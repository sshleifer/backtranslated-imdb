This film has sent Detroit Police, Detroit Police, Tony Costas and Pat Murita to Detroit for the recovery of the stolen prototype of a motor vehicle as a Tokyo Police. A Japanese man hoped to visit Detroit, and it is coming to a company named Derick Jard. Unfortunately, for those who wanted to discuss the agreement, they killed him and took the prototype. Derek Jared, angry for Ragi to take himself away from Madras. But Madrasah (playing by Chris Sarandon) did not have any of these and Zardi stressed to continue his partnership. Meanwhile, the same junk yard, where Japanese people were killed, also a friend of Tony Costas of the same person died. Tony's friend Junk Yard saw it. <br /> <br /> Tony asks to find the killer against his son's orders. Tony bombings should be executed and must be investigated in a murder case. When Tony was investigating this investigation he went to the police station of Japan and wrongly arrested him. Finally they end up working together in the case. They make a weird pair and kick some funny scenes and some ridiculous scenes like Pat Murti jumping and kicking right in the moving vehicle windshield and kicking in Madras. But at least it's my opinion, the ending of being an enjoyable friend cop movie. Jay Leno is no actor, but he is also a choice of role and Pat Morita is good as well. Nevertheless, they made an action film more unlikely for both Coppo. If you like friendly movies, Chess 80's movies or you want to see J Lenny as an actor, I recommend this movie.
