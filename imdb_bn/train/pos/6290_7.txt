His carrier evening was an interesting choice by using booster Keaton. He may be the most gifted comedian of silent age. This gives him an opportunity to showcase those gifts in a short travel story. He hugged a man who lived in modern times, and it became clear that we were at the top left in our own time, Keaton was able to awaken his eyes very well. I've heard his voice before. I believe he has made some beach party films, playing some nude characters just to earn a few bucks. Serling seems to have respect for her and illustrates that way. This is not a bad story. It shows that when we want to get something that we do not have and we want to get it.
