Throughout this movie, you can think of this picture just for kids. Well, this is mainly directed towards them, but the audience of the audiences also said aloud with a loud cry At about this time, the Mup pet gang tried to move to Broadway, protecting them from their production of terrible strikes, leading them to split. But Kimmit does not stop, and after his determination to move together, everything is running until he gets hurt from a car and sends it to Amnia! <br /> <br /> This is a textbook, in some parts, the songs of the 40s of the old storing cars are actually the subject of a musical instrument, only here there are plenty of vivid and wonderful moments, strange fun moments (Lozeland boomerang fish; Gonso's water stunts Display, tear, among others), but with very heart. Muppet writers do not feel shy about conventions, on the contrary, they embrace it where it is often refreshed to see the story 'Give a Shot' where thick and it seems that the letters will fulfill their dreams. <br /> <br /> Although not at full price as a Muppets movie, it has got many interesting and memorable songs, all the excellent places in Manhattan and even inter-species dating (and marriage)! Including Liza Minerali ("A frog?"), Eliot Gould (as a police), Brooke Shields (proposed by rats), Edward I Coach, Gregory Hines and Joan River in Camio. So be ready to sing, or laugh a lot and romantic (yes romantic) with one of the best Muppets movies.
