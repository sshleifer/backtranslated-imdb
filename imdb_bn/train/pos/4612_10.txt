Fred Guin, Al Lewis, Sid Caesar, and Yevon de Carlo are all starring in this fun, funny movie. The late Fred Guin is really great as Harriman Monster, who lives with Dada Munster (Al Luis), Lily (Eve de Carlo), and her son and daughter. Sid Caesar is a complete division dedicated to the Munster family that is sunny as a wax museum owner. When Harmon and Grandmother's images begin to create terror in the city, everyone blames them. Now they have to delete their names before they are late. You just have to laugh loudly just as you would.
