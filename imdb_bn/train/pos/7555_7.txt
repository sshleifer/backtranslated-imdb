Gender Bandera uploads a few files for X-Files. This episode is an interesting premiere, a good story, but a lasting that is missing. Gender Bender is also the first episode of X-file actor Nicolas Lee, known as Alex Crisek. In this episode he played Michael, attacked by a "the kindred". Only this episode is to see Nick Lee less than the startling start. Kindred is an interesting thing about "the power of temptation". When Marty does this to his victims, they turn to him. However, when Andrew persuaded the school, he was only unhappy and suffering, and was not attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because it has more experience than Martu Andrew. This episode reminds me why sometimes it may be offensive in British Columbia. It is so wet, foggy, and melted across the episode, it could not have been so much fun. Despite the frustrating end, Gender Bender is still a decent episode to watch.
