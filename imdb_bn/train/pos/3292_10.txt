Paperhouse is the most ongoing and poetry film I've ever seen. Often classified as a "horror movie", I believe, is a serious error. Some magazines once called it "Elm is a nightmare of a thoughtful person on the road" and I accept the conclusions of its conclusions but I can not help but think it is a tag that is ill and misleading. Those who can only see the scare are really missing here and only they show that they do not really care. <br /> <br /> Actually, trying to classify this wonderful task is probably a bad idea. Quite simply, each subtle story of the paperhouse is perfect and always my heart will have a special place. Since a scientist once told me, "This movie takes you to a completely emotional level", which can explain why my comments are so annoying. To be honest, I do not want to apologize for this, if you think my words are too much for your taste, but now stop reading more reasons. It is very rare to find such a picture that his heart aches pain and struggle to overcome the intense feelings of heartburn and isolation and loneliness that can completely defeat this broken time in our lives. Even more unusual to find child actors who can really play their role in sensitivity and intelligence to do all their work. There was an inspiring part of our castings at Charlotte Cheyle and Elliott Spiers, and the permanent effect of the paperhouse was a lot for their ability to illustrate the annoying and isolation of childhood (often overlooked) in an unbroken and trustworthy way. <br /> <br /> And yet this bright young man has diminished by the perception of both studios and has been somewhat faded. <br /> <br /> This is an incredible talented director (Bernard Rose), fantastic movie and the most beautiful and hunting soundtrack you might have heard and why you can tell so much affection and obstruction for this movie that can show any sound No <br /> <br />
