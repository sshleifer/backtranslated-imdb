I finally saw this picture after hiring at Blockbuster (VHS). I would agree that it is wildly rooted. Yes, the characters may not have been fully understood, but this is not a movie. Instead, we treat him with the eyes of the director, what is his view of the story. And do not stop it. And to be honest, I do not want to do it. I believe that the director of Sabur will have to 'lock, stock and two smoking barrels' and 'run, lola, run'. But I like the way to see them confused by passing three beautiful women in Lead streets. I really need another work in this movie because this picture really made me plot. If you like insight, culture, sturm und drang, go elsewhere If you want to laugh, camera movement and criminal ridiculous, see here.
