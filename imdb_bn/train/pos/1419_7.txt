It is a run-of-the-mill pornographic film of nature. By porn, I do not mean sex. I mean nonsense pictures (for example) thousands of birds together, or hundreds of walruses, or a giant waterfall or ice. Most of the film's shots seem to appear in the trailer just before the man sees it for ten seconds to see the theater. The rest of the picture will not be seen again. <Br /> <br /> There is almost no plot in this picture. "Lame is better than March", it is said to expect the story of three animal families, the film does not just deliver. The fault lies in three major areas: (1) The author who gave James Earl Jones some of the worst lines outlined in the film's history of nature, (2) The music team, making everything dramatic, telling you what you should feel, fails to encourage movies, and Ultimately, but most importantly (3) stories that jump in from the place without a rhyme or reason for the story, no Continuity, no flow, removes life from the whole film. Film about life. When we went through halfway through the film, I returned horribly to my seat, hopefully the film was more than half, and I hope I can survive the long endurance test as well as animals. The screen <br /> <br /> There was almost no science in the film. Polls will never be warmed, because if they do not have a rope, we can not be more extremist than the location, ignoring the fact that they are completely hot and cold in the slopes of the world (it is not season, not just season). And if there is no rotation (related to the revolution) like Mercury, it will be the worst, because half of the planet will bake and the other half will be frozen. Then, by the end, they use the word "man and animal", as if humans are not animals then it is free from the laws of nature. So much for science <br /> <br /> I have to credit the camera work, again, and again I have called this nature porn. All of the super-slow-motion elements that are considered fine-tuned mechanically controlled time-isolated photography, were used to supply some (and I caution, only "some") extraordinary moments which can increase the bar than other nature films. That said, I was convinced that there was not all nature on the screen. Some shots showing great water holes in Africa, it seems like CGI to me as the season changed from season to season. A director might expect such doubts and create it in other shots that it is all natural, but they did not. <br /> <br /> For a movie about the world, I have shown much hope in the world. What we saw was prisine. Due to climate change some species had to take the word of our descriptor to be risky. They did not show us this evidence. They did not show us the place from Alberta toxic tail pond. They did not show us the great Pacific Trash Hurley. They did not show the night photos of human light pollution around our planet. This is as much as some other earth. Why cover it for a well-well whitewash? <br /> <br /> Forecasting the latest reviews of my content Indeed, a hunter is shown on the hunting hunting screen, the music almost moves from the Lord of the Rings to the Mount Dyam scene, and the hunter depicts some kind of solar as an extreme-evil character. But the hunter is not evil. They perform a necessary service, so that the best members of the hunting species survive. We ourselves hunter. Any time hunting hunter catch, we immediately assume that cutting away anything else, death and eating does not really happen. The final insult was the "father" after being brave to die of pig drunk. "Bad beer! Bad!", You can tell them almost <br /> <br /> Presentation itself. This may be part of my theater, but is probably not responsible for it. I wanted to see something more transparent than I wanted to see my own HDTV LCD at home. But the picture was unclear, and this day came in 16: 9 ratio, which, in this day, I could get home instead of the larger proportion of many movies. And at the end during an action-packed scene, the film (I can not imagine it's happening digitally), and we've lost a few colors and eventually got completely black. That repeats almost three times. <br /> <br /> If they plant a tree on my behalf then it will be valuable. But how do I know?
