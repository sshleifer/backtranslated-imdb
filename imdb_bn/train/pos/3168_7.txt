It is a tricky and sad story of cultural differences. Kyoko is going to go California to a beautiful Japanese woman who escaped from a failed relationship in Japan. Kane is a Japanese American manual worker, with a desire to rock and Roll Stardom but to offer a potential partner a little concrete. Who "marry" to be able to live permanently in the US, with the understanding that they will live together until they get the "green card", although the wedding name only remains. It soon develops that groups are not the same waveli - or perhaps "timezone" at the same time, so the title of the movie. As an immigration attorney, I have seen such "arrangements" take their own lives, so I'm happy to see how well filmmakers look at the dramatic possibilities of this situation.
