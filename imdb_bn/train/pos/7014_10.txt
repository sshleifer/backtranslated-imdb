Wow ... I do not know what to say. I only saw seven pounds. Nobody can cry like a Will Smith. People are very self-tune with a wide range of human emotions. This movie was efficiently and nicely done. Hollywood is rare to find such intense humanity today. I would compare it to "forward payment" and "crash" as both raw and dark shows in such a raw way. Certainly for a long time lets stick with you and gives me a lot to think about. I have deep love and passion about movies like this. Generally, not a "bad end", but rather a real seeker who receives more than emotional, raw life and abundant abundance of existing glory. Therefore I do not think a little pain at the end. It's the fact that there is not always a happy ending in life. Sometimes it does not end up happy you should think it. Many people were able to lead a happy life after losing love and life. If you look a bit deeper than others, you would love this movie!
