I found it to be a vivid adaptation, very vivid and full of fun. With a couple exception of big errors, cast wonderful. I have to echo out some of the previous opinions - known as Phillips as a teenager, who is terribly corrupt. At the age of 27, she is very old (and, yes, it shows), and the lack of singers "chop" for broadway-style music. Vanessa Williams is a decent-enough singer and a dancer, she's enough. However, he is not Latina, and his character is definitely. He gets very stressful, which is very stressful. <br /> <br /> The girls of Conrad Bardi fan Club of Sweet Apple are really amazing - with Bridgetown Dao and Chia Janni's special Kado. I've enjoyed Ten Daly's performance, although I'm not usually a fan of his work. Finally, the Shriners of the dance are a riot, especially dorky repeatedly. <br /> <br /> This film is suitable for the whole family, and I highly recommend it.
