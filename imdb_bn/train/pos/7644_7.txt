Jim Beluszy is considered as "Inner Joe", who gets 15 minutes in "The Twilight Zone". Michael Kane is a mysterious bar tender who did not listen to Belushi's "story", but "cured" Bal√∫shi's middle-class problems: Beljuh is a magic practice to make changes in life. <br /> <br /> 15-year-old shame due to the defeat of the flashbacks High School Baseball Championship championship. Belushi is his "sad life", seemingly happy, but always wondered "what will happen ..." For many days, Belju has a "different" life, in remarkable success, praised and hated by others. Equal measure <br /> <br /> This is not quite "a wonderful life", but some elements are similar, and very respectful. Expected "end", but still satisfied. Look for a very young Corticon Cox as another woman's "fatal attraction". A very nice film!
