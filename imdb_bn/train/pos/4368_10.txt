This is a very exciting and romantic film. I saw it several times and it does not bother with it. Everything is realistic and it is a good plot. Actor Liam Nisson, Jessica Lange, Tim Roth and Brian Cox. This image I really like Brahhart because there is such a historic mistake in the brevite. Have a lot of exciting scenes - look for bridge scenes and end fence scenes. This is a really good and wonderful scene. <br /> <br /> Music is beautiful ... it really is appropriate in movies. The setting is amazing.
