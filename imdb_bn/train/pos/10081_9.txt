It's a beautiful, rich and very well-organized movie with a rich and meaningful story. Essentially, how is it necessary to find an old master tale tellor to carry his masterpiece to a male (he) heir, but he does not end up achieving what he hopes in the dominating world of his man. Then the letters will have to deal with their situation and the old master must be involved in a conflict between his companion and heritage among the traditional ideas of a companion and heir. <br /> <br /> The story is fun, emotional and complex. The pursuit of characters, their lives and emotions is strong, and the development of impressive character is strong, although the characters are complex and not one dimensional. The film prominently expresses its desire to find the old people's emotions and heirs, and compulsively shows how he and the child manage the situation. In appropriate points, there are sometimes quite fine, humorous. The film also made good and bad examinations of traditional Chinese culture, made more interest and depth of film. <br /> <br /> Instructions, acting, and scenery are all outstanding. Adding other strengths, these rich and believable visual images and compelling, create real characters. As a result, the feelings of strong sympathy for the film, and the characters. <br /> <br /> Some have claimed that the finale weakens the film, but I certainly do not agree. Perhaps it might be strong with a different end, but there was no improvement in overall cinema.
