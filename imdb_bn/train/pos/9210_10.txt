I saw it was one of the best movies, I am an old man and mostly western love. I love movies based on at least events, if I do not make mistakes then this is a movie. I also like the revenge types, it also qualifies as my opinion. Some of my favorite parts of the movie are opening scenes with Whipping and Burner shooting scenes. I felt that the fork scene was a bit more, but I did not affect how I felt about the whole film. Do I think I saw the continuation of this movie through the use of gun smoke. I also enjoyed it. I recommend taking time to watch this movie, I will look at it again. I felt I was acting well in part of this movie romance. I thought I could not play a villain type for Randy Travis, but I always enjoyed his acting.
