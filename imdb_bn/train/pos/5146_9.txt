I came from a unique position as a German mother and English father (who spent five years in the prisoner of war camp). One of the winners of different Nazis and WW2 winners on one side of the family. These miniseries can not delve into every single part of Hitler's mentality and the visitors will give the situation a common taste and give one of the conditions of Hitler's mind as well. This series is not quite good. Carlile O'Howel is much better, but got more information about the relationship with others in the party because Hitler did not do anything on himself. There were people around him, who often followed him without question on his question, and of course his killer had no questions in life. What is happening through the minds of Goebbels, Garing and Hess? This relationship will be helpful to see more. But I hope this will help people to study more topics. It is understood to the public that no one like Saddam Hussein will be able to remain in power.
