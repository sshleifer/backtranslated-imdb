Scorpio's tail is a highly stylish gaololo run by Sergio Martino, who became the second geyell master in Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The very satisfying and entertaining kill mystery. It ultimately makes sense, a big plus, 'because this is not always a case for the giello, because they continue to extend credibility with their endless red-horns and final solutions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> Martino points out with a sure hand, keeping things tight and atmospheric with some gorgeous set pieces. <br /> <br /> If you are a gaelo fan it must be seen. If you generally want good writing and suspenseful thriller, this is highly recommended.
