I think this movie is a very funny movie and one of the best 'National Lampon' films, it's also a very interesting Spoof title, which actually collects the whole part of the whole film. The story is a wonderful event in several films including Will Smith's film, as you might have said, 'black in men'. I can not give up in the end but ultimately it's very funny (Leslie Nilsen Style Humor) has started, especially when you have collected dust in your street (Garbage Can). Also, there are very nice dusty lorries (Garbage collection trucks) in that scene. Acting is not uncommon, in fact, it is not very good, but this is the film's fun, it's a comedy, upgraded !! I love the story line, partly partly and it is partly because it is fine (or it should be illogical), because it closes all the other films. I'm a big fan of anti-social spoof films, but I'm also a real fan, and it's hard to determine which is good with these movies, it's a largely closed film (I've mentioned this review before) or it's a real movie, but when you're actually one of the comedy movies Fooled, it actually makes it even more difficult, but this movie successfully closes it. Two garbage men are so funny, it reminds me of a TV sketch show called 'Little Britain' in the UK. This movie is a must for your collection and is the best, most entertaining, fun, best story, date of national lamps!
