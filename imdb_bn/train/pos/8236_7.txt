Due to the "Domestic Caller" discovery, meat consumption is brought under control and becomes productive member of society; However, they perform menial work. In the 1950s, among the survivors of the US, the deaths of Sheryl made small towns, while the unfinished body was roaming "The Wild Zone". Pre-teenager K'sune Ray (Timmy Robinson) parents Carey-Anne Moss and Dylan Becker (as Helen and Bill Robinson) live in "Willard" town. Well, Robinson is the only family in their street, who is not a zombie owner; Their new neighbors, Bottoms, has six. So, to maintain, Robinson got Jimmy Billy Connolly (as ido). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Mr. Connolly's "Domain Calling" is damaged by an old lady's walk, and she eats it; Then, new and hungry zombies infest in the city. Meanwhile, the young judge has been associated with Connolly (the boy and his Jimmy TV's "Timy and Lacey") and Robinson's family seems difficult to cooperate with the control of the "Zumk" authority. <br /> <br /> "Fido" can not go so far in his own playful "Wild Zone"; However, it is a colorful, stylish, and amusingly awe-inspiring zombie film boyfriend. Ray and cast separately, perform well; Nubail Jambe Sonja Bennett (as Tammy) and Malik Tim Blake Nelson (as Theoplice) is the most memorable pair. The crew, with director Andrew Curry and Kru, Rob Gray (design), John Kays (photography), Don McDonald (music) and James Wilcock (design), won the prize wins. <br /> ****** * Fido (2006) Andrew Curry ~ Kay'soon Ray, Keri-Ani Moss, Billy Connolly, Dylan Baker
