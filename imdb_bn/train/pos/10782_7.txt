Michael Stevens Michael, a sexually disappointed person with an interesting moral attitude towards sex. There is no problem with nude dancers but when they start sex with men they lose. She believes that when women are actually sex, they lose any sense of "innocence" and / or "beauty". So she wandered through Hollywood couple Hollywood Hills through love couple, finally shooting dead with a high-powered rifle with an opportunity. <br /> <br /> The primary primary reason for the existence of this film is sexuality over and over again. A "story" comes off as a further consideration. Many happy heterosexual men are very happy as we are sexually motivated to act as a prolonged vision of nudity (women look very good sans clothes here) and sex as a major dimension. Of course, through a scope it shows a fair agreement, the crying factor illustrates sufficient amounts and obedience towards visibility. (On one hand, Mike gives chance to couples for a few minutes before finally pulling the trigger.) If it is a bit of atmospheric music in the soundtrack covered heavily by the intruder. <br /> <br /> The lurid was forced to enjoy one or two degrees in the legendary trash for the trash. It has a lazy test that confuses Mike and responds to him uncertain *. It unfolds at a very slow pace, but one wraps up with the most ridiculous satire. It's a weird and distorted annoyance that can definitely obscure some viewers on the screen. <br /> <br /> 7/10
