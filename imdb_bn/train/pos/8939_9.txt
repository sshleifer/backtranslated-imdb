One of the best-selling books about life of two "colored" sisters, and a strong adaptation of Sm√•s Broadway, over 100 years of life in the life of Besti and Sadie Delaney. Wonderfully played by their old age Ruby D and Dianne Carroll. , They call their stories Amy Hill Herbert (played by Amy Madinon) in flashbacks, a white New York Times reporter. Like flashbacks and books in the current day, they do not have much inspirational value, but really strong. However, the reasons behind some of the life of sisters, such as the inter-ethnic background of their mother and the strong personality of their father, are not clearly presented. You need to read this book to fully understand the books. That's just as good as the book, just as great! Along with those flaws, it has been done wonderfully and performed, especially D & Carol and a very powerful and educational movie.
