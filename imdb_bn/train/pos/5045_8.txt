How full is this film, it constantly keenly wakes up childhood with flashbacks, and growing up with such a wicked father and engaging with a series of carnivals, it completely replenishes completely, not just making a mistake. The very plot in itself, the very story and essence of the film, is entertaining. This is a story that can do a lot with Director (Bill Paxton), and in this case, he really did a lot with it. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end you will be more than expected and what is going on and where the film is going, and behind this story is creativity first class. I felt that this film was supplemented from the beginning to the end and one of the rare gems that seemed to be without any annoying lulls - the action flows rapidly, quickly and in the next scene in one scene. <br /> <br /> It shows people how far they can go: so that their loved ones can do such terrible things and do bad things when they behave in the name of 'God'. in this case. It sometimes takes the idea of ​​attractive and completely ethical ideas in her twists. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a film that simply ignores, but I recommend you to do the same thing and check out this film - it is very valuable for you.
