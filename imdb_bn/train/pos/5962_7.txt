From years of rubbish like "Tournament of excursion" from funny funny gems like "Slurar Party Killings 2", I have seen "Fear of the Fear of the 80" years. Somehow I managed to keep putting one of these, which is strange because it is probably the most popular and well received one. Well, I've finally caught up with it and it's easily the most awesome (but almost always respectful!) Subject's best. The plot (most of the pictures taken in the "Black Roses" movie) was worried about a blended muffattie called Edy, who ridiculed everyone for his taste in high school music. He loves metal 80, especially his statue Sammy Carr (played by late Great Tony Fields.) After Sammi died, Eddie's favorite Radio DJ gave him the final recording of Sammy. Once Eddie played in the back of the record, he discovered that he was somewhat difficult, and the bad things started to mock him. Sammyir songs have reduced? "Trick or Treatment" is well made and total hoot. Special effects are awesome, although it usually has features of 80s laser beams. I grew up in the 80's, and when I'm not a heavy metal fan, I have heard the sound of Satan's words, I remember urban legend. Ha ha I remember that both my older brothers and neighbors have been saying that both KISS and OG have worshiped Satan, so both of them are a harmful radio DJ and very interesting to see Kyoma as an anti-rock cleric. If only I would see this photo as a child! Although popular in the 80's, the popular connection between Satan worship and heavy metals seems to be funny, but the audience did not really find why Sammy was back from Kara's dead and killed anyone who went on his way. This is the weakest point in the movie, but if you can ignore it, it loads fun.
