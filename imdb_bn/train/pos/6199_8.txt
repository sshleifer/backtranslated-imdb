Some people who follow and follow Hartley's public work for years, think that the genre of fiction through a real story has grown into vague philosophical mind games. <br /> <br /> While entertaining, Fei Grim is another step towards Henry's flowerline, where the film itself reflects the quality of an object in the film. Henry Phule, the object memorabilia ... in Faye Graeme, the object is encrypted memorials - which can steal, fake and transform into anything that does not actually create any sense - that means the process of script writing and writing in modern times - where most blockbusters Films are a bit more than a past mash-up. That is, in a philosophical sense, what is the Fai Grim? The object, perhaps, is the tragedy that the shock is now clich√© and lazy (indicated in open scenes in the publisher's office). <br /> <br /> It is not understood that Henry's character and memory are lost, most of the movie's top points lost. Henry is a thinly printed devil, the first to visit Simon as a modern fawst. Etc. Without understanding the extent of Henry's character, most of the Fai Grym's plot and the story's lost. <br /> <br /> Enough 'detail' published by oral flashbacks - Henry Flower's plot can not compare the 'feeling' of character quality like Henry's flower with intelligent and so I think that anyone who is cold in this movie is about 10 minutes <br /> <br /> <br /> Henry's flower was not my favorite hearty movie until I realized that it was bad - nasty and oppressed - just because of Re flowers confession was not bad ... just messy or dirty, but inevitably broken. Henry may not even be perfect villains - and perhaps this tragic error that makes him the most loved .... Like in the work of Tokio, Henry is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> It is not seen in Faye, though Henry's dialog is nice. What's happening is that the whole movie is made as an encryption - another kind of artwork for adding Henri's confession is a kind of molding of another plot with the end of the story. This is an interesting package, but which can not be truly positioned without seeing the first movie. Perhaps Henry is being shown more than ever before, the publisher was better than describing the original story of the first film - even though this film was not really the first movie - unless it is perhaps a casual observer. <br /> <br /> is part of the encryption? Say hard ... though a little disappointed at sexual gimmicks. Bunny
