This series is the premiere of the US cable TV station "Comedy Central". It is cut dead, and the sequence is shown. It was tragic for the audience that it should not have been attracted, it did not go astray. Thankfully, at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC. Thanks, because I found the "Gentlemen's League" to be completely and void. <br /> <br /> "The League of Gentleman" is in England with "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and Canada's "The Kid's In the Hall". But..a alert. <br /> <br /> "Gentleman's League" though one step beyond. It is not only for capturing the seas and illuminating the cultural suppression, it is deep and much, very dark. I can say many of you now - it will blame some group of people, it will burn others. But remember, his only comedy..Dark, dark comedy. If it's not your thing, do not watch. If you know the dark comedy then check it out - if you are angry and annoyed, then you do not know the dark completely. <br /> <br /> These guys are okay, and on the right hand button. They are bright, they are nice and I enjoyed the creation of each letter. There is a whole story called here from the episode one to the end. You can not see this one episode at one time, Willy Nilly, one of the charms of this series. So see it. See how these guys are creative and stylish and deeply. There is no one and nothing out of bounds. That is, my dears are "dark humorous". Say!
