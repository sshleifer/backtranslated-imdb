I am really surprised how much work has been done in the movie on the Kamblyn Genocide. A major documentary, not very confusing. Fortunately, we won by Ben Koko's talent, which was pointing to Zero Day, and Gus Van Sant who was equally good elephant. There are two different concepts on the incident, the general idea is that the genocide of genocide will always be a mystery, in the end it is a bit annoying and unknowable about the motivation of two killers, and in reality what it took to conceive in the terrible reality of imagination. Zero Day, created by the appropriate creator, made of videotap and found after the event, is absolutely riveting. Even if you know where it's going but you're still optimistic that it will not "go there" ... and the tension between the final minutes of the movie is exciting. The film is also excellent from two leading actors and supporters, from top to bottom, from the director to the script (not too much improvement, although it seems very spontaneous). Zero Day is the only outlook that bothers me. All right, so we can not disarm so why the monks will do their job, but the contributors must definitely have their ANGER. Yet these boys do not really feel angry. They might say they might say something, but in reality they did not believe me that there was something in them that forced them to kill innocent people. But this is still me "why ???" In the sense that the director Coccio wants me to have However, rent or buy this movie, it will tremble over you and stay with you for a long time. People with Blair could only succeed in creating a scathing documentary for such people.
