Brief summary <br /> <br /> This image is released from the company's release with men. One of them pursued another with a strange plan and repeatedly denied it. Later, they were stuck in both office buildings, where they wanted to crack during the Christmas holidays safely. Enemy curiosity becomes a mockery and then in a deadly fight to survive (during the inactivity, they reduce all drinkable liquids, so it is really serious). With open, well-built and well-oiled Torsos they ram a hole in a wall and finally managed to escape ?? Only they have been betrayed and find out women set up. One gets caught, the other is free and his partner does not release him. One last face, the last light for cigarettes, Adi L'ami, goodbye, friend. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> I do not see the closet in two main characters, the classical O-Man Superstars Allen Dellon and Charles Birston. They are obviously attracted to each other, their treatment is characterized by hatred and whole contempt of women. The whole story sounds like a powerful symbolic undertow, a little distant. It's very stylish. Want to cut two men safe ?? For the time ?? The ultra modern glass and aluminum tower. It is a promo organization seat, so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around. The dress is very good. Extremely stylish Citroine DS (probably the most modern and elegant car of all time) Does this film have a lot of features? Probably a fine type of product placement. <br /> <br /> I can recommend this movie for actor's acting. Dellon and Bronson are really sharing top billing, in such a way that I hit me as a fight and sport. Not a significant amount of both acrobatics. I did not see Bronjon better here, he really works - and spoke all the time in French, bought loudly loudly. And of course we humans hear ourselves. (So ​​the French language version is highly recommended). Following the police inspector two, my favorite French character, actor Bernard Frausson, was the partner of Jean Hackman, the second in French connection. He knows the best intelligent police inspector. Little child actress Brigitte Fosse is also very good, like a young horn, who came out of it, is not as innocent as the first. <br /> <br /> Does anyone expect? Outstanding In-Out-Out ". Classical Haest films can be frustrating with this film. It will be a rewarding experience with a little patience and full of real sense and director story, although it is very harmful and sad to myself.
