It's singing. It's a drama. It's a comedy. This is a story. It's one of the greatest movies ever made ... period. If you can not enjoy this movie then you have to be asleep or have some kind of mental disorder. In "Yankee Doodle Dandy", James Cagney sang and walked the Academy Award; But he is good in this movie! This James Cagney is his perfect best! He is fast with one liners! He is fast with his feet! It's nonstop action. And the songs-and-dance skits are classic, especially "Shanghai Lil." And the pro cast is great; And the whole movie exudes bright, fast moving, and confidence. And although this movie was made more than 70 years ago, it is still worth watching. And of course, this film features Miss Ruby Keller (who has married Al Jolson). He is the perfect partner of James Cagney and Dick Powell! If you like ambitious, fast-packed movies, with lots of music and dance, watch this movie.
