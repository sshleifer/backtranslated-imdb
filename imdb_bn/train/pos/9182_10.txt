Those who like Zen Zen Eye I like books (this is my favorite of all time, and I read it at least once a year) will love this version. Timothy Dolton is very pleased to be Mr. Rochester, but he also did a great job by illustrating Thoroughfield's Bruding Master. Jella Clark was very young with 18 years of age, but when I look at this movie, I do not think of the age of characters. The dialogue from the film is often acceptable from the book, which was very smart. Sure, this movie might seem a bit longer, but I saw it as the only version that included Part 3 of the story. <br /> <br /> I want this movie to be made in the new Jeffrele version, this is a film that helped mess. <br /> <br /> I saw this video that I finally realized that Judy Cornwall played "Aunt Reid"! He is so versatile that I could not recognize him. He plays Daisy in the look up, and has played Mrs. Musgrove in the 1995's presentation (another wonderful adaption). <br /> <br /> Update: This week got the DVD, and the original unedited version is uncommon to see. There's more to do at the beginning (GateSheed and Loud A Young Jane.) And in the end, they've restored a lot of things, (I've always wondered why St. John had a slip of papers when he revealed that he knew that Jane - Tears from his painting that was edited from the US VHS edition!). Rosemund Oliver It ... He was completely cutting VHS. As far as I can say, they did not perform some part of Timothy Dalton, so there is nothing new here, but in these years of enjoying VHS, it is very good to see the complete miniatures completely. Thanks, the BBC (PS ... I've paid more for a special edition DVD ... maybe some interviews with him ... or for making shows)
