I have had meaning to see this glimpse of the past few months. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of them is constantly blamed for killing Marty after he is burned. A few years later, helpless teenagers were invited to return to their high school. Party However, one helpless teenager did not organize this group. <br /> <br /> Through the film, thirteen young people are most seriously killed in potential ways. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, however, Marty was hospitalized with severe burns. Although the murder did not happen, the shining and the trick appeared apparently. <br /> <br /> The actress is terrible but okay. <br /> <br /> I like the story. I really sympathize with Marty. It's like Tamara (2005). Bullys are finally coming to them and have been pleased to get their sweet revenge on the victim. <br /> <br /> If you search for 80 seconds slash I will strongly recommend this proposal to anyone. <Br> <br /> I give 10 of the 10 stars in this movie. Good Chess Slash!
