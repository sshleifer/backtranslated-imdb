Among the silent movies of the 1940s and 1950s, it was weird, and considered to be the most fun to watch. I said that the four main actors: Osson Wells, Rita Haven, Everton Sloane and Glenn Anders <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < His character, "George Gersby", is the most weirdest man ever seen in the film. His voice, and he said something would be believed to be heard. Slaone is not much behind the "weird" section. Heyevert is small, blonde is not as attractive as hair, but still is Whitworth, which means that if you are a man, there is a lot of rush. Wales' are as interesting as always. One tip: If you have a DVD, turn on the English subtitles. Your character in this movie is an Irishman and needs your subtitle to understand what he has said. <br /> <br /> Wells also managed the image, which means you have large camera angles and amazing facial closeups. You have a unique finishing, visually, with a shootout at a home in the mirrors. Great stuff! As intimidated as this movie, I still end up in justice, like the BFF-like carnival atmosphere was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene. Any other, no complaints. <br /> <br /> This is great entertainment, the name of the game.
