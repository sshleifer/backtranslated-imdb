It's all about Mitzi. I liked her in this. And he does not look fantastic?! I love this Lifetime Sunday afternoon Popcorn movie. It's like nailbits where they always go commercially at the most annoying times. Richard's character was completely surprising. I've got boys like that date. Well, that's not like lol. I could not kill Jack! She was a cutie and the eyes were very easy. I love the story of this stalker type. It always makes sure to get me and lock my door. My husband usually does not like this kind of movie, but he is actually sitting with the whole thing with me and actually enjoyed it. I can not wait what Miji does next!
