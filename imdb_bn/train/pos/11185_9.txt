As this would be one of the most favorite novels, I was very excited to see the steps. I was not frustrated! Of course I can choose a few things, but I think the film is trapped near the real book and it was really a good movie. It seems that Stephen King films mostly get bad reviews, but it's one of the best. It's such a dark story, which I guess is why I like it .. and what's better than the dead ... and something wonderful about the animals coming back from the grave. If you have seen the movie with your eyes and now read the book !! This is a well-written screen game, the actors can do a good job. (I only call Rachel, and Eli .. She was very impressive.) I like everyone else .. And most important to me .. It's stuck. The truth with the novel
