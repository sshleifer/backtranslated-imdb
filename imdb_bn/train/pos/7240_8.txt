If I find this movie on my local vioidostore, I hope it will be another Chasey American Vampire film in the same vein of "The Lost Boys" (1987). To get my surprise, "Tight Dye For" is a really good movie. It's a little occasionally corny, but still quite stylish set piece and satisfying gorgeous vampire enthusiasts. It's a perfect mix of romance and horror and surprisingly gory at times. Highly recommended.
