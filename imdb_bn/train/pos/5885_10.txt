This movie is pretty impressive to me I did not have very high expectations for it but I was wrong. Mary & Roda were very funny and well written. They have spent too much time repeating the past so they do not depend on the success of the old TV show carrying the movie. <br /> <br /> My girlfriend commented that it might be less than a weekly seat and I think I can agree with her.
