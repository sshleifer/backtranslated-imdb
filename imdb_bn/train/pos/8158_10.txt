"Black Hat Fear" should be everything (very weak) "CB-4" Rusty Cundieff's ironic eyes are ruthless, she mutilates every aspect of folds, spindles, and hip hop trends and cultures. Is the "FoaBH" spinal tap similar? Yes a bit. Is it derivative to spine the tip? Not really. The goal is more focused, the taunting is well focused, and to be honest, it's funnier.
