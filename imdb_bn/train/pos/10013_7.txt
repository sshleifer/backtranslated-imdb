Like one of the previous commentators, this was the basis of a great film, but there was some way to distribute. Colette performance was very bad and Williams was believable. I keep waiting for it to get better. I do not need bad editing or other directors, it could just be a film. It has been added as a Canadian movie, like the first few seasons of X-files. Not cheap, just hokey Also, it requires a little more doubt. Something that gives you jump to your seat. The film reached that moment, then it was erased; Kind of false climax. I can see how far away from being suspicious of the "reality" of the story, but I used to think that Gabriel was in the hospital when the section was looking for the boy. The director of this movie needs to be cut, trying to solve this problem.
