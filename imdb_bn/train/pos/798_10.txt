This amazing play filled me with mystery all the time. I could not close my eyes for a second screen because every word has a piece attached to this harmful murder. This movie really touched me because it shows how sad and difficult life can be. I really cried (I do not want to give!) That gives me a sense of how cruel and sick people might be when they were killed. <br /> <br /> Cast was very good. Actor Annie Mary was the only bad actor. Actress did a great job, but not the director. I say it because he has found someone who did not see a bit like Anne Marie Fayei.
