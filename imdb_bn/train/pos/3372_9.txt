After his recent passage, while paying tribute to the great Charton Hesson, this picture is not the same. His previous films were Ben Hoor, The Tay Commandants, Omega Man, and the Apps Planet. He did a better job. <br /> <br /> This image was created in 1973, in 2022, the future of Earth's prediction efforts. Mankind's made mankind has been given a "eatable green" food to eat a universally produced food that has been used by mankind. This malicious and impossible film was ridiculous during the Liberation War and now the Indian population will be estimated which will be roughly 2 billion, after eating it will eat meat. <br /> <br /> This character is a secret international conspiracy that powers the world to use cannabalism to meet the nutritional needs of a large population. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the green message they provide for the producers of this film is not a Green Party in today's culture, thanks to the Creator. Cancer was practiced by indigenous people in New Zealand, Fiji, and Borneo, just 40 years before the film's creation, but has long been abandoned by human civilization. <br /> <br /> Another stupid prediction in this movie, when the film was created in 1972, the raudalized feminism turned around and became a sex mate surrounded by tide of feminism. <br /> <br /> This picture was stupid and is now stupid, but it is a very unusual ending film, late and great Edward G. There is no valid reason to revisit another movie, except Robinson, but still because of academic reasons. <br /> <br /> This is a movie ugly and I will not recommend it to kids boomers or fans of Charlton Heston. All other reviews of this movie I've read all the words referring to a Dostpyian society in the future, where the central theme seems to be involved only in the United States, where an environmental disaster has occurred. <br /> <br /> The film is confronted with overpopulation of the world's only qualification.
