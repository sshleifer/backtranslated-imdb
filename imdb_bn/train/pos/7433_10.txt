Christmas came to Christmas 1976 when my mother took me to see this movie. I like it now and now I like it. I know everyone makes fun of this hair again, but I think he looks great! ... and it seems that these women have shown a number of women at that time! Also, the bath tub scene between Streissand and Christopherson is so sexy! Music is good as well. This summer 70's is the best of her kids!
