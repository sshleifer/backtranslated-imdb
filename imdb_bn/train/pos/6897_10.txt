It was released in France on DVD several years ago - I want it to be republished with English subtitles. Do not confuse it with a remake with Penelope Cruz, which gets a poor review. Gerard Phillippe is a farmer who is told by a lucky Taylor that he will marry the king's daughter. He went to war to join the army. Her love, however, is for Gina Lolabrgrida in an elementary movie for her. I will not waste the end Gerard Phillipp died a few years after his young age, a great loss for Movidom.
