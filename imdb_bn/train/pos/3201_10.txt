This is an early film "Pilot" for the Canadian TV show Trailer Park Age. Before the showcase decided to sign up for a TV series, it played executives on some networks. It is made up of extraordinary performances and a very interesting custom made in the best civilized comedy films. The film plot is that these two short-term criminals go away by "eliminating" domestic animals for money. If you have a dog door next to you, all night goes around, then these boys will go! But when they face a job they have problems and they end up in a shootout. If you want to understand the beginning of the TV series, check out this movie. I highly recommend! <br /> <br /> By the use of Violence and Drug R R <br /> <br /> This is not very aggressive (they do not actually appear deadly animals)
