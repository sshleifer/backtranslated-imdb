So many educational films are nothing but psychological pains, but only "MST3 K" scoffs ("Why Study Industrial Arts?") "Hemo the Magnificent" is actually done quite well. It's all about blood, heart, and convection systems. I admit that I do not remember everything from here, but it's a serious job, explains everything, it keeps it serious but entertaining. I can always rely on June Faroe (Most famous Rocky The Skier's voice, he plays a deer here). Since "humo magnificent" can be difficult to find yourself, it is probably the best place to look at "Gremlins": A grailin is formed when a class is watching it.
