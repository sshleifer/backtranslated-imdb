This is the greatest television movie of all time! What am I saying because I'm a huge silverstone fan? Partly, but besides that, I still want to see it. I am a fan of serial killer genre films, and believe in this section as a great entry. Also, Mary Giordano is easily among the top five characters of Alicia. Completely memorable - like he really exists. I was beside him, too, if a mystery has been resolved. She plays the character with her real life, with full confidence in what she does. Sweet, honest, beautiful ... It seems he's in real life. So played? Yes, indeed, he is again a rebel type. This time he is not bad, he is very well and afraid to do something that seems above the law. But he does not do the usual teenage thing to do. Instead, he read intelligence mags during his time and resolved the crime. A cliche of plenty: he revenge his father's death, a different way than sorting-style. At that time, Alicia started playing the same characters: rebellious, seductive, without a parent, a man. It will also happen here, but this time it's a bit silly. That does not matter; He still calm down as an inferior. Check it out soon, otherwise Giordano will investigate why you do not ...
