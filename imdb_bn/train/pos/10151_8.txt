New York is a beautiful postcard. The thing that I enjoyed most was able to see it with my whole family and was not waiting for a fool to show humorous jokes. It never did. My teenagers liked it. My son for Natasha Henstritz and my daughter for Michael Worton. My wife and I commented that we could not remember that we could sit with the kids and enjoy everything. This image is a story which is comfortable but old or full. The last came with a twist which we all liked very much. If you're not just a cruel person and want to publish a story, it's for you. When it happens with a romantic movie, it takes a lot to keep my interest as a person. I recommend it and we need more of these movies to watch.
