Like Jefferson, Good Times was one of the classic American sitcoms that had never been broadcasted in the UK, it was published in the decade of the decade - a decade where I was not yet born. <br /> <br /> Like most fans of the show, I saw you a few episodes in the tube - and later I like it. <br /> <br /> Evans family is headed by James and Florida- two parents are trying to finish, and those who encourage their children, despite their lack of qualifications, who have their own longing for life to meet them and take their chances. James was a harsh but loving father, J. Did not hesitate to punish J., Michael and Thelma - did they want to cross the line? While Florida was comparatively mild and gentle mother and loving wife with contrast, though she was in many ways like James from the perspective of African-American perspective with her attitude towards parents and family values. <br /> <br /> Like Jupiter's parents were lively and entertaining: JJ was an ambitious artist with an impressive personality and humorous style, who often dressed in many colors and whose 'die-note-mite' achard Jackson's 'HowTo Talk' is Infected and Known Like Bell Willis? Different Strokes Michael was a smart-alike who dreamed of being a lawyer, although sister Thelma had her own dreams and hopes. His oral taunts with JJ were mostly sunny, as was the love / hate relationship between brothers and sisters, which was played extremely well by both Mike Evans and Barnett Stanis. <br /> <br /> On the Season, there was a presence of several cameras, especially Jacket Jackson, Debbie Allen and a young Gary Colman himself! I really like the Good Times, not saying that the Cosky Show, which was an 80's show, because I loved the Evans family on Hooksbills, a) in terms of characteristic and b) I think it's serious and difficult Has tackled social issues, a way that resonated with many viewers. It was a comedy, but it was a social commentary that in America America, African Americans observed to highlight the lives of African Americans. The Kosby show tried to communicate with mainstream viewers with a 'candy coat' approach, because the Huxettels were portrayed as Blacks, which enriched themselves in high-class American culture, which we would add to the White, where there is more to it than the Good Times. Was not afraid to address 'edgier' and themes like drug and child abuse in a realistic way. I really see that Cosky shows sometimes fun, but it's not a little too naive to have a good time, and as a result it has become prone and cooler. <br /> <br /> The show jumped the shark during the next period, due to the continuation of John Amos' character, James died in a scary accident (in reality, it was reported that John gave good times to good times and therefore, the cause of his character's death It was a show). Without the guy, the event is suffering and, unfortunately, it has lost many of its curiosity. <br /> <br /> Still, for the sitcom, the Good Times ticked the box all right. If they showed it in the UK only in the 80's. As it is, it will be done as JJ, 'DY-NO-MITE !!' <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 and one and a half
