This movie is my favorite one. This is a custom mix of action / horror-romantic / / component components. Some special effects may seem older than modern standards. These minor errors are easily ignored. There are a lot of discoveries in this story. The romantic relationship between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts. The visual is very beautiful This work is amazing, which is not frustrating, it came from the birthplace of Hong Kong's best action films in the world. Humor sometimes feels a little wretch but is a good way. Somehow this movie is able to keep the balance of various moods and good ones. Certainly recommend
