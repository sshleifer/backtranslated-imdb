Yes I would say before starting the comment, this movie is incredibly underlying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is an analyst sent to assess her after a sports star's death. Glass is a seductive game that uses Trimelel to use his mind. <br /> <br /> was good acting (without thalis) <br /> <br /> Stone really has a talent with this role. She is not sticky, naughty and seductive and looks a day older than she did on the first day. She really influenced me (as in casinos). Morris was good. A role that he needed showed a lot vunerablitity. Thalis were hair instead. He destroyed his character and was completely upstairs. She really sucked. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is not like the first but a hot watch to watch the Stone. Just ignore Thwlis
