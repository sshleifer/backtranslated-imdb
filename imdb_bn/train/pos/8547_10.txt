Many people hate this movie, but I blame the two things - 1 - They want to be more like the first couple of American pie movies. And 2 - They are trying to take it very seriously. <br /> <br /> I found the six best, and I absolutely like dive. Plot is predictable, I say it, but then what is a teenager comedy? Road trips, dirty works etc., they are all incredibly predictable, but still interesting fun! I think it's worth it, I love it, I find it pleasing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stiflers Which is fine by me See <br /> <br /> Enjoy. Love xD
