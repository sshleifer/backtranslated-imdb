His colleagues find out who works in the shop, that he is going to have a virgin while playing a sexually filled poker, and then go through funny fun like Andy, which is the absurdity of indecent sexual awakening, but always looking at him can not lose his virginity , But is very fortunate to the end. <br /> <br /> Leave the little boys home, but let the whole family see this wonderful romantic adult comedy. This will attack you very craving and cracking, and after finishing it, you will want to wear your extra thick dry linen underwear. The only other thing I can tell about it is that Steve Carroll was not recognized as a leftover man 20 years ago. In the MTV Movie Awards next year, he must definitely achieve the best success.
