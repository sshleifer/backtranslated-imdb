Effectively impossible to describe this movie. Alternative title "Do Look Up" is a lot more descriptive. Like most Japanese films, the story is not linear as American. The story surrounds a director who is drawing a story about a ww2 deserter. Suddenly the set? (?) An actress who died (?) During the filming of the TV show in the 60's. The director saw this show is only one. If you look at Rinku (director Hadda Nakata is the same) and like, you like the ghost actress. I love the ghost actress a lot. A really scary and annoying movie. A 10!
