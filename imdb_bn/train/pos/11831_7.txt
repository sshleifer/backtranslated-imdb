Despite the fantastic and exciting animations, it is probably one of the most inspiring Disney movies I've ever seen, and I often do not slam Disney movies. The soul is a wild stallion, which is repeatedly captured by the Turtles or Indians, both of which try to "break" them. The soul ends up forming a bond with Indians, and that, briefly, the story. Except for the beautiful animations of horses, I or my five-year-old film was not very inspired or excited. It is ironic that it is the title of "soul", as if the soul could use this picture a little more. Corresponding with the songs of Brian Adams and Hans Geimmer, an extra point was given for the soundtrack. And although this movie has been rated gif, you probably have to interpret the "horse breaking" of five years old. I did. <br /> <br />
