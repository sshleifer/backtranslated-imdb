ANCHORS AWEIGH is an entertaining MGM musical that fans of the genre will enjoy but I will not evaluate it with the classics like Rena or band wagon. Jean Kelly and Frank Sinatra are the first songs of three songs present together. Kelly and Sinatra played Joe Brady and Clarence Doolit on two holidays in Hollywood holidays, who made friends with a young boy (Dean Stockwell), who acted as an extraordinary actress in MGM for their attractive young aunt (Catherine Grayson) Have been known as. Although both boys initially attracted Graceon, eventually he likes Joe, but Clarence later hooks up with Waitress (Pamela Britton), who he learns from his village Brooklyn. The paper-thin plot places the room for a number of great musical numbers, including "we hate", Joe and Clarence's tomb as they leave the ship to their fellow crew; Warm presentation of Grace's "Jazz" Sinaatra's "I Fop In Love Too Easy" (This number is sadly deleted from some print) and "The Wiri song", a fabulous dance that works with animated Jerry Mouse from Kelly Tom and Jerry's fame. . Kelly is also a kiss bandit fantasy ballot, which later competes in her pirate ballet at Perett. Kelly is at the top here, a strong and energetic performance that makes her the only Oscar nomination for Best Actor, and surprisingly shy character in Sinat, here's a sexy sexy. An entertaining diversion for fans of MGM Musical Factory.
