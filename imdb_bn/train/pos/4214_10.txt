I have seen that the best film Noirs of the Best of seven Sam Fuller movies (Park Row, Run of the Arrow, Warboten !, Shock Corridor, The Naked Kiss, The Big Red, and this film) It represents its most controlled flowerery. I loved him when he was out of control, of course, but the pickup was almost perfect for almost everything. The film is absolutely beautiful. Richard Wyommark is a cockpocket star who steals some microfilms that go to communist spies. Richard Kelly has played the role of Jean Pieters, the woman carrying this film for her boyfriend. Peter Widmark is forced to find and get it back. He found him through a stunt foot operated by Thelma Ritter. Witmark and Peters are attracted to each other, which alters Peters's loyalty (that, and he is learning that he is working for communists; Shawn War stuff is really interesting). The story of love is very fast and not quite credible, but it is not so bad that it damages the film (in contrast to Fuller's previous film Park Park). Richard Widmark is great. This must be his best role, but I'm not so familiar with his career that I can definitely say that. Thelma Ritter gives the most memorable performance. Her role rendered unexpected emotional resonance to the film, and her final scene in this film is like any touch found in the movie. I will never forget it 10/10.
