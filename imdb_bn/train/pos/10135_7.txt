What started out as a very expected and somewhat shit affair is quite pleasurable and entertaining. "Right to Die" is not very suspicious, but it's more than just creating some unexpected set pieces and with the top Gore. Here <br /> <br /> Top credits go to the death - Martin Donovan is one of the most hateful characters to satisfy the screen. Playing the role of a great "miracle" fashion, its grand plan finally fails when you finally feel bad for the man. Corbin Burnson is also a very good guy who chews up the scenes playing a very good guy. <br /> <br /> End of Spoiler. <br /> <br /> As a revenge - the dead flick, "Right to Die" is a great way to get benefits from its employees and more than one hour.
