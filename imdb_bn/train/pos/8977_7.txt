It rarely gives 4 ratings as a movie, but it will often be seen for fans of the 1940s movie and will rate nine as different shows! In the presence of Richard (Captain Midnight) Web, I played Colonel in charge of this event. Darcy Day's stunning performance makes me amazed. Out of 'Accident Jane', I've never seen him better than a song here. Randolph Scott is memorable even if he does not see much screen time. Seeing Hugh Baughter's appearance I was sure that I saw this movie a while later. With many familiar faces, it is difficult to keep track. If this is a TV station near you, do not forget to take the Doris Day sequence without any other! <br /> <br />
