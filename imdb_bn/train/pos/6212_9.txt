Despite being deliberately at least 'smooth' compared to other Fred and Gada movies, I love this film deeply, not to mention the little problem welding of Harriet Hilard in the lead romantic role. <br /> <br /> Again, with these movies, the plot is a tiny event - Astaire is an unexpected sailor (which could be a great former hoofer (of course!)) and Rogers is an aspiring actor seedy dime-a-dance music. Although their relationship is brilliant and fun to watch, they are frustrated by the incomplete original story of Hillield and Randolph Scott, which did not succeed in finding any chemistry among them. <br /> <br /> Although it was a last-minute decision, Hillward expressed such anger because she did not have the screen to give the picture, which is sweet and desired even though she needs it. The lucid player's advertised cricketer can benefit the film from simply illustrating the character of Brassi simply as a major role, and in this bright film Rogers can make Helen Broader-type side-kick. For an example of the wonderful scenes between these two superb actresses, see the 'Stage Door' made next year). The one-dimensional negligible character of Scott has finally fallen in love with Hellyard, harder than the existence of the ship than in faith! <br /> <br /> Now singing and dancing in important parts: Bright and moving and completely executed as well as "Let's face music and dance" is nothing more and I often see that scene in my eyes tears With But some of the other songs in the film deserve recognition; "I'm putting all my eggs in a basket", a beautiful example of Astaire and Rogers's curiosity, and almost spontaneously, making fun of their reputation bursting in perfectly synchronized dances. Other highlights are "I Want The Band" The Band "and" Let It Run Yourself "shows how these two geniuses can work together all together. I almost forgot to mention that these few (if not only) the time we see Astaire brilliantly playing the piano; It seems that this man's talent was endless! <br /> <br /> Overall, I like it at 'Top Hat' and 'Swing Time' (though only), because it is much more like soil and encouraged by everyone involved. It's hard to dislike the fun factor.
