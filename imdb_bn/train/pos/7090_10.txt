A linear tour in a non-linear structure. It is a fact that during the 12 monkeys, come into this present, future and past and go. However, the film's linearity can not be avoided: it is very useful for the projector, the story is revealed. <br /> <br /> Reflections on the inevitableity of our actions that we can see in the temporal theme. . This terry gilium movie has little space for a free world in the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning, we are aware of the prediction of a schizophrenic, according to which a plague will rule the earth in 1997, for some survivors to be underground - the only place is not affected by the virus. <br /> <br /> The cleansing of the Will is clear: The virus related to returning to the mid-90s and the release of any person. There is no way to change the past: What can be done is to collect data that can help current scientists (which will be in future for our visitors) to find a future cure. Do not change what happened (inevitably of the past), but make the present better. <br /> <br />, during its "return", gradually comes near a fierce conflict: in the past his life is better in his present life. <br /> <br /> The second is controlled by the dark and stupid, universal scientist that selects "Volunteers" (this sound terrible irony) to start the past journey. <br /> <br /> Scientists still have not reached high levels during travel, and the coils end up on wrong dates - later this plot serves as a proof of its honesty for the psychiatrist Catherine (Stove). <br /> <br /> We see through the evolution of the story, that linearity and non-linearity combine in a circular period. <br /> <br /> More than a moment in which the first and the end of the scene is ending - and of course the climactic - appear. In relation to the release of the memories of the lap, it corrects itself, which comes in its dream. <br /> <br /> A man was shot and shot to someone else at the airport. <br /> <br /> This scene is a scene that connects the past (which is a child visiting the airport with his children in the lap), the present (the time of the times) and the future (adult collan) story, the experience he already enjoys in the lap Feel the feeling. Its prophetic dream has proved that it is impossible to avoid or avoid. That is why the killers prevented him from killing the mad scientist, Dr. Peters (mortal), who is responsible for the spread of this disease. <br /> <br /> What can not be changed. And, in the case of the coils, what was it? <br /> <br /> <br /> A movie does not understand very well for many. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Damage - especially in the second movie - it's more optimistic than gilium's work, it's a weird Hollywood picture. In another article, one of Bergman's best art works is "Wild strawberries", which in the dreams and memories involve past the past with interesting and enlightened journeys of the past. <br /> <br /> I have never seen "La jeti", but I just can not find it.
