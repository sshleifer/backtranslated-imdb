This small film trailer originally worked with Superman and Batman and formed a helpless coalition. Of course, there are different perspectives on how to deal with the crime of two characters and how the punishment can be construed. Trying to see these two symbolic characters get along much fun. I will not int here the story int. But I will get into acting, which is awesome. Everybody is good Two actors playing Casterman and Batman are suitable for their character. They are the same filmmakers that Batman created: Dead End and Grace also created this short film. Among the three, maybe I liked it at least, but I still think it was good. For me, the best 7/10 in the world
