There is no doubt about this movie a perfect 10/10. For those of you who are rating this film for a low quality, because there is no "good plot" or nothing like that, it's funny that Jackie Chan's movie is bad because of its plot because it's bad to say pornography because it's not a plot! Jackie looks for Chan because of war, because it does not focus much on a good story or something like this, if you compare movies with other American movies of the era and even later you realize that Jackie Chan movies were on top of the fight scenes and There was not really a good plot, but there were good plots in American movies Jackie Chan during the shooting action scenes compared to what it was. Looked for porn for porn, Jackie Chan acted for ACTION, I think you do not have any plots because people bad rating it because you think how a smart movie reviewer will rate a good movie but in a way I see it is a movie that is a movie May be courteous. Of course the film was boring in the middle, very annoying, but keep it in mind that all the action scenes and stunts make a lot of money for them. This has changed how American action films have been made, they postpone even the scenes from this movie. If you really want a real entertainer, you see this movie and Jackie Chan's much more, always pure. He literally looks like a American Park Park walk, and even makes todays movies. American cinema special effects and security depends on cable and stunts double and so much more. Police Story and many other Jackie Chan films are genuinely realistic pieces of work that just goes out and is very gifted in what they can do. Have a nice composition
