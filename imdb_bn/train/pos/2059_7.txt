What a fun B movie! Shepis is absolutely beautiful and scarecrow is an individual and original. He brought me back to the monsters of the 80's. The budget is definitely low and not every passin is behind the lens, but it does not matter because it sometimes does not take seriously. From the trailer Trash Redneck to the high-flying martial arts of Squarecraft, it's really a B-movie gem. Hold some refreshments, food and a couple of friends and jump back and relax. I've enjoyed this picture so much that I bought all 3 Scarecrow films. Of course, they are not for everyone, but for everyone. Sometimes you have thought the cap is down and the smile is set.
