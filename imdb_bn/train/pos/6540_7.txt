To be honest, I have to look behind this movie, I do not expect much, but hey, I was not cheated, I had a good time. <br /> <br /> I would say this is a way of filming. Fresh air, despite some of the events that they try to modernize Nancy Drew, reminded the youth of the 60-70s from Europe and Quebec, where they managed to communicate with adults. In this case, a 16-year-old teenager tried to do justice trying to solve a mystery about the actress who died 25 years ago. Since, his father did business in Hollywood, why not rent a house with a mystery behind the door? Well, at least Emma Roberts does a great job here. Like a little little boy like a church, Nancy was initially brought in with support from his sisters' humor, but in the end, it was quiet enough to keep Nancy with him, even on his subject ... <br /> <br /> < The rest of the support cast was left, and at this time, Rachel Leigh Cook Cook was happy to see a different role: single mother (he did it in a family rescue, but this He plays a mature woman ...) Anyway, Don does not cut the pieces, is fun!
