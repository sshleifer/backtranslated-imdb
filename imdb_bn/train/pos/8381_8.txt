I was this young man, because I was young! It's nice Although certain sublets can not explain the movie, but it can be a little more for movie walkers (for example, our hero's name is Achilles, and in the final battle between him and Alexander he fires with heels. Rocket, just as legendary Achilles shoots in his heels. Was done). It's a little bit of fun that's kind of fun! However, great movie, good story, it will be nice to see again with today's special effects! Surprisingly enough, Gary Graham acted in the TVV show Alien Nation, achieved average success. This movie should be a fun watch and more appreciated!
