This picture was absolutely great !!! Each performance in this film is excellent, especially Jake Gyllenhal and Chris Cooper. Looks like Mr. Gilhenhal's career will be a huge film if something happens. I thought Joe Johnston was a curious choice as a director because he was generally associated with big budget blockbusters (Jumanaji, honey I shrink kids). He pulls each scene with sheer class. My favorite scene was that Homer's Mint was going down and looking at the sky, going down, had all his dreams, it was beautiful. Joe Johnston should give further directions to this brilliant, acting-driven film as well as his Big Budget Blockbuster Fire, which is very nice. Glory !! All this involved in this great composition!
