<br /> <br /> There are stars tray canon - lots. From canon we know the history of the future. First communication with technology advancement, events, places, new people, names, dates, etc. <br /> <br /> The enterprise mostly ignores ST canons. An unfortunate event for long time serious fans. As a matter of fact, I guess the producers will look at the first few episodes of TOS and retreat back from there - but no one. <br /> <br /> Phase pistols, much like the technology, look much more modern than the TOS found. An old style sterling laser gun, the effect of a slow gold transmitter transporter - which I expected to see. Also, I did not expect to hear pure beep-based sound effects like TNG or to be away from the TOS sound effects. <br /> <br /> In the first scene of TOS (Real Pilot: CAG), we see a starflight with a more formal military approach - the old world navy. With the entrepreneur, we see a shocking negligence for the rank. Cartoon star blazers have more military code than the enterprise. It is true that Captain Ayers is not sure about the Universe's requirements (there was absolutely no lack of confidence in the use of human rights as Kirk.), but the entrepreneur feels like everyone is equal. Irrelevant, uncertain, far from the feeling of formal military service than a ST series - and it says a lot! <br /> <br /> The theme song of casual domestic music opening begins to move instead of family. The courage of an important big military ship <br /> <br /> The enterprise shows us the most fun, warm-blooded exploration of human relationships rather than the historical, bold, great, high-rickshaw quest. Space. <br /> <br /> I liked playing Adrian Paul Captain and an old man to be a doctor. Yet, I liked the actor in most cases. Boston College's outstanding Bollywood dancer Linda Park is sure to develop nicely. The crew creations seem to be made up of ideas. <br /> <br /> The enterprise has strengthened its run than the last three star tray series. Let's hope for a better future!
