I saw this image as a child at a late-late look and fell in love with it. It took 30+ years, but recently I found the DVD - it was not cheap, either - a catalog of fight films, especially a catalog. We saw this for the first time last night. The audio was good, but it was vane and there was a trailer in the railway. Even so, it was better than I thought it. I am fascinated by seeing the truth of the game. <br /> <br /> Here's the catalog. If you are sincere to find it, then a harmful fire to me and I'll see if you can get the information. cartwrightbride@yahoo.com
