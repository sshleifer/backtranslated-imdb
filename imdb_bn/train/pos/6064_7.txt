I have to start by telling you how you came across this movie. It was winter time in Alaska until 1990. A friend from Australia kept me and my daughter in the apartment's shoes box. Alaskar's winter may be a bit ruthless and most people can stay out of the house, drink plenty and see what comes on television. I found this movie out of a sharp shop kept in a snowstorm and it was immediately a treasure. This is probably the best movie we've seen. We spent the next two weeks watching this movie and drinking it like a week. We have often seen it that we will sometimes remove the television for its side or for a more full fill effect. This is a real jewel. Smile will be lost and memory will last forever. If you see this movie for rent in a video store, steal it. You will not be sorry!
