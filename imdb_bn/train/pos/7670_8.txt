I really enjoyed "Doctor Mordrid". This is a low-budget movie, which can be anything but I have no problem in it. I appreciate it more, it's more entertaining than Hollywood's slowness every year. Very bad this is not a theatrical release; I do not know about anyone else, but I went to see the theater. 'Dr. Morrad' is a very entertaining science fiction film that only anyone can enjoy, especially if they live in science fai. I do not see why this is a rated image; There is only one F-word, and there is no horrible death scene, and there is no blood. Astronomers had an intriguing challenge between Anton and Kabal (Inter-intestination wanted to use his power to protect mankind, the Kambl used to make them slaves), the story gave a wonderful idea, but the mythological scheme attracted the story. Basically, it's a movie that's just fun to watch. There is a strange thing in this movie, though: Jafri combs, who has kept the face of the brazen blue caps and wearing the suit. That makes me smile every time I see it. But I digress ... However, acting is great; The main hero (Anton, and his lady friend, Samtha) are very fond of; Intercontinental, and guests, and friendly companion. Plus, the settings were wonderful. The other levels were very quiet setting in the floating island; Although we are only given a glimpse of it once; It has been great to show more scenes here. The main setting was very clear; The apartment apartment is spacious, and has some great devices, especially the observation system that he uses to keep track of world events. He even has a pet cottage that he puts in his apartment named Adger. Overall, this is a great movie; It was fun to watch, and the main actors make many feelings in their role. If you can rent 'Dr. Merford' anywhere, you have to rent it (or, for me, buy it, it is definitely spent on financing) <br /> <br /> My rating: 10 out of ten stars . <br /> <br />
