I have waited too long to film a true version of HG Wells' classic novel, "War of the Worlds". Timothy Haines Finally It Has Been! I can not believe how good it is! From acting, from the costume, special effects outside the world, I just can not say enough! It was wonderful! Dramatic, intense, full-top cast performance by a top pure cast! It will be seen to believe. I'm not sure And I've read all those negative comments by others, and can not believe what they are saying. We're watching a different movie, is not it? And the bad comment of that Vaasian man, he is the person he is, he just does not know what he's saying. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work, Mr. Hines
