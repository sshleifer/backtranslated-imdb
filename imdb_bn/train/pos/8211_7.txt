I did not see the real dirty Harry, I saw this movie on a clean slate. And I must say, I've enjoyed quite a lot. Sure, some of Sandra Lock's acts made me a little stupid - but hey, it's 80's. But if you can not cross before (and I almost did not) or the killings of his revenge (which seems a bit over .. overdone; P), but it's just valuable for the Winnie Harry. Or at least, calf dog he loves 'MeatHead': P <br /> <br /> 7/10.
