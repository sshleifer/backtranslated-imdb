Only 9/10 from me, if there was one more plot in the movie, there was a perfect ten, but still, today, Munawalkar continues a fun festival of music, dance and entertainment. Jackson's long career started with a mismatch of video clips, which reminds the audience why he is often considered 'Pop of the Pop'. From the hit-charity charity record for Africa's benefit to his hits, 'I want you back' from 'We Are the World'. It follows a short film, although the Oscars are unimaginable in the winning script, but it provides an amazing and entertaining play for the audience. Finished with a perfect (sexy!) 'Come together' converting The whole family can see and enjoy something.
