My brothers and I became frustrated with the champions when our local station was resumed in the summer of the 1970s. We absolutely adored it It was something extraordinary and mysterious about it, especially when compared to normal American re-runs (Petikot junction, green acacia ... you get the idea). It was similar to Evengers (it was not surprising, because it was British and spy / adventure). <br /> <br /> I want to see it again - I hope it's waiting. I have mentioned this show to others and have never heard of it, so I started thinking if I had imagined its entire existence. But the web that surprised me to track information about me. Hopefully this will find a new generation of fans.
