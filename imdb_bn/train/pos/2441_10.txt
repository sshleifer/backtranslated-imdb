I will not be surprised and frightened by the badness of the ancestors in the history of the world in the name of religion, and it seems that there is a dominant influence on history and modern-day knowledge of the quarterly Ireland's top Catholic church. <br /> <br /> A love split is an incredible story of a real family hateful by all sides in the name of an incredible intolerance and consciousness theory. At the beginning of the film, we were offered a playful life philosophy in a small Irish village, among which Shiela and Shan Clanie happily married with two kids. Shan Catholic and Sheela Protestant, but there are no qualms with their children raised as their Catholic. There is no sign of any kind of hatred between Catholics and Protestants in the village. When Sheela expresses her wish to have an old child at Prestish School, calm and loving relationships are broken soon. The local priest took it upon himself to ban this "sin" and soon became the husband of Shibla and the whole Catholic population of the village as well as his father's native local dairy farmer. In a step of chaos and despair, Sheela kidnapped her two daughters and fled from the area. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To express his heartfelt desire to be independent, he decided to refuse to love deeply. Liam KingHingham, who plays Shan, has given a realistic portrait of a person for the same foot, which is not complicated as his love for his wife and the conflict between the church and the community. <br /> <br /> If fiction, this film has been a compulsory and interesting drama. It seems true, it's a terrible tragedy change. In real life, people and villages do not recover completely from the events held there. It took about one and a half centuries for the Church to accept the negative role of these events, and although Sheela and Shan were able to overcome their lives in this region, they were not completely restored from what they did by religious leaders and their fellow villagers. It is to deny the fundamental right to education, to destroy buildings, to fall under the women, to condemn the whole nation, or just to plagiarize and kill, we must have the ability to use religion. Our society has a strong negative power.
