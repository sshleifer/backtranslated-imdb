It's a bit longer (2 hours, 20 minutes), but there were many famous Pearl Bucks novels. In other words, many covered areas <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was wonderful to see that. This film is about 70 years old, the special influential crew of this movie did a great job. <br /> <br /> Paul Munie and Luis Renaera are their award-winning actors and they are not disappointed here, giving both strong performance. The only problem is the credibility of all Asian citizens to the Caucasians and some of them, like Walter Connolly, do not really see. I want to recreate this movie with all-Asian actors, not just for PC reasons but to just watch the story and make more credible words.
