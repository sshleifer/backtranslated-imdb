Though "eighteen-day" plot elements seem to have been for a long time, the film still has much of Spark, Mystery, and Emotionalism, which was the first film of Jack von Dormal. Although not as good as "Toto Hero", which will always be on my favorite list, the film still releases us with many emotions. Daniel Autty illustrates his part from 2001's slowness "The Closet", and is afraid to express his reaction (in reality, the role is easily destroyed when the actor becomes extremely dramatic). However, I felt that this part needed some more realities, instead of just increasing the character, gave much attention to the character. <br /> <br /> Do not expect dark comedies and unexpected twists in this movie because you got "Complete Hero" because you will be disappointed. However, the film still works as a decent, if not faulty, movies
