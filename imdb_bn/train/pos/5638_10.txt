I liked this movie very much. Britney is an excellent role model for teenagers and should be appreciated more. This movie follows your dreams and does not criticize what people can not do or criticize you for frustration. Holly just met her dream like Britney. <br /> <br /> Everybody lives in a time when people judge for their judgment that they are not. By seeing this movie you will realize that you should follow your own special and your dreams, no matter how, <br /> <br /> I would like to thank you in Britain for encouraging me and my friends to follow our dreams. He does not know how much I mean. Bravo Brittany You are the greatest !!!
