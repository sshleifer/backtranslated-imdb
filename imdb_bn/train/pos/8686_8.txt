The second official episode of the "Colombo" series ("Mardard of the book," was later featured, first airwaves hit). Robert Culp, who will meet Peter Falk's victory in the future installment with intelligence, is horrible as the short-term head of a sophisticated private detective agency, who murders a client's wife when he refuses to spy on his blackmail schemes. These two cats match this cute cat and mouse exercise, which is the series's seratum.
