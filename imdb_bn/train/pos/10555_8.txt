The evidence of this film has survived my fantasy for a while now. We've all heard or read about it in Kon-Text. What would you do if you were alone on earth? What will you do when the whole world suddenly disappears before your eyes? In fact, the last part actually comes with Dave and Andrew, who lives in a run-down house in the middle of a two-room freeway system. Andrew is a nervous ruins and Dave is considered to be one of the biggest losses in society, to say the least. The only reason why these two boys are so good, because they only move each other when there is a need for comfort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of them are involved in crime, Andrew Suffering from paranoia and not just showing the courage to go out of the house. Dave failed in his job and his colleagues did not respect him well and respected him. The problems faced by them continue to grow for a day where they will have to face inconvenience and deal with it. It's too much for them and they want everything to go away ... and of course it's exactly what. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story puts Dave and Andrew in this chaos. At first they are surprised and there is a problem to understand the characteristics of this crazy environment and to deal with their problems, but later they know that they can fix what they want because they seem to be still left. <Br /> <br /> There is nothing incredibly short cast features - in fact, in addition to the first few shots from the film, we only see Dave (David Hewlett) and Andrew (Andrew Miller) in the whole movie. It is clear that to stop it, the cast should be more than the task, because in a country where nothing exists, the viewer can not be confused in any way. Vincenzo decided to use a reasonable amount of close head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well. Photography director, Derek Rogers, is also a great way to stop visual information by teasing the audience, especially at a time when a character views and responds, but we can not see it directly. <br /> <br /> Clearly, this is not an event-driven movie and it's not. Most of the actions come out of their homes when they travel unnecessarily. And where most ridiculous scenes happen, especially when Andrew invented a candy bar <br /> <br /> Now anyone can think: "What does not look like?" Well, it seems really nothing. Nothing in the whole world is white ... white no matter what you look at. It's this movie's weakness ... It's extremely annoying to watch an hour or less and there must be an event to make it look more interesting. Thank God, there are some. For example, when two boys are unable to jump in any way due to any trait, nothing is made from the Tefu (such as Andrea claims). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The beautiful work of this photo, the house that houses in these two houses is quite interesting to see, but it seems to be both of them living in such a place. Above all, the production design is no doubt that this movie really makes the movie valuable ... among the most powerful aspects of this movie ... However, the best part of the film is acting. Both David Hewlett and Andrew Miller really look like they both professional actors. The camera is for them every second and as before said, there is no props in the film, they are really at a bare stage. Character development and some decent one-fishing equipment, clever dialogue (sometimes ludicrously stupid), it all works to the end - and it is actually removed from the well-equipped handwork from the low budget area. <Br /> <br /> Speak a little about visual effects, because they are significantly notable. Digital visual effects and prosthetics are some of the features that equate any modern horror film. The film has a horrific dream sequence, and even though Drush has turned that scene into milk, it's still fun to watch. One of the best visual effects of the film is Andrew and Dave suddenly discover their power in this environment - they have the power to wish for everything, so if they can do it any other way and publish things? <br /> <br /> "Nothing" is a brilliant and well-known movie, it actually helps to promote the concept of their death (it's actually one of their theories) but "nothing" is a comedy and it gradually destroys its own theory Do it. We do not know where they are or what happened. We do not know if we will never find out, because we will end before the movie ends. The end, by the way, is not as good as it may be. It's easy to predict what's going to happen in the future, the authors still think about a few things that help make it even more attractive and ultimately it's satisfying in a satisfactory way. <br /> <br /> Follow "Man", "Bill Bill", "Cube", "Ipok" and many other movies and you have "nothing". This is really an amalgam of different styles, yet no other film Not at all (at least I know) Nothing is really like. To keep in mind the original cube production commentary in DVD, remember how Vinsenjo talked about how Natalie came up with the story. Andrey Bjellik was once a room-mate and they were both out of this very damp room, without any hope their "nothing" can not be very well-timed screen version of the story and that ultimately, it's almost like a dense prequels. <Br / > <br /> What can I say? I've enjoyed "nothing", it's a great movie and different parts of the film are very well-versed with a few intelligent ideas. I still think that the movie is absent and I'm having trouble finding out exactly how ... If we have "nothing" then I can answer that question. "Nothing" is a great movie, but as much as I I hope that's not the best. <br /> <br /> Final rating: 7.5 / 10
