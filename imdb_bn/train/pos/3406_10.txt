In terms of visual beauty this movie is outstanding! There was no idea that I came out of Technikola so early. Although I do not like the end, the whole movie is fantastic and I hope that I was in North Africa. Cast is a great plus and Marilyn Diarych and of course she is so alluring and I just like her to flick this up. Basil Rothbone is also perfect in this movie. I could not cross the scenery and sets ... at the hotel, the date palm, the desert, it's all there ... the lezioneers also feel the picture of "Bau Gesse". They certainly do not have movies like this. Do not fail to see this classic!
