The only reason I came across this movie was that it is in the small Miss Marker DVD and I propose to watch it even though you do not like it as well as well known movies. <br /> <br /> We have Gary Cooper and a con man and Carol Lombard as his partner. The film starts quite a bit, but Coup is planning for the first time to withdraw huge cash from his daughter, but she meets with her brother after seeing the girl and disciplining him. Mr. Elections to keep him However, he has a problem for holding straight and narrow paths, and so the drama develops. <br /> <br /> Cooper and Lamber are good and Shirley is still managed to steal in her scene. It has little music, and Sherly has only one song. But watching with this little MISS marker and valuable value.
