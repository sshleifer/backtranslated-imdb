For a person who did not know what an actor was like, this is the best example. This plot is ridiculous, and really makes no sense. It's full of clipped situations, Hackneynid line, melody, comedy ... you name it! <br /> <br /> But Amitabh Bachchan can believe a bit, and this film is no exception. Sashri Kapoor, Waheeda Rehman, Ranjit, Om Prakash, Smithe Patil ... Everyone turns out to be a good act ... but Megastar scratches everyone with his greatest presence. Without it, this movie was a non-starter ... the story is divided into separation / misconception / misunderstandings / love / hate / adhesion / good versus vs everything - everything! One of Amitabh's extraordinary performances, otherwise the silly film! And I mentioned that it is ridiculous ridiculous?
