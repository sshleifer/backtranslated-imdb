I'm a big fan of the movie, but not for normal reasons. I think Trvolta and Winger are performing more than the average rate, I think the set was the position and representative of the era, I like the sound track and the Charlie Daniels band. Anyway, I wonder what photography is amazing! Since the internal scene was featured in the actual club and the low ceiling of Gilli - probably 10-12 feet high and the smoke filled smoke was 2-4 feet tall under the "smoke bar" roof. The camera focuses on getting the shot with smoke and focusing on the actor, bull, bar, woman, dance, low level light that was in the bar! What a credit! There was definitely auxiliary light, but to maintain the atmosphere of the bar, it was less light shots. Ray Villillobos (camera operator) was outstanding! He got a few shots, he had no expectations and his effect came about the realization of the film. Thanks, Ray - Great work!
