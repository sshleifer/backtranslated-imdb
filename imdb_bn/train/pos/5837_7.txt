Oliver Hardy horn, bells, phone and trumpet sound in bed, his doctor, Phillipson, calm and calm and advised to feed the goat. Partner Stan Laurel has come up with a great solution, living in a docked boat, so the saline wind can help Olie get everything else in the air. This is a great courtyard for all crazy cap hedges, because the boat has been neglected by the hungry goats, and a suppressed criminal (Richard Crumar) suppresses this journey. <br /> <br /> I got a stick outside of all the gags in the movie, starting with the sign in the horn testing factory - 'men are working then silence'. The basic story of the boys' apartment is a combination of several mixed upgrades, plumbing and appliance disasters, making bananas with stan bananas. There are two great lines in the movie, like "We were certainly disconnected", but the one who surrounded me was responding to the criminal on board the ship - "Self-saving is the average average law" - OK! <br /> <br /> I'm not a student at this board, and I'm not a student of Hardie's film, I know that I've enjoyed them as a kid and they have found me just as entertaining today as my youth is back. On this calculation, "Saps at Sea" offers a beautiful hour of funfobobic funeral, on the way to Hornomania.
