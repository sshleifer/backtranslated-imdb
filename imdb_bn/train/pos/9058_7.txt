I read the book in the 5th grade and after a few years I saw this movie. There are some differences: <br /> 1. Delivery can eat 15 worms in 15 days, 10 installments within a day not 7.00 no. <br /> <br /> 2. Billy is estimated to get 30 dollars he is eating all worms. After delivering all the worms, in the movie, Joke will have to go to school with a pest in his pants. <br /> <br /> 3 Joe thinks that he has a net, but he does not do anything in the movie. <br /> <br /> Although there is a change, this movie will be enjoyed by the kids.
