My super x-girlfriend is a roller coaster journey one hell. The special effect was excellent and the dress was Uma Thurman Habba Buba. Uma Thurman is an underhand comedy actress but she proves all wrong and nails her role as a crazy girlfriend. He was just just effective !!! Louis Wilson was also good as Joe Joe, but he was a man brave enough to work with the greatest actors of all time. Supporting cast was nice, especially Ana Faris, who was very good (far better than the scary movie franchisee). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ivan Rittenman was very good to handle this image because it was not for him and Uma Thurman did not make this film so good. This movie is clearly for its cast (Uma Thurman) 10/10, it is the director, it plays and plays from its original plot line. This film is highly highly recommended.
