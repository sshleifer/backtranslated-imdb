Tom and Jerry are a very classic cartoon "A Mouse in the House", which is faithful to their tradition, but with its own critique. It's violent, ridiculous, very entertaining and quite fun. Artwork is good quality. <br /> <br /> This short is not only for Tomi to grab Jamie. Boch lives in the same house and is trying to catch the mouse, because in the morning this cat is going to be a cat in the house - and the cat can catch the mouse. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, there are many fun gags in this cartoon. The most fun for me, for example, when two lazy cats sleeping in the two shoes of Mammy and say, "I'm happy that you enjoy SiyataÂ» and she hopes she is satisfied because she does not expect two cat gasp. Another funny gog is Tom, who hides himself as Mamie to Juice and slogans Boke with a frying pan and then gives the same technique to Boych Tom. Of course, even more interesting, two models of original mamy appeared, and both (stupid!) Cats believe that they see each other as mamma impersonation, and then they both attack the "back" - Lull. Naturally he becomes crazy and once he gets mad, he is not abhorrent. But Jerry did not even win this time, because he expelled him too.
