I like the way the Earth is made His photography is incredible, performing it has been an interesting challenge and on top of Patrick Stewart's voice must be perfect. In addition to watching his music and sound editing the world does not want to miss you a deep experience. You will probably never end up by yourself where you are truly a journey. At the beginning, I was surprised to hear the audience's smile that we saw animals in the daily battle to survive, I could not help myself to laugh at all. Nature seems very impressive to simply understand. But, instead of the need to smile, I left the film with a deep question: "200 years of industrial revolution can destroy the natural system which has been here for thousands of years? <br /> <br /> <br Remembering this question, you will understand how to look after the earth, it was somewhat nasty and powerless. To help these animals in their struggle, the changes that have been done through recent centuries I was immediately required to change the world to change it and to stop global warming at once (not all NGO workers! <br /> <br /> I immediately visited the website mentioned at the end of the picture and found out how we Can we preserve acceptable planet (and pole beer) from our glorious fate? (Www.loveearth.com) <br /> <br /> I will ask my questions I was a little disappointed to find the answer directly. Still, it was very interesting to know more about the film and its struggle went through. <br /> <br /> I hope my strength will be overcome. I do not know how to slow down and how short can be swim to reach the ground before drums or they will not be able to beat them in tired ... <br /> <br /> This is an inspirational film, but I am very I did not think happy.
