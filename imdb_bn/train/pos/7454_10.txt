** Alert - This post may have spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I only got a gaming ube on September 2005, and the first two games I bought were James Bond Games, a representative of the modest agent and the dull Golden Rug under fire. The next game I did not want to get anything or anything, because my friend told me that it was already better than two games. I want to say that he was right. <br /> <br /> I bought this for Tanner at HMV, and when I returned home, I ended it hours in my cube with a blur. It was much better than my two other games, and there were many better and more interesting stories. The graphics I saw were quite good (but now the Xbox 360 comes out, the Furky intends prydator has some of the best known graphics in the world). The storyline was tricky; The crazy people (named Willim Duffo, Nicholai Diavolo) and the beautiful Hanuman (Heidi Klum, also known as Katia Nadanova) are trying to destroy the world with small nanobots, which at the beginning of the game you have to destroy James Bond. A train. The worst thing is that one of them is hidden in the cutting of boobs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The big thing about this game is that its letters have voice-like voices, like Callus Voicing. There are 27 levels, some are short and some of them are long and tricky. <br /> <br /> Gameplay - 10/10 Graphics - 9/10 Sound - 9/10 Replay Value - 7/10 Multiplayer - 8/10 <br /> <br /> I have a fairly 90%
