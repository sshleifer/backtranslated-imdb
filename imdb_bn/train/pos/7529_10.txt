Two years have elapsed and most of them are different, some good and a bit worse. I still enjoy as much as I can. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They make poisonous ivy and make it more white in color that is becoming like a plant and ketmonim looks very different and it is not as real as "real". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The scarecrow look badass, especially Scarecrow. <br /> <br /> The show is not as dark as the original because Batman does not work as he used alone. Most of the time working with Batgirl and new Robin, Team Drake. Nightwing (Dick Grayson) often comes with rescue. Batman leaves the yellow logo and black wing in his suit and it looks like he is still a bit bigger but still kills tons of donkeys. <br /> <br /> This event is not really good at all. Some resuscitated characters but the story is as exciting and dialogue is still elite. "Edge the Age" is one of the greatest Batman episodes of all time so you can test it. <br /> <br /> Overall, 8-9 / 10
