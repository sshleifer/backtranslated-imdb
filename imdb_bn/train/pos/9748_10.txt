I saw this movie when it was 17 years old and classic rock (still am) when it came ... <br /> I hate opera voice because I did not like opera before, but he changed all that. He was adorable in the movie and was such an amazing voice. <br /> <br /> I heard on CNN that he died tonight, he will miss cancer cancer, and he must have left his mark on this earth. <br /> <br /> If I want to buy it, I can find, enjoy and enjoy it. * Laughter * Maybe I'll head towards Amazon.com and have a look before it's sold.
