So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. The film is so feathery that you swam in its return reality and you do not want to go back to the hemday again. A kitchen sink basin, and hairdressers, and plumbing sink, but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence. Will the credit screen go in the direction? Take your choice - they're both faultless. Let me go back to New York City just looking glass outside.
