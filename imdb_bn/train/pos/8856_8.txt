Before you learn about the death of DEVIL, you start to commit dying, saying that from a different perspective (in the style of Rashmon) that horrible to set up a simple hijst. Almost hour, Sydney Lumeet transforms this film into something that is much more than the sum of its parts. It eventually transforms into a multi-noble family drama, discovering the whole region of human emotions / relationships, because the story comes in its coolest measurement. <br /> <br /> In the case of Lumet, she plays exceptional outside her studded cast, without any idea of ​​excessive acting or hyperbolle. Philip Semu Hoffman is a complex, mysterious and striking character in his best roles, and repeatedly plays his brother Hank with Ethan Huq. Do not say that bad is bad; In fact he's an abnormal role that suits his style, enough enough above. Marisa Tomie is nice for her relatively small look (she bares that her meat adds to this). The character of Albert Finney (father of Andy and Hanq) was the most curious, and in my opinion, he was more qualified to get some screen-time. Amy Ryan has done quite a lot of her work. <br /> <br /> Devol is telling you that the dead is not an exceptional movie, but it proves that Lumet is an extraordinary career near the top of his play (clear) evening. Many of his features and trademarks appear here, which at least does not involve the use of his characters. A killer script (no intelligent purpose), smart dialogue and pacing, and infused with a decent score, Devoll knows you're a must-see-dead. A really intrinsic gem. 8/10. 3 stars (4 out) Should only enter my top 250 at 248. Highly recommended.
