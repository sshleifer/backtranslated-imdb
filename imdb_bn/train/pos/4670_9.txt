Those who remember the late Sir Peter Ustinov as Horacul Pirot or as a professional raconteur, they will do well to find out this charming fragment of the last 60's. Ustinov poses (as a convicted piece of identity theft) a computer specialist and an American (through a mere piece of identity theft), sensing that the stars are in the future computer, as stars (as we first see in Gol his last day, where he is ready to pay the Governor's tax return) Multinational set for infiltration. <br /> <br /> Ustinov (the script that co-authored) is the top, such as the fun reminiscent Magi Smith throwing it as extraordinary accident-prone cocktail - child dolly bird. Bob Neighart, designed by Maggie Smith, has a fun performance as a suspicious executive.
