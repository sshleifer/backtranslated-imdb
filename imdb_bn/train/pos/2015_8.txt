It can not be one of the best films ever made, but overall it's a very enjoyable, light-hearted piece that makes everyone feel like a good time. It is highly recommended only for the well-liked good factor. OK, so Frank Sinatra's "acting" may be very much desired, but his song is a great freedom fighter and songs fit perfectly with romantic environments. Sintra made many other films, where his uncertain acting ability had diminished, but in Hollywood's first venture, his voice, not his performance, his main contribution to the film. I have seen it again on TV and it has still seen my mood as much as I have seen it many years ago.
