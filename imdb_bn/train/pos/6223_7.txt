From modern sensitivity, sometimes old movies are difficult to see. It's annoying to stop the stereototypical Wallflower librarian from closing its glasses and becoming a smart and stupid man to win a man. Especially as a shallow and unrestrained man He is obviously a player (I can not believe him true) who does not want to sit, who is looking at fools only fools and always call him "ick!" After he completely changed his face and his own life, after refusing to reject (supposedly) by another woman, he simply went to him and knew that Connie spent all his money by rebuilding a boat for him. I wanted to stand with him, or behind him! Within a few minutes, his sudden transformation was completely unreal and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> In addition to that theorem, I like the movie. How do you like to dance sailors with each other?! (You could say they were from San Francisco .... D) The "rehearsal" dancing was fantastic, Zinger Rogers was intentionally coming out of "the right steps" and was good to see. The last dance scene "Face the Music" was beautiful with beautiful dresses and art deco sets. And I really enjoyed "we saw the sea" (though they used it a few times, as they realized it was their best song). However, the plot was somewhat weak, mostly like musical instruments (IMOs) - and the songs were okay, but for the dance the film was worth watching. I hope some shots of San Francisco can be shown, since this movie was set up in the guise. <br /> <br /> It's weird to see a light navy movie about what's already happening with Hitler. Time. I myself will have to try to suspend all the knowledge of submerge in a made fantasy land.
