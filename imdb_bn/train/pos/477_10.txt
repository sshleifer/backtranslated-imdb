Hi I'm a chess enthusiast from all 6 years old. I think I am quite obsessed by chess, but hopefully this is not the central character of this film. <br /> <br /> In this film, the central character reflects an actual chess player known as Cart von Birdie, who committed suicide in 1924. He was the one who played against Steinitz, which was a beautiful combination of stenitas. Instead of resigning, he just left the tournament hall and never came back. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think breathing is a very Big sacrifice, and you may sometimes end up being imbalanced in other areas of life. This is a major example of chess legend Bobby Fischer. Although a gifted, he was very upset in many ways. <br /> <br /> In the picture, a world championship match was depicted as Italian Grandmaster and Lujin. The format is a knockout, which is actually the Fed's World Directorate Organization sometimes employed - from 128 players to final 2 But this was a group knockout - which portrays a realistic format, where each team's winners can play against each other. <br /> <br /> The location itself before the suspension creates an impressive chess puzzle. Actually, I've made a youtube video about it, you can explore winning combination in detail - Enjoy! http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XZPtdtPHwdM Best wishes Tryfon
