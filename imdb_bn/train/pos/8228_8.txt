It is difficult to tell you more about this movie. I was enjoying it because I do not expect what I see, but a simple sex-drama .... It's a small-sex thriller, which does not seem to be. It is the character of Emmel Signer, a newborn (and nudity) stranger, in which her husband Polanski ordered him to do so. And a vague performance from Toronto (actor Bernard Tavarini) (I'm unclear / yes Crippy). It seems that a Pascal Brookner has met Roman Polansky (better than Biter's moon), such as Cheberle's straying or the cruzot thriller (I refer to someone as Les Debolix), but Georges Franzauz is close to Les Yuux San Wizze (eyes without eyes, Dr. Fitz's godfather and more). A gem! I'm scared they hit the hieuchouche remake Hitawatch and The Venting like it did.
