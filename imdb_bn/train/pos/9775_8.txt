Ink's tears are a real yet flawed horror film that is divided into the activities of a religious group in India, among which German psychologists, who can control their will and their body, have learned that they can be "healthy" to others. Radical tactics (which could trigger night-time hallucinations and physical pain and torture) to free the pants-up demons inside them. <br /> <br /> This image has been shown as a series of Vintetta about the Taylor-Ericsson group - the cited group mentioned above. The first segment is slightly slower than the other, but it is fine to set up the compound for the rest of the group. The rest play with a sync film like @Sink Film and a mix of some cell phones (full nudity, some gore) will keep you happy. <br /> <br /> I'm checking it out. It can not be spectacular, but this idea is quite beautiful and it distributes it to the correct spots. 8/10.
