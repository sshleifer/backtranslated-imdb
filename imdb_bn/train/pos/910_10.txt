Suraj Barshatriya is good looking back to see what is good. A story about a button around the wedding. There is a movie that looks good, which does not have any scenes that you will not want to see with your family. Although the story is simple and does not have any new elements, you still love the film because of the presentations, performance and indeed all the treatments. Haat off the sun .. This is the fact that engagement leads to love. Illustration of the change of thinking, it is nice to behave once you are involved once. The director must have thought so much about it and the actor completed it in perfection. Although the film is slow you do not feel it because you are so involved with this story that you just want to see the happiness of this newbie, the couple involved. Generally, as Rajshree Staff, it has many sensitive visuals that can break the tears of the audience (especially women). But when you leave the movie hall, you are very pleased and think that the ticket was valuable :-).
