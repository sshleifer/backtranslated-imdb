A fantastic show and an unrealistic classic; The jungle league remains one of the greatest modern comedy in recent times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was something special during a quiet era. <br /> <br /> Until the advent of the scene, there was never really anything like the League of Gentlemen. Sponsored, a seemingly simple sketch show, the show soon emerges in all the ways of bright comedic creation, like a bright, scary but incredible sunny universe. That's exactly what sets the show from the rivals, it's the way to tell us stories. Rather than serving our rescheduled sketches, at the very least, we see each individual or group of people going through their various journeys and story lines. They have no vision, and every time they make us wonder. <br /> <br /> Gradually, three series and a Christmas special, fantastic city, Raisen Vesy is still surprised. Ridiculous population Unlike current current events like the Catherine Tate Show or more importantly Little Britain, why the show is so happy and why the show is so happy (and that's why the show will make the series more easy). A character has run it certainly, and there is a chance to deal with that. Most fan favorites, which can be more easily entertained, allow the role of new residents in the role of roston vassi to allow them to grow more in co-workers or to make their mark before the series closes. <br /> <br /> Another thing that sets this show on top is that the authors communicate with the script process with care and intelligence. As mentioned earlier, four members of the League come in long-term justice for their creation and when it comes to calling, it leaves it for specific letters. This awareness also indicates that Gentleman's levers exceed the brave evolution, usually not seen in a show of this nature. The story is driven, and a much darker third series is a bold step from the first two series based on two sketches and the League really closes this bold step. The third series is not an urgent need to please their audiences and like Christmas special, they follow separate stories with distinct descriptions, like a series of more 'sketch-based preceding series' that (successfully) combines several sets of 'long story' Sketch <br /> <br /> The third series is both a refreshing change of style speed, as well as a practical behavior for fans who have seen the first two. Regardless of some constant opinion of the third series, however, any real interest in the league will realize what the third series can offer, as well as enjoy more character-based episodes, which will only become deeper in fan favorites, but the up and inter-alcohol characters that have previously Could not It can make a little effort to change the style but it is certainly valuable, and in my opinion, the third series is the best and also provides a strong conclusion of the series. <br /> <br /> The show is not in the fault of the errors, and at least few letters and set pieces come out of some places, but in most cases, talent writing, bold nature and host of bright letters (which are often very close to real life ), Proves that comedies are about to be created for true behavior and what should be about the latest and most recent, story-driven expression And often disappointed in the comedy, shame is an attempt
