A comedy, which works wonders well, was the "Divorce of Lady X (1938)" by the British Empire. It marked the first pair of Lawrence Olivier and Merle Obaran before the little movie about the uncontrolled passion of 19th-century English chickens. And when Olivier and Oberon are not particularly suitable for scrawl comedy, it all flows smoothly. Oberon Leslie, a young woman who progresses to a progressive divorce lawyer Logan's (Olivier) hotel suite ends up in a nasty English fog tour. He can do everything to annoy him - but, crazy movies continue, he falls for him. And she falls for him. But the illogical "Lady X" (which she gives to Oliver in a note) seems to be a serious incident of mistaken identity, a lady married to Olivia. To make things even worse, more compelling, Lord Mayer (Ralph Richardson) wants to break away from his wife, Olivier, who wants to be the favorite Larry, Oberon! Sex of the Sex Conversation, and sexual politics have fun. You can see that Olivier is not very confident with the comedy, but in reality, she is a professional person and distributor of Olivier. And he runs the screwball twists and turns, probably not with comfort, but with gusto. O'Brien did not smile as an actress, but he was generally worthy enough, and despite his famous off-screen dislike, did a good job with Olivia. It was illustrated at the beginning of the technicolor, which looks very primitive today (everyone looks more white than Michael Jackson), but perhaps the need to clean the print.
