Hollis, originally a novel by Louis Sachar, was successfully transformed into an entertaining and well-established film. Warden plays Siegery Wiever, starring Shia LaBeouf and Zero as Khlon Thomas, these roles have been performed very well and the actors portrayed their role well. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The main story is about the penalty for spending one and a half years on Stanley Yellnats and Camp Greenlake. The second story is about Sam and Kate Barlow. This plot is related to racism and it is a deeper story about the film. The third is about Ilias Yellnat and Madam Jaroni, the 100 year curse of the Zilanat family. In my opinion, these stories were very well-accumulated. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many people's beliefs, I think you do not have to read books to understand the movie. The picture is reasonable in terms of understanding. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Sir). Other members of the D-Trent include Jake Smith (Squid), Max Cass (Jig-Jaag), Miguel Castro (Magnet), Byron Cotton (Armit), and Brendan Jefferson (X-Ray), comic refreshing the film. However, the best parts were with Zero and Stanley, who made a great team together. <br /> <br /> While Holles is a Disney movie, though it works on some serious issues such as racism, shooting, and violence. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend this picture to people of all ages, whether they read the book or not. You should not miss it.
