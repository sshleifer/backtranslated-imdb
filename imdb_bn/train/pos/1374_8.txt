A French film will love Ester Williams. But the synchronized swimming was just a hook for the stories of three girls who were found outside the Paris outskirts. There is no question where Symama sympathizes because all the boys are portrayed as "anime", but in fact only 3 girls are in focus, and for the full time, most adults and other adolescents are mostly in the background. Marie is a girl, unreasonable, but determined. She wants to be a swimmer and wants to make herself a beauty in Florida (a newborn quality beauty for a critic) and she was also a friend of happiness: she was not unreasonable, but for her, the perfection of her body was short, and now she is a teenager in a woman's body. A journey to self-realization without the road map has happened but there is a smell about three natural nature: Where is the young man's pride and intelligent devotion? Florian's self-absorption is beautifully depicted and the Danune breathes with the beautiful union of Mary and Anna, although it is all Samamama dolls.
