I've seen "Dick Tracy" for several years, and as a result it has become an important part of my life - it was throughout my childhood and I often saw it. As it is now an adult, it is still a very good film - dark, satirical and incredibly misunderstood. The only thing that can be said, the Oscar nomination gets the passino - it is rarely discussed and when it comes out it does not make any conflicts in most cases. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is definitely loaded fun as the top but good effect. Batty is awesome as Dick Tracy, and a better film than any other camera behind the camera drives the atmosphere of silent comic book, probably I have ever seen it. It's just exciting to see a scene from the movie. Light, velvet overtones and smoke / smoke combine to create a great effect <br /> <br /> There are some really funny tricks, including a "Mumbles" by Dustin Hoffman, and I do not think there are any errors in terms of acting - even compulsory kids The character is much better than expected. <br /> <br /> Overall, a truly fine movie which is meant to be misunderstood for years after its release and is incredibly only underrated with 5.7 IMDb / 10 average. Critical reviews are very positive (see Rotten Tomatoes.com) and after seeing the movie it's not hard to see - why it's a perfect example of keeping an essence of artistry from the fiction of a comic book. <Br /> <br /> Highly Recommended 4.5 / 5 stars.
