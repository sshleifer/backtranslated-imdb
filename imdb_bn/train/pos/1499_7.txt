Hammer type horror films for fans of the 1970s, this film should be a treat. The only thing I like about this picture is that Peter Cushing wasted on the worst part. In general, however, it is a tough, malicious little movie. If this is not the best movie of Amicus, it must be one of them. The best episode, has been preserved up to the end, featuring John Pertwee as a terrible film actor - it's really nice. Perth was good at this role, it is hard to believe that he did more to do such films. After all, this is an entertainment film, which feared me as a child, and which still adopts me these days.
