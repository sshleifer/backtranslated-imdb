Karen goes to Emma as an alternative nurse in a Japanese house, a wonderful woman who sleeps and wakes up at night. He listened to the horrific ghosts when he heard the loud cry and then climbed up. She will learn the secret of the house. <br /> <br /> It's too scary! The scenes are frustrating and terrible! Character is good. The settings are weird. I love the whole plot! The last was frustrating! I paused in a scene where the little boy was looking at his sister up and I was amazed. This is the most horrific movie I saw. I do not see the Japanese version. I recommend this to the horror fans. 10/10 and 5 stars!
