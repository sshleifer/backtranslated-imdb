It's pretty good if you want match fight games. It is also valuable to see some cheap but robot war. I've enjoyed the Battlefield Battle for a while and this is the only movie that I have ever seen that comes to the feeling of how a pilot will be piled up among these huge dirt. If you like the General, your favorite games are Mach Warri three and four, and if you have Xbox and $ 350 steel battalion. The movie is viewed at least once. There really will be some more movies on the same theme. Less remakes and more original work. Enjoy <br /> <br />
