I must say, seeing Hamlet from a student's point of view, the Hamlet version of the band is very good. Should be appreciated his dedication to having the original text true. It helps life to play on the screen, and makes it easy to keep the text while watching, just as we did during the study, to follow the text and analyze it. <br /> <br /> I've heard criticism for most of the time, the name of Hollywood's main play. I have seen that it helps to make the characters' characters more easy, opposing the actors, whose appearance and words simultaneously help to confuse the Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> Also, its flashbacks help to clean many of the ambiguities in text. How far did the relationship between Hamlet and Ophalia go, and finally, why the fort was in Fortinbras. All in all, this edition is not only known by Shakespeare and is not only known by both bright actors but also some brilliant performances. It has been presented in such a way that it will not be English Literature PhD to understand and enjoy.
