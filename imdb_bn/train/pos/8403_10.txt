I found it very intelligent and artistic in every way! I felt that when I came home from work and saw the script, I feel physically and mentally all things. It is a tribute to the highest form and format film. <br /> <br /> Sacred Gucam! How do I want to come back that day I tried to put a bubble window next to my car (Honda Civic 1984), but the vacuum Muffin tray made it was not quite cut. Also my citizens are not limited by sexual positions and water beds, as illustrated in 'Van'. <br /> <br /> 'Van' isolate each other and even if you personally see some scenes as an alternative then it is obscene. <br /> <br /> I highly anticipate that Sam Grossman (Director) earned his performance. <br /> <br /> Ratings: John: **** 1/2 Sam: *****
