In 1594 in Brazil, Tipinbaba Indians are friends of Franes and their enemies, Tunkiewicin, Portuguese's friends. A French man (Arudino Callasanti) was arrested by Tipnombs and despite his trial, he is convinced that he is French, they believe he is Portuguese. The French became their slaves and live on the marine seas epipas (Ana Maria Magalhaus). Later, he used powders in war, which the Portuguese had left behind to defeat Topinquin in the war. Indians celebrate victory to eat them. <br /> <br /> Another low-budget movie by the Brazilian director Nelson Perera dos Santos, "Como Era Gustoso and Mue Frances". The screen is very original and the story is called in Tupi. The film is mostly shot using natural light and too Realist. Actors and actress perform nude and Anna Maria Magalhães is fantastic, showing a wonderful body and giving a stunning performance. Produced by Brazilian musician Z Rodrix, this film shows the beginning of the exploitation of my country by Europeans, at that time concentrating in Portuguese and French, doing business with Indians and exchanging combo and mirrors through our natural resources, which is a national festival such as the Brazilian 1971 The Brazilian Cinema Festival (Festival de Bras Best Documentary (Nelson Perera dos Santos), Best Dialogue (Nelson Perera dos Santos and Humberto Mouro) and Best Sigmund (Regis Monteiro); The Sao Paulo Art Artes Association (Asociocio Poleta Dos Crucios de Arte), Best Public Year of publication (Ana Maria Magalhães) and some other awards.
