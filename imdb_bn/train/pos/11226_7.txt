Star Trek hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways. First of all, it's a fan series created only on the web and mainly features friends and neighbors who have computer programs and home video cameras and knitting machines, as Mickey and Judy once gave, it showed a show. It's certainly friends and neighbors, you can say. Among these people are the most beautiful looking folks you've ever seen, or the least, or thinnest ?? Some of them are walking through their lines with stones? Some of them have a thick pronunciation, or simply do not seem to be good at first, whick makes it virtually impossible to understand the single single word. Still, you have to admit, these friends and neighbors have put together everything, it's fun to see. Yes, some of the conversations in the phrase. Yes, it was a bit weird (though it was a little quiet) two starfish male kisses (though some of the kiss scenes seem to be moving in.) Yes, when you quote from ST: TOS, TNG, you're doing a little bit of action, other shows And the movie, or when you look at the theme of the Galaxy Quest and start looking at the end, hear the theme. OK. We can get by that. Why? Graphics first rate You've seen almost anything better than that. And sometimes, standing on the basis of a show or two story ?? Some of them are really real tear-joker. <br /> <br /> Total frustrated pleasure in every sense of the word "Frontier"? But credit is due to where you will pay people involved in credit. This level takes much effort to produce one. People, sets, dresses, graphics ?? It is a huge effort of many parts of the people. We watch, we return, and we thank them.
