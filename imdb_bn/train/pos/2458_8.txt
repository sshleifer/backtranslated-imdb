When I took my seat in the movie, I was in a quiet mood and I did not plan to change it. But this movie is a dramatic powerhouse. I was in sweat and needed a shower afterwards. So what do we have? Theoretically the story of the age of a teenage Turkish girl living in Copenhagen, Denmark. I felt in my mind that the plot borrowed from "bamboo-like", where one of our Indian girls had played football and had married his sister. Here we separated our brother's marriage by making a Turkish girl a kung fu. And we have a love story and of course there is a competition. After I received this, it turned out to be a really gripping, emotional drama and it shows some beautiful kung fu (although I'm not expert). The lead actress Seema Turan is not only Denmark's female champion, but she also provided a wonderful performance, it seems safe to assume that we have most autobiographical impressions and it is considered that it is her first film and none of her education as an actress. Supporting Cast All the rest are OK, camera good, Kung Fu intense. Sidenotes: - Men display Turkish respect to the tribute so that they must have something right. - Our heroine finally paid tribute to the vengeance of the audience when they took revenge on the war. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Do not know that the screen does not work well
