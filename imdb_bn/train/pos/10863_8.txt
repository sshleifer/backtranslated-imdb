First of all, I must say that I have been erroneously watching films in the series. I would like to say unfortunately, because the election seems to be frustrating after first viewing the first election. Both films gangster epic similar to that form. And when the selection is an enjoyable piece of movie ... it's not nearly as good as the sequel it just does. <br /> <br /> In the first electoral installment, we are shown two competitions for the chairman; Big D and guy Some of the "Uncle" thinks that the chairman's title should be after the discussion, they (almost unanimously) decide that the man (Simon Yum) will handle the triad. Not saying that it does not run very well with rivals Big D (Tony Lung Ki-Fi) and kidnapping two uncles to lead the Bid D election board to influence takeover. These have disastrous consequences and triads head in a complete fight. People are determined to be chairman, but the "Dragon Head Baton" representing the chairman's power will not be official until the recovery. The current chairman, Wislel (Chung Wang), is hiding somewhere in China on the mainland and the nation is progressing to see that the nation can restore it first. <br /> <br /> Most movies are dedicated to the recovery of the baton. . Both aspiring leaders have to make it search for police and reverse sides to find it, which becomes one of the standout scenes of elections, including Jet (Nick Cheng), a match and a lot of bad guys. Nic Cheung's attendance is to draw attention to say the least ... I wonder if this dominant director Johhie is in any way during the second election, he provides more of the jet's letters in sequel. <br /> <br /> Nick Cheung gives a visual stolen performance, though, I fail to pay due to the actor left in the film. There is a great ensemble throw with performance out of both good and impressive good thinking in the selection. Simon Yum also benefits the film from his generally glorious self and actor, such as Louis Ku, Tony Ling Ka Fai and less grateful Suet Lam. Actually there is no weak link and can easily believe that they are watching the actual gangsters. <br /> <br /> Although the performances are great, one of the most influential things about selection is the Janoni to Eye camera. There are some really interesting shots in the film and it is not to say that its shots can be framed, because the inventor's innovative and pretty bright camera is treated with a series of planking and corners. Everyone chooses, the biggest, a great looking movie. <br /> <br /> My problems with the film came out of the amount of moon involved in most of the selection. It is a bit difficult to follow because the film is so full of characters which is not integral to the plot. Siegel decides to focus more on two candidates, but the first selection is a catechu cousin, underlines and police officers who offer the selection process by filling the story. Maybe the film will work better with more time dedicated to Trident's internal activities, or if director Johnny leaked essential ingredients and explained more on them. <br /> <br /> The bottom line- Above all, this is a surprisingly cruel film that is a great cast, nice direction, and retired pissing that packs a punch. It's a little more complex than it needs to be.
