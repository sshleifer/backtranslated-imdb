Due to the lack of quality and imagination of film directors, there was a bad year for Indian films in 2000. There is nothing left without love, nothing is standing. Many cascading disasters have happened due to film financing, and what is known about this picture did not really know that it sold good promotion and better ticket sales for India and abroad films. The only information given was that it was a mystery thriller. The film was now released in 2001, and this movie was surprisingly good. The key plot is to do with surrogacy and well-managed. Salman and Preity have given a good performance where Salman does not really feel shirts off ... can have special effects !! Rani played Salman's wife but played a relatively less role with Preeti, who played with Prestige, who eventually became the official mother. Three main sources have confirmed that their screen and screen chemistry (apparently) are closed after the rate dearer curve. Like a successful businessman, Salman Khan is excelling in the film and in other movies, Wang is commemorated as a comedian because he is partly involved in part of the films selected in Mumbai's film industry. The queen's character does not know that Preity is finally a prostitute ... ... from the rest of this and her family ... you have to find out the rest because I told you if it destroyed you. The songs have been portrayed by everyone, especially Vallon and main title song. Other supporters made a brief but fine effort as actor Salman loving family. Abbas Mustan has made a film and strategically directed the film. I say see what you like and see or rent it!
