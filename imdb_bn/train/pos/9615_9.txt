This is a very nice movie! Most of us have seen the Jurassic Park, where Chauce Theory is summed up by talking about a butterfly's wings, which creates a tornado on the other side of the planet. Well, all of the bugs (or at least some, do not worry, it's not a fool) I am not a religious type and do not believe in predominant elements, fate, but this film definitely ensures that if you are truly amazing then you think ... <br /> <br /> More acting and cameras are excellent, another proves that still a good movie can be made without a million bucks
