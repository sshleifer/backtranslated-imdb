During the Second World War, see the Rhine, one of the best anti-Nazi propaganda films. Paul Lucas was certainly worthy of his Oscars. Bate Davis shines brilliantly as a great actress and beauty. I would suggest this photo of those who are interested in this era, and, of course, late, great, fabulous films of Miss Bate Davis.
