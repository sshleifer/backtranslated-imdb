Writer-director Brian de Palma is best known for his film strings, which is a bit unnecessary, "Imitation of Hitcoch." Contrary to popular belief, De Palme does not tear a hitcoat; He has highlighted the elements of the story or character seen in Hitkov films, and then expanded on more violent, modern methods. Like Hitco, De Palma is known for making a mix of deaths in blood with Makara's smile. <br /> <br /> "Dressed to Till Kill" came back in 1980, perhaps, in Palma's most famous Hitkochi film, and probably its good as well. This story involves a cross-dressing serial killer, which calls both a burned-out housewife (played by Angel Dickinson) and a street hooker (played by Nancy Allen). <br /> <br /> Yes, it will definitely remind you "psycho," but de Palma's flick is technically impressive and intensely creative. The museum sequence is particularly well-scored and edited; Lift stub scene is sometimes one of the most unique shot killings in the film. "Kill the dresses" may not be completely original, but I would say it's worth your time. Rated 105 minutes 10 out of 9
