"Holus" is my favorite movie ever! So far I have seen this movie three times in the theater and looking forward to buying this upcoming DVD in DVD. I read the book while watching the movie and I was amazed at what the book and movie was like. The director of this film did a wonderful job of rebuilding the book in the form of a film. Also, all the actors selected to play the role made their characters wonderfully, especially as Maccash jigajag. Props to everyone involved in this movie, it was a real success! 10 out of 10, I definitely want to see everyone!
