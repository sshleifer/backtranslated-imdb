Shawncock, Godfather, Paul Fiction ... all the best. Great movie But nothing, and I mean everything is not the best Christmas movie of all time in Samsung Clos. <br /> <br /> This image is so big and it has a lot of messages, I look at it. Seriously, you need to see 10 out of 10 of these movies. When we see the pitch says he needs to eat ice cream, then we see sadness in his eyes, and we feel deep sorrow, and then we wonder ... What is so bad about this ice cream? Does it mean that we are using ice cream as a good man when it all makes us worse? Imagine the movie you think. <br /> <br /> This movie has the best version of Santa Claus. Unlike other Santos, he is a normal person. We see her children in prison and see the kids' dreams in a dream, and we are surprised; Santa We really believe that good? Also, this Santa actually refers to Christ, the whole meaning behind Christmas. <br /> <br /> You owe yourself money to see this cinematic masterpiece. We should just stop making this epic but nothing in the movie and air 24/7. Whether it's not Christmas, this movie gets 500/10. Anyone who is bad about this movie is an anonymous fool.
