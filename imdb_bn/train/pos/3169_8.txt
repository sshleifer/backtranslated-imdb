I hired a few years ago, at that time the video store was only VHS. Hitting its strikes right in the video (you know where the same fonts and color schemes are used in successful movies in the box). I did not know what to expect other than what was printed. When I saw the first one, I saw, "What is wrong with the Hills?" - There was obviously no conversation dubbing. The words are echoed, so I leaned towards what I wanted to pay attention to - I do not know there is no Shakespeare here! Just simple. The story fits easily, the boy, the girl etc.. What hit me as humorous and heartfelt, the filmmakers do not feel like the characters written in this story, but non-actors have temporarily halted their activities (uniforms). All the time, you start to understand what movie makers understand later, then see that there is no effort to make cheap humor (people can do personal harm, using hazards, do not hit the market, there was some honest about it, if they had a big budget It would have been better, but I was sure that they used to think every day, but they went ahead and made it. Person felt they had to do an independent film-making. The term "indie" is thrown around as if it is a general .. Oh! It's fun!
