I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. Richard Dean Anderson 2. Amanda Taping. These two actors carry the show with support from regular and repeat actors. RADA replacement in 9-10 season was enough to take the heart out of the program. <br /> <br /> Chemistry is just amazing in all major characters. After the camera stopped rolling, the actors got almost the feeling of turning around. This is the relationship we are going to see in the program. <br /> <br /> RDA's credible personality 'O' character gives credible personality. He never knows when he will not be rested. You watch the others roll their eyes to scare some of his words. Yet, they know that while the situation is dangerous, he is a man. <br /> <br /> <br /> They manage to hold the lid, but often only barely. The season of 'Solitude' in the season is one of the best dramas ever seen on television. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 'O'Neill's strategic sense seems to always sound. He understands what to do without thinking about the subject. The team has been in danger several times to listen to his orders. <br /> <br /> The standard 9 and 10 seasons have significantly reduced. The stress of the original story was mostly used and the new villains are never interested in me. Ben Brandor was very inferior to Rena in the rally. It was his rare moment with Claudia Black, but all were there. Amanda Tapping was phoning her performance in these two seasons. You could see his widely changed appearance after having a baby. She was probably more thinking about the child than the show. <br /> <br /> The spin off of 'Stargate Atlantis' is a few moments, but mostly weak efforts. Original character throwing chemistry Wraiths are unlikely to be weird. Maybe the Amanda Tipping program can breathe some life or it will not end in the fourth season. <br /> <br /> I have always had a problem with special effects on this event. There is a design monstrosity that has spaceships shaped as a pyramid rarely equal in Sci-Fi. The use of the torch for illumination on this ship is just as bad. The use of camps equipped with ancient Egypt is very difficult to hide as much modern technology. <br /> <br /> I am also surprised at the slightest continuation of the show. In the second season, Daniel Jackson was shot dead and his uniform contained a hazardous hole where he was injured. She crawls in a sarcophagus and it came off the rack in the clothing closet just to cure her body and recover her uniform. The 'Hathar' episode of SSPC has a sarocophagus, but it has never been mentioned. This device comes from Daniel, 'O'Neill', and 'Dr. Frasier '.
