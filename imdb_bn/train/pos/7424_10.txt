When I first saw the movie I was 16 years old and it was always my favorite favorite. Of course, you can not deny the appeal of the movie Crisoperson - how exactly are those men ?????????????? Sheesh. He is still He wants to hide every woman from the bad boy. His acting is flawless. He played a drunk / dragon that was actually going through it - and he was - finally he got the wagon, so it was all real. <br /> <br /> The music is great and even though in the following years I thought Straussand is not a good person for the sake of some physical beauty, I think it is a problem for male viewers compared to men. Our gals are just looking for Kris - and naturally the boys are looking at women's interest - my husband can not see his c / c cinema - he does not like his appearance. But I was sitting on the street just through the Red Ferrari scene so that he could see how good it was - the camera work was so perfect and you completely exploded the car with him - you saw it on my 50 "Plasma - WOW !!!! Should have been and ultimately, the transfer quality was great - anopharmic widescreen and really except for dark areas for all colors Clean colors and with very few words. <br /> <br /> I remembered some memories of my mom and I loved this movie together, I bought a copy for Christmas for him and want to see it together last night. <Br /> Judy Garland has tried to sit across the original, but I feel like seeing this first, I will not go to the previous era. All the concerts footage in the '76 version was what I had I was like him <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm working on my way through Streisand's comment, but he seems to talk about himself. Ongs, until he has even mentioned details about Chris or the film scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wendy
