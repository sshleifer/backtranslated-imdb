I have enjoyed this movie so much that I have seen it twice and it has something to say about a documentary. Music score, cinematography and sounds are absolutely stunning as you can expect from an emax production. Although it is shot for a huge imam theater but it's great on my home system and sounds Actually it will create a perfect DVD to demo your system. <br /> <br /> The matter is very interesting. It's about Mario Andrei and his son Michael. I was already a fan of Mario because he was the best race driver in history because he was the only person to win the Cart Championship, F1 Championship, The Daytona 500 and Indianapolis 500. This script is very important for two cars. Father and son The first car is found in a chicken fog and Mario turned out to be the first road that ever happened and we followed the recovery of gleaming perfection. Other cars are Michael's new racecar and we follow it from the cutting mold through the season. Imam makes just the right magic to make the car's building attractive and attractive. <br /> <br /> While filming this movie, Paul Newman, owner of Michael Amorite's group, describes the film. For many years as a owner and driver, his drawing and discretion gives many things to the production. <br /> <br /> The main feature is the race scene. Turn on the volume here! There is something about 200 MPF and musical rotations that you can take to the screen for the complete forgotten experience. Wow <br /> <br /> The final magical element is the humanity of Andrei family. Racing god of this world, Mario Andrei, father loving father who proudly monitors his son's career. Every father and son that they work together absolutely will see this. You can say that they are a close family. I have all the experiences that we are willing to do.
