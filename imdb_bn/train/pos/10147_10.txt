Does anyone know the correct quote "time and love" by George Ed Ur, in this step, Father Fitzpatrick, would you like to be? He was leaving while talking to Charlie and Anana in church? If not, then I'll hire movies. It was a great movie. I like cerpeti! Great love story for soul! <br /> <br /> I met a real love of mine (my solmate) and although I had the experience to meet him, I was not ready for such emotional relationships. <br /> <br /> <br /> Eltho, we got married, I was not as mature as I thought. I was confident and accepted his love for the mind and he had tolerated it for 7 years. <br /> <br /> He finally went away with anger, but we still got hurt, I got angry and went to disbelief. I got some hard lessons to learn and now we have passed 3 years. <br /> <br /> This movie was a big deal because I am still waiting for my only and true love. I can now admire that individual feeling inside me and Father Fitzpatrick's quote was true for me. <br /> <br /> I know that he has healed me enough to trust me again, we'll get married again. <br /> <br> Please do not be grateful and do not accept true love! It has been the best text in my life. <br /> <br /> The music of this movie is excellent and meaningful too! This movie is DEEP and spiritual lifting. True love is worth waiting, if it is meant to be, it will happen, no matter what, it will end! Nothing is impossible, even when it's almost the second time! Thanks!
