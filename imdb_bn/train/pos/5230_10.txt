Actually I liked this movie very much. Because of its plot, acting, joke, not Because I liked it, it was one of the worst movies ever made. It's so long, so bad, that it's very funny. Some jokes are really cool, but the others pray for unemployment for the script writer. "White men" are so stupid and stupid, you can only do two things. Turning on the TV or floating on the floor smiles (a lot of beer helps :). I chose the second option.
