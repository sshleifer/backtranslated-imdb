When the couple's weak relationship is separated, a big story plays in the background. At night, a stark dark mass of bridges from the sun will make barbarian acre seeds on their farm and apparently will eat something in his path, which there was never a sign. <br /> <br /> This picture is loaded with strange characters and ends with a visual execution of what is happening, and a good execution finished, enough questions on the left side to validate the belief of the author / director of an intellectual audience Similar to <br /> <br /> It seems like writing about the death of a sub-American dream, but I just will not say a fairy tale to the film.
