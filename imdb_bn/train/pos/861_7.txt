When you see a good French movie, what can you say that the characters try to draw a suspicious story with the social background? The main point we believe in those characters and once they've seen each other we want to stay together. It's simple and really efficient. The story of the background is less important. Why go to the semi-developed thriller screen game? It does not help to prevent most of the French film-makers in social exhibitions. There is not too much ambition, OK: Sur Mace Lavrera is just an impressive French film, which is a good character. <br /> <br /> For all the clever silent points in scrapplay, the end is very simple. In the rear window (this is a clear reference and definitely not a silent film) but it is in a less relevant context. Where I am surprised that the identity officer's character has not been deleted. She comes very little in the story; We do not wonder if we will not miss a part before it appears alone. Jacques Audiard is not yet a new comer. Weird and weird
