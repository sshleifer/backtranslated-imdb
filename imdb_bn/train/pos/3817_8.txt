If you have a drama in your life, from yourself or from someone, at the stage of trouble of this woman (but, in my opinion, it can easily be a man) is very real. This is a film about not being able to withstand your pain, not knowing what to do to help it get through yourself. Obviously this is not a film about how you can help a person to help them with their pain. This is a movie that you can understand that everyone is alone in their sufferings. This is a movie that can push someone on the edge ... which sounds like a little less recommendation. I'm not sure that I will recommend anyone to watch this movie, especially someone close, but for me ... this is a movie that puts things in perspectives, which shows real pain and so it's relevant to be alive It can help you understand that you or your immediate person suffered from pain, hey, the things you are thinking now are so less serious
