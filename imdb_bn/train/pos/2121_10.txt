This is a beautiful movie which is surprisingly played by all players. It will force you to laugh and it will make you cry. The last part of the movie deceived me every time. If you want to see a great movie, it is either. Jimmy Stewart has provided a wonderful wonderful performance and Frank Morgan like Mr. Mathusk has made spellbinding Morgan's character diversity is nothing short of surprising. William Tracy as Pepi is distributing awesome comic relief and some important lines and performances in the movie. Felix gave a fantastic performance as Breast Peruvich, who is a frustrating shopkeeper, whose life expectancy she has with whom she works. It is a simple story of how many close associates can become and how easily two people of great disparities fall in each other, in extraordinary circumstances.
