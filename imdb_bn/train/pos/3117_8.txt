I'll start to say I am very happy with this climax of the Bourne Trilogy. Please, please do not destroy it now or a seagel year from the past. Just leave it alone. All right ... as talented and versatile as Matt Damon ... it just looks justified in Jason Bourne's game. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the first two Bourne movies, you will not be frustrated by the third installment. It works by adding stick and more. To illustrate Jason Burn's boring past image, I was very happy to see how well I found all the information about 'identity' and 'superlative' in 'Ultimateam'. The order of the order is packed fast and puts on the edge of your seat. Clashes between Bourne and Killers are always fun to watch. I'm always a fan of movies surrounding CIA agents and CIA collects their Intel and how this movie is on the road, it makes me even more exciting. <br /> <br /> If you want to see in Bourne ultimatum without seeing the previous 2 installments .. you will still enjoy the movie but I still recommend you to show them first. This lets you fully understand and join the character Jason Bourne and be part of his world. This allows you to even more praise and enjoy the movie. I'm not sure which one is better than the first 2 but I can personally think of 'ultimatum', all right, there's the edge in comparison to the triangle.
