It's an incredibly fantastic fantasy about A Thund and one Arab night, fantasy discreet and wonderful. Malguntant Geiger (great actor Conrad Vitt), with the powerful Magic Faculty, defeated the royal Ahmad of Baghdad (Attractive John Justin) in the throne, and then thanked a thief named Abu (Samanujitishi Sabu). They fall in love with Ahmad and Princess (Pretty Jun Dupage) where they reach Basaura. But frustrated by the Prince and thief Jafar, Ahmad has become blind and Abu is a dog. The story is compiled by the collection of stars, flying mechanic horses, magic treasures, flying carpets, and of course cosmic genes (reactions edited by Rex Ingram), who transformed Sabu, magic eyes, three wishes. <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> This extraordinary figure is one of the finest shocking movies of all time. Produced by Alexander Firth Alexander Cordar and directed by a great screenplay by Ledos Birro and Miles Mollson, directed by Ladues Burger, Michael Powell and Tim Vellan, author and actor congratulated Sultan on mechanical games. The WWII prevalence became the cause of paralyzing shooting, when three Corda brothers and associates traveled to the United States, especially in Grand Canon, Colorado, especially in filming.
