**** Excellent <br /> <br /> ** Good <br /> <br /> ** Fair <br /> <br /> * Poor <br /> <br /> 'Go ahead, My day <br /> <br /> The fourth film in this series was directed by Eastwood himself (who directed most of the Magna Force directors) and he brought back the violent society from the first two films. However, the film still lacks influence and credibility. This film was released in the '80s, during the Reagan and Young Republicans. A raped woman does not appeal this time frame to the vow of revenge for her rapist. This plot will be better for Enforcer, which actually makes it a good movie. What was the sticky effect like Wall Street but in the middle there was what happened to Wendy Harry. <br /> <br /> Writing: 3 stars
