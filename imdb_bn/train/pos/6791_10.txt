The second speed I make it into a movie, it would be great !! I was surprised at the creation of this game story and character. I've tried it again (more than 20 times) just to try a little bit and it becomes more interesting every time. The Ultimate Fantasy Eat Your Heart !! This should be made a movie !!!!! If someone asks for some help to start a petition for making a movie there, please contact me. I want to help with any project. Great for graphics PS1 and even you forget it forgets most often during the PS1. Side quests makes it different at the public every time you play.
