I decided not to believe the famous movie critics. Although the film did not get the best comment, this movie made my day. It got my thoughts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It does not matter how much milk is fed to it, it can never be trusted and bites it while giving it. Likewise some people are such that they are never grateful. How this movie can be a selfish person and how everyone ultimately thinks of themselves and works for themselves. <br /> <br /> A stranger, unknown to a gangster, died. The surviving brother decides to take revenge. Through this process, we learn about the futility of this world. Nothing is real and nobody is loyal to anyone. <br /> <br /> Amitabh gave his life performance. New actors Arya gave a good performance. Chand performed the actress Amitabh's wife. His role was small, but he portrayed his role so impressively that one was removed by his performance. Chaila was really big face but her role was very limited and she was not given a chance to express herself completely. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its movie always give some messages to the visitors. His films are like the novels of Nanak Singh (a Punjabi novelist who always targeted the novels and social evils) because the audience has their real message. They are given entertainment as well as lessons.
