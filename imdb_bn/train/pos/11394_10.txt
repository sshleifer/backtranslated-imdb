Although the story is sweet, and the joy of singing and singing in the main part of the film, the uniqueness of the film (and it makes a wonderful composition) the sequence of dreams. It combines the highest form of true American music (Gershwin), the fascinating beauty of the French dominant industry, Kelly's intense curiosity (her rapturous "Pass de deux d'Amour", a really different section) with the most fantastic. Never designed for color palette sets. Surrendered music and a creative talent and a great artist are a true act of match with visual explosions with those dances.
