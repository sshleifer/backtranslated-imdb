Yesterday my Spanish / Catalan wife and I saw these psychological lessons in history. Spain is going towards a political conflict again. This masterpiece should be shown in all Spanish high schools. This is an extraordinary lesson on the secret of fascism. The American pilot involved in the Spanish Civil War selected for the democratically elected Republican government. Criminal role of religion is surprisingly well-presented in the most innovative view made in Yuri. The colors are fantastic. The cruelty of war (can anyone tell me the difference between a war and a civil war?) When two children express their feelings and protect each other, then it is used as a view of hope. Cowards who started misusing authority on innocent children are now active again. A film like 'El Barrez de Carroll' / 'Carroll's Journey' is one of the most tragic stories of the 20th century. This is a good lesson in history than a book. Again the great work from The Pinnacle Iberica!
