I did not see the previous two in the Bourne film triangle, I was a little reluctant to see Bourne Ultimatum. <br /> <br /> It was a very exciting experience and I did not have difficulty understanding what happened because of not seeing the first two films. Every part of the story was easy to understand and I fell in love with Burren Ultimatum, before it was over! I sometimes do not think such an exquisitely created, and gripping film, especially saw an action film. Since I'm moving away from the usual action and thriller type movies, it was such a great news to me. Ultimatum is one of the most popular movies, it draws your attention from the second half to the last minute of the credit roll. <br /> <br /> Math Damon was simply superb as Jason Bourne's role. I've heard a lot about his great performance in Bourne 1 + 2, and now, there's more to add to this fabulous actor's list. I look forward to seeing her much more in the future. <br /> <br /> The stunts were consistent with the style - everyone was brilliant and I am very surprised by the fascination of this movie. Savash.
