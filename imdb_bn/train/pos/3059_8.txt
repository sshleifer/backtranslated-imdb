Writer / Director Henry Bromel did a great job with his film "Panic", which has included his favorite work since 2000: William H. Messi, Tracy Woolman, John Ritter, Neighbor Campbell, Donald Swittland, Barbara Bain, David Dorfman. Bromel Nilambi starred Olman and Ritter in non-funny roles and offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we usually see. <br /> <br /> "Panic" is the story of Hit Man, Alex (Messi) who actually works for his father (Sutherland). He works on mail orders throughout his true profession; In sum, he and his wife (voice) and their son Sammy (Durfman) are an ideal subclass family. Unhappy with his life, Alex asked for the help of a magician (Ritter), only his mother (Bain) was saying. In the waiting room, she meets a young girl (Campbell) whom she is attracted immediately, which makes her situation even more complicated. His mother broke his promise and told his father about psychiatry. When Alex took his next assignment, he discovered that he could kill his psychologist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The wisdom, who killed his father to please him but could not stand up to him. His anger is so deep that he has lost all the attachment and mental attachment to everyone except his son - and finally his son who woke him from almost living repression. When it's time to run "Panic", it's fast. <br /> <br /> "Panic" does not look absolutely awesome. In fact, it came very slowly. But it's not slowing down because it's created badly - Slowly deliberately, Alex's own mentality is gradually coming out of the fog. By deciding on the whole of Campbell's character, and seeing his signs, his own psychologist, living, breathing man's breath, what Alex does, and what he starts to build relationships between - and how they do not complain. And the difference between the two may be the cause of other psychological damage. <br /> <br /> William Messi is another loving father, a distant husband and a cold killer, giving two brilliant performances like two children. A monster who does not curse his feelings or wishes, who is finally able to understand that he must go to the plate or repeat the cycle. <br /> <br /> It is a drama that is not working well in a movie theater. It is very adult, very small, very fine, very character driven, and very good.
