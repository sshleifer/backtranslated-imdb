This episode was presented to HOLDAK TNG to the world. Zardari should contact and a specific greeting should either be given or it will greatly humiliate them. A tired Picard decides to take a trip in Holodeck and starts a wonderful adventure. The settings are fantastic and almost like movies. Well, Zarda hurled Hellek shortly after the investigation, and all its security devices stopped working. Picard and now guests must send the 40th American Gangsters to the Ganges for returning to Zarda. Picard well wishes Zarda and a new day starts between humanity and Zarda. This jewel of the first season has set Hollday for many interesting and unusual events
