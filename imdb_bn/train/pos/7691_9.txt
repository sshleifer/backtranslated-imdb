This event was a landmark in the American comedy because it was the first sitcom to be the first African-American cast star. Sadly though it was never ever expanded on British TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> The father is called James, he tries to run the house, but his wife Florida always looks better. Three child artists JJ, Moody Thelma and young intellectual Child Michael Florida's secret friend Willona always came home. <br /> <br /> I have seen two episodes of Youtube (BlackJesses and Sex & Evans Family- only two on the site). You might think that why an English audience saw a series that was never shown or rarely heard in his country. The answer is this. In 1976, Britain's first black season was known as "The Fasts", only two series were created and it is now forgotten. But I saw an episode and were really impressed. Then I learned that the scripts were equal to "Good Times". They were the same character but with different names - Sam Foster Baba, his wife Perl Foster and three sons were sony (a small lonely Henry), Sheryl and Benjamin. Pearl's troubled friend was a reward. (To read about The Foster, I wrote a review about him). While watching "Good Times" only two things bothered me. The first closed theme tunes (terrible) and secondly the audience was laughing. I like the audience smile, but someone will say a little funny line and the audience will be crazy and start clapping. It was also a very interesting show. Let's hope that more episodes will be launched on YouTube and hope some of them will release "The Foster" in the UK in the UK. Best Part: Sex and Evans Family-Series 1 Episode 6. Foster's Episode This is called black community sex. I have seen other episodes, titled episode of Black Jesus "The Foster".
