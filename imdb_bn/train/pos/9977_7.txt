Spoolers: <br /> <br /> I'm really in this minority, but I liked this movie. This is not a classic but it is definitely involved and most adrenaline fuel powered journeys. I certainly think it was at least a 7 rating price. <br /> <br /> I probably liked the reason because I did not see the original. Some say that it will be its strongest fan with a movie that has not seen the original version and thus there is little to compare them to. It was not a great composition but I got it a lot and in fact it really wanted to see me. <br /> <br /> I like some things. One was Kowalkski cast. Viggo Mortenson was fantastic and really brought much charisma to the role. As the film's variance fell on his shoulders, so he was really nice and he was. This was a big role for him. Another interesting thing about Vanishing Point is that it is made for television. I did not have this idea when watching it. It sure seemed like a big motion picture and I would never have imagined it was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I get to absorb the story very much. I'm not the only one for action movies but I got sucked into this. Plus it was a lot more action movie where the drama, mysticism, a love story, the curiosity of the man you became. (I could not even recognize the prisli.) And it was touching. This was not a great movie but it can be seen. <br /> <br /> and then finish. It packs a strong punch and if someone is involved in the story at that time, it is very difficult to transfix at the very end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. Kolksky had survived and although I was very skeptical about how I could have been able to do it, it was a movie and the reality is not always the element that is always mixed during filmmaking. So I want to say that I have found an incredibly unrealistic conclusion, but easily touching in a great way that I do not usually like, but for some reason, this film is almost apologetic. Confession is that many were just producers (or villains and stereootic) for the plot but they got many rights even though many mistakes were made. Anyway, I'm saying, I'll admit that I understand why the original key would hate this version because even though I did not see the original, I've seen so many real movies that I've been resurrected with terrible results. (My biggest dislike is actually seagulls.) But the original quality is high quality if I understand the low rating. <br /> <br /> People compared smoky and bandit to this comparison. How does the road version of "The Legends of the Foll" meet with "Thelma and Luis"? I am sure both touches the film (both of which I am a fan.) I do not think that it was a great movie. It was better than me but far from better. But it touches the film with a dry, adrenaline fuel, nice cast of the main character. My vote is 7 to 7.
