Chase made a true story about The Soprans. Overwhelming performance, rock-hard text, and some great music that has probably become the best show. <br /> <br /> All Castes are Powerful, but Falco and Gandalfini have achieved each inch of their AMI. Sample only a few episodes of doubt in this doubt; Especially since the first few seasons. James Gandolfini is absolutely horrible, absolutely awesome, and you still find yourself loving - mesmerized by her. <br /> <br /> Tell the many people that I have talked about Sopranos (those who have not seen it yet) "I'm just not a fan of mafia movies / shows". Anyway. Run - do not walk - and get it. Those same people are usually "ER" Loves, but I betting they do not care much in the hospital ... it's not about the context.
