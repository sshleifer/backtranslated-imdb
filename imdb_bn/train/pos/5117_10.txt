Very few few movies have an impact on American culture in urban cowboy ways. Thank God it was temporary. But UC is in a class similar to itself in a class that you can not just close your eyes when you flip the channel at 3:00. My top three are the Hollywood House and Walking Toll BTW but by the point. I think the urban cowboy has been hurt in the theater and hackers are open in every corner, men played cowboy hat with their penny laufra and if you do not know how social psychology is in two steps! Personally I think this is a great movie. Travolta really made me wonder at Satyenifar Hill. Who would like a cold. He is actually credible. Soundtrack is awesome. The Dallas reputation of the TV was the worst of the great Charles Tilton Johnny Lee's career that destroyed the man. Here's the show Stele Scott Glenn, Gregorian Pre-Condon Redneck Cowboy. And I did not find anything against the ex-relatives of Guerrej's former cowboys, but I always feel myself as the greatest power line ... "Pack-Ace * #!" Sort like Clint "Make my day." And the closest thing to watching Sissy slap around her is that I would see my Julia Roberts fantasy ..... So I said beautiful. 9/10
