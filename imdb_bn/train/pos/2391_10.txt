My husband and I enjoy DoodleBops as our 8 month baby. We bought him DVD and CD so that we could see and hear ourselves. They are fun, energetic, and very entertaining. They encourage children to be active, shared and cared for. They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment. Whenever our son hears the theme song, he quickly turns his head back to the television and gets excited with the excitement. De de is a wonderful singer, he has a great voice. Md is a great dancer. I would recommend DoodleBops to anyone with children. Our favorite song Bird song You just can not help but smile and you want to dance to hear it.
