I thought this would be a crappy b rated rating movie when I went to this movie. I am surprised and amused too. Eva was good, but Lake Bell stole the show. She was at the amazing comedic time. In this film, Jokes was astonishingly original and with one or two flat jokes was really interesting. The plot was enough to bind together, a woman (Eve) dies on her wedding day and her husband comes back from leaving her husband, her words are far away, but she really does a lot of work. Well <br /> <br /> 7/10 - Overall it's a suitable movie watch, if it comes out but it is not available in DVD.
