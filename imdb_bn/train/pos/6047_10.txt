Winnal and the bright thing about me is that it captures the long left college and life can go way along the way along with its other other finery. Freebird went to do some of those who probably did not consider higher education and went straight to work 15/16 years old. I know some shades of these films kept this shadow out of the movie, but I saw it in a packed house in Hilsam and everyone was really enjoying it. I grew up in Dean's Forest and it took me straight to my mushrooms and dop days (there were some big partners - they hated what they think so far - maybe local council runs). I have seen it in DVD several times and already I see this movie as an old companion which will remain forever as part of my collection (how can I like this movie and dumbsters - of course it does not look right) at the end of the second half of the picture and I think Social contact scenes with locals have been brilliant. I like the mix of three lead letters and here are some obvious writings as well as some very quote lines and I dare to say a good smattering of courage. I tried to get the soundtrack, but it was not revealed (shame, as a censor). Someone told me that it was basically a stage game, not sure how it worked, but I'm sure it was fun. I like the short Shakespeare touch / references which can crop up throughout the film (also see Dillon Thomas reference) and like all the small gems, there will always be small things to discover in the final scene which easily thanks to Isardider, they start the next journey. All true pieces of film making (pieces of love!)
