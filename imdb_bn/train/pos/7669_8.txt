Doctor Morrad is one of the rare films that are completely under radar, but fully qualified. It really reminds me of the serials older than 30 and 40. Because I liked to see follow-up movies ... but not enough meshes to satisfy the general audience by just judging by full moon output. Unfortunately, due to the scene of a completely unexpected soul, there are two more for the family audience - which is unfortunate because without it 'it can be Harry Potter-style magicfests that kids can eat. Both Jeffrey Kombus and Yevette Nipper are great - I'm not sure that Miss Niper does not break a listed film in this film, he was very credible. Not serious! Anyway - it's embarrassing to them that Dr. Strange did not have the money to license, because I think it could be a total quid phanom.
