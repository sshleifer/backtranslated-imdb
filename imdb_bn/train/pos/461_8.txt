This movie seems to have a lot of entertainment qualities, it should have more credit than IMDB. <br /> <br /> This is your original 'Who?' The thriller with sex and assassination but it keeps you accurate guesses in the end. I like this kind of movie and I certainly think it meets a standard. <br /> <br /> To me it was more viewable than once, so I will give it 8 in ID.
