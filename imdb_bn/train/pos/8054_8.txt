"The Fat Dragon Enterprise" is a fun artist film that I had the chance to watch. Sammo Hung comes to visit a city friend that shows a Chinese farm boy. Just like the "Dragon Way" Tang Fung. Wherever Samo goes, trouble starts, so its differences will depend on its martial arts skills. Fortunately, Samo's character can learn martial arts by imitating and imitating Bruce Lee's statue. He even strokes his lips with the stroke of his nose just like Bruce Lee and expresses his scary screams. He uses a view nunchucks. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. At the end of the film there is a great showdown which includes foreign fighters. Sammo has faced one one facing each one competitor. The sort of "execution game", where each soldier keeps a different martial arts discipline from each other. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that I really enjoyed and the first Sammy Hung Movies. 'I have seen. A lot of excellent battle scenes and smiles. A rare classic Sammo Hung film I highly recommend for you martial arts fans out there. 8.5 / 10!
