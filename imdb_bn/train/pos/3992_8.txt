The movie titles contain the word 'Mother', but the first thing in our mind is to love mom. <br /> <br /> Mother, tell a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not talk about how to offer herself for the benefit of her child or for the benefit of her child. Here, Notting Hill director Roger Michael tells us how his mother's love for nearly half of a man hurts people around him. <br /> <br /> Daniel Craig played here before James Bond's role Darren, a man who is helping Mother's son renovate the house and is asleep with his daughter. Ana Red, popularly known in the TV series, has challenged the character of May character. <br /> <br /> The story may start in May with the sudden reduction of her husband, Toots. The son of the family is his son Bobby. When making friendship with Darren, he was surprised to see some of the works of Bobby's house, he was sleeping with his daughter, Paula, Darren. At the same time, after the death of Tutsis, the girl is fighting. Harry and Pallah do not want her, she is scared, her life will be seen out of the track until she spends it with Darren on her afternoon. <br /> <br /> Darren was beautiful and friendly with the girl, and soon she could find some affection. On darren Rather than treating him like a friend, he treated a man half-life of love for a man. Later, Darren could get sexual pleasure, where he could not open it any other way. And this is the beginning of a disaster that can break a family. <br /> <br /> The mother looks for a widow's inner world who never wanted to do anything in her life, who did not have any in her life, she should have a shoulder on her. To meet the needs of men under the age of less than Daren, she can buy her tea food meal from May, where she eventually gets more than her door. <br /> <br /> The role of May, she was well known for its various roles in the TV series before. Most of the movies are not in the resume of her career, because her mother has given her attention to critics. On the other hand, Daniel Craig did the same role as his movie career, such as Sylvia (2003) and Ending Love (2004). If James Bond fails to revive his revived role, critics of the film should not remember that his film career has good performance in small productions and the Mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> Mother may not be a favorite of everyone, but your usual mother tongue does not go with tea and skins as well as butter and jam.
