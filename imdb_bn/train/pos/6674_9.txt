After watching "mystery male", I thought that this movie can be so popular why? I think this movie is so funny and funny that its status as a bomb denies the logic. Well, I hope this will be a godly hit in the future, and you can guess me fans. <br /> <br /> Easily write, and without too much, did this movie for comic books "Princess Bride" for the fairy tale and "Who made the Roger Rob frame?" for the classic cartoon. This will give you more accurate ideas about the film's voice, but the marketing committee was unfortunately signed (an event like "Ion Giant" where there was no source in the studio). The next time you mood for a little offball. You will never hear BeeGees again in the same light.
