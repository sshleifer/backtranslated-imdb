Tony Scott can make good films and make them worse, personally I think he can be a bit sticky and harmful, and his job is probably more than his famous brother, but it's probably his best film. <br /> <br /> This movie makes it so great that Scott Dennett (on a better form than training day) and reveals the true warmth and tender relationship during Dakota Fanning. Set up is not always annoying, though it takes time, but it is involved, and takes a little ride in our characters - among which Radha Mitchell has a great role as the mother. These help to make all the work more effective, because we invested so much in the letters, for all their very obvious weaknesses. This image is on the verge of completeness, and it does not end up in the end. <br /> <br /> The film will certainly be nothing but Washington. I often wonder why he seems to have played such a dough, when he is almost as good as a leading person (I can only think of Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen on this day). This image should have been huge due to its position and its performance strength and film quality. It shows you that if the studio does not return a movie to Hill, it goes straight to the video. I'd like to get the chance to see this on the big screen.
