You're not even more dark or sad than "Othello", and the film captures the game with the extraordinary performance of Lawrence Fishburn and Irene Jackbach. Fischer has expressed the pain of Othello to the audience, because he has been suffering from Yagou's false accusations, even in realistic epidemic means. Jacob is a loving and trustworthy wife who is a vengeance device for Othello or an object of his anger (it is not clear if yoga has no intention of behavior). Kenneth Branaghang (Span?) Has shown his natural talent for Shakespeare in this movie, but he is a little bit younger. Cassio and Emilia's characters also float in and out of the scenes, though they seem to be more important in the plot, just like Igor. I did not check the film against the game to cut the line, but I know that Shakespeare can develop his characters, even seemingly unexpected, very good. <br /> <br /> If I have a movie critique, then the story is released very quickly, and the relationships between some letters are not elaborated further. The director had a great throw, and no one gave bad performance. The relationship between Casio and Othello and the emilia and Desdemonae earlier in the film needs to be improved further. I think they were closer to each other than movie offers, even though you are too late for this movie. Also, Othello and Desdemona need more time together. Although their pain is certainly trustworthy, but the interaction that they have with each other seems to them that they are only met. On the other hand, maybe just met --- like Romeo and Juliet. <br /> <br /> Short: Good performance, too small. <br /> <br /> <br />
