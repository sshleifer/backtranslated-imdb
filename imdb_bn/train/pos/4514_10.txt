I recently watched this movie, a lazy Sunday afternoon, some of my friends and we have lots of fun! This movie is a masterpiece of the trash. Try viewing it with this purpose! This was certainly not expected, but the performances by the actors (and Alberto Toma's best), the poor script and the low-cost budget made an extraordinary mix of stupid things. Tambaa retired from Alpine ski racing, where he was an influential technical skier in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two world championships and nine World Cup seasons. Seriously about the director: No one knows why he signed this image in Damiano Damian All other directions are important.
