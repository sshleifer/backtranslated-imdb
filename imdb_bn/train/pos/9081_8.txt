If you like sai-fi, monster and ancient legends, you will love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Many years ago, the Juarezic Park hit the big screen with special effects. While acting may be less than that, the lines and effects of the story provide sufficient compensation for it. <br /> <br /> I have now seen a movie on the theater screen instead of 42gb screen TV. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want non-stop action, extraordinary visual and taste of taste and fantasy, you should see this movie !!
