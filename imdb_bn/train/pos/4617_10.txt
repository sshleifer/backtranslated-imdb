I'm Jennifer Conley fan from Phenomena, and I've heard seven minutes in heaven, I've seen it as soon as possible. The film is not just a comedy if you think that this has become like our kids and now this film is not only operated by extraordinary generics, but it has attracted my attention that the film is horribly handled and out of it it's a good deal I like it And it's a good smile for those who have seen it again and for those who love you and Jennifer You can not stop watching this movie!
