The film was all transferred on October 20, 1944, where we saw the great Philippine 'I Shall Return' being a part of the landing scene ?? General McArthur earned his reputation on the coast of Leight? <br /> <br /> Gregory Pecke has won the General General's picture? Is it fork, shoulder set, intensity ?? What was it normal for both men: intensity, total absorption, devotion ?? Was the military with MacArthur ?? Was the challenge to play with the pack ?? Oscar nominated for "to Kill in a Macbird", "Kissme Kingdom", "The Yearling", "Gentlemen's Agreement", and "Twelve and Clock Hi"? He has obviously played from everything a crusading homicidal amnesiac journalist; From a troubled gunfighter to a obsessed attorney; Biblical David to Captain Horatio Hornbella ?? He has brought all his own unique insights, his character, sincerity, warmth and love, and, in particular, his laughing ?? <br /> <br /> there is a scene where 'MacArthur' stands on the deck with the Philippine president. We hear the dialogue: "General, I hope the water will not be too deep," the president said, "because my people will find that I can not swim." Then come to Peck's golden voice: "And my people find me I can not walk in the water!" <br /> <br /> As "MacArthur", again backed his fame as a giant in the film industry ?? Through him, we feel the emotion of MacArthur: We knew his anger, his happiness, and we understood the relationship with his whole family.
