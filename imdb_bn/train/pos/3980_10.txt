I have been watching every night this week on VH1. This is a horror publisher portrait about drug epidemics and how the medicines were shown in the media during the late 60s and early 70s. Wadestock, Easy Rider, Beatles, Morrison's death, Hendrix, Joplin's death are here. VH1 has a complete complexion of life and time during the "Drug Year". 54 This documentary from the SanFranskiso Bay Area studio is the evolution and progress of the drug trade and it shows death and new life in American culture. This documentary from Marizana to LSD shows up to the fact that drugs are coming to the country, hippie movements, conservative prevention, and how the drugs influenced art (music, film etc.), with many interesting interesting interviews and news relay footage. <br /> <br /> Dram Films: Trip Easy Rider Up Smoking Ripper Madness Blow Boogie Night
