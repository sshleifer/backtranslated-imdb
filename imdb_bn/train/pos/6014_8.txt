All the reviews, acting structures, ornaments, no idea about ZP's plot, and everyone miss the key point. <br /> <br /> Let's be honest. It was a film made in Los Angeles in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This is a movie that is, HHG is out of your mind on your cyclical substance. <br /> <br /> Find out some types of buds and smoke or get rid of acids. Seriously, ZP misses this straight and quiet review point. You can not get a bit of this movie straight into the mind. <br /> <br /> As long as you watched this movie on the big screen (which I am fortunate to have done in the 1990s that worked three times) Jepp was very rare) out of touching, you have no idea what this movie is about. <br /> <br /> If you insist that you are not addicted to it, then at least you can express gratitude. Soundtrack The X X, Eugene Soundtrack, "Come, number 51, your time is up!", Pink Floyd's excellent restoration.
