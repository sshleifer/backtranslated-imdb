I love devil pitt !!! David Tennant is such a great actor and so Billy Piper !!! Who Would Love Thorp Piece ??? She is so beautiful, is not she? I hated the bit where he got possessed by the devil and where he called "go to hell", as the rose so put it bluntly. It seemed like he was quite funny when he said, "Rose, do a favor for us, what do you do? Shut up!". Mr Jefferson was so brave, did not he? Death to save others. I felt sorry for Toby (Will Thorp) when he grabbed the second time because he was so scared. I was fine "Oh my God if I were everyday, I would be scared for him". And when she embraced him, I was like "Grrrrrrrr, he was my hand!" But I was really sweet. And the doctor ... Well, I thought he would call Eda "Tell me every day I love him" but he did not. Well good
