Other comments and reviews can not believe in my eyes when reading a lot of bunch. As it was a mid-film of some run-of-the-doles. <br /> <br /> The film is a great, funny, crazy, but at the worst of all, with the lowest Gore, and above all Core Energetic. It's like every single bit. Sunny and martial arts can not feel anything like this crazy for showing off. And now the most important thing (at least to me): It is the effect of computer free. When I am throwing a screen on the screen of some modern Hollywood high-resolution screen and high-budget action "Foollo" (Russian word meaning "steam * beep *"), I understand that no * beep * can do this - you need to adjust the body wire You can add some cool PC effects and stuff it in action film. Here it is different. I do not think a dozen of physically engineered workers around the world can repeat the same, even at the end of the film or at the end of the "sugar football" game. And it does not just pretend to be "Star Wars", but rather a little Hong Kong movie made for fun. <br /> <br /> There is no problem with having a DVD with this movie. It does not ruin the atmosphere to me. <br /> <br /> It can not help to mention the very beautiful dramatic game. Some of you, guess, would not like it. To me - it's amazing. Look at the friend of the dragon, who is speaking bravely to criminals and suddenly gets a punch from his head to the left. The expression of his face changed into something scary and when he comes to the dragon with the expression of a child. And look at the face size - it's almost from one ear to another long time when it grimes. <br /> <br /> This movie is a high rating from the people of the world and thousands of comments. Thank you for our Russian art for the release of the classic Jackie Chan film. His modern people are very weak about my modest opinion and are not eligible for many promotions. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 - a series of his legendary films. Thanks for your attention.
