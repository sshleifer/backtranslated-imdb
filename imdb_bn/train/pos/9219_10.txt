The film itself wants me to go and call someone so they can enjoy it too. It was extremely fun. Angelina Jolie as Juliet was wonderful. Parents are delightful. They are caterers and enemies. The children play Romeo and Juliet in the games of the church. They fall in love and their parents try to keep them separate. (The forward forward. I think) they have torn up after a party and do it. Surprisingly they still want to get married at the end of the movie. You do not like stereotypes and do not see classic literature dysfunction. If you do not mind them then you will have an explosion of this one watching.
