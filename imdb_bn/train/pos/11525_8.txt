This movie is awesome for three main reasons. It is esthetically beautiful. I love that absolutely. There is a dark color theme across the film with great costumes and photo sets. Very expensive (and probably not) which is full of a photography look. I always enjoy coming together and having a family who misfits / loners about those group stories. Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but this one does not. This group of actors portrayed really well flawed, yet highly likable characters. Alan Larkin was the best (in that, I was not able to help Van and the road movie theme, but could I remember last year's favorite movie?) I've discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio, very interesting actors, and at the time only Til Schweiger got a little bit annoyed by the performance. In the opening scene, all the scenes where they mess up their tactics are very funny. There is a mix of humor and emotion across the film. I like the end of the lot. And of course it's all about the magic theme. A good magician wants to make listeners confused about their confusion where they want to see them. Which movie director did exactly this and because of that they call it Movie Magic.
