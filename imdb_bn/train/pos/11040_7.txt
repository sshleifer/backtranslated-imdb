Last night I saw this French horror movie and most of it liked it. The whole movie is basically in a prison with three detainees, where 20 years ago one finds a handwriting journal in a wall of a serial killer escaped from prison, in no way, without his cell. They look for the diary, they discover it in black art and commands which can be their way from cell and independence. What they find, something completely different, and the least scary to say. I like the low budget horror films, which supply products as a whole and tell a good story. Despite some time to fix this movie. The results and fears they had made were very interesting to me and I enjoyed the journey. Not much of Gore, but the story will not fit, though the grave is pretty good.
