After the death of Siskel and absence of Ebert, Richard Roeper's absence has been kept in the hand. Roeper is not a movie critic, he personally criticized something that he does not like, because the country is panning the movie with the music because "I do not like country music!" And children's movies get a benchmark "Do not watch it now, wait until it comes to the DVD and rent it for your kids!" Roeper may well be a stupid savant, but in some other cases. The eager rental of 'weekly' for the weekly guest is good, but who wants to choose a dais in the middle of the cattle? That said, it makes the town the only show and alone worth watching it. Like Roger Ebert, Stephen Hawking can talk, so you! It's your mind and thoughts we are long for. Whatever its going to get the usurper off its self-declared throne.
