I first saw this as a child living in East London. Hitler Luftaffe's stains were very clear and the film's landscape was memorable for our streets. I have to remember having a nightmare after watching it. The odd thing is, if movie fiction is seen as a part of social history it really does not date. Besides the devastating global war, the scale of machines is now very bad, more nanotechnology, but overall a nice and disciplined job. It was interesting to see how the space travel was felt. I would think that firing a spaceship from a monster gun would kill almost certainly the astronaut. However, there were many rights. Man is for war, man's inhumanity. Meaning of war as a catalyst for development. <br /> <br />
