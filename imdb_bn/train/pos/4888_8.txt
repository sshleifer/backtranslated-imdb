It has recently been broadcasted on BBC and I am very happy to see it. As the credit rolling, Cast alone is sure that I will go for it one. Just five minutes later, I was completely submerged in this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> Yes it was formulaic and predictable, but its charm was added in any way. A similar feeling was felt in hundreds of productions and flashbacks were nicely decorated in the 1950's. <br /> <br /> An extraordinary sense movie, combined with outstanding music. When it's released, I will buy it!
