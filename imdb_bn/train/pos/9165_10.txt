This should be my most favorite adaptation, which I found to be my favorite and I think it is very close to the book. How to actually see it is the casting of two main actors. Wonderful Timothy Dalton is the best Rochester. Screen Breading and Tragic Watches, Zenna Clark's Perfect combination of humility, such as strength, courage, shame and genes. The story (since I'm certain that most people know), this young and flat Jen was a teacher in a donation school for girls of the 1800s, who published her services as secretaries in the newspapers. Pregnancy in the big palace Thornfield is the mysterious and respected owner Mr. Rochester, the little ward of Adel's teachers. After a few months, she fell in love with Jane and tried to apply some situations and saw that Jane has been crazy with her as well as with him. The Arcanfield Hall is still secret secrets and it is devastating when the impact. It's a nice and well-played play plus plus plus with gorgeous dress as I said before the excellent performance, especially Zelah and Timothy.
