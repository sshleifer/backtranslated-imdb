Dad and son have very little contact. In fact they speak different languages. When the boy takes his father away to 3000 miles away from Mecca for his pilgrimage, the conversation ends. They are difficult and need to increase in both parts. <br /> <br /> This movie takes us to the heart of these two tourists, and it is an ocean travel for visitors as well as two principals. The whole imagery is impressive, especially the final scene of Mecca. It may be different for me as well as the world may be different, as well as the same. The same was true for the father and the boy in this film. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. Tell your friends to see it. You will be glad you
