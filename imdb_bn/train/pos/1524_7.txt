This movie will be a classic. It's certainly not perfect. When paging is perfect for stage, the film form is slowly as slow as a glass with the knee. Jean Seberg is misdirected to be very sweet and very gentle. He firmly shows the talent, skill, and skill of the actress, captivating, and confident Joan firmly, but unfortunately, the director has missed the point of the character. George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright. His dialogue in any other game has been more sharp, and more musical instruments in line. However, you see this as a lawyer to process this movie. This movie is a case, and the judge is the judge. The way this picture can be enjoyed. 7/10
