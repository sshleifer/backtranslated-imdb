Story and music (George Gershwin!) Wonderful, Levant, Gatori, Folk, and of course, Kelly. One thing missing, and that's a good female leading lady. I'm sorry, Leslie, because I'm annoyed. However, despite her, the plot nicely (and deservedly) move along with the ballet. Oh colors, flashing red, blues, greens, and yellows. Do not forget the beiges as well. ; ) I just love the contrast of the Bau Arts ball (completely black and white clothing) and the bright children of forever. <br /> <br /> I think what I'm trying to say is: Please, see it in all ways, and enjoy it, because it's not the best, it's gravity. But do not be sure that another genie Kelly music accompanies a 20-year-old girl after musicals and then moves around Starodom.
