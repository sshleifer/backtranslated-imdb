I hired zero days from the local video store last week. I have never heard of this movie and my reservation was about me. Just seeing the box, I knew that this film was indie film and so the quality is going to be lower than the mainstream. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished showing zero day I started it from the beginning again. The original form of what happened in the April 1999 Column High School basically follows the outline, but how did two major actors believe me? Seeing this movie was not entirely sure what I was seeing for the first time, I kept the original tape behind by Colombian disappearances. Back to my mind, I knew that what I see could not be real, but at the same time acting was so sure that you have to shake your head. <br /> <br /> Is the picture boring? Shuffle clothes! Are you going to see something that will ask you about the talent of the film? Probably. I think most people will become annoying, they actually feel the two main characters, Calvin and Andrey (played by Cal Robertson and Andrey Cakes). Why is that problematic for some people? Calvin and Andr√©s are planning a genocide in their high school. I know for myself, that I feel great and sad for Andre and Calvin. I had my sympathy for them because their lives were so dreadful. They were so deeply moved by anger that they could start their journey from the streets, if the people around them looked at their plight. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is an extraordinary movie. It gives you close and personal appearance with events that many of us can only see the conclusion in the news. It leaves you thinking about life involved. And it leaves you confused how you get to this point. Even after a week of watching this picture, I still wonder about it. <br /> <br /> For those who have not seen zero days please note the following: Camcorders are shot in no film or film independent of the budget. Photo element is boring. This is not mainstream Hollywood and no happy ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> But if you can keep it next to each other, Zero Day is a movie that will be with you and only help keep your eyes open.
