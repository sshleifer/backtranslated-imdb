Writer / Director Michael Powell, "Al Metter of Life and Death", since 1946, and his American Spellbinding Fantasy, can not be considered as favorite of their movies together. This colorful romantic adventure, released after World War II, provided only the tonic for the need for a good stimulus for a traumatic, recoverable nation. <br /> <br /> Following a string of other patriotic war movies, Archers' one of these made their quirkiest, skittish and many patriots. In order to maintain Britain's heritage (Shakespeare, Beer, Fair Play, Good Manner), it is Britishly Britishized in its binary composition, technological innovation and fine multi-ethnic cast. <br /> <br /> Another weird 1946 classic, "It's a wonderful life", is open in the Amold Grand World, the joyful voice-over in the world and the sky, and we live in a big, wonderful world. <br /> <br /> Then it entered a British cocktail, hit the fire and the co-pilot already died. It is wrong idea, but the connection is very fast with the followings. <br /> <br /> Clocking in about 5 minutes, British pilot Peter (David Niven) and American radio contact fast fire exchange in June (Kim Hunter) is exciting in his intimacy. Peter resigned for his death, but Peter gave up a lot of strong force, elegance and extrovert confession, and he closed the mutual exchange of 'I love you' with his warm relationship with June. <br /> <br /> Under the magic of this moment, Peter, under the supervision of his conductor, 71, whose work had been transferred to 'other world', escaped from death and stuck himself on the beach. Later he runs a bike with June, and immediately matches the body with voice. After understanding their mistake, the High Court wanted to return Peter and ordered the French conductor (Morris Garing) to bring him back to the world. But Peter is unreasonable to survive due to June and conductor's mistakes, and deliberately defending his corner. <br /> <br /> Peter's fate is ultimately with the Heavenly Court and the American Prosecutor (Raymond Massey), whose jury has several heroes of the dead war and British representatives' garb. After the announcement of the verdict, the overwhelmingly tripled trials of B / W, may be a dream, but the final shot of the hospital examines the expected results. <br /> <br /> Abstract, the "Stairs of Heaven" (American title of the film) is used twice: the first time b / w, when it picks Peter and his progressive French guard over, Peter's possible attorneys Crosses the monster statues, including Abraham Lincoln and Plato. For the second time, gradually the colorful filmmakers provide setting for the film - as Peter and June frozen, along with their wonderful eyes go ahead, their fate is sealed. <br /> <br /> The unlikely affection shared between Peter and June never gives money to words or words; The couple and the perception that this couple is already sufficiently married and will have to satisfy their loved ones, so it can put them together. <br /> <br /> The French conductor, who can erase the body of time and people, combine multiple important moments, Peter's history and his rogue strategies include Peter's top 100 tricks book and his coffee cup. <br /> <br /> As per another Powell / Presbyver co-operation, apparently inspired by the color of B / W with the first time? Being used for the scene of Heaven is a modern quality, and both are equally rich. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary script matches the fantastic set design, it seems so quickly with the dialogue that it is not written or edited for the screen. Sunny and Wicked, Powell / Presbyter's writing color and composition have the same ability to criticize their Four. <br /> <br /> One of the films "It's Matter of Life and Death", created in 1946, is that it is fresh and inventive, even in this era, where CGI will blow up its artificial effects, perhaps their emotional wonder isolation. <br /> <br /> Another jarring change involves the need for average seconds to be cut, and the inevitable application should be included in the conversation so that it can save less attention span to most listeners. Powell dislikes a spell, which absorbs the observer from the first frame of the subconscious, which gives him the freedom to test with the logical development of Peter's accusations, without hypocrisy.
