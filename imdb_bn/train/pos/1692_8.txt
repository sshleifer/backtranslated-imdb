Like the great classic bug Bonnie Cartoon, this movie has humor at different levels. I just introduced this to my 10 year old girl and 11 year old son. Both of them enjoyed the movie - laughing several times ... and my daughter is not many scientist. The film has laugh me a few times, but it also laughs ... adult-level comedies (that is, adults will get easy due to big living, no wife or rated staff can be found here), the film is equally enjoyable for adults. As an example of adult-level comedies, Martian voices are based on the character of various movies / actors. Martin Pilot, Blazny, Jack Nicholson's Voice and Process; Scientist, Peter Vendor Dr. Strangelov. Special effects are surprisingly good for this photo. The lack of the top 10 actors actually work for the film and the actor / actress plays well in their part - actually I would say that the producers have chosen actors and their skills for the role necessary for the box office draw. Example Wayne Alexander's "Vern" character). I had to write this review ... kids play this game for the third time in just 4 days at dinner. There is no good-and-I-boring movie for a rainy day or a late night weekend.
