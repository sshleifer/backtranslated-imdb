Nowadays, it finds a romantic comedy which is not surprisingly annoying throughout the whole film (for example Big Fat Greek wedding; Me, Me and Irene). There was only a couple of unnecessary entertainment in this movie, nothing was unreasonably profane. Almost all, it was an intelligent movie with preferred characters. I was a little accidental in the end. It seems like it should end on the world series for a real bang-up finish. Acting little left to be desired, but the story was made by motion. If I knew it was a farewell brother's film, I thought it was a belly-baked trash and did not see it, but it seems that they were wrong to make a good film. Good for them, I hope they pull their heads from the rest and make consistently good movies.
