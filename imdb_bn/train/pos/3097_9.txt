This show was fabulous. It was complicated and well-liked with good writing and all the characters where being awesome is sweet. Even Jonathan Cakes was also loved philandering boyfriend. Since our airwaves were filled with dirty-like shit with American Idol and stars, it was so nice to see a drama that was not very nice. It was always stimulating to see how each character will be attached to the next situation. It's really annoying that we finally got a program that thinks you a little bit and it's been cast due to some mysterious numbers that most of us do not pay attention. Some of us are not sheep. This show will probably be missed by many people but by some pretty loyal fans.
