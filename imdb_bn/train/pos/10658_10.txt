When I saw this movie I was 10 years old. I have remembered these years that I could not sleep for a week or more after seeing it. It just rattled me absolutely. I was on vacation in my buttocks. Valuable, Texas and I will not forget it. Now, 48 years later, my daughter is trying to get a copy for me as an adult. It has done a lot of research to find out which movie, but I always remember that Barbara Stanwick was in it and was finally able to get its name and review. I have enjoyed it, but it is very frightening to me! Jaqui
