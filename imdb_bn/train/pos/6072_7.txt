Branagh and Fishburne provide excellent performance in this version of Shakespeare Classic. Branagh played Yao well after watching the character in the film or stage. Some would say this image is too ego-centric, but I disagree. Fishburne, the first Black Othello in film history, surprisingly, provides a strong performance. Fishburne has always been a good actor, but this performance as Venice Mooor could be her best one. <br /> <br /> This picture is a problem to me, it's easy subtraction of several important scenes. Desdemona's character gave much less depth than his play. In this movie, he can not even add. One of Branhghang's worst cuts in this film is the reduction of the conversation between the Ego and Deseddammon at the beginning of the second act. This section of the play shows that Desdemona is not his innocent child like this picture. There were some infrastructures that hit the integrity of this photo. <br /> <br /> However, if you do not read in the play, or see a movie version of Othello before, then I recommend this movie. The story is cut, or not, still incredibly enthralling. Acting, said earlier, very good. Some important scenes have been added and the character of the dame has got some more priority, it will be a great movie. It stands, it's still a pretty version of the original. I give it a marginal recommendation.
