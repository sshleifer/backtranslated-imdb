Jake Speed ​​(1986) was a funny parody of India Jones and other adventure films that were popular among Aishidas. Wayne Crowford is a star like Jack Speed, an adventurer who is always fighting with evil activists wherever he goes. They are looking for some action (and some decent story line) with his assistant Desmond Floyd (Dennis Christopher). Two women meet Margaret (Karen Kopins), whose sister was kidnapped by an evil white slave trader (John Heart). Can he find Jake and Desmond to help him rescue his tongue and convince him? <br /> <br /> is a naughty and Chess film that does not claim to be anything. I will give this a recommendation Enjoy movies you want to have fun and those who do not accept everything face to face <br /> <br /> Recommended.
