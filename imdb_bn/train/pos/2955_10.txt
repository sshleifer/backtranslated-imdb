I always got a specific attraction in the discovery of the super-unknown movie. This invention has almost always been theatrical films - in my experience, unknown science-actions, actions and fears are very, unknown for very good reason. I found "High Tide" in a junk store video, mixing innumerable taps in innumerable taps. <br /> <br /> When I was watching Judy Davis (Lily) throughout this movie, I was sure that I could find it. Was a great undiscovered performance observer. Yes, I have seen Davis in a very small part of the past - and has played "A Passage to India". However, although he was fantastic in previous films, "High Tide" is a completely different animal. Recently seeing Gilly's Armstrong's next film "Charlotte Gray", I was aware of his actor's opinion. Davis Cate attracts a lot more than a momentary look with blanchate - both the way and the sensitivity. <br /> <br /> The performance of Judy Davis is stunning, I can not say enough good about it. He shared a wonderful on-screen relationship with young actors Claudie Caravan (as Ally), another great actress in this film. Here they have shared many drama and quiet humanity, the details of which I do not want to publish here (see for yourself!). To cover a survey, "Hi Tide" is much better. In fact, I'll rarely care about - the film is good enough for myself. In conclusion, I would like to appreciate the producer Laura Jones for understanding his superb conversation director, director Jillian Armstrong for understanding the actors and for the great Russell Boyd to reduce his brilliant cinematography (see his work in "Tender Mercies").
