Dream Quest was a wonderful good movie. There were some significant caves, but it could be expected in a film that was created in such a short time. I did not feel any desire to move forward during the movie and I found it pretty. It gets stupid kind of time, but overall I recommend it. They probably used all shiny glasses in nearby shops, and the costume design was quite good.
