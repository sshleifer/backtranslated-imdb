All the Hoopla, this film is for the respect and recognition gained from the Kung Fu historians, yet it has a weird lack of two disaster areas: action and war scenes. But I certainly want to say that the plot is probably the best and most original seen in the martial arts film. Without doubt, five serious genomes must be seen, not only this, but a film that you can see repeatedly; But I must say that after watching it you could have been better. It's somehow you want something, you want more. Producer Chang Che set a beautiful story for a possible masterpiece but does not follow the action we want to do. The film style of the film really captures the audience (centriped, snake, scorpio, leezer, toad) and they are shown, but the battles are significantly smaller. Todd and Snake styles are especially stimulating and it should be seen, much more, Todd is actually killed by the film. Interestingly, the absence of sufficient constant action or warfare with this film leads to the development of a huge plot, it is one of the few Kung Fu movies where you really care about stories and outcomes. This movie has a dark and harmful tone and you thought. The weapons and torture techniques of the movie are used throughout the movie and join the films. To stop the movie and introduce toxic descent producer Chang, we take us to a weaker dungeon. The last battle scenery is certainly good but muffled and the way you expected more. Although this movie is the best of Shaw Brothers and it is quite enjoyable. My overall impression of the film will be concluded: The fighters used by fighters have shown us only and are not shown in detail, sadly, the hand of the director has some great rights for the product and it did not expand. . I have wondered what might be with this movie, yet one of the best though. 10 out of 8 on the scale
