I saw this film in the worst case scenario. I missed 15 minutes to wake up in international flight between Sydney and Seoul. I did not know what I was watching, perhaps it was a movie of the week, but quickly turned into an actress acting faster, whose child was kidnapped. The compound started to rotate and did not come back and with the last achievement I was scamming through the in-flight guide which I saw. I discovered the Dell-Yen gin belt, who won the best actress in the ear for this role. I do not know whether the Secret Sunshine is a Korean movie model, but I'm going away from the DVD store to discover more.
