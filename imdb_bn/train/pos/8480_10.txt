Thanks to the Warner archive, I can again see this huge variety of shows which drop everything in the kitchen sink. (Bathtub, but present.) The film gave a screen-time to everyone who had contracted with the warners at the time. Some artists seem to be strangers because they were big in silent days, and most talkies fade with popularity. As well as some of the vaudeville era are really remarkable artists. You will be most affected with Winnie Lightner, who performed two numbers. Also the French star, Irene Bordoni who is singing a love song in a sexy way. Probably one of the biggest highlights is the "Chinese Fantasy," which is restored for this version of two strip technikollars. It's really nice and it stars Marina Laure and Nick Lucas. Finally, there is a larger "Lady Lux" final which goes about a quarter of an hour. This is really an epic of the first talkie era. Any old movie buff would love this.
