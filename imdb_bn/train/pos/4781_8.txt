Plateau Drive made me a special fan of David Lynch. He is a modern genius, because he is only a filmmaker. There is a spell that crosses his story and screen of his style. So the Starlight star was pretty surprised to me, the story and sunny set were easy to follow. Still, there are lynchies, and, when it is far from its best, it will not be missed. Finally Richard Farnsworth's performance is one reason. <br /> <br /> 8/10
