OK said this movie well but you must see it as watch value. It is about two sons, Mac and Sam who work as friends and fashion photographer and start a comedic period when Mac (Akshay Kumar) starts dating with 3-year-old wives at the same time doubting the wife at the same time. Sam gets fate and almost completely forgets his friend. But Mac thinks so and so he started dating with air hostesses. Every step of the film produces garment spices, but there is a slight lack of music. Do not mark up comedy and deserve a prize. Excellent but not all excellent. Some people laugh till their stomach belly but many laughs were not worthy. But of course everyone's opinion is different. So if you want to see the movie you are welcome to do so.
