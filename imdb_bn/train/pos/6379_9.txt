Films "Atlantis: The Last Empire" Recently a burning jewel of the ruins of the Disney studio production films "Jungle Book 2" or even a Pokemon movie, the parents of the film will surely express this gratitude. <br /> <br /> This film is one of the few to try in the original story. The previous feature films were only details of the existing story. Such as "Toy Story", "Finding Nemo" and "Monster Incorporated" movies. Everyone works the same, but it should definitely be noted that all of the pixels are made and distributed only by Disney. Recent Disney movies have been released on most of the live video, and this is an upcoming successful movie's Siegel. The quality of those films is given in the way of profitability. It was a new era with "Mulan", "Lilo and Sew", and recently "Open Range" with "Atlantis". The author created all the original story lines instead of fairytale stories from the past. <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie is dedicated to the search of Atlantis, a work that holds many imagination for hundreds of years. Together with J Fox's spoken young Milo Thecheck. Milo Washington D. C. Employed by a museum. His grandfather was a famous archaeologist, who dedicated his life to the discovery of Atlantis. It is seen as a waste by his colleagues, and they are willing to follow Milo to walk him. After failing to satisfy the Museum Board of Directors for sponsoring his mission, he came home to find a woman in his dark apartment. Take him to his employer, Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was close friend of Milo's grandfather, and wanted to send a team to Milo in search of Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore has given too much wealth and everything for the better. The crew carrying her is the same as her grandfather. To overcome the journey is filled with many great obstacles and great fun to see. The viewer caught himself if they would reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected change after the discovery of Atlantis, not just the invention of humans. It is enough to keep interest in old viewers. <br /> <br /> Animationers did an excellent job in the depth of animation. Very successful in combining traditional animations with computer-generated images. A feat is not easily achieved, most listeners quickly notice two differences. Characters are trustworthy people. With a lot of action going on, there are some nice chez type scenery. Some curiosity is filled with jokes that children may not get it. <br /> <br /> The creativity of the authors is truly enlightened. Atlantis is widely developed, including a complete language of culture. The film is like historical sources, such as using Atlanta's references from Plato. The disappearance of the Atlantis from the world has been explained. Trustworthy, if by a young audience, that magic really exists. The people's power of Atlantis is not presented properly as magic, but in this way it can be best described. <br /> <br /> Although the level of technology set in 1914 is unrealistic. The journey is in a submarine, which is very memorable for Captain Nemo's Nautilus, which is completed with the bays of burning torpedoes in the fire. The giant diggers are powered by steam boilers so they have tried for some era technology. Female characters are empowered in such a way that the older women play leadership role. It's not bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What? The first feature film, a tradition that started with "Snow White" and a tradition driven by "The Lion King", almost every Disney movie is completely full of songs. This is great and all, without the seven high dwarfs "Hi Ho!" Will be It will be almost good after billions of years, but this is a parent's salvation. Every single person on the screen does not know of a song suddenly that the song is never heard before and it is broken. I am grateful for one. <br /> <br /> Animation story and depth are both guaranteed to keep the guardian and child's attention alike. This is a movie that I want to meet again with my kids.
