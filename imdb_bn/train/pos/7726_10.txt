I have always been so disappointed that most of the science fiction films are inter-caste Western or war drama. Even Star Wars, which is visually bright, one of its central images, is a future "gang that can not shoot directly." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The forbidden planet, It's still very good. The story is based on the long abolished civilization, Crawl, who created the machine, which could raise an intelligence by quantum leaps. Unfortunately, what they did not exchange for, the brain is the center of thought rather than intellectuals. The brain's primitive aspect, ID, is called Fred, it is allowed to go strangers. It is released from sleep, a bad dream comes to the municipal existence. Walter Kuburt, Dr. Morbius, who hugged his brain in this brain and created machines and protections with it, which kept him scared only one step ahead of his mind. His thoughts are frustrating that he will not be able to save quickly. Creele, a much higher species, can not stop it; It destroyed them. Landing party was not very interested in me. The rest of the actor is quite exchangable. Anne Francis will be produced beautifully and homely, and certainly a response within fifty-five male men. Her father's turmoil was excited by her innocence and wolfy Fifty Astronaut (more like the construction workers they created than real astronauts). They are always trying to find "Dames". With a great character cooking, her obsession for hooch Robot has much more personality than most crew, and if a miracle happens, Mr. Spoke does not accept the literary thinking of this artificial animal. The whole movie as the situation star is very satisfied. Marbius can not return and so she is determined to destroy herself and everything with her. There are several science fiction films which are worth more than once; This is one that can make the coast right in the 21st century.
