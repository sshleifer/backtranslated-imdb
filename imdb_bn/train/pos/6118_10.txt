Jack Frost is really a cool movie. I mean ... it's fun. Her violent. And very enjoyable Most people say that it is B-rated, but it can not be much better than the truth. It has great special effects and good acting. Only strange thing, killer Snowman. I think this movie is actually one of the best films of the last decade. Most movies these days lack the Clive Barker Master PC standards. In other words, be real and give the audience what they expect. Jack Frost is very cool 10 out of 10 Grade: A +. Ed also features movie Uncle Sam from Jack Frost's fan.
