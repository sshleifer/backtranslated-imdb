This is one of the best series, Resident Evil 3 is ranked with. Nameses (or Bayohargard: The Last Expiration) is a very good story in this game that you play as Claire Redfield in search of his brother Chris Redfield. You probably know who the original resident Evil knows) is as terrible as the other resident Evil, and there are many more cats. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** ***** Stars (ratings based on comparison to other video games)
