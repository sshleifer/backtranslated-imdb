I first saw this movie three years ago, and it was then presented by Disney Chief Engineer and Real Jim Morris. <br /> <br /> Around a month ago, it came back to TV, and this time I taped it. Since then, I have seen it at least three times. <br /> <br /> This is an amazing, inspirational, good film that is played by everyone intelligently written and reliably related. It's going to be sensitive towards the book, as well as all the other clinches. <br /> <br /> This is refreshing to see a movie where the kids are not blurred and there are completely behavioral problems, and jocks are not portrayed as testosterone-powered muscleheads. <br /> <br /> This is just plain people who have dreams like you. <br /> <br /> I think, as the other extreme character that has gone Hollywood, they use the term "reti realism", create movies where everyone curses and problems with aggression. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a person who dreams and encourages friends and family to follow the dream. Big Lake TX people say so many people that I want to go there. <br /> <br /> As I said B4, the film does not try to go overboard with the feeling. Dennis Quaid, as usual, never disappointed. I've seen him since late 70's, and he's so humble. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Prior to the game, Drog has been practicing and his wife called him from the stand. She rushes on and reached to her family. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
