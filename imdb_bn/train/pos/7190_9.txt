Zorro Serial is the best and my favorite serial, time. It is a serial set after the birth of Mexico. The country is counting the new nation on gold made for the Republic's solvent. But the gold deity, Don dell Oro is pushing Indians and stealing gold for themselves. His men and his band rescued the band. Reed Haddley wins the winner and he spends dashing as a nice selection of skaps (which is later reused by a serial and other serials). The story and its nicely clean is not the real bad guy One reason I've seen most of the serials that I saw it, it's simply a great action adventure film. The only thing that I can compare is that of Mark Twiron's Zerro or one of the most important Sashblocks. Its super and highly recommended.
