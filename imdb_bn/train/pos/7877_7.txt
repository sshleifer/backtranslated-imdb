Write words <br /> <br /> What you see is what you get. Actually it does not! The brave and brilliant 'Page 3' of Madhup Bhandarkar destroys the myths associated with glam and fascination, which are the pages of our newspaper and whose life (party practices fall in) we follow with the psychological intensity that can only explain our inner horror style. <br /> <br /> Page 3 The incident is disproportionate as it is incompatible. How it was controlled on the printed word and when it started stopping in another page was another controversy. The repository shield that shovel. He is only concerned with the process of this extraordinary existence. And while this works, he has a piece of different material pieces in this way of life together. Like Robert Ottman (though I'm not comparing Altman's talents with the designer), the reporter uses countless letters to further his intentions. Whether it's a Page 3, NNI's Prank, Gate Crashar, Freshman, an upcoming model, a socialist politician or a erotic novel writer; All the characters are launched with an objective and each of them has a separate letter-sketch, even if their part can be tiny. And there are movie appeals. <br /> <br /> Konkona Sen Sharma has played Madhuvi Sharma, a young and talented journalist who has added Page 3 for today's nation. Initially the material with his job, soon he started to see the ugly of the underlying that covered by this fraud and cosmetic profligacy. But the designer stops the temptation to turn this subject into a moral-police movie and focus on one character. Therefore, this film is not only about Madhavi, but also about Deepak Suri (Boman Irani) - Madhubi's editor who is a large instrument, Anjali Thapar (Soni Razdan) - a socialist who is suffering from social pollution, Abhijeet (Rehan Engineer) - a homosexual makeup Artist and Madhavi's Roommates Pearl (Moridul in the evening) - Sassy Airhostes and Gayatri (Big Sharma) -Kahit Actress. Many characters (and more) in one story seem to be impossible to combine it, but net credits to write a complete screenplay for Net Arora and Manoj Tea Agi. Sanjib Dutt and Bhandarkar's dialogue were written with a special attention. <br /> <br /> No description, no matter how good, can be flat with the lack of real performance. Thankfully, 'Page 3' with actors is not brims and big. Konkona easily goes through its author-supported role with ease. Ditto Boman In the evening, Mridul received the best part written, but it is almost finished. Atul Kulkarni is lost with an underwritten character. Occasionally, the director seems very interested to include as much as possible (pedophilia, homosexuality, etc.). But they do not allow the context they are used to look at them. Finally, the effort of the vendor to abandon our cruelty, but he took it one more step. He takes us inside our photographs and expresses the terrible reality of this tribe of humanity which seems strange and is living in distant lands. These are the new people who became rebel in the new year, when hundreds of kilometers away, their fellow countrymen were destroyed by nature's hatred! Glossy writing, skillful music included, capable performance and genuine feeling of sincerity, makes this movie worthy of laziness and lack of poor production value. The best way to enter 'Page 3' is to enter the new year. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandarak <br /> <br /> Ratings- **** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ** *** Excellent <br /> <br /> January 29, 2005
