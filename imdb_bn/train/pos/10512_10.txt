At first I ate this movie in VVS, only to buy it on DVD, it's always my favorite movies. I read the book, but I really think the movie is even better. Mr. Knightley is a wonderful choice as I like Gammaam Paltrow as Emma and Jeremy Northam. She was brilliant <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a 10/10 movie !!! <br /> <br />
