Other critics have made this photo nova well shortened. I just "Whew!" Elisha Cook apparently wanted to add a commentary about the coke-fuel drumming episode. It was a doozy, I would say. The dog is worth some praise for his crazy performance. <br /> <br /> I'm a little surprised: Barbara Stanowyak appeared as a waitress in the 1941 Barbara film "Ball of Fire". He was the nightclub waiter, where Barbara was singing and the legendary drummer Jean Krupa gradually rebuked. The dog's wonderful movie "Phantom Lady" was inspired by Cooper's work, which was seen by Cook three years ago? <br /> <br /> If you see a crop in "Ball of Fire", then you may notice some clear body movements. One hopes, of course, at that time he was not influenced by any drugs!
