What can I say about this picture which was not already mentioned? Really speaking, it looks very fake like a jump and kick. How does Charlie Shin know this real though I do not know. I'm sure that they will be hit and it will be very difficult if its kickting. But with pinching and hot oil the scene looks very real. And the final needle of the eye scene was amazingly done and the only thing in the movie that never disappointed me.
