If you apologize if you are not able to get a movie in the DVD, then it is probably 'enlightened' which you are looking for. How often do you do comedy routine stand up? I was very young to see Richard Pearl at his best time, and when I was young enough to see Eddie Morphy's 'awful' and 'ray' (not ridiculous), I did not know where Eddie got a big part of his inspiration. Now I'm old, and after most of the comedians after Professor and Marfi, I realize two things: Everyone's Style from Eddie, and the boyfriend from Eddie Richard. The huge difference: Eddie is original, interesting, provocative, thoughtful ?? And more. She had never seen anything before. She was always we needed. This day Eddie Murphy is annoying and old ?? But once he was a king, and 'Delirious' was the greatest fortress ever built. Really is one of the fun routines all the time.
