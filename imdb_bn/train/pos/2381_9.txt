"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film, which is a great effort and a great effort. Yes. Come to the goal of re-establishing Wales's classic book. Mr. Hines is doing so successful. I, and those who watched my movie with me, praised this year that it is not such a standard, predictable Hollywood rental every year. The Spielberg edition with Tom Cruise was the least similar to the book. Obviously, everyone looks for things in the movie. Those who consider themselves as amateur "critics" can only criticize what they can do. Others rate a movie in a more important background, such as entertainment, which most people do not agree with "critics". We m Hines to HG Enjoyed the faithfulness of Wales's classic novel, and we found it very entertaining. This "critics" made it easier to ignore what its errors are.
