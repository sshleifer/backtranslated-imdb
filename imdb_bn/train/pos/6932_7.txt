The story of Winchester's 73 man (Jimmy Stewart), a repeat rifle made by Winchester, is involved in returning his valuable possession. The rifle keeps changing hands, and Stuart keeps doggedly after it. Ethn Manner's 1950 B & W effort is more a crime film than the current West, and golf often seems more like the modern gangsters than the older gangsters. Shelley Winters plays a woman of a suspect, who is going to marry a man (Charles Drake) with a cat. He ended the fall for Stewart, but before he is not passed near a bit. Winters is one of the most complex characters in a film filled with extraordinary characters. Look for a small Dan Dureyea for a very small role as a tiny murderer and Toni Curtis. A depressed miscast will be playing Geer Wyatt Earp.
