Christmas survival is a wonderful fun movie, especially when it was first published and considered bad promotion. Ben Affleck is a funny one million dollar funny thing, which makes money for the family which occupies it as his family for Christmas for his childhood home. Then he drives the family rails with excessive laziness for Christmas joy. I was not like the Ben Affleck fan in the past (although I like Daredevil and Peachk) but here he played well in this role. I like Christina Applegate as a family girl who can not stand the character of the first time. Of course you can see where this movie is going but you are not taking any care. Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie because it's more fun than many Christmas movies.
