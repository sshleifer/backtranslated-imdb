Vince Lombardy is a new principal of high school - Bad Miss Togor (Mary Woronov). He is all willing to bury rock and roll music together. He raised his head with Riff Randall (P. J. Souls) who loves Ramon. Also the head of the school football team (Vincent Van Paten) can not connect to any girl - interesting Kate Ramboo (Day Young) can not understand. <br /> <br /> One instant midnight movie. It was a common bomb and almost immediate bombing - but it was a huge hit as midnight film and all the games were playing in the 1980s. When I was in college, some of them seemed to attend - it was like a party! People singing songs as well, laughing fun and laughing fun. <br /> <br /> Now I can not imagine why I love so much as an adult. The script is full of teenagers and crying that I could not believe I was listening. Characters change randomly and the movie goes jumping all over. What's in this save is some really real funny lines and surprising performance by Soles and Woronov (really enjoyed yourself). Also full of everyone's strengths and playing their role at the top (as they should). For the Ramonans ... I have never been a fan. I like the title tune, but the rest of the songs have never been counted. If you are a Ramon fan then you can give it a high rating. <br /> <br /> Speaker Alert !!!! It's mostly for kids (it has a PG rating) who will probably find it stupid but fun. I especially think that they will end in high school! SPILILER END !!!! <br /> <br /> So, if you're in the mood of midnight movie in the mid-1980's, you might like it. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7.
