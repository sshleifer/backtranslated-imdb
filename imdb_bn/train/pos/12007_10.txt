This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen. I was led by about 150 people in St. George and we saw this movie in the tour station of St. George. One of the viewers did not have a dry eye. Also, there were some non-religious and anti-dignitaries in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and rekindled the fascinating music and the story of progress and their hardships they faced because of their faith. <Br> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to know more about Joseph and the troubles that the pioneers are going through. After all, it isolated American history.
