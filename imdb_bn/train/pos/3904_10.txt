In my opinion, it's the best stand up show I've ever seen. After killing the groom, I became an instant Eddie fan, but I must say that this is his best work. I would say, though, if you definitely get the chance to see him alive. It's valuable! <br /> <br /> Several times after the stand stand routine, it starts to become old. But I must say, I have seen this event many times that I literally remembered the whole thing (which is yes, I feel very sad) but every joke still smiles me. This really seems to be a good show <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
