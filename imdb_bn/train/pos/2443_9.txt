This film may not be in the best light of the Catholic Church, but it is telling a story based on true facts. Unfortunately, with religion, everything in life is beautiful and not pink. Sometimes people and groups consider things to be the right thing, but they did not look as good as they once did in the past. "A Love Divideed" tells the story of a family, yes it combines religion, but in reality it is not a matter of putting together a story about a family and the family that put them on them. This picture is not based on the fact that the scene view of the story is true, but if you want to see the news articles of that period, you will see that churches did not manage this phenomenon in a way that was helpful to the family. Both churches here blame the Catholic Church for not complying with such comments to the family in the early part of the Catholic Church and to respond to the violence and the comments of the Protestant Church that she should force her husband and her priest and make a fight. No In this case both of these families are given below. I believe that the film does a good job to show this struggle in both the Church and the family. It does not in any way shape or form under the Catholic Church, on the contrary, it shows how any event can change the concepts of that religion and how a person can make its own effect more effective.
