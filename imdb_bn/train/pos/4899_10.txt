I'm so happy that I saw this video in the store. I was looking for some happy movies and this one turned out to be truly gem. I love the story of love, not some beautiful twenty; Rather, it is the story of some beautiful 60 stories, who used 20. This is a good, well written and wonderful acting story that throws as well as the fantastic WWII band music. It got a delightful surprise for lovers of the Scottish castle. It made me laugh and ready to watch again, which I did several times before turning it on. I highly recommend.
