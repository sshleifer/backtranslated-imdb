Every day we can see a large number of pictures, soap ... on the TV. Sometimes a miracle happens. A great movie, with a great feeling, with real feeling, a great implementation director-director. There are two pictures for me that everyone needs to see: The first is the pakula? "Sofie Likes" with Merrill Strip The second is "Hope Journey". As a human, we need to know about our humility, love of others, acceptance of other civilizations, and other ways of living. We must fight against racism and fascism. We will avoid judgment, criticism; We only have to love our earthly companions. This extraordinary film helps us to get Lenan to dream: Imagine all the people living with peace. These two films are hard to see: See these, but make sure you hit but good. Great movies, great actors, terrible stories, pain and tears guarantee, but good understanding of others. Enjoy
