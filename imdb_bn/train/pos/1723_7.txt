Excellent P.O.W. The adventure, taken by Eric Williams from his own book (which is a copy of a paper which is part of my father's library) which was inspired by true events; It may well be the first film of its kind, and, so, have a lot to answer ?? ALBERT, R.N. Just like the hard-top-lipped examples. (1953; which I will now see), The Coldidge Story (1955) and Danger Indin (1959), but the high profile is published from the other side of the Atlantic, such as Stalag 17 (1953) and The Great Escap (1963). After that, it laid the ground firmly: the internal soldiers of the German camp made a great plan to borrow a page from Greek legend and escape ?? Burrowing under a vaulting horse used in full scenes of physical exercises and their detainees! In fact, the film has been divided into two parts: the first is the first agreement with the tunnel drilling process, which escapes and later portrays their fate outside the camp, when they try to do it in neutral Sweden. Generally, among these British movies, many customs characters (Anthony Dawson), Brian Forbes, Lynn Jane, Anthony Steele, and Up-As-Asing (Peter Finch, David Tommlinson, and Bill Travers) Michael Goodleaf and Walter Gotal).

As expected, the statement contains lots of mystery and tension; Most male central P.O.D. Sagas, too, is the least vested interest in female interest. Director Lee was not long career ?? Is this a bit more similar (though both settings of setting and perspective change) a Town Alice (1956) its most significant achievement ?? But he must feed every secret situation in this case (even if, when the filming time is delayed, then Lee leaves his attempt in an emergency?) The producer Ian delimmel leaves the job of ending!). However, the special mention is absolutely fine light (especially time sequence time during the night).
