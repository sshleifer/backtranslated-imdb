This is the best movie version of Dicken's classic story. I have seen over VHS over, and have recently achieved the DVD version, which is designed for TV (not screen). What interesting interest I have about this telepole is that since 1984, since the appearance of other films / shows in North America since 1984, cast of accredited English actors My biggest surprise is that of Edward Woodward, "Eclectier", Whit of Christmas Present.
