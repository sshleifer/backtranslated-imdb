This indie film shows the lives of a group of adult swimming class people in Connecticut. The plot is roughly thin. What is the character of the film drive, played by nicely mostly unknown actors. Cast standouts are as marine problems as teachers in Human school and Schuster as a casino dealer who as a stripper as Brighter as Moonlights. Two actresses give natural performances and work well together. This is a fascinating feature film for author Schechter and Director Setton debut. Modern keeps the details moving at a quick clip. The movie title and poster offer a little messy, but it's a fantastic little comedy-drama.
