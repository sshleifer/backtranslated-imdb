Having a giant monster fan, I see an "sharp" an absolute must, especially after hearing about it a lot. Well thanks to the good bullet market, I was able to find a copy very easily, and I was pleasantly surprised to see this glimpse actually, I said, honest, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For what it is humble, in fact, such a fat giant-giant flick. It immediately starts immediately because it is instantly available instantly and we introduce different characters, some of them are lazy, some good people, and any girl is mostly one of the most beautiful women in the film, very impressive scientist. <br /> <br /> The straight man outside of the original Woodstock concert, and, in fact, does not think of a father as bad, especially after identifying a kind of fantasy cage like the world. He is not Godzilla - despite his illogical awakening, he did not even scoff (actually he rarely destroys anything in the whole film), but it seems very annoying when trying to find some things. The sharp English understands English very well (my copy is dubbed in English) and he knows what good boys and bad guys are However, we want to see the huge giant pilgrims doing their work, and she is mostly in the whole movie, and usually in a low-budget fashion, she can resize depending on the scene, and a group of "fake legs" shots there. There's standing there. <br /> <br /> Yes, special effects are not the best, but here are some good things. A scene that is sharp sharp through the pilgrimage, and on the other hand, it uses the windows of a building as "step by step" to climb it from top - each window seals with its feet and often shines in the residents. - A sequence that actually looks much better than many "bad" movies. <br /> <br /> "Pilgrims" never say less, "APE". In fact, the only time when real excitement comes near is that the beautiful girl is the reason for her sharpening and she takes her eyebrows towards the "Oh baby" method. But this is not bad, the kindergarten laughs with the audience. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite long for such a thing, but surprisingly it is not annoying - the story is really good, and if you see this completely fantastic actress on the screen, any male audience will be happy. <br /> <br /> "The pilgrim" can not live on the upper coast of the monster giant Flickr, but it is certainly better than other King Kong '76 Epipus of "APE" and "Queen Kong" by far away.
