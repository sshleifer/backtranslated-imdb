Well, basically it is a populated scientist film, but from the beginning it is clear that it has been managed by a larger intelligence. You can count about 10 glasses uploaded by the movie, but it only distributes between three and some of them have a package that lets you know again that the director did not tell you that you are an idiot. Cart Russell's performance brings genuine and impressive and fruitful character. Recommended if you just look a little stupid and want to rebuild your faith!
