Writer / director John Hughes covers all bushies (normal) with this bitter sweet "Sunday afternoon" family movie. "Coralie Suu" is a sweet, steady orphan, caring from childhood by "bills". Couples lock their wits when they travel to America's Great America to meet the "very nice" UPP lawyer, and the rest are expected. Children will love this movie, as they can 9-year-old Alison Potter (who became Pepsi's advert "You Go Girl!") related to acting heroine. The character is considered to be 6 or 7, since he is considered to go to school. Some of his vocabulary recommend that he is 9 or older. <br /> <br /> Like "home alone", there is a little fist to throw a lot of slap-stick and big fat chords. Again, it made a "audience" film, aimed at a young audience. Recreational and heartwarming Do not look for any surprises, but be prepared to run a tier or two.
