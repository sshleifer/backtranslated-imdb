When I first started watching this anime, I never thought that something interesting might be made on the bread, but I was wrong with gratitude. From the moment I started to see it, anime just dragged me into the world of bread making, I gave fingers. <br /> <br /> The biggest advantage of this anime is its humor, which is very intelligent and very funny, some gags repeat. But animation, soundtrack and character development are less than average, although due to the great work of this episode, these losses are not so much seen in the first episodes, it actually begins to show up in the last 20 episodes, when the reaction and repetition gags are only aging, and as before Not funny <br /> <br /> As far as I am concerned, if this anime ends with episode 52 I will give it a 9, but the last episodes only release a bitter thirst, which sadly can not be washed by 50 extraordinary episodes. <br /> <br /> 7/10
