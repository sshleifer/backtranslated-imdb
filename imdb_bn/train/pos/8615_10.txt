I waited for a while in Canada to wait for this movie, and in the end I was very excited to see it. I really enjoyed it. Of course, at the beginning, it's a very sad movie (and it was the New Year's Day - it's even tragic) - but it does stick with you. The next day I was thinking about it again, because even though it is moving around something emotively emitted, but after a while it seems that it is a beautiful story. How can a person be seen as a link to so many people, but sometimes you may be blinded by many things. And how the character of Diane Keaton is the only way to save the rest of them. And how they processed their side as well. This is an excellent movie and Chris Pine (one of my favorite actors) offers perfect comic relief. It is certainly a movie which needs a box of tissues, but for a long time you really have to be with you.
