It has been my favorite movie for a long time. Recently I was happy to see it in DVD which is a relief from seeing older, grainy VHS versions. <br /> <br /> I have not seen it for so many years and I have seen today how wonderful it is that it is astonished. The movie stood till the time. This is one of the rare, perfect storms where comedy (where funny line after real funny line) is associated with great instruction and extraordinary performance at the same time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Murray's performance in "Arthur" does not win the best actor of Oscar's performance, no comedian can ever win the title (another example is "John Frankenstein" in Gene Wilder). <br /> <br /> <br /> The image of the craftsmanship really fulfills each character and warm hearty voice of character. Quite simply, IMHO movie is a rare jewel. Only a year after the release of "Arthur" Steve Gordon has died, it's just sad. <br /> <br /> As per 1/2007 DVD available, it is so / so Although the video quality has a leap on the old VHS copies, there is no widescreen version. <br /> <br /> There are some additional extras in the DVD but this is not enough. An example was from the director, commenting on how he specifically deleted and included how the scenes were expressed (because he was violent), but for a final edit he had to make difficult choices. Having the perfect format included in the DVD, such components, of course it should have been given. <br /> <br /> This, the original "Arthur", is a classic comedy which is one of the books.
