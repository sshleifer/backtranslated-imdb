This movie is probably portrayed as low budget and British Columbia in Canada. The barriers to overcome this film (which were in California and the end of the 60s) to overcome this film were well captured. I believe that this is the best and most accurate version of the Russian assassins by attacking the city of Valujo and Bay region. Since 1968-19? (He was not captured). Edward James Olmos (Dave Dost Toski) and George Dujanda (at Arthur Leigh Allen in Russia believed that DNA and cleared by fingerprints) the cats and the mouse to watch the crime together, each one saw a Trying to trigger the trigger in mental revelation. Dying from some kind of terminal disease of Olmos and Dzundza knowing it, still completely losing his family and obsessed point of becoming a full bloating along the way. Dzundza is completely unknown and abducted (like all serial killers) in his waking up killings. The only disappointment "top" has ended, otherwise it is quite accurate. If you usually tie the Hollywood Faf or look for interest in Russia, check it out.
