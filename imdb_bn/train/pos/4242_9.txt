I read the book and saw the movie. Excellent both. In this era, the movie is the diamond of coal. Liebman and Selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their character without errors. These pictures should make them bigger. The studio is not to keep all of the images behind it, but it's worth studying in the studio. This can easily be a franchise. The DVD must be released and a suitable remix will revive this movie. Find it in your TV directory and see how long it may be, if you see it listed. You will not be disappointed. Do yourself a favor - read the book (same title). It will blow you away Times have changed dramatically from that day, or at least we think they have.
