Am I using a rifle on a rifle-bracket movie and also asked about the eligibility of the bullet that he was firing. I guess if it is 7 mm based on Carlos Hathak's snaping. Round. I'm interested in myself own rifles. He commented on the final sniper film about the rifle that the people of Vietnam let him use it with his father. Beckett mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever I want to know that there is a rifle too. I know that this special rifle was created before or before WWII. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> killed. After recovering from wounds in Vietnam due to her wounds, she spent the rest of her career in the USMC with the necessary skills in the field of sniper training. His graduation career is still mentioned to our brothers and sisters who are trained at the USMC. I have found his friend who is a former Marine. Any information can be great.
