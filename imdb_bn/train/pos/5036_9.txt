I am amazed by his debut as the director of Ferrari with Alliance's Bill Paxton, Dark and Terminator fame. He hits all the cylinders, but there is an uncertainty at the end of the FBI agent (Power booth), which would otherwise exclude a point from the cool and anxious thriller thriller. Even more than that, this movie was just fine. <br /> <br /> Bill Paxton plays father. He never gave the first name, but it is not the film's weakness. It actually strengthens the film, lets viewers see it as some kind of symbol. He one day saw a visit that he had sent him to God that he was told that the world is going to end and he and his two sons, Fenton Mix (Matt Wolory) and Adam Mix (Jeremy Samper), both have to suppress ghosts and kill them. . . The ghosts kill like ordinary people, and wonder that if the father has lost his mind only, or he is actually doing God's work There are scenes that portray both points associated with confusion and make the movie even more susceptible. <br /> <br /> The story is now being grown up with flashbacks (Matthew McConaughey) and FBI agent Wesley W. (Wheelbooth) with very suspicious and justified. Since it is not everyday, someone comes to your office and can tell you that he knows who the murderer is. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of twists in this movie, and Bill Paxton guides us well by guessing lost interest. Acting is incredible. Two young people and Paxton do great work together, they feel like normal families, though they are all involved in the murder. I said that power has an impairment in the booth character, but it is not really big. It was a very well made film involving faith and family.
