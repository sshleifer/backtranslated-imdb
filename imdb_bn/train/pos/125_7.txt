Lauras von Trier is not chasing behind trying new strategies. Many of them have forgotten the original and others better. <br /> <br /> He portrayed North Germany as a night's journey. There are many cities in the ruins, the German-born young American Leo Castler is obliged to help them rebuild. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is to be met. A chalk mark is made on seal when the shoe is polished. A terrible argument ensues that the shoes of a feather is not chalked in spite of being polished when they are polished. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Leo In search of the dash through the rear cars, the semi-hungry bodies are running away from the inventive. These pictures, they are awful, dreamy, fast, each one's own terrible influence is still unconnected. <br /> <br /> Jump into the train with Urumage Leo in a station called a bird bomb. Considering many stand-bys, he connects the bomb to the bottom of the car. She makes a connection back to her cabin and a time clock. Later, he jumped from the train (high speed) and stayed in the cool grass on the banks of the river. Looking at the star above, he decided that his work was not to be built and destroyed. Later he saw a train reaching a giant bridge, he looked at the train and ran at the boring speed to stop the clock. If you care about the situation analysis it is a completely impossible task. Actually quite ridiculous It can only happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Although this film is widely acclaimed, I like the next films of Lars von Trier (Breaking Waves and Idiot). The bomb scene described above really close me. Perhaps I'm a realistic one.
