In 2002 I saw this greatest movie, where I used to mainstream films. It is rich and works in a beautiful artistic work from these 11 small films. From technical information (elected director), I was afraid it would be an anti-American basis, but ... it's a kind (11 times) personal tribute <br /> <br /> The weakest aspect is from Y. He does not manage to "swallow his pride" and does not regard this event as a punishable punishment ... it is actually the weakest part of the film, but it is the original piece of sentence in the whole piece Gives evidence. Wonderful Mexican comes from the almost conceptual art industry ... I am not sure yet at that. What is the meaning of Gonzalez Inner 9 perfect (K., Loch, S. Pen, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or almost perfect (C. Leloch) and my smile, or cry or even surprised me. I do not know yet Whether the story of Imamurah is related to the September 11th disaster, or whether it is so beautiful that its last place deeply 'makes it'.
