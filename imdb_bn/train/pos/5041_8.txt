Matthew McConaughey is a mysterious person waiting for Agent Wesley Doyle (Power Booth) in his FBI office. He has demanded a series of FBI assassin information. When the agent comes to the office when he comes to the office, he told him that the serial killer is actually his dead brother. The agent has requested some evidence in the deal, and people tell stories from his childhood, his life. They had an ordinary family of three: his widow, Mixes (Bill Paxton), his brother and himself. One night, his father gathered two brothers and told them that an angel of God went to him and appointed his family to destroy the monster. The most horrific movie I've ever seen what happened next. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in VHS four months ago, and yesterday I saw the DVD again. Although having a low budget movie, screenplay with no flaw sharp. Cast is outstanding, but I like to highlight Matt O'Leary's performance as Young Fulton. It is a very difficult and complicated role performed by a young teenager. Bill Paxton's instructions are awesome. There is no obvious violence in this horror movie. A great debut behind the camera. I am sorry for the Brazilian title of this movie: 'A Mao Do Diebo' (The Devil's Hand). At least it was 'the hand of God', it could be acceptable. But calling this movie as 'The Devil's Hand' is really ridiculous. Brent Hannel, the screenwriter, did not deserve such deficiency from the Brazilian distributor. This film is highly recommended. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Mao Di Diabo" ("The Devil's Hand")
