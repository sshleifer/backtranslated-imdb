All right, I'll accept the cast of the film, really weird - this is part of the plot, but I still can not believe that Pierce Brosnan is playing this lead (though he has done a really good job). <br /> <br /> This was based on an English real story, who went to live with Canadian Indians in the early 20th century. He claimed to be a mixed blood Indian. In fact, he was so successful and well thought that people came to listen to his lectures and to bring him to the tracks in the desert - though he was not a mixed-blooded Indian and all his knowledge was hidden from the book! The movie is centered and what happened when the hack was unveiled. Acting and setting were awesome and I really like this picture (once I suspend my suspicions about Brosnan). It was not widely distributed - perhaps it was quite cerebral - a bond movie or romance - it's a really awesome movie about an extraordinary person.
