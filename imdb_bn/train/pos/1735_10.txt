Authors can bring everything in the first half of the scene of Miss Darkl's Starring - The American Civil War, the Great American West, San Francisco, its goddess, the Ballet, the Opera, the Vaudville, the Stage Coach Bandits and the Chinese Rubbish from the Franco-Prussian War. When you thought that the plot could not get a schuyure, it was. It's nice to take the tongue into the cheek. The character of DeCarlo (brought here - notes Solomon, the role that he dances) is dependent on the notorious Lola Montage career, who was King of Prussia and created revolution when he gave him crown jewel He fled to the American west. Based on historical truth that Lola Montage plays the role of Sodom there, in the city of Arizona there is a city called "Salom, Where She Nanched". StageCoach Cleve and the Russian nobleman who is falling under his surroundings is not historically correct, I suppose Chinese wise people with Scots accent - but it is my favorite all-time camp classic one and DeCarlo breathtakingly beautiful across the whole.
