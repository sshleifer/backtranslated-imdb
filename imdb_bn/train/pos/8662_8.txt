I liked this a lot. In fact, I see it again (and I plan) I just love it. I would like to say to other critics that this movie is really moving on you. It starts slowly but the way of effluents is very normal and it has a mood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters are a powerful element of reality and The movie produces a spell very slowly and slowly, when you are involved in various interactions between them and want to know how it will end and learn how to choose the characters. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised that there are fewer few comments on this topic - there are vague TV movies that make more comments after Rich in profit. <br /> <br /> Tell me one thing that I'm going crazy and I want to see it again. This is not a film that might not be for everyone but I think strongly (even those of almost all the film's intellectual friends who have seen almost every movie they did not see) and it does not seem that most of the message board, but I like it and those who Family plays that are visible, the atmosphere is warm and warm at the slow motion, They probably could look at it. It is especially noted in South Carolina that it is a jewel for the love of South Carolina (and like me) and for those movies that are held there. I'll add my vote to tragic comments and recommend this little known flick.
