I went in the hope of a good orchestral and playful thriller; And when it's something that is this film; I can not help but think it's a poor sloth of the people. The classic 1972 film is probably an inspiration for this movie; Especially in terms of conspiracy, but it is certainly the case for the death penalty. Michael Caine's cast in the central role is just to confirm it. This image focuses on a game based on Era Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary's Baby and The Stopford Wives) and focused on Sydney Bruhul; A playwright whose best day is behind her. After his latest game bomb, Sydney finds himself low; And a game called Deathtrap when it is not helped; He has written on an education written by an amateur, on his doorstep. The DeathTrap is a sure commercial success, and soon Sydney is starting to thrown a plot of its own; In which an amateur writer was invited to the round, to kill him, and then to stop the death penalty as his job. <br /> <br /> Despite all his cute twists and turns; DeathTrap falls down to a primary element, and that's the character. The film failed to deliver the single preferred character and it is very difficult to take care of the story if you are not routing it for a player. This is not helped by acting. Michael Cain puts your expectation as well and entertaining performance, but no one else is proud of himself. Christopher Reich is weird in his role, when Diane Canon tries to hate a possible favorite character with genuinely annoying performances. It's lucky that the story is good; And it's just good enough to save the film. Features lots of intriguing twists and turns; Some work better than others, but the film is always going to be quite sure to ensure interesting. Director Sidney Lloyt is eligible for some credit, because the film style is a big plus. The central position is interesting to its own right, and the film fits well. Overall, I acknowledge that I have enjoyed this picture; But it can be a lot better.
