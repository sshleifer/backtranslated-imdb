Although I love the city, I really like it. When Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly come, I'm a new actor. Although I heard them, I have not seen anything with them till recently. The first one I saw was the singular rain which made me a jin fan. I think that is very good. But I think this movie was good and some parts like all movies are better than others, but this is a great movie in my book and I like it. Frank and Gene made a good team. I'm still taking them to hell. But I'm gripping my guns that I really enjoyed it, and I love it!
