Oscar-eligibility performance by Peter Folk in the Oscar-qualifying-written role. I like the perfect, balanced exploration of long-term marriage - how can we get it in films often, where the film ends with a boy and a girl meeting together? This is a film for adults, a complex aspect in the eyes of all parties - how husbands, wives, sons - each has adapted each other in the past and how storytelling grew. On top of it, it laughs about 10 big stomachs, and I am a man who is usually sitting in the audience with a smile, it is unnecessary. This was one of the few really fun movies I saw. Great, original joke.
