I really enjoyed this movie because there is tremendous interest in my American history ... especially the years of Intelbell and civil war. I recently bought it from a rack of previously watched videos to sell the supermarket and it was very happy to add it to my history video collection. Although the civility of civil war like "poor" or "gatisburg" does not provide much history about pre-civil war fraternity among cadets at West West Point. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it is gray uniform, young or military disciplinarian, but since 1830 I was fascinated by the story of cadets corps at the end of the war. I imagine this is what other young people prefer to sit in the classroom, learn how to fight, then the lessons should be used against your own classmates! <br /> <br /> In fact, the two classes were graduated in 1861: one class in May, the other in June. There is no significant reference to the film, Henry A. Dupont, except for mentioning the first graduation in May class; And George Custer, the class finished grade in June. The reason for the two classes was not so much about the war, but after testing for five years with a few years of study, it was the result of studying in the course of four years (I think the first grade was present for five years, another four). As a film figure, cadets were like brothers and were often nicknamed each other ... George "Fanny" or "Otto" Caster; Alonzo "Lone" cushion; James "Beauty" Stewart (Geibe Stewart, class 1854), etc. <br /> <br /> I say this image was like "Santa Fe Trill" because it's the 1940 film, when enjoyable, truly ugly history. Cadets from different classes are graduated together. Geibe Stewart and George Castler are portrayed as best friends and John Harrison's ferries are also close to the rebellion of 1852. Actually, Stuart and Castler were never friends, but they were enemies during the war. They were facing each other in Gatesburg in 1863 (Stewart was at Harper's ferry ride, but the cast was still a cadet at the point). <br /> <br /> "Fannie" Castor plays a role in "Class of 61", although his classmate kisses, Dev O'Neal and Shelby Pitton are fantasy, I believe they are based on Henry Ork and John Pelham respectively. I can see two people. <br /> <br /> However, I really enjoy this movie or a movie that provides a window in the middle of the 19th century to America.
