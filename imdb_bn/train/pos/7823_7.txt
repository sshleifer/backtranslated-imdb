Stylish reinforcement of friendship between civil rights leader Steve Bacon and Donald Woods The first side of the film is the most powerful, where we see bonds related to two men and how they help each other, but the second half is not strong because of the elimination of the bike character. Still, it's a great movie with great performances from Kine and Washington, which puts the next on the map. Washington was nominated as the best supporting actor for the first time. Overall, there is a well-made film that can be trimed down a bit. 7/10 .____________________________________
