I love this TV series so much. It contains interesting and beautiful animations. I do not believe that they have turned off the TV, and I never found out that cybercusses and data 7 have died, probably they are alive, but I'm not sure. Cybercusses were sometimes the best TV shows ever. I hope they are late and hopefully they will start the series so I'm really glad to see it. I love it a lot <3 <br /> <br /> About a woman named Syberiks, she is not human. He goes by Adrian Sieldman, a teacher of a higher education. Now cybersea is actually a woman, that day she is an impostor as a man. The City of Cybercicks suppresses the city on the night. <br /> <br /> A person named Von Reichter creates cybercusses and once he knows that he lives, he uses everything he can catch. <Br /> <br /> If you do not see it before downloading it completely. It was the best TV show in the world. Why do they cut it off ???? Some people have problems. But I was happy to see 13 episodes.
