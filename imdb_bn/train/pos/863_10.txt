I was completely engrossed in this photo from the first minute to the last minute. It is shot with lots of wildly and attractive camera engagement and strategy employed. The plot is surrounded by deaf women who have chosen friends and colleagues in the same way. She is an assistant hire of work, with her true intention to find out the love. He conceded a former and he took advantage of his advantage to take revenge for those who have hit him. Then he would have to help him with a heist that needed his ability to read his lips to help him. The film carries the silent post of a bold movie, a couple of really nice scenes and even better finishes The director came from the way of using this character's character of disability. The use of the word keeps tangle consistent, and keeps the pumping blood from dramatic changes to words from silence, that is sure. Throwing a little black comedy and erotic sexual suppression you've got the makings of a great film. It just does not want to be made like a Hollywood, but it just can not do it.
