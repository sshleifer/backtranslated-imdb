In the early part of the first century, the filmmakers will find out some of its possible potential. This is a good story of a playwright who needs money and unknowingly sells his soul to Satan for a lot of money. Unfortunately, the spirit has doubled her and she must separate her life, often face her. There are amazing scenes of people and of course, there are scenes when the scenes are on stage at the same time. The middle part is a little slow, but the fawstane story is always the mind of the audience. The one thing I would like to mention is the irrationality of the film. Also, they have moved away from a few steps which have given at least some lives. About 25 years ago I became aware of this movie and was finally able to see it. I was not frustrated.
