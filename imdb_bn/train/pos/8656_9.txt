The same movie as the Natural Motherland Killers, which was not so popular with critics due to its excessive violence, but I liked, California is a film that explicitly strengthens violence, but I think it is almost the final law. How the diaries of basketball initially glamorize the narcotics, but at the end of the film, the bad side shows, which is very bad in good terms. David Ducheny plays Brian Kiesler, I do not know about such an artist, Yappi girlfriend, who is reserved for the violent black-and-white photography, whichever goes for the nudity industry. Maybe it really does and I do not understand it. At any rate, Brian and Kerry (Ducovini and Michelle Forbes, who played a brutal role) forced the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. Brian, author, write the book, Kerry can take photos. <br /> <br /> Brian and Kerry are not quite financially prepared for such travels, so they have published an advertisement for someone sharing gas and travel costs, and Early Grace and Adele Corner (Brad Pitt and Juliet Lewis ). Initially, the parole is held and his parole officer appoints the local university's veterinary office, after watching the advertisement on the bulletin board and violating his parole and deciding to leave his zamindar murder scene. Do not have to deal with the investigation of a pesky murder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Brian and Kerry are generous, but when Cary arrives at Early and Adele, Brian is impressed with the status of Arlie's status, as Brian shoots an initial gun. Never before has a gun fired, she is fascinated as a small child. Adele and Kerry returned to a hotel and Adele expressed her things like her child that she was initially "smoked" and she did not allow her to drink (initially women should not think), early and outside the local times of Brian. Brian nervously responds to drunk trying to start a war with him, and first advises Brian what to do, and then quickly sends him a step and cooks for the man. "Hit him, Brian, comin it." This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it is a very interesting thing for the first time that a friend's friend tells him that he murders, sheds blood, and beats him, because he enters the hotel with the girls, so we learn together two couples, their differences, And due to them, perhaps there are a lot of conflicts at the same time. And along with that, Brian had benefited from Early's work and was worried by what he heard from Curie Adele, it illustrates the ways in Carrie and Brian's early and Adele's reactions. <br /> <br /> You can say that this is not the kind of romantic couple of your idyllic couple, where urban people are driving the country and all kinds of haphazard developments happen. On the one hand, it seems very little that Brian and Kerry roam around the murder and live with a real life killer, but on the other hand it is a great way to resist spontaneous killings. In a cross-country tour designed to win fame and fame for their crimes While studying the actions of the past killers, Brian and Kerry face the material they are studying and realize that the murders you face when it is in your mouth is not quite beautiful or scary, since it is through detachment research in the past. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by Brad Pitt's divergence as an actor. For example, consider its role in movies such as Callirin, 12 Monkeys, Fight Club, and Ocean 11 and 12. Like Pitt Tom Hendes, so that he can change his appearance or enough for a given character, and fully trustworthy. Eventually, I failed to get initial Grace for Halloween this year, but could not fix hair and beard. I even got a hat right, at first I thought it was the most difficult part. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand why many people like California or they think that it commits violence and assassination, but I think what glorifies is intended to explain the understanding of the audience. At least initially, a movie that is not glorious, may not be as effective as California, but the film completely forms it. All of Brian and Carri's impressive features are derived from the idea of ​​killing and the comfort of places that have happened, but their perception and our real appearance, which they combined with Early and Adele. The very purpose of the film is to differentiate between the ideology of violence and its horror is intimate and realistic.
