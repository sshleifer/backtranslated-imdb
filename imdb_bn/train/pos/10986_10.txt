We stumbled upon the past Sunday's documentary, the Gray Gardens and got "sucked" without warning. The people who entered the room were thinking of television and Edith and Eddie's scary images living in the residence of the big dirty mansion in the sea beach, which ate the ice cream and flour on the farm (which was cooked on the bedside table) - and the cat bed and its incredible Cat cat on the word, "I rely on it [smell]." We did not see the start and were amazed at what we were seeing and they were surprised by how these elite women were able to stay. Spellbinding! A must see !!!!
