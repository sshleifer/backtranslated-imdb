... and do not forget that all of the series. I'm about three years old than the illustrated children in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first shortage of gas, and in 1979 I got my first college postgraduate job during the second gas shortage. In the 70's, there was really a terrible time for inflation, at least for school education. Thirty-something on the risk of drugs, terrible music, jobs with bad clothes. The funny thing is, this series does not ignore anyone and even manages to make the 70s look interesting. For us, those old people know well enough. It keeps an eye on the direct face of 70 years - complete with time-tested clothing - and still fill the show with the expectation of the youth and make high school and college years both in the best time and worst. Then there are the parents. Two young lovers of the ceremony - Eric Farman and Donna Pincetti - have a very good parents with terrible parents. Eric's parents, Red, and Kitty are not only for decades but but also in June and Ward. In the 1970's 60's, they finally showed what had happened when they reached the coast. Donna's parents are two who are waiting for the 1960's to show their whole life to give legitimacy to their curiosity. Eric's friends Fez, Kells, and Jackie surrounded the continual group of groups of representation, meaningless inefficiency and snobbishness. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show in the suburbs, but she will play the cards who have been dealt with cards even when they are largely confronted by those absentee parents and neglected parents, she basically represents someone. Eric's absence results in eight obstacles in season, but I recommend in eight seasons.
