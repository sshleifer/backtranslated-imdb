Dick Tracy is the best made comic book based movie. The film feels the same, it's like a comic book that is coming to color school. Batman series has climbed, dropped, climbed and fell again. There may be something similar to Dick Tras, which both adults and children can enjoy. The good guys win over the evil, get across the points without blood and gore. Al Pacino Big Boy Caprice makes an excellent job of making his own adaptation and memorable as Madonna's Breathless. But the best thing is that Warren Batty, who cleared Dick Tracy with Clyde Barros. I can not wait until I leave the DVD on April 2, 2002, my tape is wearing thin.
