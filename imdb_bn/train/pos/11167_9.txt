My favorite one is the movie "Character" in New York, Steve Brodie (Rought) and "Chuck" Conres (Bari), who both tried to be the "lead singer" in Bauvari in the late nineteenth century. <br /> <br /> Brodie (1863-1901) and Connors (1852-1913) were real people, though they were an extremely fabulous account of their antics (based on a game). Brody's legend (he did it - it's still a reason for rationalism!), Jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, at the same time as the Spanish American War (1898). Director Walsh was clearly a great affection for the time, beautifully rebuilt here, and it included a wildly nominated ragtime number from the solan singer Tricks Odbre (a young stomach belt). At the time of his brilliant, like Rober Brady, and Berry again shows that he is a clever actor, hard, hearty, and sometimes quite sensitive to Connors. Preet Fay Roy love interest in boys. <br /> <br /> Full of life and energy, "bower" moves quickly (in contrast to many initial "conversations"). This is not a simple movie, but it is good to look around.
