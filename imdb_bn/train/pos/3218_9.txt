Ninety out of ten people might think of a high-profile, straightforward video fiction film for YouTube at the box office and criticizing it as the most important movie in Cart Russell's career. <br /> I have reasons. <br /> <br /> First of all, when you read negative reviews of this film, then they usually explain the name of Russell's nickname Tod. I'm going to start here too, with my wonderful statement that I saw Russell dragging this perhaps amazing role. Todd is suffering from a mental disorder and acute PTSD - the phenomenon was widely acknowledged as being now written in this movie. <br /> <br /> Photo spot spot. Todd is recalled, unusual and a loan. He is suffering from irrational anxiety - by training he pushes the fever to the pitch, which teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with other people for treason and danger signs. His hyper-focus makes it unable to convey the greater continuity that he has to sit in the tasks he has done - there is a scene where he is cutting himself a piece of cow and continues to work without cutting or cleansing the blood. Many work as a symbol of his physical strength and concentrate on work, but it is a sign that he is performing the easily requested work - after eating vegetables that he does not understand and the relation of related food. <br /> <br /> To say the Todd's dialog, Spartan - Two big scenes in the center of the movie plot and both the silky nature of its existence. Fear and discipline we are called. Always He is afraid to keep him in a dangerous caution where the little story is not ready to respond to the knife edge. Discipline keep him checked through his fear, overcome it and perform strategically. The idea is that he does not have time to remember and can not bear feelings. In response to the hug from Nelsen Sandra, many have given different explanations of his reaction - but I believe that you have to explain it from a person's point of view that only the embrace experience is in the war - his reaction to shivering / reaction to flight intent, from fear of being afraid, his movement And the visions are limited - actuals Fear and discipline <br /> <br /> Theorem of its abandonment (double) - So representatives of the toss to our soccer team are infantrymen onto the garbage shield of society when they are serving their terms. 40% unemployed is the former military of our world, in which it can only be bad. Russell quickly gave his wife and child the responsibility of the responsibility of the mess - perhaps most likely for a mission, even more likely to die. <br /> <br /> There are also military theorems - Conflicts between Busey's Church and Headquarter, Mekum in the hotshot. Mekum's new men are fast, strong, more accurate and aggressive. None of them could pound the toss in the ground - but it is not about the equipment about how you use it. An inspired Todd has given freedom to practice his advances and to act without the silent effects of acting superiority, using Ammash techniques and sticky techniques to swim through a new unit - without support, covers or reconsideration. This is a reminder that military power can not be created for leadership failure. <br /> <br /> There are many fine themes. When a movie is shot and is scripted at the minimum, it leaves plenty of white space to take root for your own explanations. Watch the soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.
