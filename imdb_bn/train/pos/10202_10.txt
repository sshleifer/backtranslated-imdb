I personally liked this movie and some people woke it up on the rating. It's a movie based on a comic book and it's animated, now if you do not like comic books or animations, of course you would not like this movie but why you saw it and bothered to lose it outside of me. However, if you are interesting, strong characters and heroic (sexy) women kicking on foot and are a fan of the world (hell) you love this movie. I thought the story really dragged me and it was a very cool movie. Following this new trend of adult animation, most anime-eskiks or more, like most American movies. Titan AE LIVE Action version of Mills is like a liner. Finally I recommend this film with a lot of heart and mind for the comic buff and superhero fan or any funny movie.
