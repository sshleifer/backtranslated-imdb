It's not for the academy prize now and for the time being, it was not very fatty, but it's so funny! Nothing makes me smile like Bill and Ted. A great way to love, be hopeful, and reluctant to be happy, Bill and Ted. <br /> <br /> Although I love the great adventure, Bagus Journey is fun for me. Death is flip-flop and bill and Ted even more respectable. People give me sorrow for the love of this movie, but only the real projection movie-viewers say that it's not even a little entertaining. If you like it, perhaps you'll be Wayne World, Where's Dude My Car, and Fools and Dumar Fans. Accept it, though stupid, they make you green and turn on your tile box. So just watch for kicks and giggles for them !!
