Berlin was born in 1942 Margaret Von Trotta is an actress and now she is a very important director and writer. He has described it as a director, perhaps even an illogical character, whose director transcends his artistic power to bring the screen sensitivity. "Rojenstraße," which collected mixed and even weird reviews (the New York Times article was one of the most negative aggressive reviews I read on paper) is not a perfect movie. This is a rare movie about a fine film and a massacre Nazi regime, which is manifested by all the people, by the people of powerless Germany displayed in Berlin street. /> <br /> The second co-author von trota <br during World War II Germany, the capital of his mother as a child, never to be searching for a yubakira <br /> On the rajanenastrasera event <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and the Jewish way of life is a miracle that amazed, astonished, which was probably for a long time, but Ruth "sibha is dead" (Jewish mourning weekend What is the ceremony) Tu hard copy to follow his faith, he urges. His apartment in New York City reflects the prosperity protected by the labor of his deceased husband / wife. His American-born daughter, Hannah (Maria Shader) and her brother are separated by the idea of ​​a Jewish banquet Jewish idea, but they pitch it. Mother's coolness was the presence of Hannah's fiancée, known as non-Jewish Luce, Fedja van Huit). Ruth warned that if he disappointed Hitima, he would not be disappointed, do not give up the handsome Lewis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Hana is frustrated - she questions her mother, who has not agreed to discuss the part of her life. This is very, very realistic. I grew up with parents who escaped from Nazi Germany only and I knew many children whose whole family but usually ran away from Holocaust. Those days were not discussed only. <br /> <br /> Hannah, learned that a German male woman has saved Ruth's life, the Berliner hopes the breather is still breathing. She was not, it was a very small film. But Bhan Ruth, a historian, is now 90-year-old Lena Fisher (Doris Schweid), who is now a widow. Like happy-interviewing, but lenate with suppressive memories, Lena tells her story, the scenes have changed intensely between the current Berlin and the war-time capital city. <br /> <br /> The young Lena (Katja Riemen) of 1943 is a fine pianist married to a Jewish biologist, Fabian Fisher (Martin Fifel). The Nazi regime coming to him with the name "Israel" need to use, just as Jewish women, their names "Sarah" to add the (incidentally I aiemadibi character of the false name phebiyara the name of the "Israel" included - it is only classification And determines a name applied by the Nazis as signs of deterioration.) <br /> <br /> While Germany Bay Irabhaga Jewish communities frequently sent to the camp, who "ayariyana" married out. For a bar. By 1943 the government decided to accept them (most men were; a minority Jewish women were married to non-Jews). Roundups have been shown here in all its terrible intensities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She and many other women know that they are limited to Rosnextras' buildings. The crowd of concerned women have grown, some bold German officials are seeking help from those who rejected future help and abused them verbally (as a title of "Jewish-boyfriend prostitute"). As a sub-lane lane, eight-year-old Ruth seized his mother and kept hidden (remember, the chariot now is sitting in Manhattan with Shiva). The child has played Ratha civilized lohde. <br /> <br /> Women are finally won in protest of growing anger. Men, and a handful of women, are released. In the real story, the Nazis were one of the rare, almost unprecedented times, when the pagalists recognized defeat in their domestic work program (the other was the end of the evangelistic preaching campaign for the release of mental error and the lasting attack, but this is another story). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Van Trott creates a tension and the story of each woman is personal and universal. Suddenly she began to gag lenake elderly, who gradually gathered, he was not talking to ordinary historian, but her daughter was rescued, he wanted to know about, whose mother was killed. <br /> <br /> Controversy, a set, and a detonation, reconstructed, Unified Berlin on the street today, in Rosensrasta, provide a repetitive thematic element. Today carries the heritage of Berlin but does not have the scars of a giant past. Von Trott is very good. <br /> <br /> The main actors are exclusively impressive. লেনার স্বামী দৃঢ় অবস্থায় নির্বাসনের সম্ভাব্য দৃষ্টিভঙ্গির সাথে সম্পূর্ণরূপে অসহায় হিসাবে দেখা যায় (যা স্থানীয় পুলিশ এবং সামরিক সহ - সব ধরনের অক্ষর দ্বারা স্পষ্টভাবে বোঝা যায় - যেমন বিস্মৃত হওয়ার একমাত্র উপায় হিসাবে দেখানো হয়েছে) । Old Ruth was forced to face the monsters in her happy New York life for a long time. Hannah is very trustworthy as a young girl whose father's death requires the discovery of her family. These events occur (although the Times, critics did not know it) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Halloween Lena playing a scene with gayebelasera fueling unnecessary and confusing. The propaganda minister has gone to bed with the highest fanatic top-level Hitler worshiper to save her husband from the wonderful success of the proposed wife and relatives. Most German officers have come from Central Casting and Arich von Straheim has created "Copy and Paste" Titanic Diet School. But it is understood. <br /> <br /> The story of Resenstruss has been a matter of books and articles, and some argue that it is a classic example of controversy over the Jews who can protest more Jews. Unfortunately that argument is meaningless. The German women occupying Rosensrasta were deeply and understandably selfish. Most of Germany is located somewhere between passive and anti-microbial semimps. That is why the Rosenstraße protest was virtually singular. The purchase or rejection of Goldenhenge Thesis that most of the German real killers seek cooperation, it can not be denied that the former Nazi racial anti-Semitism originated in a deadly strain since 1933. <br /> <br /> The elderly Lena commented that what women did was "light rays" in an evil time. Most men and women survived the war sprung from a death trip. So it was "a ray of light" and the Von Trota movie symbol of illumination. It shows that some of the most common women have been saved by courage and there is a ceremony to celebrate every life to save. And always will be <br /> <br /> 9/10
