I watched this movie in 1984, we first started watching "this spinal tap" and after 5 minutes we were ready to fall asleep. So we went to see this movie instead. If you have a conspiracy theory running around your head, you will want to see it. <br /> <br /> When you look at this movie you will have to ask your own question: Do you think the government can do this? (In my opinion there is no doubt that they could) <br /> <br /> But I do not want to give too much information as it would be a mockery and I think you can see the movie for yourself. However, just to let you know, we still talk about this film after 20 years and trying to explain it to the people is not the easiest thing in the world.
