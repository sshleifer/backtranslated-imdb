I love this show. Duration I'm not looking very long, probably about six months or so, actually, but now my favorite show and probably will be for a while. I love all the characters, except I really do not care Donna. I'm not completely sure why. I just could not find anything interesting about her, and I do not think Laura Pinping is a very good actress. Other than that, I left quite a good cast. Curtuud Smith and Debra Joe Roop, who played Eris's parents, were very funny. Top Grace is also a great actor. Contrary to many fans, I did not hate the 8th season. I still see it, and it makes me smile. But, if you compare it to previous seasons, it is not good. Randy is awesome The final was good, nothing amazing, but good. =] I think it was good to cancel the show after deciding to leave Ashton and tofar, but oh well. I have the DVD's fourth season, and one day I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD. Most of the ridiculous episodes in my opinion, 'Dine and Dash', 'Grandmother Dead', 'Red and Stacy' and 'Streaking', but I love every episode I've seen so far, which most of them think. . =] 9/10 stars, I would definitely recommend it. =]
