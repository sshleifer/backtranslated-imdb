**** Out of the scoop **** Woody Allen is certainly not my favorite director, but I've enjoyed the "match point". It was fortunately Woody Allen star did not have a nice dark romantic thriller. It was a beautiful sketch Johnson. <br /> <br /> "Scup" is the last movie of Woody Allen and although he looks at it, all right. It also coordinates Scarlett Johansson, and two of them work perfect together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Johansen gets scope of life from Ghost Joe suddenly heard a boat with wild grain and heard a bunch of other grains of grain. One of those souls Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman.) Secretary. He told Joe that Peter could be the serial killer roaming the streets of England. Joe, with life's life, returned to the living and gave this information to Sandra during the magic law. Sandra has some magic shows with Madison Seed Waterman (Woody Allen). She became a volunteer to go to an invisible box and when she is in the box, she travels from Joe. She did not give Sid Waterman's help information to know what to do. <br /> <br /> This image has a hearty feel for it compared to "match point" and it still works. Johansson and Allen together work great. Allen's humor is the perfect fit for this story and role. Hugh Jackman is a horrible, "suspected" serial killer like Peter LeMan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Do not forget to watch yourself Woody Allen himself. Because I give it a chance because you might just like it.
