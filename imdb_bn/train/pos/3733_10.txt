After returning to Vietnam, due to mental problems, he was a uncle who committed suicide. So when I saw the channel of this movie for a channel for one night, I was curious. I wanted to know that my brother was ready to go to Vietnam. I went out and hired this movie and I have been told that I have ever seen the most heart-wrenching films. I bought the DVD immediately after I rented it. In this way it attracts you emotionally from many different aspects that I have never experienced with any other film. As far as Vietnam movies go, I think it's the best, even though Platoon is the second closest. Also, I think it's Colin Farrell's best acting role as an actor. I liked him in most of his movies, but in that he was incredible. I gave it a rating of 10 because it is one of my top five favorite movies.
