I'm buff a huge classic film, but just getting the silent movie. Many silent movies do not hold my attention, but show people is a significant exception. <br /> <br /> In this movie, Marion Davis and William Haines are simply awesome. Davis, in particular, shows a wide range of scenes as well as taking the girl to a small film from a small town. <br /> <br /> Faster movies with a fantastic array of folks. By the greatest of the silent era, something bigger. The movie immediately caught my attention and I actually forgot it a silent film. (I know that it is not very sensual, but that happened.) Actors are so skilled in their tactics that some conversation cards are needed. <br /> <br /> Show people the perfect role of silent movies. It's a fast, attractive movie with two stars in the silent era. Join Hollywood's picnic and the exhibition should have 'must-see' list for all classic film buffs.
