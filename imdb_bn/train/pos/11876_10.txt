When I see this movie, I know, I'm sure it's been criticized for the date. Also, about violence. When I saw this picture in VHS at the age of 20, I thought it was extremely nonviolent and radioactive. But I did not get 'it'. <br /> <br /> People have gone for decades, I know how I did not get this picture! This is a nice remake of the film which came back in the 30/40s. How can you improve on a classic? Yes no But you are a story that "The most lustful decade of the lustful decade is brought to the" new migrants "eyes till today, it's over 80. Depalma, Stone and Gang present an ambitious, annoying and great movie. <br /> <br / Yes ... Disco is going to die and New Wave / Punk has been taken, but these migrants have to do everything from Cuba Florida difference in a new home It was exciting, what they wanted, but how to get it? To the immigrants, the only way to Florida where they had lots of money and to get the money, you had to take the drug drug empire. <br /> Al Pacino Tony Montana was pretty fantastic to me as "that could have a little train." What is an amazing way to look at your lead character America : War, murder, theft, falsehood, all get cheated - "money, women and power." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> I saw no mistake how to live it and get it in its circle. The English language command was very involved with the word "f" but did you expect that the last school of the Emily Post was for her and her co-hots? See how they came to America, how they were exposed to what they knew. Tony and his crew chose "everything that can be done in America" ​​in this way. It was all about energy. Tony Montana did something to achieve it ... all of them violent, false, stealing, miserable, glorious glory. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Toni Crooke brings money for drug money to Bangkok. Who Tony and his crew care about? Where did he go to the clubs? No Money was with money and money, you get power. Tony Hogg had lived high off. She and her beautiful blonde American trophy played well by married Michele Pfieffer. <br /> <br /> Increasing the power of Tony Montana, after he finds out his really crappy. He is agitated with suspicion, he is addicted to drugs, he is parandoned, he surrounds him who wants to take him bloody over, his trophy is 80 American American drug addicts wife, he found out, because of his empire he needed to keep a rising ... Going down. And down he goes in a horrible violent fashion, but again I ask, what do you expect? <br /> <br /> This fascinating film of 1980 is the American Dream ... something misunderstood saying a warped story obsession. It's violent, bloody, too much .. but it drives the house disturbingly to the point. There was nothing like Cuban Tony Montana who came out of Cuba in the 80's in Florida. Give me a break. But how tragic it was in the 1980s that America's only move was "to be" and emphasized on people's greed and money as their tool of this poor character in America and their lives in America. <br /> <br /> You wonder - Since then there are some things - learned today?
