Lion King 1 1/2 is a very intelligent story to go along with the lion king. It basically follows Lion King's original story, but with a few twists. In film, e vents are explained by a different character perspective. This story is still a key plot. <br /> <br /> As far as the signal goes away, Disney does not fit everyone. This one is the third part of Lion King (Simba Pride II.) Actually involves fun fun when it has an original idea. Timon and Pumbaa travel along the ideal places to live. After searching from a distance, they found the place "Hakuna Mata". Then they meet a small lion named Simba and parents will go through the many things that are going on today. <br /> <br /> I think this is a very good movie, and I'm happy to add it to my collection.
