Anyone who thinks anime is nothing but sex and violence will remain silent forever after watching this movie. It is a fine film that tells Tetsur to seek revenge for his mother's death, but the process also increases. Train sort journey represents the journey of Tetsuro from manhood to manhood. The movie music and visual styles are a little dated (you can call it a 70's movie) and the animation is a little better than your average "Star Blues" episode. But stories and characters are so powerful, it really does not matter. Must watch for an animation fan!
