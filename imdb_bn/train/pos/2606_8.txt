Maybe some people might consider this a slow movie. However, this is precisely this "slow burning" which lets it deeply influence viewers. The incredible first scene: First, we can hear the voice; Then, we are allowed to see the letters; Finally, the camera slowly pans back and forth and we see another character, a young person who is sitting there, obviously is not trying to listen to the conversation, at least not really taking care of it. This young man will play a key role, the technique of this movie shows: allowing the character to develop and determine the surroundings in its surroundings, but eliminating points in the right direction. People come and go, flow in and flow into his life. Although most of his films follow him (and most characters of his supporter are only seen close to him, it is defined in relation to his relation), we believe that we are motivated, so touching the director is fine.
