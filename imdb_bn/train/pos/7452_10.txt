I'm a big fan of a ferry tale theater and I've seen them all and this is the best one! It's funny, romantic, and a classic. I recommend this for all ages. This is great for little kids because it's good, Cinderella and great for adults and miseries because it's fun and not at the top. When I was small I saw it and I still see it now. It's great line that my family and I cited all the time. Acting is great and it gets old. If you like fairy tales and romance then you will love this. I saw a lot of cinderell movies in my time and this is their best. (Sorry Disney) I highly recommend this movie and all ferry tale theater shows. They all appeal to all ages and are all unique and very entertaining.
