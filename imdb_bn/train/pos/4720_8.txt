A beautiful movie, especially if you like horses, WWII movies and violent Hungarian Plato. The stories of courage, compassion, and loyalty that cross the generation. Horse showers are spectacular as well as the main character's horse in his training. <br /> <br /> I'll buy this movie and see it again. This is a family film and I highly recommend it. A good 'Family Night' movie. Although there were some violent scenes, it was a Nazi occupation of Hungary. In spite of their personal reasons for hunting Brazil, the locals stood on their soil until facing a specific death from a Nazi officer. A hauntingly beautiful film.
