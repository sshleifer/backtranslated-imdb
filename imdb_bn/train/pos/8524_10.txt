The children of 7 to 14 year olds have found such a huge kick that we have given a copy to all other children in our birthday list this year. They all like it! 2 to 7 kids are frequently and frequently seen, and we can get a kick out to see it with them. <br /> <br /> It is a rare event that a child so entertains children so much and laughs for adults, too. Most enjoy it more than the first. <br /> <br /> High quality production and a wonderful cast, well-known George under the leadership of Christopher Schwarzmann - Athletes, enthusiastic and completely trustworthy, loving innocence and especially the tool to take a tree in the mouth - bad mother-in-law, Thomas by disrespectful Christina racket Haden supports the Church as an evil rival and everyone else. It's fun
