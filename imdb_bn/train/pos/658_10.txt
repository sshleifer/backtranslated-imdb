It's not an easy movie to watch - it's been over two and a half hours and it's completely made up of conversations. Yet it is so unbelievably and brutally observable of human character that my modest opinion is one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> This movie is frustrating, cruel and cruel. (If you want to raise something, see Jake Rivet's excellent cylinders and Julie Go Boating, which were created at the same time). It changed the ideology of the late 1960s, not something different from the society. <br /> <br /> It contains an inferred freedom fighter-non-trouser (played by Jean-Pierre Laud), Mari (Barnardt Loft) and Veronica (Francois LeBron). Yet Alexander is considered to be authoritarian and jealous as any other man. Women deliberately define their femininity through careful view of men. <br /> <br /> This film is a very dead end of the revolutionary French New Wave. This movement is one of the most significant movements in film history and has had a deep impact on the film. Jean-Pierre Lead was one of New Wave's actors, who played the influential Les Queres Saint Kupe (1959) of Francois Trafault as a rebel teen (among other films). Director Jean Yusach is not known as another director from New Wave, but he should be. <br /> <br /> No reforms (unlike the Cassetes film in the United States) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations. This image corresponds to personal experience on Easter. For example, Francois was a former lover of LeBourn Easterch. Based on his own suicide on Easter in 1981 and based on the genre of real life. Angry and angry all delivered directly to the visitors culminate in a disappointing belonging by all Veronica, the rest of the film breaks the nature of the purpose. This mesmerizing, personal, and honest filmik statement is one of the most revealing movies of nature.
