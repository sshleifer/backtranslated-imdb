Most of Neil Simon's work was done, but it was a strange couple who earned him fame. This film really works. Jack Lemon and Walter Matthews have a great chemistry. Supporting actors for this movie are also excellent. <br /> <br /> It is about 2 men living with opposite planets. Scripture bristles with humor from this situation. This has been completed in some form before. This is one of the best packages to combine it. <br /> <br /> Simon has done some good things, but it really makes his best work which makes his remaining work possible. Simon is hard to imagine topping this ever.
