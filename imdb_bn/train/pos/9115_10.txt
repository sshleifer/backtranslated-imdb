The idea ia is a very small film with much information. Interesting, entertaining and leave the audience to leave more. The producer has made a fine quality film that is not comparable to any other small film I have seen. I've rated this movie at the highest possible rating. I recommend that it is shown to any organization's office manager and business people. What comes out of it is that people never listen to their ideas, their voice is never heard. It wants to go to any office that wants to send. I hope production will produce a second part from this 'concept'. I look forward to seeing the order. Again a lesson congratulated the light media for creating a movie of excellence and quality.
