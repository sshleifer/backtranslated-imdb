A film made in 1934 may be like head and shoulder on the movie Tarzan, which was followed by floating and annoying 1980s Grrestoc. Once, after the first three scenes of the audience, which passively verifies neutral, Tarzan and his partner looks like a shot, offers non-stop action, humor and romance. Mornin and Sullivan Jane, like charming and beautiful and with the movie. Weismuller is good as well. Highly recommended.
