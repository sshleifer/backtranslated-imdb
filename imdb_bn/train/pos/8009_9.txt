Ah, true memory. I used to live in Holland at that time and went ahead eagerly every Sunday evening and later on Tuesday. I saw it during my 14-16 years. My school (school-time) is very good, the Dutch TV offers subtitles for other languages, since cdci shows nowadays. So you will hear the original voice and language. The best series was the first three and then after the third series, the great character, Nazi von Gelb, who was such a fierce enemy, disappeared from the series (I do not think that he really took him, he always ran away, he would go back to the next story. Leaving the room to appear) because the series was apparently distributed in Germany, and a Nazi enemy would not go very well! Very bad, because Jeffrey Tone did this wonderful marvelous act of illustrating an intelligent Nazi elite, who took this moving tendency to revenge in England. It was a real pleasure to see such high quality performances in the Youth series, but Ronald Leigh-Hunt was a good opponent and the youth were so natural. They were so trustworthy to me, and as a childhood I could have imagined myself as a part of these young people, who were at about four years of age. It was a very exciting series for me, in memory of that time, as a special show with "prison". I hope the series will release a good quality DVD, that would be wonderful. Even bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch. The next series was not as good, watered down and not just as fun as the first three. Hopefully they can find another series to keep Von Gelb up in the DVD. Best wishes from Canada.
