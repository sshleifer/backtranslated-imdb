Christina Reyns plays a beautiful model in New York, who finds a new apartment and starts to meet the strange neighbors and publishes secret about the building and gradually develops itself up to most Climaxs at the end of the film. This film is played by the Roman Catholic Church v. The Devil, the gate of Hell, the wicked programs, the growing conspiracy, and finally most of the talented famous actors and actresses flooded the film. We are Awa Gardener, Burgess Meridith, Chris Sarton, Jerry Orbatch, Deborah Rafin, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Slavia Miles, Beverly Denangelo, Eli Wallach, Martin Bars, Christopher Walkin, William Hickey, Tom Beerner, Jeff Goldlam and the old pastor. As John Carradine forget Many of these actors have highlighted this - especially, Barjes Meridith has given a good humor / surprise performance as a little bird and a neighbor of a cat. Miridith as memorable to Belsam and Chris Sarandon. Some actors do not really have anything to do with creditworthy role like Joseph Fahr, even though it is not much more than a camio. Sentinel is a fine awful film with lots of emotional elements and some really awesome scenes. The last scene is repulsive and still cool. I find fault with some unwelcome sex and violence in movies, especially the whole scene with Dangelo and Miles. Was that really needed? I do not think so. Also, the father / daughter stuff was a bit better, but overall the film works and this is a winning moment. Director Michael Winner works like a worker and implements moments of stress and horror film. The scene with Carradine is especially effective.
