Her opponents of her first best-verse "The Elephant Man" Lynch prove that she can tell straight, simple stories without her artistic touch. It is an old retired person (especially played by Richard Farnsworth) who has decided to travel to the tractor in some states, to visit the dead brother who is now at the door of death. A beautiful score from Badulenti, the fine photography of rural life (love the airy ears-field shots), and the hand of an intelligent director who reveals the basic humanity, it is a beautiful part of life film. Some of his visitors can sleep very slowly, but those who are next to the ride will be rewarded eventually.
