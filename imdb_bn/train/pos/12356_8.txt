Contrary to some people's shortcomings, women portrayed in the film are not Gaisha. They live outside oran (prostitution) outside of the most famous Ananda district, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a large number of women of Tokuga era. I can not say the stories were especially enlightened, but how ordinary they are, their impressive. Themes universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed art direction and acting. I was feeling that I have seen a time and place where I can not look otherwise. The actors, especially 4 women, who played the main orangan, were thrilled to watch. I only recommend this movie to the taste of Japanese culture, or those who want to enjoy calm and emotional stories. It's both a great example.
