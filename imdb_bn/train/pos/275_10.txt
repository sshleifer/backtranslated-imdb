This movie started with a family who was all going from different directions and loved their teenage daughter Martha MacIsaac (Olivia Dunne) Joe McLeod (Jack). Ma has played Mikey Capture (Jill Donne), who is walking with her daughter suddenly and being jack out and then all kinds of problems arise. Jill Dunne is a husband who often travels or often stay away from the house. Big problems also occur when the family decides to go to their camping trip when their daughter dislikes Olivia and is not suitable for sleeping outside and all the bugs require a tent to be kept. In many ways, doing amazing performances like Olivia teen and Nick Mancus, (Richard Grant) offer great support to the hotel owner. Guess how this movie will end and you will enjoy a movie filled with scary and terrorists. Enjoy
