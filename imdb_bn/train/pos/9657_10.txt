Previous work of 'Precession Reiyan' ('Mango Adon'), a gifted author / director Sebastian Lifshits (with the help of author Stephen Buketlet - which gave us the next 'Wild Side'). We realized the methodology of storytelling of the lifeships, each of his work became more positive. By allowing people to confuse their confusing and unsafe youth in the same random fashion with their flexible and sensitive love stories - now time, time spent, reflecting time, time to imagine, alone time - Lifatize makes their stories more personal, character feedback involving the audience With every aspect. It utilizes some of its methods, but taking his strategy draws us deeply into the film. <br /> <br /> Matthew (handsome and gifted Jeremy Elkheim) is visiting the beach for the holidays, one time his mother (Dominique Raymond) allows to fight with his indefinite illness, the faithful and wise Anne (Mary Mathew) and his Sister was with Sarah (Latitia Legricks): Their remote father had to stay home due to business. In the first moment of the film and suffering only outside of the pictures of Matthew, innocent, horse-drawn trains, like talking to a little recorder. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Soon Cedricric Mathieu approaches and a gentle introduction is a kiss that begins an passionate love passion. Matthew was afraid of the way he was taking it, Cedric turned the public's view, but wanted to find him for theft. Two young people are completely involved in the love and in relation to the physical outlook of this relationship, this story is very important to understand, some are very erotic and sexually explicit with the audience. Summer, a summer student, Matthew, realized that Cedric is working on a condom stand in a carnival. It has become clear that Cedric Dianisian partner, but Matthew Apollonius is one: Stirred by the beauty of Matthew and the beauty of the space in a period of architectural destruction, when Cedric is only interested in a new secret place for love. << br /> Matthew is a complex person, influenced by serious illness and non-presenting his family's relationship with his family, his fear of increasing sexuality, and his passion for Cedric enthusiasm. Cedric's betrayal, and Matthew's inability to face that problem, and ultimately they enjoy the parts, their moments of happiness are hindered. Time passes, family changes are made, and Mathieu drifts into depression with a suicide attempt. In dealing with these challenges and finding comfort, in such a way, Sadiq's past lovers show the picture in Pierre (Nils Wahlund) an impossible but completely successful climax. The film is so strong that the feeling of identification with these characters is that the desire to start the film from the beginning is strong now with the full story knowledge. LifeSitz gave us a meditation film with meditation, conflict with the emotional forces found in love, and the silent film and the repeat of the wonderful beauty of silence. The entire cast is superb and gentle and stimulating in the direction. Lifeshit is definitely one of the brightest lights of film making. French with English subtitles Highly recommended. Grady Harp
