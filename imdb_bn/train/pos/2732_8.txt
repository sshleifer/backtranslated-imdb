Harvey Klutter, wife Bonnie and their teenage son Kenion and Nancy were given much respect and respect in their small town Hollcomb, Kansas - but four people were brutally murdered in the first hours of November 14, 1959. Unexpectedly, this crime created an impression on writer Truman Copt who went to the scene and followed the suit in the conclusion. The result was the Blind Book of the Blind. Controversial, frustrating, and particularly well-written, it became an international best seller and it remains a touchstone for crime writers today. <br /> <br /> The 1967 film version of the CAPTO work is almost as remarkable as the book itself. Most of the real-life locations are portrayed in black and white, with little documentary quality, ice, and isolated - and overall cast exceptional. It is a film that earned fame as an actor by Robert Blake and a well-liked creator. As the killer Perry Smith, Black trap you in a deep distaste and unexpected sympathy shock; It's an efficient performance from start to finish. As Richard Hickock, Scott Wilson is not less delicate. Like the Capet book, the film is open with Smith and Hikk when they travel to Kansas and bring them to their cluster house - only suddenly flash gets off the investigation until their investigation of arrest and firmness is complete. The center of the film is always at the moment that we finally saw what happened in Clouse's house; In fact, it is a vertebrate sequence that is depicted in the Quatroor house, horrific and deeply annoying. <br /> <br /> Director and writer Richard Brooks manages this movie with a very strong idea of ​​discussion, only in the sense that he can be a little preacher of the film. Although the overall power of the film is given, it becomes a trivial annoyance. Strong staff - and recommended. <br /> <br /> The GFT, Amazon Reviewer
