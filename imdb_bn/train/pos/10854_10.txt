This series can be the best britcom of all time, and it seems like a great deal to the contenders (Fowly Towers, good neighbors, only for two naming) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It happened that reflected. <br /> <br /> <br /> I see this event as a teenager and afraid of it all.

The concept that was living in the dream of colonization, was so dissatisfactory and unstable that revolutionaries, especially for North Americans, whose happiness was always defined as money and things (certainly the situation was depicted on American movies and TVs, but not intensively) butterflies or film Montenegro).

Butterflies have become very blurry, but some people put their disbelievers in disbelief ... at the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Lifestyle, the concept of mental traitor, and generational disconnection and male dissatisfaction (illustrated by the relationship of the son of the illustrated father). It is very bad, this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and those who are involved have given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of the given time and place and predicted the arrival of all the inferiorities and fingers.
