Since the number of unbelievable films published in 1932, forgotten, the 1946 mystery / comedy "The Amazing Mr. Williams" featured Melvin Douglas and Joan Blondel co-stars. <br /> <br /> Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his daughter, while her girlfriend is constantly waiting for a wedding to be suspended. What happened in this movie is no exception - he has also been known as the scene of the murder, because he is going to walk under a hole again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both stars were excellent in the comedy, worked well (and often) together, and helped to fight this kind of sex fun. Edward Broffy and Donald MacBride are in excellent support. <br /> <br /> You can read in another review, Melvin Douglas does not make many women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One day's comment trashed our best actor, Melvin Douglas. He literally floated in the movie a few dozen of other films and as an old man before his arrival in film as old man. He was not lazy, but rather a very hard-working actor (who made it easy) who did Broadway career together with his film career. He has not given a very challenging role as a leading person in the film or not under the studio system. Challenge someone to see his devastating performance in "Hood" and "I'm never the sea for my father" and call him lazy or to refer to his smirk.
