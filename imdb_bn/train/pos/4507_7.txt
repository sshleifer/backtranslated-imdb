I was really surprised how much a 60-year-old film could affect me. It's about two hours long, it's not a star, it's subtitles but interesting and exciting to watch it. The reality of the film was mostly fascinated by me. You can often feel the coldness of ice, because you can see the storms are real. It's a relief in a CGI-world like nowadays. I wonder how much work Van Van Dyke has done for this. I read somewhere that it takes 17 months. Who wants to talk about 'Titanic' now? It will be a great movie with a great message and recommend to future managers how they can be great and realistic movies if they are driven by reality rather than just visible effects.
