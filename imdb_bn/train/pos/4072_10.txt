Hayo Miyazaki has become prominent with the name Spitide Away, but often the director's first film effort is ignored. Who directs Spielberg to Duel or THX 1138 directed by George Lucas? I think this seems like a piece of cinema - last 45 minutes at the end of the 80's, and there was a wide spectrum of design and animations stuck with me. So when I found a copy of a well known shop for 9 pounds, I could not resist it, but bought it. The strange thing is that the last 45 minutes of the movie do not match my memory (the way it's fun). <br /> <br /> Now, the film has got all the knowledge of artist portfolios by seeing how some art works like girud like gin mobis. I can feel some effects here. <br /> <br /> When his paw is started to catch a fallen girl (winter), his adventure starts - looking for Laputa - part of the negligence of Jonathan Swift's of Golves Travels. With a healthy reference to Zeus Verne, it is a fundamental good versus bad cheezing film that ends with Hiro Laputa and ends with it. <br /> <br /> This part is the strongest part of my memory - Environmental aspect of 'Passral' Laputu has come back in nature - crowd of robots covered by mobs covered under giant trees. In my opinion, the highlights of the film - the visions of the landing page are opposed to mechanical underground. <br /> <br /> Although it is not the dualism of this movie - it can not even overcome the nature to show the technology - the origin of the last robot is on garden and animals. The silent running end of the movie is almost the same. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly stylish, I will not say 'sticky' - very nice and organic and building, airships and a tremendous amount of detail <br /> <br /> <br /> Mayazaki The true master of such an Japanese anime. Buy this movie and treasure it.
