Anyone that lived through Nerds and Girlpower revenge age would appreciate this film. This is a movie that provides whatever you want in the "Spring Break Movie" plus which makes it fun to make the film cinema fun. It's funny, it's dead for a cast (Emmie Pohlar! Rachel Drach !, Sophie Make !, Parker Pocci! Jane Lynn! Amber Tumblin! Miss Pill!) And it sure made you laugh at you. Writer / actor Rachel Drach is a comic genius and Sophie McKay is so beautiful. Wilson Phillips! God! (I'm just repeating myself now ...) Those women who like Miranda in July will love to eat ice cream and they think they are fools.
