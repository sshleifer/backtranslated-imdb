I'm 14 years old, so maybe you think I've never heard of George Burns or Walter Matthew or anyone like that. Boy you wrong I heard that George Burns was in this film and he won the Academy Award for it. I became George Burns' fan after ten years. I oh, God recently saw the movie and liked it. This one was very awesome. George Burns did a great job. So Walter's head (this is the first time I saw him playing). And although they had a really small role, Philis Dealer and Steve Allen did a good job. It was really especially if it was fantastic acting. Tell me, if you're a fan of George Burns or Walter Matthew, you must watch this movie!
