It is a movie of life, victory over disaster and the wonder of human soul. At the end of the film I do not protest anyone to tear a tears. It's more than just a tear-jacquer, it's a compelling, thoughtful drama that delivers excellent performance from all casts, but especially with leaks and Dan Zel Washington. After 7 years, I'm surprised that Luke is still a virtual unknown and Washington only managed another film. Yet, apart from the gradual build up, the story of this child's trial and adolescents and how it still affects adolescence is a movie that you see for a long time. Like many Fox searchlight images, it was more than a sleeper hit and it did not qualify critical critics. When Antonov finally met up with his mother, that scene summed up the movie for me, there were many ways that could be possible, and it might be surprising or it might be unreal, but Washington correctly hit the right sound, his mother never said a word and Only a tear hole can occur, when antowne simply asked. His heinous crime prevents him from saying something, what can he say to protect himself? One of the most moving cinematic scenes I've seen.
