I think James Cameron is becoming my favorite director because it's the second review of my movies. However, everyone remembers RMS Titanic. It's big, fast, and "uncertain" ... until April 1912. It was among all the news and the greatest tragedies of all time. Well James Cameron decided to create a movie from it, but instead of the ship, two fictional characters starred in the spotlight. Well, to the main review, but remind me that it is all opinion and zero truth and this phenomenon is only an incident from the movie. <br /> <br /> So we have two main characters Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They are not too annoying but can see it and why they may find it annoying (http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn). I think the main fame is unfortunate, fate, God's hand (no blasphemy intention), or simply plain hakley (Billy Jane). All of the above combine and you get what? Yes! We get a love story in a sinking boat. Supporting characters are: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber) (Ivy was so beautiful), Lovejoy (David Warner), Mardoch (Ian Stewart), Litler (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith (Bernard Hill), Molly Brown ( Cathy Bates), and more. We got Treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) today. They add some good things to the story, The action here is extraordinary, especially the second half, as well as the drama. At the end you may be dropping your eyes rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A bow finds the heart of the hunter ocean and instead finds a woman of diamond called the diamond. He calls and tells his story of RMS Titanic. The two lovers are divided by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything works about the story and there are very few errors. I gave Titanic 86% awesome
