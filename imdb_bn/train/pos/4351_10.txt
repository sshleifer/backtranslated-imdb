Peter Folk is a diverse and accomplished actor. The movie feels better writing and acting like real life. This is a great work for all the lovers of Columba. Because it shows what a talent Peter Fawk is. He is not a detective playing a retired carpet salesman. When you start the credit role, you already want to see it again. The interesting part of the movie is that it will apply to everyone to see the message; Its' depth depth is the only thing that will change. It is shameful that Hollywood liberals only encourage smoking and skin, because the movie should be proud of this type of movie. It will be a great movie turned into a live stage play.
