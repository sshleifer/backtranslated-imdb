This is a wonderful start to Mickey Rooney's film career. His talent here shows that the long career ahead for him. Carriage and Truck Chase Exciting During the 1937 era. The beginning of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure of my book. The performance of spring Byington is as nice as usual. Please take a chance by Mr. Rooney or the owner of the movie owners and produce it on DVD. I think it will be a winner.
