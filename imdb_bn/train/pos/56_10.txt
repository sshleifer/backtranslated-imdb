This is one of the most wonderful stories I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> If this film is directed by Larry Clark, then perhaps this story of school shooting was seen by the murderer and the person who was going crazy in the first place. Instead, after school school shooting, and how affected survivors were affected, <br /> <br /> I saw Basi Phillips in other films, but His performance in this movie is his best. The only other movie I met with Arica Christensen, "Swim Fan", which did not want me to see this movie almost, but she made herself very well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I saw that was actually able to cry to me. Believe me when I tell you, it will not happen often. <br /> <br /> The home cell is a beautiful movie, and that's all there is ...
