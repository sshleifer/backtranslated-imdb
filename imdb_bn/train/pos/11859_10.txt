All Beller and Shot Callers in MTV Creubes pull out the classic Movie Scarfstation outside their DVD collection. It can give you an idea that Scarface is a "gangster movie". Of course, there are gangsters and mobs, but not the point of scarface. Tony Montana (Al Pasino) is looking for a new way of life, only a dense refuge. He fell with the crowd team and became a well-known drug lord. Montana was all for what you wanted to do with your life. Classic phrase: "Hello my little friend!" Scarface is also. When I come to think of this quote always remember the Brian DePalmas movie, Scarface always comes around. This falls under my top 10 favorite movies. I will rate it *** 1/2 (**** out). Definitely a movie you must see. Phenomenal
