The feeling of this movie was amazing. The performance of Adam Sandler was very inspirational. As he played a very barbarous and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role. Her character was really interesting. I can see myself reading this movie's script and not being as interested as half as part of Sandler. For some who primarily play the role of a comedy, he pulled off a serious role with what he thinks of his own quirks and inputs. I especially like the scene where Adam and Dawn's characters drive motorbike scooters around the city. I was known at this moment, because Don was one of the things Adam had seen to be away from it. With his video games, music, and so much more, he wants to avoid thinking of past thinking, running a scooter with his headphones, and escaping his thinking. This movie is definitely worth the watch.
