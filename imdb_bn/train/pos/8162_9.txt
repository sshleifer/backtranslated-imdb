As Dr. Allan Finston, Carbin Barnesen played astonishingly disrespectfully in "The Dentist". <br /> <br /> With his exotic emotional compulsive tendencies in high gear, IRS strangled him, and a very suspicious acting wife; Dr. Allan Finston is trying to lose his sanity every day. <br /> <br /> When Doc really realizes that his wife has a relationship with the local pool boy, it closes the string of an event that leads to torture, murder, Anne-Mayhem! "Dentist" is a solid film! At the same time, Dr. Feinstone makes characters and hateful characters. Though he is completely out of his cow, the audience will feel sympathy for him. That's my friends ..... well played. <br /> <br /> A wonderful firm cast of actors around this gem of a film. Nice aspects, good killings, and graceful, and effective pensing gives you entertainment throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Highly recommend!
