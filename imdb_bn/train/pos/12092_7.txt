The late night television shows that I remember it in the early 70's. Afraid of hell from me But then, I was young at those days, for now I'm not a witch like movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mario Bava Black Sande (1960), Cursed of Living Dead Kiel) (1966) and Castell√© (1965) in the Nightmare of Mario Kiyano. If you want wonderful atmosphere as well as wonderful writing then check this out as well. This rate along with the early poe films that I'm doing in the same period of Roger's chronology. <br /> <br /> I saw a new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French print and it has been a great improvement over the old pan -and scanning print that was made round on television for years. It briefly adds a few minutes of dialogue (French) which does not add much to the movie completely, but it is perfectly beautiful to look complete without cutting. Unfortunately the DVD does not really offer any extra additional offers yet from the film. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the first scenario was that smoke-response was shown to the people by the front door of the inn. I guess editors could not catch it at this time, or maybe they did not care, but this is one thing I did not see for the first time. That's the DVD's wonderful. You will see all the flubs, mistakes and details that the first time was almost clear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
