Emilio Miraglio's "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times" (1972) is the most perfect example of a giyalo I've ever seen, mixing all the necessary ingredients in a cruel stove. Above all, and most important to me, this is a complex, twisty plot that finally creates perfect ideas and the murderer here does not fully come out completely outside the left ground. The story is about a series of sudden murders (you already know how many people from the title of the movie, right?), Which seems to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy related to two sisters, it is an involved and murderer, a red cloth, with a madwoman crazy smile, both terrifying And memorable. Every great giello needs some lovely lead actresses, and here are some of the many stores under the laughable beautiful Barbara BUET led by one of our sisters, and among its earlier roles, Sible Danning, a last-minute trouser in Barbara's fashion house. Another essential element of a superior geyollo is an attractive, croit score and Bruno Nicolai provides one for this movie that can be with you for a few days. Fantastic scene? Check again. Originally pictured in Uruzburg in Germany, the image is actually a treatment for the eye. Okay, okay, but what about this murder? After all, what is not gaely? Well, I'm glad to report that most of the viewers should be well pleased with the various disguise, shooting, humiliation and other killings that the film cooks deliciously ... cryptos, strange dreams sequences, rats and bats (and many more!), Drugs References, a rape scene, a compulsory red basket and a woman from Uganda, violent leaders for female viewers The best person I said, a perfect gazelle. And even better, this DVD means no matter what fairytale folks you have, and what you know: A fantastic print and extra load to boot! Thank you friends
