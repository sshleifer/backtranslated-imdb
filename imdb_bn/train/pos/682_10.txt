This is one of my favorite movies, and it can go very slowly for a while, it's good to see. A corporate lawyer (Richard Chamberlain) is dragged into a case involving "City" Aborigines, and this is no common case. Okay, a man died but it was not a normal kill. Recently more rain has risen than the average rainfall, and most of the film's atmosphere is somewhat clustrophobic and oppressive. Indigenous is harboring a secret and the beans refuse to spill. There is a lot to do with white men to create an idea about "city" vs. "tribal" indigenous people, and of course, in the big city, no Abee will practice in tribal ways. Ohhhh Chamberlain has a weird dream and it is the core of how it is happening, even though how many times I have seen it, I do not understand the fair connection. This is a very scary and weird movie, and a fine example of Peter Weyer's ability to create excitement. The end is a little confusing but I literally take it, this is the easiest way and awesome. 10 out of 10 and highly recommend.
