A modern contemporary novel about stress that reduces and ultimately closes marriage pledges. A young cosmic couple from Milan arises from the origins of the main emergence of a 'Homily' narrated by a country cleric following the oath of marriage. In it, the future course of marriage has been made, which is a little away from the stress of modern life. In this story the 'moral' of this story is that it was necessary for the marriage to stop the relationship between now and past, family and friends. This image was a relative blockbuster by the Italian Italian standard. It's a terrible shame that this movie is not available in DVDs or VHS.
