Hostage Cagney constantly screams in this story of a stage-producer who is struggling strongly against upcoming "conversations" movies. <br /> <br /> This story is presented in this way as love, cheating, women and dancing as you are not treated at a dull moment. The rehearsal cell was performed very well in the mass scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Preview Work Producer Thus he tried to save his ass out of the business, before he started, Broadway was the producer. Joan Blondell is superb as a neutral love interest, nan, he has given so much extraordinary performance for movies of the time that it is so unusual for movies of those times, to be depicted as a strong woman for any woman's change. <br /> <br /> My only problem with the film was the final end production. These were excellent, beautifully dancers and surprisingly produced, but they do not seem right in the story. The only link to their original story is that the agreement was to add Cagney 3 previews within 3 days and what they did I firmly believed that the girls were rehearsed during the whole movie and this set could fit in the movie theater. In this way "sitting on a backyard fence" was more suitable for the story. <br /> <br /> Eventually this terribly short story story takes a stop and it was not a good thing. I was tired of seeing the first musical sequence and then I realized that the other two were coming. These sequences have received many chocolates from viewers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
