We are talking about a low-budget movie, and it is understood that there are some weaknesses (no sellers: one suddenly explosive expert and one meaningless alcoholic); But in general, the story is of interest to you, most of the characters are favorites and some key situations. <br /> <br /> I really like some movies that surprise you with some people who do not want to believe you, and then they pull up and turn the plot ... I appreciate it. <br /> <br /> If you know what I mean, try to see a movie in Argentina "Nove Rinas" (Nine Queens).
