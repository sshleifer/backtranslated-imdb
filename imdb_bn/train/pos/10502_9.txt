I have had fun playing a fun. Levels are creative, there are fluid controls for its time, and good graphics. There is also a group to fight mad enemies and enemies. Sometimes the levels are frustrating, and if you leave something of the hard level and still, a boss will get to get more done to fight, it can be annoying. Another complaint is the camera angle; Although it works well most of the time, it can be painful in certain situations. If your big time is Mario Fan; It's for you Even if you do not have her a huge fan, I still want to recommend this one. It's a big game and it may take some time to get what you need, but it's very satisfying. The time is good for playing short bursts. It will certainly be of interest to you; It sure is not mine!
