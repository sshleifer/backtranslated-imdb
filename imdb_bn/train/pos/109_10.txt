This movie, which believes that the movie is not the seventh industry, is not entertainment entertainment. Lars von Triair creates an uninterrupted atmosphere in Germany against anti-war. You get absorbed into the dream and you are given the last credit to go only. An exciting story with the plot necessarily comes second, but still raised difficult issues. Just wonderful.
