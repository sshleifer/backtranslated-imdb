Dominic and Eugene's mental power and character are nothing else. This is one of the most emotional, sensitive, and heart-felt movies I have ever seen! Roy Litata, Tom Hulce and actress Jamie Lee Curtis, have the ability to win the Oscars! Not enough words to express how cool this movie is. Certainly, those who are not in sensitive movies can not take care of us as much about the Dominican and Eugene, but for the rest of us, this film goes to the heart and compassion and the only right of humanity. <br /> <br /> <br /> ***************************************************** ******************************************* Made-school interns who face long hours and meet the needs of the hospital. Due to the loss of brain due to his father, two of his parents, Dominic (born 12 minutes before) were tortured by their father, a little slow and painful. (An impressive moment when found in this movie that will drop you in the tears!) Eugene (AK "Geno") faces a painful conflict. He must decide whether to finish the medical school, which means to take his place in another city and drop Dominique (AK "Nicky"), or cut off his remaining education to care for him. Nicki works as a trash collector to help her brother get a Med-School tuition. <br /> <br /> The question of morality, morality and responsibilities in this landmark film is nicely mixed. Guino thinks when Nikki can progress towards independence, Dominic runs around things to help the drugmaker turn around, or time to use a faulty cord found on a dump on the power machine. <br /> <Nicky, Larry, "Character" and Nicky's partner on his garbage route, who is going to the Atlantic City with Jimo and Jennifer (his girlfriend, whom he is studying in Clinical Pharmacology) with all the stories, heading the Atlantic and gambling away All their money But deep down, you can see that Larry thinks for her. In their rounds, Nikki also makes friends with a little boy, whom we find and also beat his father. The end result is also tragic, and when this happens, the pain that you see in Nikki's face is called Volume. <br /> <br /> Two brothers' sharing sensitivity can not be extended enough. All Nicky likes to want and whatever he can accept to accept the recognition (He loves to go to church, loves Hogan), likes Nikki more than anything in the world. But can his brother become independent enough to follow the dream of becoming a doctor? This is a great movie which has gained much recognition from its capabilities, but unfortunately, it came out of the same time as the rain, which works with the same problem. However, I like Dominic and Eugene because it has more powerful mental components. This movie can be accurately targeted at Tier-Nou√©, so use the Clenex easily! What a film !!!!
