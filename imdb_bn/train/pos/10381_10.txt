The previous critic said it right. I saw it once, was enchanted, when it was seen second time it was re-aired in the first air a week or two. I still remember some of the scenes. The inauguration of the 20th century was mentioned as the title of World War I. A view of the scenes was set in only one part of a public, which was an interesting historical note. At the moment when the first woman touches the other one is one of my best movie moments of all time. I do not think it's a "gay movie", it's an interesting and flexible time to love story, where two principals can be women. I want to watch this movie again; I will buy this one before coming out of the DVD.
