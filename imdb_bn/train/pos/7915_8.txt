It is the idea of ​​more than 300 artists "computer unnecessary over time" through animation. At the end of the 80's and released in 1990, it was cutting the threshold for the day. I thought it was good and the spots were quite interesting. <br /> <br /> There is no sense in most of the scenes, it is simply transformed into another but it was fun to see. All this about a visual, really about any story. There were some weird sequences in which strange men-animals would dance almost with the birds. It was back then which all backed up the computer. Even the word "computer animated" was not well known. <br /> <br /> This is an opportunity to showcase this new technology in small colors, such as a nice color and a fantastic view of cartoons. No words, just pictures with electronic music. Stoners really liked this. <br /> <br /> This is a wonderful, 40 minute "eye candy" and "head candy". The effects of today's CG could affect it, but I think you will still be entertained by this.
