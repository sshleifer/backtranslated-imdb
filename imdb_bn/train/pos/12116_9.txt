... This image's bet Davis version was better than the Kim Nova version. <br /> <br /> Despite all the other comments I have here, I really like the version of Bate Davis, although the Nova version is there <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have a raw emotion of Davis Milledrade It seems more appropriate to prostitution, who easily feels for prostitution. <br /> <br /> Constitutes a part of those raw emotions that fall in love with a poor doctor. He is the emotion of frustration, failure, "uniqueness" - he is emotionally strong emotion. On the other hand, Davis Mildred shows his passion without immediate and brutality. There is no feeling of disappointment, or failure, or "otherness"; Rather, he only survived as a poor woman in the Victorian era. <br /> <br /> Novak's screenplay was even more poor mildred than Davis, almost through the whole film. Davis Milledrade was ** ** not helpless until he actually came to the doctor and requested for help. And when he taunts him for keeping the body and soul together and for his method of good use of his love for him - then he unleashes the most enthusiastic rejection of Snowden's holier than the attitude he sees on the screen: "I washed my face. I washed my face!" Novak's weaknesses were excellent. The reality of Davis was memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> Agreed IMDB!
