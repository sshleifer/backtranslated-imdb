This is mildness that we do not know! It is summarized in the comic strip for the syndicate to sell the newspaper! Lee and Jeanette Bachler were the real Modcey Blaise fans who gave the Dream Job - a preview of humility that fans have never seen before. In their audio-language, they acknowledge that they have changed their source to make the story easier. "Purists" should also be noted that he really did not know whether Miklos was true whether he was "suspended for time" or truth. I did not rent or borrow DVDs like other "critics", I bought it! And I do not want to return! I saw it three times and I could not sleep with it! Great dialog and well-known characters which I care about (even the bad guy Miklos) like novels and comic strips! I can not even wait for the next Modedia (and Willie) movie, especially if this "preview" is a sign of what's coming!
