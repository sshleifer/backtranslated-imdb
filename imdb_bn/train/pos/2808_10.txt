This film is not morbid, nor is it depressing. It's a sad, because in the early '90s ADS-unfortunate. But his true message is one of love and perseverance. <br /> <br /> Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other is immediate, and the rise of AIDS increases and becomes the center of their life, you will see strength and commitment which is really heartfelt. <br /> <br /> While originally released "Silverlake Life", I was deeply involved in HIV / AIDS education and healthcare, volunteering as an advisor to an HIV / AIDS clinic. The film spoke with me like any other AIDS movie, because Mark and Tom were real people, in real life I used to live in everyday life. I fully knew from experience that it is like eating, eating, eating vibrant, young, healthy people like before? Seeing this happened with Mark and Tom in the film, the real friends of my life have gone bad. It touches me that after all these years, still affect me.
