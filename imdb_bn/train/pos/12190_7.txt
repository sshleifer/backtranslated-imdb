Without the "Lady of Shanghai" and studio intervention, it is very difficult to say about the film. At the time, Oson Welles's main interest in film was to collect money for his theater; In fact, funding his own projects led him to look for acting work. He soon created "Shanghai Lady" for his wife, Rita Hayorth. Harry was afraid of Rita and released the film for a year. <br /> <br /> This plot is worried about Irish sailor Michael Wahra, who is Elsa (short golden hair in love with Hawthorne). A well-known criminal lawyer of her husband, Arthur Banner (Everett Sloane), who was internally disturbed. They appoint wahra to work in his yacht, and there they are deep and deep on the web of murder and fraud. <br /> <br /> "Shanghai Lady" moves at a snap speed, although I agree with one poster that today's movies have been criticized for taking a plot. Yet, this movie drags. Fantastic house scene is fantastic - though Wells wanted it without music, and I believe the studio cut it. It's a shameful case. The film is stunning, atmospheric, bold, and very stylish throughout life. <br /> <br /> Wells is a wonderful actor, his young man has handsome, charismatic and has a fantastic voice and technique, but in many movies it is almost as if he did not believe in himself or took the time to develop a character. Instead he relies on externals such as pronunciation and fake nose. The only one he did not do this day, "Tomorrow for eternity", where the director gets a wonderful, deep-felt performance from him. Comparatively with "Obedience" where he sees that he is acting efficiently and calling his performance. Wells quadruple is here - as a director, star, co-writer and narrator. A complete unnecessary accent and intense looking sports were a quick way to a deluxe. However, he always obliges. <br /> <br /> Supporting players are excellent, with Slayan and Glenn Anders. Heyever, gorgeous and soft-spoken (his song was once again dubbed by Anita Elise) is naturally a complete goddess and one of the great screen presentations. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> But the audience becomes frustrated, as in "The Magnificent Ambrosus" - Wells does any work in the studio system. He was a great artist who should have given an independent regime; He was not. He was a strange biffer - he needed more independence, but as proof of his next few works, he needed the structure of the studio. Well, he can not have both.
