During the Second World War, most of the war films produced in the US were very interesting to watch but were suffering from serious gaps in realism because they were being produced more for promotional prices in order to increase the spirits of others. I am not rejecting these movies because many of them are still very frequent. However, they are often barred from being a great movie because they often lack the realityism. A perfect example was the John Garfield Film Air Force - one of which is almost half of the single handover of a B-17 Japanese Air Force! However, Marine Pride has a welcome departure - to achieve a higher score in a truly accurate way to present a true story. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was not the true story because it was impossible to think it is true. However, after more research I found that it was actually true for two men's amazing stories, who did so much to earn the Medal of Honor. This is an event where real life looked very incredible to be true!
