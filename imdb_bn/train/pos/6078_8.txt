I was particularly glad that Othello itself was dark-skinned in this movie, and Desdemona almost did not always have such beautiful hair. Cast played very well, and I liked the following scripts of Shakespeare's original text so credible. But I must say that some scenes have played extremely harmlessly for Desdemona's character. I always think he is very modest, and why is not it appropriate to show him in bed with Casio - even though it is only in the imagination of Othello. At first, I was shown so openly in a love scene between Othello and Desdemona, even I was a little surprised. But overall, I liked the movie and especially in the scene of Desdemona's death crying.
