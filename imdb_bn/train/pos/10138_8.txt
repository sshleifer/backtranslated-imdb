Well about time Any and all hope that I'm going to be a standout episode of this season entries has really been left. Although so far there has been a lot of entry, at least this episode has been better. Rather than the funny story director Robert Schmitt, who is not only bad, his credits and writers go back to John Esposito, whose only scripting works include the story of Mummy and Graveyard Shift, the best written and most thought provoking season for us. In "Right to Die" we were treated with Cliff and Abbey's story. At the beginning of the episode the couple is having a conversation. Abbey Cliff has been caught cheating and she is desperately trying to win her back. When they talk, they fall into a car crash, where Cliffe has only scratch and curvature, but Abbey is thrown from the car and throws him in the fire when a spark jams up and goes on gasoline. And this is just setup people. Cliffe has to decide whether to live in this condition once in the hospital, without any skin and only nervous reaction. There is also a side effect. Each time he performs flatlines, Abbey walks as a ghost and hurts for all kinds of people. These handsets are the best part of the season and certainly one of the top podium stays as fixed. From the terrible effects I never came to the small script that came in a few twists and did not see suspense so that you can almost touch it, Diet Wright should have the right to live forever.
