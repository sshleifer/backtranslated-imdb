I really liked the movie. I remember reading it several times as a kid and was happy to see a movie about books. <br /> <br /> I was a boy for a boy and a girl aged 11 and 8 years old, and was talking to the girl for watching movies. But happily, to the end, he was delighted to see it and even said that he wanted to buy it in DVDs for the early exit. <br /> <br /> There was some amazing sunny moments and the movie was not as "gross" because I hope it will be ... so it was fairly high over-o meter ... <br /> <br /> < /> The only thing that I can not understand is that he wanted to live in his "Dili" line which Woody had mentioned in his personal episode ... that was the only time for me to shock (and you listen to the listeners of the audience at the moment Hear yabhabe film) ... I have no clue why this film was kept; It has added nothing to the actual film except the shock / gas factor ... there is another beautiful movie. I see the "Pepsi" girl has grown all the time.
