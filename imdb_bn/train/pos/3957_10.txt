The Three Stugges I always liked that many actors. I love every one of the shorts that I just love about. I love all six Stooges (Curly, Shang, More, Larry, Joe, and Carlie Joe)! Shorts were all colorful and also many other great actors and actresses star in which they were shorts! In my opinion, The Three Stoges is the greatest actor of all time and the most fun comedy team ever! <br /> <br /> There is no one else with my favorite Struggles Sheep Sheep Shamp, be careful! These little ones are beautiful Christine McCaintere, De Greene, Doris Hawke, Alin Lockwood, Johnny Cassiere, Nancy Sanders, Lu Leonard, Maxine Gates and Emil Citka. Green and McIntyre provide great performance here! There are lots of fun here. This is a very delightful brief. There is another similar three stages that each other is called Bride's Girl and I recommend both!
