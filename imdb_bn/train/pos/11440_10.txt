I went again and saw the rivers and tides again. It's the second time in two days and yes, I like watching movies as often as I need. Yesterday I was hit by the image and the brightness of Goldsworthy's work. This morning when I cast the coin # 29 Goldsworthy has an affinity with water, so the title. I got the 5th line change which was transferred to the # 7 army. Black Art was a fight. Anyway, I knew I'd see the film again. <br /> <br /> I have read several reviews online from the SF tester. Critics like this picture, but said Goldswari's remarks have come to the conclusion of her enjoyment. She'd rather have the image and the wonderful soundtrack. So I was aware that I saw this second time. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I thought that I would vote for Andy Goldwright as the King of the World. Okay, today I can get a little bit beyond the image and listen to what he said. Can I enjoy the movie without his comment? What he is doing, he goes on the path beyond what he says "art". His understanding of water, time, stone, change, and over makes me think the resurrection of the Lao card or some incarnation. Its some work / sound like Jane. His knowledge ... <br /> <br /> However, the film is only (apparently) shown here in Bay Area. Be a Trend Setter Go to your local movie and tell them, they do not force you to book a movie that you heard from the ground forcibly. It is called river and tide. <br /> <br />
