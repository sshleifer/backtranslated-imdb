Acting - Fantastic. Story - amazing. Script- wonderful. <br /> <br /> There are a few ways to describe this movie. Yes, it is slowly and most of the talk, but how it has been said about all the stories and flashbacks of their lives, you want to learn more about this harmful and sad story. I myself am reading this book reading book and it showed me more light in this story and answered some questions that were missing in the film. I'm going to read the Exekers song, which is half 'half' of Gilmore's story. This movie reminds me a lot about the "poking the glass looking". You hear a song in the film Gary Gilmour Eyes, which wrote a song about a punk band that wants to stay in the eye of Gary Gilmore (which was given as a transplant after Gary's death), and when you hear it, Mickael Gary Last seen, if you only see your song here, see the whole situation a little differently. This movie opened my eyes and other ways. I highly recommend this movie (and book) too.
