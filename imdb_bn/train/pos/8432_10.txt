On Saturday evening I saw, I did not read anything about the movie. And then, when I was watching it, I felt Lena and Boesman's woe in my bones. I was so attracted by acting and voice and filming that I only heard partially in the conversation. Soon after my sleep, my husband fell asleep and I was shameless under the influence of the film. I just wanted to tell him that, "If I ever want to get an Oscar nomination, then it will be for these two actors." I decided to wait till the next day. Then I read more about IMDB's film, and I wanted to know that Mr. Berry has died before publishing this film, and she probably never saw the latest version of her brilliant work. I still want to tell him that his film is a true independent film, his concept and spirit. The actors are not only appreciated for their brilliant performance but for taking a part with no light, no showing off, in good contrast, human beings show true images of depression. Sorry but stupid
