I was lucky enough to catch this movie when I was volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival. I've always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the castles of William Castle, so it must definitely look for me. <br /> <br /> This was an underlying director of William Kasall's life and work, in my opinion. True, he made some awesome budget sculptures, but he added some of these movies: real live theater gymics you can not see anymore. For example, in his movies, because of cardiovascular disease, someone is with a nurse and keeps vibration under the tingular chairs, but his nurse was. <br /> <br /> This is a really well documented documentary and this instead lights up the galaxy director, and celebrates its contribution to horror movies. It portrays a larger castle than the character of life, who was very good and had a smile on his face. <br /> <br /> Unlike most movie documentaries, most of the viewers from film historians see, spin tingala! The interviews were shown by most family members and directors who were influenced by his work, such as John Waters, John Lindes and Joe Dante. A classic horror and sci-fi fans must look for.
