I'm not going to watch this show. But, I'm glad I did. These critics are not right! This is the most fun and most entertaining thing in T.V at the present moment! However, when interviews are done with ordinary folks, they probably seem to be in vain; However, animals and insects keep them in the mouth, and it is a smile riots. I smiled so much, I had tears in my eyes. The kids are milk-rich and dry-invaluable with their mother. Husband and wife are talking about the health problems of the birds, and the male bird has said to the wife that she broke down completely and broke her completely! Animal Conflict The most fantastic show I've ever seen in some time! Hopefully, when this run ends, it will return to next summer.
