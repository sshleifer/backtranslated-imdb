The title of this movie is taken from a party game called "Seven minutes of Heaven". When he was popular among my husband's friends at Brooklyn's junior high school in New York, he described something like "Spin-The Bottle", "Lives of Riley" and other Chinese kiss games. According to the rules, a boy's name and a girl will be drawn, and the selected people get together a dark toilet and stay there for seven minutes. In the meantime, both parties would have speculation in the party's guest whether it was kissing each other in the hold, hug, and / or toilet secrecy. At the end of the seven minutes, the leader of the game used to say, "Times Up" or the celaitt is standing on the door, and the couple will be out of the cobblet. After interrogating other guests, the couple will have to accept what they did during their "seven minutes in heaven" time. Then other couples will be selected to enter the closet until other couples participate. The couples who will be the most admired will win them. <br /> <br /> Such games have served as a social "ice breaker" for children and teens, but they can be embarrassing and frightening for embarrassing people. The title of the movie is given this title because it is the first experiences of thirteen related to crush and romantic love.
