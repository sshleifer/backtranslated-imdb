At any time without the laughing out, this film often requires an activation of faith to start ending, as one should say to himself, "it is old", "it is a classic", "please", because the movie is so bad, but That's the best because of his best. This is a date movie. This is a classic, if one is a tarnished one. I am not interested in ridiculing people on the basis of policy, when others do this I am a little bored. When I immersed my orange juice on the table to make my mind nifty fun, then a fool looked at an intelligent. Yes, someone tells himself that he is a fool, even when he is at the top of his game, he is also real intelligent. The same is true for the informer, which is very awesome on the occasion, and yet it deserves great photography, some fine acting, a nice score and a good, decent simple story. In the end, which I will not give up, politics, religion and psychology will be united, in a church, the scene is visible and can be made upward, even when life is sometimes. The illiterate people of general faith behave differently (perhaps bright) from different people, and the view is not so incredible (I bought it, but I know Irish) as shameful. Yet people behave like this, they say such things. Not everyone is hip, and it can not even be desired for everyone to be hip. Today, seventy or eighteen years ago is the best man? And how? I do not think so. We are just different. See the movie now.
