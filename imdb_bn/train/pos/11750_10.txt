I saw it in '86 in the theater and started laughing more than once from my chair. "In Beirut" ... "What do you know about Beirut?" ... "Bereut ... She's the best baseball baseball ever to survive." <br /> <br /> You know how it will end but it's a great time getting there. Training scenes are very interesting but the best scene might be that when Jack and Reno try to make a makeup dinner with their wives, Falcons vs. Vikings are trying to see the night football game on Monday. <br /> <br /> <br /> There seems to be such fun with Williams and Russell and it is extremely bad that it is abandoned as a top notch comedy.
