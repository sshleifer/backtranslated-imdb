I was brought to Doc Savage and was brought up by green death as a child, yet I still consider it to be completely recreational. I've seen many friends and colleagues from this movie and are most delighted by the variety of responses, granted they mostly feel I'm weird but you have "I do not know what I know about doc, but he always gets girls" when you look at his sad band of men will be the final line. This movie is a classic spoof of all the super heroes, and this was the way before it, it will not be taken seriously, will move towards Austin Powers. Ron Eli is a God It is unfortunate that this image was not released from DVD in the UK. I do not think it should be rebuilt and shocking, as I said it is a classic, it can not be without Ron. (Italian work without mini and Michael Kain). I pay it 10/10
