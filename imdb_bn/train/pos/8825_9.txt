This 2004 Oscar nominated Spanish is a very small B / W film. A young girl goes to a cafe, gets a coffee, and some musicians stand silently with their instruments. All patronage is motionless like mannequins. But a man is quite happy and breaks a song of what happened in the morning at 7:35. To the very end a wonderful moment which is quite good, amazing. People, places, everything looks pretty normal. And like the musical piece "Bolero", things keep building up to Claymax. With its structure, theme, movement and intelligence, it's an 8-minute composition best.
