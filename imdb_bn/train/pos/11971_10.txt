I think the comments about the show are a little exaggerated. When a person comes to see a TV show, what does he look for? Enjoying that he shows a show, until he is a critics or a story analyst. But most of us do so and show and enjoy show shows. Flower House Office / School is a standard show to visit after a heavy day. It makes you laugh and it's not just humor. <br /> <br /> Yes, the Tanner family is a perfect family, perfectly fictional families. If such a family exists in the real world then it may be a role model to follow us. But this is not a TV show, a real family, and there is no mistake in portraying a fabulous family on television. The program can be so long that the truth shows us that people have enjoyed seeing it, which will later comment. <br /> <br /> Another good aspect of the show is that no person of any age will enjoy it, but it must take a message back, even if the message is a child. Jesse's talk with Michelle is very sensitive, if someone does not feel like kids. <br /> <br /> Overall, after seeing every ceremony of the flower house, I will say that there is lot of satisfaction in your heart after many other shows.
