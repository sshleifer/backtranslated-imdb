There was a better movie than 101 Dalmatians (not live-action, animated version), I think it's still a little less about what Disney can do. It was safe, the music was more suitable for action and the effects were well done (compared to 101). The performance was probably good, but the character of the character played a more appropriate role in this character, and Glenn Close did not miss as much as the first movie can not be missed. She makes it shine. Her poor lack and excessive soccer sideclubs play astonishing role, and they join us in described Disney. This is not a small family movie, little or no offensive material, and it's still fun and interesting for adults and children. It is bound to be a classic, as many Disney movies. Hopefully the third one will be better - because you know that they probably want to create one. ;)
