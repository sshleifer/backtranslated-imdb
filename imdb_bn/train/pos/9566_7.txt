Ultra-Grim crime drama from Pow-Soi Cheyang, director of "Home Sweet Home". Yesterday, it reminded me of Billy Tang's "Run and Kill", although it is not so smooth. Nevertheless, it is a composite, defective bit about a Cambodian Lonar Peng (Edison Chain) who came to Hong Kong to kill a lawyer. While fleeing the scene, he killed Sam Yai's colleague, who is in the middle of dealing with his death father, who is in the middle of dealing with his dying father, so Sam begins to feel like a mad, emotional manhunt for Pang, which is a dozen nearby bodies and uninterrupted violence. There must be something in the air in recent times because I have never found so many people in each other. This is a violent, nasty stuff, so I'm very part of it, and I congratulate her downbeat VB. It's apparently arrested and sound design is very unique. Dramatically, not every character can find him until everyone is in a world of spiral-or pain of suffering. Adds the depth of a mistress story with Pang's attachment to a girl of sexual abuse and spawns a wonderful fourth law which does a fine job of a wonderful surgery.
