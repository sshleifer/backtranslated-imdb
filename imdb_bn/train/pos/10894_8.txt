I had some reservations about this movie, I think Christmas is a source film - it will be the normal bill of the rental. While in the middle of the heat wave at the end of June, we decided to give it a shot, whatever we might see some snow. <br /> <br /> This movie started laughing after the other. Ben Affleck was credible in his character, but this true star James Gandophini She delivered a true intellect about her line and made a great "dad". <br /> <br /> If you want an enjoyable few hours, definitely check out this one.
