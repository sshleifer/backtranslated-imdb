"Mechenosets" is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. The name of the film can be translated into English "sword-carrying". The main hero (Sasha) was born with an exceptional ability: he can defend himself with a very sharp sword from under his own skin. At first he can think of a more stupid superhero than the stupid film about outstanding phenomena and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly be called anti-hero. I think he is a person who has lost faith in his life and faith, love and love. In his life, he never met anyone who knew him and loved him (except his mother). Each of its steps is stained with blood; He takes revenge for his gift, which becomes a condemnation for him. And suddenly he met her. He does not require inactive discussions and explanations. She loves him for what he loves. She does not care. He is more important than anyone else beside him. But soon he found his secret information: he killed two people (his former boyfriend and his bodyguard) to protect him in front of him. Even then she could not escape from her feelings. They try to run but hide it. Eventually they have a serious car accident. She is caged; She is in a psychiatric hospital. They do not know anything about each other, but she believes that she will save her. She surmounts a lot of hurdles but eventually finds her. They run again but they are not invulnerable. He wounded, he needed to rest, but police caught them almost. He did not know what to do, they entered into a corner, and his sword started cutting trees, helicopters around him, but he did not need it, because he was already dead in his weapon, and he is again alone in the whole world.
