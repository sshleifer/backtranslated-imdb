Fire and Ice set an animated film in a fantasy world. This movie is about a village that is destroyed by a giant glacier that houses the Neckrun, the evil ice house. Larne, the only survivor of the village, is ready to take revenge for the people killed by glaciers. Ice glaciers leave the land of the fire and the land prints of Telegra are abducted by evil creatures. Larn set out to find her and out of Nekron and set out to kill. Fire and Ice is directed by Ralph Bakhshi, who is one of my favorite adults. He has written us such animated masterpieces, in the film version of the Beats film, and like the heavy film Heavy Traffic. I did not often like Fire and Ice about other works of Ralph Bakhshi, but I still see the film is enjoyable. It was part of some very nice animations and the story had adequate entertainment. The only basic complaint I received was that I wanted to have more stories because the story used was very thin and there was not much else. I asked for some more time, because it is less than 80 minutes of running time. It is still a recreational action adventure movie that is suitable for children aged 8 or over in contrast to frigate cats or heavy traffic. I only wish there was a more advanced story and it went a bit longer than it was.
