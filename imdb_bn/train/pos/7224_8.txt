When the DeathTrap was first released, posters - reproduced in the covers of this DVD - offer a graphic like Rubik's cube. This is an appropriate figure: Originally written for Ira Stewart's stage, who wrote a memorable work such as Rosemary Bab and Stephen Wies, this game was one of Broadway's most famous twists and it translates very well into the screen under the direction of Sidney Lumet. <br /> <br /> <br /> Dathrop is one of those movies, which is very difficult to discuss, because it is famous for the famous plot in any detail. But the opening premises are very clever: Sydney Br√ºhl (Michael Kane) is a famous writer of mystery plays, but this day he seems to have lost his touch. Especially after the cruel opening night, an old student, Clifford Anderson (Christopher Reeve), sent a script for a game written by her. This is called "DeathTrap" and Sydney recognizes it as a sure hit. A kind of injury that will revive his career ... Indeed, to beat one. And when Clifford went on to play this game, the events suddenly started to become unexpectedly possible. <br /> <br /> Similar to Anthony Schaffer, like Twisty Slut, more stories on the stage at home than the Deathtrap screen. - To reach full power it requires a immediacy that offers a live performance. Nevertheless, according to Director Lumet's expert guidance, it makes the screen more respectable. Most of these are due to cast, which is a significant fine. Michael Kain gives a truly brilliant performance, what can Diane Canon offer to the only good performance of his tragic little acting career, funny and respectful as Sidney's shameless wife and Christopher Revive? If you do not see it in the production of the first stage theater, it does not come together until it has to be done. <br /> <br /> at Gary Taylor, Ur GFT, Amazon Reviewer
