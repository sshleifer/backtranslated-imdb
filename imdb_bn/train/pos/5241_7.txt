Thaddeus O'Sullivan's excellent film has presented several powerful performances by British and Irish actors. The film works well with fork topics and effectively influences Belfast's frustrating and terrific environment in the 1970s. Surprisingly realistic, there is nothing to glorify both parties in this conflict. On one hand, it is a young Catholic father who shows that trying to raise his family without being dragged into trouble. On the other hand, it is related to a loyalist gang charged for promoting violence. Very interesting and, thankful, entertaining. Although no laugh will be expected. 10 out of 7
