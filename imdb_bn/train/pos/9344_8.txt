I have to admit, this movie has moved me so much that I exploded in tears. However, I always think about things twice, and instead of writing a written that defines the film as shameless and faultless, I like to take risks of a closer look. <br /> <br /> What is the first? An uncertain effect on the audience is that it starts and continues as a slow film that does not try to blow you with real scenes from 9/11. The talent thumbs for this stroke, because, unlike Stone's world trade center, this fortunately does not focus on the attack, but like the collapse of a nuclear explosion, which is rarely visible but dangerous and devastating. The psychological impact, the brutal devastation of 9/11, and the American people have been attacked, it is almost clear in the film. I think Binders conducted the suspicious observation of 9/11 society in America's post, and Sandler created rockets from an average genius from average comedy actors in my opinion, who showed the eligibility of the Oscars. However, in the film Bloud Diamond, The Capri is telling the character and I quote: "Ah, these Americans always want to take their feelings". Now, I do not want to suffer them, but I definitely want to compare. Since 9/11, 9/11, the whole world is confronted with memories, memories and memories. Halfway artists and writers such as Safaron Faar more than 9/11. Now, this huge number of cultural products, dealing with 9/11, killed 3000 people in the biggest tragedy of this twentieth century. The number of books written on this subject and the number of films that have been conducted in this regard, and I say with full respect that the importance of this inappropriate crime should be dropped out of proportion. <br /> <br /> The phenomenon is: People die every day due to bad people or badly lost wrongdoing and horrible crimes. We have war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Bihar and many other countries. On daily basis, we have forgotten the African people's poverty and we are sympathetic to them with less degrees than American victims of 9/11 because they are black and because they do not have much in their lives. General with our western life. America does not have money or prospects for celebrating their national tragedies like America. So, what I am saying is: We feel more reason for 3,000 people of 9/11 and their families because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. There is no magazine article, a movie or a book about 9/11. At the conclusion: I have negotiated with Charlie Feynman, but I'm not sure whether I had more rights for him than to have a right to lose his whole family in the Rwandan Civil War. <br /> <br /> Will you catch me?
