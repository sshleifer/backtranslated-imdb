Touch and sad movie. The trial and tribulation of a writer is trying to come to terms of paralysis due to a cycling accident. The film focuses on its relationship with her married lover, whom she often feels very hostile, and her interactions with victims of other accidents, especially the black down-out-out and a white-most bike. The film is often ridiculous, often sad, and always believable. Get the Clientx Box and see it on Sunday afternoon with your partner.
