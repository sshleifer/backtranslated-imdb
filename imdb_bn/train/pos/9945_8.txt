Previously before! This is not an action movie though it has plenty of system! I think you can compare it to American sports movies! Where a team of very bad players achieve unlucky success, without the expectation of winning a game or tournament! In this case it is not about football or baseball, but Tawkondo! In the beginning it looks good to do anything cold in this street! But soon we know that they do not want to be cold and actually earn something in life! They love watching their struggle and training! I was wondering how funny this movie is! From the beginning to the end you will smile off your pants! Young Korean actors are very confident! Go to see this wonderful good movie!
