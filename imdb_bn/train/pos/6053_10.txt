A comedy jewel Smiling, shop and pub scenes laughing loudly to me laughing - smiling uncontrollably. Characters are recognized and dialogue is well done - I know this good man! The ridiculously surprisingly gentle and film (it can be a weird sound) reminds me of an Ealing comedy. It's a quirky little film with lots of detail. It certainly takes a number of views. I saw it a few times (I showed all my friends!) And notice something new every time - some dialogue, some scenes that I did not raise before. I really liked and found some flaws in the movie but I'm not going because it's a great, emotional movie, which is really a watch, and a laughable person should enjoy it. This is a movie that it will find friends and I hope there are so many. Oh .... and it has a great soundtrack.
