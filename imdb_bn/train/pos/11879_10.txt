This is my favorite one of all time. <br /> <br /> If there is an error in the movie, it comes to you like a raging calf. It is not so busy as the audience attacks him. Unyielding as "scarf" frustrated and producing myself as Tony Montana. There is nothing left for spectators to imagine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Like the Koras in the Greek tragedy, it is a constant reminder of the will and gnashes, broods and tugs, the fate of Tony. <br /> <br /> A story of warning as a catastrophe is not so, "Scarface" rips across the screen with unnecessary forces in a runway train.
