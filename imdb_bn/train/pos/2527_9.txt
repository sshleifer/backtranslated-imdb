This is what I call a "pre-sci fi, sci fi" movie. It gets better than this incredibly good "mood" type motion picture Lugosi / Karloff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A man watching as I drowns myself in three concepts shown before The idea is caught between. I was sad and at the same time they were fascinated with two stars. <br /> <br /> This request a remix. This time, Harfan Ford was portrayed in Karphoff's part and Kiefer Suchchland was introduced as Bela Laosi. It could make it almost as well. <br /> <br /> This is one of the very best that Hollywood ever produced. I said .. it does not look good. No way.
