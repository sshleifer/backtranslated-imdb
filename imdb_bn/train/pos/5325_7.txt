The idea of ​​making a film about Beatles is a broken idea, because no production can catch the idea of ​​actual historical Beatles. Therefore, trying to recreate the past is probably not the best, but to create an illustration that works best with other available beetles. This 'Beatles of Beatles' is just what we have, without a straightforward, common story we have known. <br /> <br /> *** *** *** Here ******************************************************************************************************************* Beatles show songs that were rarely compiled by that time. Beatles "ask me", "ps you love me" and even "do not bother me". Beatles-graduates should definitely see that if the film's bitls are played in Hamburg, they only perform but the young audience can not tell them that the beetles have learned to tell them. In the original Hamburger Repertory, only "Johnny B. Goode" and Stu Sutcliffe's "Love My Tender" remains. <br /> <br /> This generation of beetles are rarely like the ones, but the rest of the film still looks good because the movie is perfect for a rest. The guy who plays the lenon well and the rest of the band is not bad. Brian Epstein is fantastic and at the moment when he carries the belly belly of the group, perhaps the most memorable scene in the whole movie. Also as a bonus you will see the film's main cavane club.
