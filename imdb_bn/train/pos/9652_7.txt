I agree that the film gradually has many scenes of daily life and no dialogue. And I was not impressed right after seeing it. However, after a few days, I realized that the movie is with me and it invented a disgusting mood in my mind. Increase my perception of this movie. It certainly qualifies for more consideration than immediately forgotten movies. Many people have commented that the film is non-linear and it is a striking form of European filmmaking, which opposes the linear narrative form of Hollywood bias. I do not really know whether it's true or not. Many dislike the lack of confusing structure and lack of clear explanation. To those visitors, I do not think I can say a lot to change their opinion. However, those who have not yet seen the film will be challenged and the movie will not expect all the answers and you can otherwise enjoy it more than that. <br /> <br /> The film has moved a bit closer, but in reality only 3 periods of history Focus on hairstyles and you can easily separate 2 out of 3 stages. It is not as confusing as the proposal; Just enjoy it and it will be clean at the end. <br /> <br /> Yes, a lot of things are not shocked or shown, and many situations are left unreasonably. But life is not? Many times you are not sure about the goals of your friends / loved ones, unless you face them and even if you are not 100% sure, they do not tell you the whole truth. This type of movie forces us to explain the reasons behind our actions. The film, however, gives you enough hints to make some reasonable guess. For example, Matthew mentally depressive, suicide point. Why? I do not know, maybe his life is not exactly the same as he expected; Maybe she misses her family but she did not forgive her father for abandoning her father when she left her sick mother. Perhaps he dedicates, reorganizes, and, in fact, separates his life with Cedric, he realizes that it is all "being restored" I think the director meant to show us that he has always stopped a little, the mentality is fragile by that scene. Maybe he has a very sensitive mentality and all these stresses are taking a toll on him. But we have also shown that he does not take any animal to mental abuse by his boyfriend's interaction and cat cats. Also, there is a conversation between Doctor and Cedric that triggers the cause of breakup and due to suicide attempt. The doctor asks him if everything is okay, and Cedric once thought that though he once betrayed Matthew, but according to Cedric it is nothing. The only reason, we do not know, there are probably others, all mixed together. Is it the maximum that we know exactly what they do? I do not think so for this movie. Historical ruins scene in another telltale sign that they are not consistent in the end. Mathieu is not interested in studying the debris, Cedric is not. He is the only w / harmful hormone which focuses only on the physical side, which Matthew must have. <br /> <br /> Finally the end is really optimistic and sweet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One word. It's very soft. When I heard the dialog and then the bar or the outdoor crowd switched the scene when I had crank up the volume, it turned very loud. Other subtitles can not be closed; They stay on the screen. Most foreign movie DVDs are not released by a major studio, unfortunately this way.
