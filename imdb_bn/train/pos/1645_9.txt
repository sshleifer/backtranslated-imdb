Most of these Westerns are done in a different way than others. The reality here is the key. Conchata Farrell comes to work for Wyoming leaked on her ranch. This makes America the most interesting for any kind of how it is presented. I liked to see it on the big screen instead of the tape, but a look to see what life was like in the real west. Cinematography is excellent. Solid 9. Tornad and Farrell excel this movie.
