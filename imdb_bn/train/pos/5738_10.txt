I just bought and saw this movie's DVD. DVD transfer last year, since 2001. This 1988 picture is really a great little film. Focused by most people. I saw it in the theater in 1988 and since it has never liked it. I like Pittsburgh's first shot (not Baltimore, another user commented). Pittsburgh looks like the most beautiful cities in the world! And I must say, Nicky's trash pirate tour with a beautiful, interesting one! Tom Hulce, everyone else, gives a wonderful, amazing performance. DVD is an extra transfer, no extra, but a widescreen layout. I recommend it to those who love the movie
