It's just fun, watch it !!! <br /> <br /> They want 10 lines there: This is a fool of 50s / 70s Bayreoff films. Many satirical, some political. It seems like a primary clouse movie (probably due to Alan Arkin), but with a low slipping stick. If you like nude gun movies, you will also like it (again less snapstick in it). <br /> <br /> In reality, humor is the light sexual stimulation (essential in a teen comedy), from truly mad social-political satire. Moon High School transformation in the 50's to 70's is really interesting. The sequence with the President of the changed photo is different! Not just bright but still delightful. 50 cold war warts and tons (hijriakal) cracks starting from the end of the 70's have cracks. <br /> <br /> However, if you get the chance to see the movie!
