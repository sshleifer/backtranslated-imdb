Any reward can show all people please. Clearly, if you do not win your favorite movie then you will say that the show was not very good. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " And he was never present - though he won many awards. <br /> <br /> While the 74th Academy Awards were held, the World Trade Center collapsed in New York, but the country has lost its life.
