I have seen this as a child at the end of the eighteenth century and of course, the galaxy express is a film that takes long for your imagination. If you do not understand the Anim's appeal, then discovering this movie can be a gold ticket in your Okatun City. <br /> <br /> This story is fine and poetic like a blade runner of Ridley Scott. Cell animation, somewhat traditional, is a vivid style that portrays Lizzy Matsumoto's brilliant talent for exploring explosive character design and visual stories. <br /> <br /> This is one of the unique children's films like Star Wars, The Dark Crystal and its like. The Wizard of Oz, which completely surpasses the 'Family Entertainment' status, and it stands as the classic of the film in its own design. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
