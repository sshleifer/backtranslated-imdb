<br /> <br /> <br /> David Matt's directional debut in the House of the Games playwright and it is an effective and sometimes surprising psychological thriller. It makes Lindsay Craws big like the best-selling psychologist Margaret Ford, who faces a gambler who drives a patient for suicide thought. In this way, he gave up some of his general life's safety and comfort and went to the House of Games for the following city tour. <br /> <br /> Gambling Michael (played by Joe Montague) is a bit sharp and tempered. He proposed a deal to Cross's character, if he is willing to sit with him in a game, a big game in the back room, he will cancel the patients' debts. Card game sees and is known to be familiar with the work of psychological and gambling soon (others gain faith) and seems to be starting an interesting relationship. The house of games are striking and are considered a constant scene for a movie fan, which is a constant guess, whether it is a psychologist or a well-known man in the legendary David Mate. <Br /> <br /> The direction of the game of the house is dust and mostly flat and irrelevant, but it is a story that is not central to the whole proceeding, in every David Mamate film. Thanks to the superb performance of these two spots (decorating and confusing) in the House of Games, but thanks mainly to the case of Mumt's work, this is a dialog that gripes you and gradually draws you to the film. . Nobody at the House of Games said that their meaning and conversation became war-fighting and sound fighting. Each of the bluffs and double bluffs, which is memorable of natural orders in a poker game. It can have great impact on the right moment for creating an ongoing theme and huge momentum throughout the movie. The House of Games can also be seen as a category of 'Class-War' category. Lindsay, suddenly, our middle-class, well-educated psychologist and Joe Montgona America's working class are completely opposite of earning by 'honest' crime. <br /> <br /> The movie seduces spectators like Montevideo, and the end result is an extremely satisfying part of American cinema. And the final character of the film must be seen by everyone and it is a bit obvious to watch. This is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 9/10
