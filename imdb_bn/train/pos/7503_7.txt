The film was just fine, quite entertaining. The cast was pretty good, and my second comment would be mentioned earlier - Glenn Quinn was outstanding and he was just enough to see this movie alone. He is selfish "evil" friend and the band brilliantly played manager! <br /> <br /> There are many songs performed by "magnificent interval" in this film, but this does not really come as a surprise considering the film is producing a VH1. However, if no one likes soft rock / pop music then those scenes may flash more. <br /> <br /> The band's plot trying to create it at the top of the LA, but the many obstacles on the way being defeated are very original, but quite interesting, some wonderful plot is active here and there.
