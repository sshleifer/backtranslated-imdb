I attended Camp Chesippi. It is located on the banks of the Chesapeake of North East River, MD. It was the same summer camp with the cabin. It was founded by Coatesville, PA YMCA. I started as a young camper and later became a junior, senior councilor and later, the waterfront director. If the camp continued, I could have done anything in my power to become a camp director. Yes, the YMCA decided to stop the camp and sell it to MD states. After several years I visited the eastern camp in the boat and was frustrated by the neglect of the MD state and the natural disaster of Mother Nature. The 350 acre site has provided many services with all the benefits of communicating with dance sacrifices. Curtis Ford, a black man and his family were residents of the property and caretaker. Mr. Curtis was my friend and mentor. I figured every statue of her Even he could not swim, he was a waterman. I asked him, where the fish are biting, he will get the spot, and I have a force. At the end of the summer there was a family camp. These memories will be with me forever.
