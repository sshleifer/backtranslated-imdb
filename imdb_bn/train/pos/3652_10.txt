I started to repeat a movie of this TV on Sunday afternoon, thinking it was just another mobile phone crash. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> "Pandora's Clock" is an intelligent political thriller that is much more than the quality of most TV movies. It has easily been her debut on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Best acting actor including Richard Dean Anderson, Edward Herman, Robert Gilmour, and Robert Logia. Duffen Zunega has become his best performer as an expert expert working for the CIA, and Frasier's Jane Lewis is also very good. <br /> <br /> The conversation is well written and the story is compounded throughout. In fact, the final hour is filled with a plot twist and suspension that you can not leave your seat for one second. If you have the opportunity to watch this movie then invest the time - about four hours. You will be rewarded rewarded!
