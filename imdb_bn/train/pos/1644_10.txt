I saw the next half of this movie about a year ago and finally it was very happy to find it on DVD. Recently, I saw several series on PBS, such as queuing, etc. None of them came near to tell stories like this story. Based on the true reality, it is a panchayat, embarrassed, happy, tragic and illuminated, a film that should be shown to students or anyone interested in life in the first borders. Adding a fine completed script to Rip Torna and Concerto Ferrell. The opening credits say that it was done through funds funded through the National Endowment for Humanities. If this product is tax type, I would be happy to see more. I highly recommend this and if you've seen it and enjoyed the movie, then encourage you to tell a friend.
