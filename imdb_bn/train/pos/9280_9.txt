Women in Iran are officially banned from men's sports events. In June 2005, there was an important game against Bahrain at the Azadi Stadium for qualifying for the World Cup of Iran's national football team. A group of Iranian girls and football fans like boys were arrested and tried to enter the stadium without being arrested. <br /> <br /> Soccer (and flamengo party), beach and movie is my greatest feeling; So I liked this little gem for a group of girls and their passion for football. Jaffar Panahi, director of "The White Balloon", "The Mirror" and "The Circle", defeated Iran on the day that defeated Bahrain and qualified for the World Cup in Germany. The dramatic and fun adventure of these Iranian girls is one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. Not my vote. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
