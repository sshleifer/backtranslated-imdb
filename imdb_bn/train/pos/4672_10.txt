I saw the shadow of the brother at the Tribeca Film Festival and liked it! Jude Hirish and Scott Cohen are great fathers and sons. This film follows Scott Cohen from his parole in Brooklyn in Alaskar. He saw there because his brother was dead, and he gradually started to repair his relation with his brother's wife and child gradually and his father, who did not forgive him for the family's black sheep. This story deepens our heart and mind and enables you to understand the complexity of their life. Also, woodwork and imagery of Brooklyn backdrop sets the tone of this rich and revealing family portrait.
