Matt Spiriolos (Toby Malone) family knew that he was a talented footballer and he was happy when he secured an audition to join a big club. They hope that when he comes to town his cousin will take care of him. <br /> <br /> But the cats are like Chowk and Ponir: a stupid farm boy, the other is busy in the streets. Up with drug dealers and gangsters. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Multiple ways <br /> <br /> Most likely, Toby Malone, known for his work on the theater, has a pretty performance as a child teenager. There are signs of low budget, but with many other low-budget films, there is more fun, apparently more spontaneity and more elegance in Hollywood than blockbuster.
