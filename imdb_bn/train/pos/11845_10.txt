I really dislike both of the Shake film. (I did not like them both because they have both "PG" and the words in them, so I dislike them.) <br /> <br /> But when it comes to "soul: Stem of Simron", which I just barely missed last month For the first time I saw, I became a fan of animated films other than Pixar. *** Spoilers ahead *** "Soul: Simron Stallion", a horse was born swollen and finally became his listening leader. One night, he saw a strange light in the distance, and he set it off towards it. This event eventually leads to its capture, and much more. Throughout the movie, we hear a description. It is not through the thoughts of the spirits, even though the horses speak. What makes this movie so goo They (filmmakers) reassured the real horses to create horses; None of these words were made by humans. <br /> <br /> Spirit rain, beautiful beautiful jungle, and Little Creek, a native American, who owns rain. After Little Creek released the soul and the rain, they went home. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Brian Adams, but I want to buy soundtrack in the near future. <br /> <br /> See this image, and you will not regret it. My Score: 10/10
