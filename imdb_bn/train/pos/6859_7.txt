Kate Miller (Angelina Dickinson) is her marriage problem and otherwise - psychologist is enough to see. When his incompleteness puts him in trouble, it is linked to List Black (Nancy Allen), who is involved in the investigation of the identity of a psycho killer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Historically important. This is an example of the earlier styles of contemporary thriller, which has all the extensions in this writing, through Hide and Seek (2005). It is impossible that director Brian de Palma is trying to dig into Hitco. For example, de Palma literally shows some parts of Vertigo (1958) for the famous Dresden to the notorious museum scene. Along with the fountain shot of Kill, it is similar to Sik√≥ (1960) in the way of her villain and death. De Palma Hetcock's favorite songwriter Bernard Herman has also included a prominent score with repetitive design in style. The duplication does not end there. <br /> <br /> De Palma guides the attitude of dress, structure, and lid with the help of dress, its effect, or perhaps its effect by the loser or skill. The flow that has been dominant. Maybe, due to this effect, partly due to this effect, it is deeply flawed at the time of dressed to toil. Countless subsequent directors adopted De Palma like Hitakoos and improved almost every element, and after 25 years of precious thrillers, it was seen that most of the costumes for the dress were mostly seen, structurally incapable and unplanned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One aspect of this picture which was unfortunately not improved is the murder sex and nudity scene dresses. Both Dickinson and Allen use our full frontal nudity (from the very decorative angle of Allen), and Dickinson's breasts' linking shot, firmly masturbating and sex scenes usually found in contemporary films. Several scenes near the soft-core porn system. I have no fan of discretion - quite the opposite. My culture's myths towards myths, boredom, sex and nudity are annoying. So from my point of view, it is unfortunate that the pressure on the dress on the meat and his delight is one of the few aspects that others do not follow strongly or prune the film. Perhaps it was preferred, but due to the cultural control of conservative stuff shirts, they were not allowed to follow. <br /> <br /> The direction of De Polama cinematography and the staging of some scenes is good enough to do anything in the same style than de Palma. He has an odd, characteristic approach to close ups, and he has the likes of interesting corn, tracking overhang across remote cutaways such as Overhead Opinion and James Whale-like set. Eventually after the director was flashed, but it is hard to say that they are good. For the skill of filmmaking, at least, the museum scene has the ability to create a very delicate tension on the reduced document and the spectacularly intense concentration of the metropolitan Museum of Art, followed by Kate, is remarkable at one glance or two views. <Br /> <br /> On the other hand, from a point of view of the story, and especially if one hopes to see a thriller, the museum may seem to be very slow and stupid by passing through the scene and slightly beyond. Due to the removal of it from the primary concern of the film's original and its primary concern (with the cultural aspects of the film), the opening of the film does not seem to be very well-organized and it seems like Russia. Some of the improvements happen when the first killings happen, but due to the end effect of the movie, most of the improvements now seem a little bit clutched and occasionally a hockey. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> At last the dress is likely to hold on to your interest, but due to the information in the picture, not completely old. At this point the film is primarily a historical resort, and for example - it is not one of the best illustrative images of the broker - even the best.
