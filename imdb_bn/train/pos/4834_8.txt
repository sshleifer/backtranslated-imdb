This memorable movie is a treasure for anyone who wants to get a glimpse of the Soviet scene of modern Russian history. In the middle of the ancient century, the story of black and white colored white colored sepia (1900) began, and the story was completed in modern times (ie 1960s). <Br. <br /> The story holds a boy in a remote Siberian village, which is marked by the arrival and arrest of anarchy in the Cajestist era. After the revolution, he joined Bolshevik and brought Soviet Communism to his village. His son, by the local beauty, fought with the Germans during World War II. When he returned to the village, the oil industry was stopped and some of us were treated with Soviet economic ideology. <br /> <br /> This movie is long and slow, but it is very reasonable and very good. It is seen in three parts.
