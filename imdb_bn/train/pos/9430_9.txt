I am a member of a Canoning Club and I can tell you the truth that the experience of payment is parallel with peace and peace. When we keep our boat in the boat, then Banji leaves behind the conscious mind. This movie is ruthless because it has a philosophical form of human position on nature and the position of people in the nature of technology. We see it in bow fishing. We see it at home made tent. The misconduct of the people of the city and the people of the countryside have the feeling of superiority to "cracker". The banker's "bad tooth" in Atlanta (Ned's) is meant to keep him on the same level with a toothbrush. Finally, the "civilized" supersed suppositives about life and death struggle "law" supersed. This canoes end soon for the trip viewer, but it is not enough early for letters.
