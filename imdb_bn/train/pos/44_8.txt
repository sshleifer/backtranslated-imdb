When I talked about this movie, I thought it would be another dog flick. I was roasted. This movie sends a strong message about the judgment of others. I was deeply moved. Everyone I face, I've recommended this movie. No one is saying bad things back. Busy, this photo also did a great job with its role. I do not know much about his acting career but wow, he was dragging it to the end. <br /> <br /> At the beginning it was a little slow. But after going to hospital ... oh, the movie comes up again. I do not know why this movie is not spoken in the movie world. I would like to get rid of this movie again and get more advertising ... because it sends a strong message in just one and a half years.
