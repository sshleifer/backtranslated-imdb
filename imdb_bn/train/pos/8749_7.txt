I like the movie, but everyone says that some bits that were not well enough. I personally felt that the girls were very awful before they went to jail; Sure, they were supposed to be innocent American girls but still ... I felt that they felt the lack of bonds that are best friends. For example, in Montage, where they are seeing eyesight, they were looking at each other for photographs that are very strange. <br /> <br /> Then, some part of which was very confused. I think it did not understand the character of dance very much, but I can see that it can be confusing. Also, does the camera think of Manat as a very attractive expression after placing a bag on their taxi trunk? I thought it was something to offer, but it turned out nothing turned out. <br /> <br /> Without that, the movie was great. When Claire Nannes blamed me, I shouted; She is a great actress. Also, I would like to see that the malicious Thai prisoner kicked his ass. Talk about the lack of closing ...
