After finally watching South of Washing Disney's South of the South of MySpace, I decided to watch Ralph Bakhshir's reaction to the film-Canskin - in Afro Video which I've linked to Google Video. During the live action sequence, the preacher (Charles Gordon), his friend Sampson (Barry White) with him as a Pope (Scammen Crohthers) and Randy (Phillip Thomas), before adding Michael to his middle name professionally several years ago) . During their attempts, Pappy Randy tells a story about Brother Rabitz (Voice of Thomas), Brother Bear (White), and the episode of Fox (Gordon) and Harlem in their event. As expected, these animations and live-action mixes, which provide a unique perspective from the writer / director who blames some people. Another fascinating animated character is Miss America, which is a big one - as all the giant-white white women wear skin-tight red, white and blue stars and stripes, who hold a small black man and shot him dead. Funny for me that was the most sexually abused way! There are so many scenes scattered throughout the picture, among which there is a big smile from me about another of the Beer's front physiological subject. A segment of a woman "joke" seems to be a tribute to her child, as well as a tribute to comic strip artist George Herriman that he had left him with his friend. I was also impressed by the announcement of Grover Washington Junior edition as "As No Sunshine" as part of listening. The most compelling part of the film was seen in Scatman's silhouette with his head, while watching the song's discipline and a song scatting, which he used to mimic the n-word. When I saw a VHS cover of this movie, what it looked like Warner Circle with the slogan, in his unhappy mode, in front of his brother Rabit, "This film will condemn everyone". Anybody who is meant for children in cartoons is enough warning That said, I definitely recommend Coonskin for fans of Bakshi and every form of animation.
