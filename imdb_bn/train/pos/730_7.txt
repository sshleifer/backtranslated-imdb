I love this movie, remembering that this film was a very good job where Reef Randel (played by PJ Souls) is lying in his bed in a smoking pot, and then he begins to imagine that Ramon sings in his house "I want you around" ... very nice things. <br /> <br /> It was fun, energetic, playful and cool. Yes I will admit that the end is towards the top and the way towards the remote ... but it does not matter because it's fun because it's a very funny movie. It's Sex, Pot and Rock N Rokel forever <br /> <br /> I read that the cheap trick band was originally a star at it ... but I do not know whether it is true or not
