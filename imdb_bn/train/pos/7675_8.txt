After watching the movie last night, I was left in the face of frustration with the organizations to deal with the problem of photo. The scale of prostitution seems so big that it is difficult to see how it can be overcome without Cambodia's major official changes. <br /> <br /> <br /> However, it is a great movie with an uncomfortable central relationship, it is a very compelling movie and I can even say it's enjoyable. This movie was well edited for the running time and Thu Gueen's performance was excellent. I think Ron Livingston played a very difficult role. <br /> <br /> Patrick thinks he had to help Holly to get a little more insight, but perhaps it would explain the character of Chris Pen simple. I will not explain it here - check out the movie. <br /> <br /> This is a good, thought-provoking movie, which is clearly with good intentions. I hope that it will be widely available to reach a decent size audience and get more support for the K-11 project.
