I'm not all picky about horror movies, and I'm most interested in seeing any of them. This does not mean that many of them are willing to meet again, or I will not criticize them. This movie is vague, and is very well done. Actually, I think this movie will create excellent double bills with 9 seconds. <br /> <br /> I should specify before my comment that I saw it alone. Before I went to bed, I started to see it and about 15 minutes ago I realized that it was very effective, so I saved the rest for the morning. Even while viewing it in broad daylight, it was still unclear. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The terms with this death. Remind me of this death - it's one of the rare movies that does not move away from the child's death. This is more important, because it sets both voices, as well as many of the film's conveyances. <br /> <br /> The couple is not doing well. The wife has kept herself away from the relationship, and the husband is doing what she can do to try to bring her back. Although some comments complain about their performance - one mentions that they act like a father and a girl like husband and wife, and it is legitimate. She is trying to give her more instructions. This is a role that people sometimes take. <br /> <br /> There are many different types of fears in the film, and mostly nonviolent, though in many ways it is awesome. For most films, the story itself feels very easy, and at the end, an odd turn. While traveling, it is certainly not what you expect from anything that is going on. <br /> <br /> Moody, atmospheric, and something very good seems to be shot in the video.
