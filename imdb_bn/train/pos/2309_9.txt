It was life changing, it was really !!! An exciting experience to see the man in the moon. The performance was excellent, the story line was great and it was a perfect start for Reese Witherspoon's career. I do not see how anyone can love this movie. Of course, this is not the best movie, although it was close to it, but it was very fun to watch, and I also felt a laugh at a joke and a lot less smile. Of course, something was crying at the heart of your heart, but this movie was enlightened, and it would brighten your day, though you will now get a bit depressed from each story. I do not believe this movie has won at least one prize and I can not believe it has seen so little people on this site. If you are not for this, then touch this movie.
