Last summer I saw Bourne Ultimatum, and, wow! I saw the first two films and I liked them, but ultimatum, I love. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon is playing Jason Bern, who has hurt the CIA agent. As I said before, I started from the beginning of the movie, a plot hole, slowly scenes, everything was well-liked and it was well-fitted with other movies, but in all senses it was very good. <br /> <br /> I have seen all the girls, car chases, actors and influences in one action movie all summer (surprisingly because of Spider-Man 3, piratets etc) but I'm just working in this movie, just kill and run Jason Is not it. He has a soul and the audience feels for him, so the drama is included. But that does not reduce it. <br /> <br /> That "last three" came out last summer, it was the best.
