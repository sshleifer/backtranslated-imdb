One of my favorite movies is one. It has everything - Soundtrack Rocking, courtesy of Eddie Clark, former motorhead, action load, laughter load, complete ridiculous plot and most surprising characters as '80 characters. Eddie is an excellent man who wants to be alone separately, Leslie (as he gets wet), Nook (Rock Burned Out), Eddie's Mother (Merciful), Roger (Guy) and Ozzy as Preacher (Of course he exists in America ?). Then there are boys (rich, dirty and fools) and girls (empty, vain and stupid). What can you ask <br /> <br /> All right, Sammy Kara, rock star, 80's is a mix of badas rocker that you can think of. What about that rocket firefight guitar? Then the scene where Sammy pulled the old lady to the TV screen and pushed her. And what does Roger do? Why, a good geek would just hoover up like her. My favorite scene where Team Heinei Sammy gets a long-term award through the wet fingers of the plug-magic! <br /> <br /> If you were in Silita in the 80's or just like funny movies, then check out this one. It is available in DVD and very cheap so (techniques or) treat yourself.
