I'm not a writer or a critic ... I'm just a student who watched this movie a few minutes ago ... and I would like to thank those who work for making this movie! It's not the best .... but it touched my heart ... why ??? I want to understand myself ... it's easy and accessible. It's a movie that feels good after feeling sad after you've lost it! It's our love and care that we have, but we sometimes miss it because of the elements .... See our time but we miss it. ... why a fu * k can we do it ??? We need to live like dead ... take care of every second and remember: if we do well - good things come back to us! . And it has a special taste in New York ... I love this city and the world where we live !!!! Thank you very much for the movie and sorry for my mistake (English my second language) ...
