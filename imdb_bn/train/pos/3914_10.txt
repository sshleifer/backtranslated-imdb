Personally, I think that this film was very professionally done, I love dancing and acting. The plot is also secret and mysterious. The film itself is very emotional, and most of what I like about it makes you feel after it. Antonio Godas fully played his role, and I must say that this is one of my favorite films and a wonderful director of solar.
