I'm getting old, I am in the middle of seeing this 40-year-old flick, and am surprised how my grandchildren will look at it for 40 years now, it's an old word, but they do not make MK this way. .. It's just the story, its music, played both young and old .. This cast, think, was born to play their role, young oliver, old Fagin .. many all of them mention the role of judge Oliver stands already, I Over the years I've seen other roles. Lose Dude, Ron Moody, Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, Phagin, this movie won only 5 Oscars, but got a few Golden Globe Awards ... If you want to watch this movie, do yourself good, if not all children, then see this beautiful composition.
