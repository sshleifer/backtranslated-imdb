First off, it seems to be a brighter and thought provocative film than many other critics think it is compared to. Anyone with the first review knows something apparently about something horrible movie saying, apparently another way around. If someone looked back after the film, it was not really credible, it was a low budget ipak. But in reality its aim was to show viewers with cruel shock quality (and all their visuals were less attentive to the actual VHS versions). <br /> <br /> I gave it a high score because it reached its goal and even though it was not frightening (in non-shock sense) it makes me a little sick and completely paranoid / frustrating (I'm 'for almost a week Do not trust anyone because I did not want to wake up and torture)
