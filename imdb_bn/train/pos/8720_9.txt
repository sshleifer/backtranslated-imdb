For all those looking at the vulnerability and vulnerability of the last studio of Disney Studios, there has been something that can heal your wound ... Once and above all, a bug's life shows that a synthetic image manages a better scenario by imitating the old- "Drawings" such as Disneys (Lion King, Pokhantas and all the latest productions where you apologize to the left Birr witch background and see what the atmosphere is gone forever). <br /> <br /> A bug's life (1001 petus for my fellow French cinemas!) succeeded in avoiding all the flaws that awaken you in the middle of the movie and say "Hey, this thing is computer!". A weak part, its effectiveness in the background and the general look of sets, a wonderful 3D bird (near the simulation of reality) ... and it's a great effort to just mention the technical aspects. <Br /> <br /> The scene, my friends, the real backbone of a motion picture, has some thickness! Curiosity, and perhaps thanks to Lasseter's team, there is virtually no musical sequence in the life of a bug. Which means that the story is long and rich and rich enough to free yourself from this 3 or 4 minutes, which some children would appreciate but mostly dislike (like me like parents or anime fans). This movie reminds me of an old film featuring Steve Martin and Chevy Chase: 3 Amigos; It was originally the same background story (a whole Mexican village living in fear of some bad people hired gunmen (who could eventually become actors) to protect them, etc. ...). Easy, but effective, and terrible ants are transformed into a colony in front of the rage of terrible insects. <br /> <br /> From microcosmos, many movies talk about insects, their lives, fears and hopes, but I think that the life of a bug is the most fun and best directed. The humanitarian process has been well-received ... and the whole audience was inspired by Ficci (the shield of the ascendant in France). <br /> <br /> Thank you very much for the lascier team for the last 30 seconds. .. At the same time to see the whole theater in a weird and humorous, hilarious situation, bugs / actors forgot their lines or hit the camera ... <br /> <br /> And finally, especially for those who saw the French version , Other congratulations go to the duining actors who have done a fantastic syntax in this film. A bug's life is a great part of entertainment, and I think it will soon be part of the collection of my videos (very privileged movies have been given a privilege and this is not a problem with the storage room :) Go and see it, that's an order.
