This movie has changed it all for me ... I have heard of breakdesigning and hip hop, but never seen it professionally (I was a child at the age of 11 when I was in Holland!) When I saw this movie, everything changed. I have been actively involved in hip-hop movement in our city, started breakingdancing and writing songs. <br /> <br /> Today, I consider this photo as a personal choice. Of course, the importance of filming and "cinematographic" may not be significant. But if the wide shot is painted badly or someone sees someone hanging on top, then who care? It's personally what you count it ...
