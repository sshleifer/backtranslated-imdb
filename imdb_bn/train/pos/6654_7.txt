This song took the new angle of Gandhi's life, which is beautiful and it shows how he was a man. Her relationship with Harilal was an issue that Gandhi was often annoyed because of her failing father as a father in her spiritual life. <br /> <br /> My big key is that I thought it was surprisingly unusual in the Gandhi movie. It could have played well by acting in Gandhi's role. Gandhi's statement seems somewhat shocked and seems to have been deliberately portrayed in negative light in some parts of the movie. <br /> <br /> This film is not actually round, but only narrowly relating to father and son. The rest is separated and used to show only the time frame and general settings of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you remember that this is not a complete picture but overall good movies.
