I can not really condemn the movie because it works. It has enough silent elements to consider a silent film, but I think it is only in the department. <br /> <br /> There is no sinner in this piece, and silent elements fail there. Of course, this disease can be considered terrible, but it's a very difficult time for me. The film indicates boldly: Blackie can trace people, New Orleans Police is just willing to arrest a reporter, hanging the spectators on this film to all the people ... but they are only <br/> <br /> to ask questions about Reed's motivation There is no endeavor, such as one with Marlow or Spade, or there is no attempt to bring Blackie to the person, which makes him more hateful Bay human trafficking is actually played. <br /> <br /> The lack of depth fails until the end of this film. <br /> <br /> The story is good, good acting, writing and direction worked well ... but there is nothing to create this movie which you have to go back over again. Once valuable to visit, if you do not think it a few years ago, and then putting away.
