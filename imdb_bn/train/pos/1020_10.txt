"Start SG-1" follows the intergalactic exploration of a group called SG-1 with a device named Sturgate and is waiting for all the wonders that are waiting on the other side of the wormhole. <br /> <br /> This is the first few seasons to see this series sporadically, I did not know how good this series would be, finally I saw an episode after 10 years. The series was great on my old impression, but my impression was far from the truth. "Staggett SG-1" is more than just a common science-fiber series, it's the best, interesting, long-running, exciting sci-fi maker. And why? Because it runs on an amazing premises. <br /> <br /> This series value was far more than the film and I think it is a very good example, which, as a medium, with a suitable fit, can provide anything that does not work in the film's time limitations. Observe the progress of the familiarity, character, and time with the familiarity of a long running series, adding stability to excitement and simply suspending unbelief, and it's all horrible writing and many creations by many crew. Show <br /> <br /> "Staggett SG-1" had a great courageous dedication program throughout 10 years, but the plot was never afraid of the challenge of movement and it gave way to a different duration of the show. <br /> <br /> - The first few seasons, probably 4th / 5th, gave a lot of attention to the planets and various situations, if they are not fairly unrelated to each other, always goond threatening impending. <br /> <br /> - There were increasingly more episodes to fight against Guevald from 5th to 7th, and to prevent attacks in the world. As a result of the search of planets this season, there was only one excuse for establishing SG-1 in place of cowherd / duplicate / ore conflict <br /> - Probably the most mixed one in the 8th session. There is a stream of its episodes, in which there are minor land issues, in which the sturger is rarely mentioned, but the last episode has some great transcript moments. <br /> <br /> - 9th and 10th travel together because they have the same new enemies and no Jack O'Neil. They are both good continuity, although the first few episodes of the 10th season are a little weak, because they seem a little more than the SG-1 and lose the human / jaffa war after the war in Ori. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < On the other hand, it has been created for such a big episode of ongoing conflict that the change in nature of the show has still worked and shows how wonderful and brave the author was. <br /> <br /> Even harder I believe the series is a high quality that puts a nicely rest, my feeling that it can go; The people involved were all great professionals and the series narrative offers lots of offers. The last season to return to the beginning of the series was very great and most welcome, but eventually the things were as they were. Finally, I've enjoyed everything, it's a little hard to find. The big picture, however, is one of the paintings by hundreds of people working by hundreds of years, the true credential of the beauty of the beauty and crew of the crew, those outstanding actors and characters we always remember as a collective named SG-1.
