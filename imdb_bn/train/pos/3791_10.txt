Our song is a great example of enthusiasts, making its aesthetic best movies. It's actually a real wonder of a movie; A sharp and insightful work in the industry that girls of three young inner cities (Crown Heights, Brooklyn) are increasing their lives in a particular summer time when the concerns of the adult's perspective to them make them difficult to live, change choices, which are likely to change each of them. Redefine it, as well as its How to stay in touch with each other in the coming years. <br /> <br /> Jim McCack's writing / direction is lovely and stale. There is no sad, unknowable feeling in this movie, and there is no solution here. What we see here, sometimes, the heart seems to be boring to be real. There is a naturalism - if you want to - a credibility, in our songs that cross the other giants including this song, American Graffiti and Kuolie Hi. <br /> <br /> Most of the credit goes to the soul of the movie, its original actor. The joint appearance of Melis Martinez (Maria), Kerry Washington (Linisa), and Anna Simpson (Jayselin) is nicely strong. It would be easy - and, of course, gradually copy - to be dismissed, as there are some apparently, performance as these three acting or indifferent. Indeed, their silent kisses, the normal feeling of dignity and their raw, sometimes abnormal intelligence, are all riveting, throughout the film. Teenagers' behavior to be completely "out of touch" or completely indifferent to the fact that these three young women can bring to the screen. Likewise, supporters cast, especially Marlin as the mother of Fort Lionsa, congratulated the work of three girls as well as the overall voice of the film. <br /> <br /> Our songs will not be missed - anyone of any age.
