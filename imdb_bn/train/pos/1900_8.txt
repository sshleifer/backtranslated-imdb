Murray's 1981 Arthur's most famous role was in the very short career, it's a fun, cheerful and alternate sensitive story that produces warm smiles, big stomachs, and you occasionally create tear in the right mentality. Moore received the Oscar nomination for Best Actor, Oscar Bach, a drunk playboy who "drives, plays tennis, loves women, but is closed on weekends and owns." While marrying a golden social girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Ecchenbery), Arthur inherited 750 million dollars, the dear daughter of a secret gangster. Arthur Linda Murraya (Liza Minerali) stole the queens waitress / struggling actress for her father's birthday when Sticky takes it. Moore has made the light up on the single fun performance screen in the last 50 years. Late Sir John Gilgood has won an Oscar Oscar for Arthur's acid -changed Butler and his best friend, Hobson, for his stupid celebration, which has more parental feeling due to the outward manifestation of Arthur's behavior. Barney Martin's other interesting contribution as the Leader's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father and Geraldine Fitzgerard as the lame granddaughter of Arthur. Steve Gordon, for the first time, directed the film with a public eye for the director's comedy, who sadly died year after year. Several years later there was a forgettable sequel, but this instant classic will not be missed.
