In spite of Rita Heyever's love, she found the film's final sequence and was able to appreciate some of the impressive "symbolic" aspects of the movie, the Shanghai Lady did a lot of work for me. I had a problem with most performance, scripts and overall structure. And a movie that most people talk to each other in different situations is quite a problem. Shanghai Lady has ended for very little "C" or 7. <br /> <br /> The Shanghai Lady is actually about the character of Osborne Wales Michael Veaha. O'Hara saw Elsa "Rosalie" Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in a car ride Central Park and hit on it. Later, he conserves him from a mugging and he takes a shine near him. She is an Irish sailor and California's defense attorney, her husband Arthur (Everett Sloane), who owns a yacht in Alice. Ohara, despite her initial reservation, is talking about the ohara to work for them - and it seems to the audience that Elsa just wants to have a relationship with someone and they do not want to be involved. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, Grysby asked her to enter into a very suspicious and dangerous scheme. Foolish, O'Hara agrees Naturally, this leads him to a lot of trouble, and finally, many mysteries are uncovered. <br /> <br /> Maybe the problems of my film are actually false, I'm not exactly right. Ososon is a huge fan of Wales, and here, he's made, writes, manages and feeds for most of the screen. In most parts of the Welsh work, I have not seen it yet, but I have been able to make his next films better, when he has achieved some more camps and performance skills. For example, I love F for Fake (Vérités et Mensonges, 1974) and I even like his performance like Casino Royale (1967), when he intends to do magic tricks in an intimidating answer table, but citizen Cain (1941) It did not do much for me even after 4 opportunities (almost a year ago, I had a low rating of 7 - like my current score for Shanghai Lady). <br /> <br /> He played for Wales and influenced me. He has a bit of a motormouth, a bit a bit, and a little monotone - he has to listen to the sound like reading. His performance reminds me of Moby Dick's Welles version (listed in the 1999 IMDB, but referred to as "finished"), it also appears in Oson Welles: The One Man Band (1995). Where he thinks he is just reading the camera and believes that he spontaneously, very dramatic. I'm not the one who does not often complain about pronunciation, but the way Wales affects its Irish pronunciation and encourages me too. <br /> <br /> For other performances, I can only say that I thought Hayworth did an excellent job. Of course he is gorgeous, which does not hurt. Here are plenty of eye candy. Like Wales, Sloane also influenced me and inspired me - I never bought her character, her handicap, and Anders is not only witch-hunted, but I do not think it would be wicked. Wells often shoots him closely and underscore almost always has some over-exaggerated, emotional expression on his sweaty face. <br /> <br /> The constitution, the lady from Shanghai is very uneven. The first 50 minutes or more is sticky and soap-operative, although it is communicated with a harmful substance in soap opera ministration. Once Grißby started his plan, sorted things out, and eventually we progressed to the end. But at that time, the Shanghai Lady has become a crime / mysterious film, it is too late, and it suddenly turns into a court drama, suddenly there is an exciting ending that almost does not come from anywhere, and it is too fast for its relative superiority. /> <br /> The end is even more dynamic, less dialogue is heavy, more diverse in settings, and external and sometimes fairly abstract. Welles manages the component combinations with a skillful skill. If the Shanghai Lady is a combination of crime / mystery elements and the last of the army, it can easily be at least 9. Final scenes are easily 10 seconds, since Wales is moved to Hitakovian suspense scene. Another mystery scene in the Chinese Opera House in a Chinese entertainment park in San Francisco. Minhaus uses climax cinematography which was experimental for her time. It integrates well with scripts, because it is a complex solution and allows many symbols to be fueled. <br /> <br /> The whole painting is interesting, even if it is not usually made for progress problems. Views block with wells skills. There are plenty of interesting attractions in San Francisco location from the Central Park to Acapulco. Wales effectively creates symbolic backdrop for their actions, from stressed height and acapulco intense drops on the streets of the Caribbean, from the well-made and silhouette of San Francisco Aquarium, etc. The romantic element, for which the aquarium acts as a backdrop, it is a kind of isolation across the film. But romance on the other hand never works like romance. <br /> <br /> Great Welsh fans will appreciate Shanghai's Ladies much more than me and of course it is a watch price for Rita Hayther's love. Shanghai Lady is not a terrible movie in my scene, but dangerous aspects of not being "transient" Proceed with caution.
