In the opening scenes of this movie, a man threw arrows at other people's bathrooms in his hotel room and burned all the lights. It must have been very hip for 1936, but there is no other way with the movie and Robin Hood could not see my face. However, Bate Davis (Daisy Appleby), "August's Wheels", '87 was very young and interesting and played his best role in Hollywood's long career. Daisy was never too sexy with teasing or her night gowns, and was called Swim Suit in her yacht with George Brent (Johnny Jones), "The Spiritual Searakos", 46. Daisy even ferries propose to marry Johnny and even got black eyes. Davis and Brent have created a great couple, one must be very rich and another poor reporter Off Stage, Davis and Brent had a truly warm love relationship, which was a clear reason to be present in this film. If you like Bate Davies and George Brent, it's a movie for you!
