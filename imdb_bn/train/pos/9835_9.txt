Off the block I am just a huge zombie fan so I do not lightly comment like the above. Secondly tell me that it is an Italian zombie movie and Phukchi only indicates its 15 minutes before handing over Bruno (Rats, Terror Night). These dead people have no donation. <br /> <br /> It's one of the easiest junky movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is amazingly awesome. Try two scientists trying to find just one plant ("Let's try to combine these two molecules"). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, weeping, crazy birds of birds! <br /> <br /> <br /> The feet of the feet are closed, cracked arms, cracks open in the stomach. <br /> <br /> Speed ​​fast, flying from one zombie attack to the next. <br /> <br /> then have the refrigerator head. Head of custody! One of the biggest moments in fear after being caught in the ashes, caught by the dead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Drink some companions and some beers and you will be for a fun night. <br /> <br /> I mentioned the freeze head?! ??
