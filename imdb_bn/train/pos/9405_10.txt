After a few years of WWII, Hollywood became like a stranger, England created a very great film industry. "The Man in the White Suit", inventor Sidney Stratton (Alake Guinness) created a lawsuit that never gets dirty. Unfortunately, this means that some other businesses can now go out of business! How can Sydney deal with this and maintain its dignity? It is an example of these great films that starred before being Alake Guinness's Po Ki Kenobi. It's a good look at the overall absurdity of the business world. If you plan to start a business, you can consider seeing this movie.
