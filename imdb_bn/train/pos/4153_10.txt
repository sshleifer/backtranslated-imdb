This was a fantastic episode. I saw a clip from it on YouTube, and I swear it should never be seen on TV, I'll glue it to see myself. I watched it with a friend of mine, be gay gay, and we both cried to the end. These two police, which I felt, were indeed a sincere written, heartwarming episode of forbidden love in the "lucky public" (in the words of Kopp). This is an episode making CDU a cool case among television's most compelling and most-loved works. I'm anxiously waiting for more episodes, and re-run "blue forever" because I'll always see it again.
