Polanski came back to the themes of unity and madness, which he discovered this tremendous effect of tenant on Renalson and Rosemary's Baby. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere is Polansky - dark, annoying, inaccessible - but there are some unknown about this movie and I'm not sure if it's deliberate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was disappointed in the example. <br /> <br /> The only thing that really gives the movie is acting down. Polanski is not a bad actor, but seems to chew on Tr√©lakhovsky's tough role. Among the helpful supporters, some of the cool, notably Melvin Douglas Landlord and Shelley Winterers are considered to be deputy directors, but others are weak and fantasy. It is also difficult to understand the fact that all of these supposedly Americans of Paris have an accent. <br /> <br /> Unexpectedly, there are some fine moments in the dark comedy of the film. Anyone who saw the unconditional vampire killer knows that Polanski is a good comedic actor. However, moments when it slips into a parody of itself dangerously. Trelkovsky's sudden (and somewhat undefined) detracts the 'transformation' may be a strong moment in his psycho-dramatic journey, which is likely to raise giggles compared to the recurrence. <br /> <br /> All, the mercenary is an enjoyable and interesting experience, if very little for its own good. Apparently cool moments and a consistently uncomfortable and predicted atmosphere is a boxer but this film, being very well, did not hit it successfully marked as successfully. <br /> <br /> day, 'OK' Polanski film is still better than most other 'good' Definitely do not expect to watch a clock, just fly away.
