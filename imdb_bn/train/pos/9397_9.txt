Uncommonly famous Westerners of 1940, such as "Sierra Madres's Treasure" (1948), "Red Rock West" conscience, greed and betrayal. Michael (Nicholas Cage) is a low and out, but honest, young man in Texas who goes west to search for work and money. He found both, but he was not the expected way. <br /> <br /> The screen of the film contains plenty of surprises and plot twists. Add excellent cinematography, adritt film editing, and Moody Western music tension and suspense. The big sky offers a wonderful setting in the wide range of countries. And from acting to the best, Dennis Hooper and J. T. With great performance from Walsh The specially recorded Country / West song of Daiyit Yakam provides the film with firm end. <br /> <br /> Neo-silent as the Lead properly, "Red Rock West" hit me as something else. The plot is full of amazing coincidences and impossible times, so much so that it can be regarded as a scrapplease error. Generally, I agree. In this case, however, when Moody meets the atmosphere and the small town of Red Rock seems to be almost empty of normal daily life, coincidences and unlikely time suggests a story that "noirish" beyond, ... surreal Often fate deliberately interferes with unfavorable incidents, so that Michael is forced to embrace himself. From this perspective, coincidences are not at all error in scripts. They must be faced with their own giants, which is a plot plot of a young man's night story ... Incredible as another character. <br /> <br /> Here we need Rod Sirling, PostScript, always explicitly spoken voices in the interpretation, that ... a young man, searching for himself, is trapped somewhere in a thousand miles smaller, almost solitary town. It's a triplelight zone for its final layover.
