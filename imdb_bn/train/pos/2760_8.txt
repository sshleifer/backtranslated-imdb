All of us influence our thoughts, correcting our ways, a small part of that person spreads over to us. "The eighth day" brings this theme (compare "Rainmaker"). In the film, Harry (Daniel Outeuil) met with Downs Syndrome's child Georges (Pascal Duchen), running an expert specialist in the Department of Psychology. These actors played both actors to give this film its main strength. The opening sequence is excellent where George describes his theories about the creation of the world and in the last scene we discover that God created what was on the eighth day. Harry has a few moments in a very frustrating story. For example, those who are completely uninhibited claiming a pair of expensive costume shoes and do not have enough money. This is a scene where you smile through your tears. I like the scene where the Downs Syndrome group enters a bus and escapes from the Art Gallery and the Paradees fun park gate-crash. The most ridiculous of all the shame is the scene where a horse passes on Harry and Georges Highway and looking back, Georges gives the driver a rude salute. But there are also some scenic scenes, especially with the impressive use of hand tools - feeling the sun, the wind and the rain in hand, hand reaching hands, reaching hands and blurring in love and friendship. This is a true movie that touches the heart. Georges suddenly proposed to Nathalie, where Georges cut Harry's head in his arms, where Georges calls his beloved mother, where Georges teaches Harry to laugh. I think there is a deep message in the film - beautiful appearance of grass (you know how to weep it?), Growing up on the trees, birds, small insects - miracles of all nature. If we go back, like Harry and George, they can enjoy us and hear ... a beautiful movie.
