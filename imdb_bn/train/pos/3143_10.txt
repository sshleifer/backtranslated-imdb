If a show is eligible for 10 in the last ten years, then this rare jewel. It can escape back at a time when it was easier and more fun. Filled with heart and smile, this show laughs you through the difference of three decades. The furniture was ugly, the clothes were colored, even the medicines were tolerable. The hair was a bird, the music was by roller-skate, and in the words of Merle Haggard, "a joint was a bad place". Take a trip to the greatest time in American history. Love for the character falls and the people in the small town feel good feeling where people are inferior to each other. This classic "flower house" is as televised as many. Do not miss it, and always remember "shake your pebbles !!!"
