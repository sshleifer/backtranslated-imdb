Of course, I do not know anything about baseball, even I am not a sports fan, but it did not prevent me from enjoying the last film of Férélie brothers, Fever Pitch, a charmingly overwhelming romantic comedy. The film is not really about baseball; Rather, it is really the relationship, and often the emotional isolation that can happen. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Falane ?? Date giving her the best performance ?? Ben is a big, a dorky, light nerdy school teacher. Ben is a man-boy who, unfortunately, has not really grown up, and he encourages almost a playful habit of the Red Sox Baseball team. Dedicates his life to Ben Sax, and is doing everything to make pilgrim pilgrimage for spring training so that he can decorate each square inch team in his apartment. <br /> <br /> One day, while going to Ben for a field trips to his office, while taking his honor Geometry class, Lindsey (an amazing drew Barrymore) met. Lindsey is a corporate, career-oriented girl girl, but she has a kind of authority that finds out completely respectable. She is initially hesitant to ask her that she is coming out of her "class" and Lindsay does not immediately see a potential partner of Ben. <br /> <br /> Lindsey is hit with a serious case of toxic food while crushing their first date ?? And his resonant writing gives us the first formula that we see in the fareer brother brothers. Instead of accepting Lindsay - urgent - request for rebuilding, Ben Nurse, Growing, and astrologer almost stick to play. So by holding down Ben Toilet and dog teeth teeth, his love interest was passed with a bucket next to his bed. <br /> <br /> When Lindsay wakes up in the morning and falls asleep on her bedroom, she starts to think of the long, effective process of destroying the state of anxiety and ambition, as her standard. Soon they are falling in love, Lindsey blithely took Ben's fanatical devotion to his play. <br /> <br /> His favorite uncle, the successor of his favorite favorite season tickets got organized around the season ?? She does not miss a game. But their relationship, which has progressed without quarrels throughout the winter, creates a quarrel at the beginning of the season. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Ben Halfly meets Lindsey To begin to have problems in modulating her interest. Can Lindsay agree to her unreasonable devotion to the summer boys to work in their relationship? Can he really play with Ben's football? Can a die-hard and desperate red Sox fan find true love after all? Of course, Lindsay and Ben's opinion-attendant friends come up with a colorful consortium. Lindsey's harsh friend, skinny, rich and blond Robin (KaDee Strautland), stressed that if he was alone 30 years old, then something could happen with the guy. However, the thick, curly-haired Sarah (Marissa Jaret Winokur) and Molly (Law Sky) provide Ben's more optimistic and positive outlook. <br /> <br /> Ben's brutality can be effectively applied to a passionate sports fan, when Lindsay disappointment can be a representative of a moving mobile carrier driven woman. As Fallon Ben is a quintessential, showing the reality of a bigger screen, beyond unreasonable challenge to ban Ben from disrespect. Barrymore, at the same time, is also equally charming as Workshop Lindsey, especially he struggles to accept Ben for those without losing sight of his own needs. <br /> <br /> The fever pitches really work, and there are plenty of inspired comedic moments, the film also mentions the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to discuss this harmful region. <br /> <br /> Most of the movies which were portrayed in Boston's Fenway Park, as well as the ambiance of the game added a delicate sense of authenticity, although what transpired with the team is fully appreciated, although perhaps the baseball aficionados will be limited. Still, Fever Pitch is so happy with the subtle and intelligent funny scripts that you can find a lot to connect with even the newborn baseball fans. Mike Leonard September 05.
