Turns to be a classy production with what has been a low budget. Characters from 7ft ghouls to several amazing, ax-wielding dwarfs! I enjoyed the relationship between Leads, too much sensitive but romantic enough interest to keep going. I also enjoyed a mix of humor (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much / not enough) which means that it is not too dark, not too stupid. This is a great step from Yves's other efforts, helbreaders and sanitarium in terms of story and production. They have a great website which worth checking out. Can not wait for Ben, if the progress level continues, it should be fantastic.
