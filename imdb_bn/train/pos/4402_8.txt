After watching movies such as Jesse James, Quantaryal, Joyhakkar, in the 1950s, the film was thrilled to see this film with a new view of Anne Lee. Lawrence, Kansas attack scene is awesome. The romantic relationship between Jewel and Tobey McGuay has become one of the best parts and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is outstanding as a bad guy. This image gives you the horrors of the war, and the frustration of the main characters, they do not know whether they are going to survive later. The price is definitely worth seeing.
