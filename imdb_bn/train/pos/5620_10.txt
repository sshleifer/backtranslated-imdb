Roman Polanski is considered to be the most important manager of our time, such as "Rosemary Baby" and "Chinatown" as the mind behind the classic. Possibly it can make Polanski's film very interesting, though, as he has been able to create commercially attractive films such as previously mentioned, he is also eager to create more personalized lower-end films. "Le Locketier", or "The Tenant", is one of those movies; Perhaps one of the best works and the best horror movies in them is probably a horror / suspicious story about the best work and passion in them. Polanski himself plays Telokosky, a young man looking for an apartment in France. Finally, when he found one, he discovered that it was simply because the previous tenant Simon Chaul tried to kill himself by jumping outside the window. After Simeon was wounded, Trailkovsky began to panic with him, believing that his death was caused by the rest of the building's tenants. <br /> <br /> Time to share the same clustrophobic feeling. His other "apartment-themed" films ("Twist and" Rosemary's Baby "); This film focuses on a bizarre conspiracy that may not be entirely on Trélkovsky's head, his panoja has its harmful effects and malicious emotions with his previous tenant. br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Activated in this way; almost any life is easy As such, who deviates from this tragic sub-world, which lives by the collection of strange people, the supporters of this supporter have actually given life to the people to create memorable characters, which is very important for the success of the film. Also, cinematography's beautiful painter Polanski helps to increase the feeling of isolation and for a beautiful building   ীবন দেয় যা Trelkovsky এর জন্য খাঁচা হিসাবে কাজ করে। । বিভ্রান্তি ও পাগলের অনুভূতি প্রকাশের জন্য পোলানস্কি ব্যবহার করা হান্টিং ছবিগুলি একটি অতিপ্রাকৃত সৌন্দর্যের কারণ যা তাদের উভয়কে ভয়ংকর এবং আকর্ষক করে তোলে। <br /> <br /> If there is any flaw in the film, it is a little slow at first. It may sound like a turn-off, but in the beginning the slow pace works perfectly because it trillowskski's own annoying life and how slowly it enters a different region. Also, narrow narratives are not easy to understand due to its complex complex level. However, more than an error, it is a joy to face a delightful stimulus plot. <br /> <br /> Although "The Tenant" may not be for everyone, those who are mentally awkward and happy with the experience of the guest's story lines. "Le Locketier" is really one of the best works of Roman Polish. 10/10
