This film is quite simple, bright. Cinematography is good, acting is fantastic and absolutely breathtaking for the story. This story of Donald Woods was South African South African who felt lonely until he became racist. Kevin Clayne is absolutely convinced - so many years later when Donald Woods appeared on TV itself, I knew him from the screenplay of Cain. Denzel Washington is also active as an efficient performance. <br /> <br /> I'm requesting you to visit this. It's long, but it's worthy of your patience because it tells an incredible story. Remember, folks, this really happened.
