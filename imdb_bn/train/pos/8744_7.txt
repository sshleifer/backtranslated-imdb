It's a low-budget film with a cast and a minimum position shoot unknown. Philippine is the alternative for Thailand and nobody actually goes to Hong Kong. Landed at the old airport makes a fully convertible Catholic Jumbo Jet Stock Shot. This film proves that you do not need a mega budget or a headliner star to create a great movie. The young filmmakers who stumble often in this are gaffras or plays. Strong labor force from all aspects of film making and those who understand compromises between industry and box office A nice piece of work!
