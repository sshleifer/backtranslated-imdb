Walter Matthews and George Burns just work well together. Willy's acidity with the wicked amnesic al is a mixture made in heaven. Once again seen in Willie's flat, the scene transforms the film into a gem and final scene into perfection. Walter Matthew has done a great role as a great character, only that he can do, the combination of voice words and exaggerated plays has become a great character with the common misunderstandings of what is happening. It was well compared to the photographs of George Burns and nowhere compared to this picture, his calm aplomb with the dry north of the desert is memorable. Look for the scene in the end when al and his daughter asked some of the Spanish caretaker, and al-reaction - invaluable.
