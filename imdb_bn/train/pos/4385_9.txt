It can be said about a movie that seems to be the most black, the most stupid and sometimes extremely weird - I will not say 'sympathetic'. I will call the 'Karimastik' villain in the history of the movie and Flynna and Fairbank were in their sky? It is a lethal, sometimes epitome of freedom against war and tyranny for his honor against the foolish, incredibly brave and honest people. I love it John Hart and Tim Roth were fantastic villains. Jessica Lange was very moving, flexible, and sensual.
