I have recently started to lose my faith in films related to General General Film. The story line has failed, and the camera work is copied from the last movie of the same taste. But, then I saw Giantto (Europe) and my faith was renewed. The metaphorical story is not only impressive, but apparently the use of color and black and white apparently stimulus. The narrator (Max von Saido) takes you through a spellbinding on every step of the road and hugging you in Europe of 1945. We have kept everyone on screen in hundreds of thousands of ways, but how the beauty of this movie governs you leads you to death that every slow dynamic moment. Unlike many movies, it will not cut the second after printing a stolen (for example), but you will be forced to see the devastating but sensitive beauty of a person's final moments. I think we will take a little away from what we are trying to say, but it will take time to find out what it really means. For anyone who wants to send me an email, I want to talk more deeply about the film. Enjoy it
