So much so much about the film's plot, wonderful acting performance, script, sadness, dull environment, excellent direction - what can I add? Just watch for one of the most heart-warming, beautiful performances, ruthless scenes ever illustrated. It is about Christmas Eve and the character of Frank Morgan (shop owner - Mr. Matusque) recovering from his broken marriage and suicide attempt. After leaving his staff, he invited them to their Christmas dinner. Each of them and each of them humbly turned them down. They all have plans for their own Christmas Eve. At this stage there is a deep sadness in this moving scene. Frank Morgan gives his career performance and this scene brings me to tears easily. Thankfully we have a blessed denouement in this very special scene. The new employees, children, and the end of going out of the store in a beautiful snowy street scene. Undoubtedly Mr. Matushek came to the boy and asked, how would he want to spend with him in the evening, he would treat him with such wonderful Christmas foods that this wrong boy probably never seen! The chap is frustrated, he can be clearly lonely as Mr. Matuschek and together they have a wonderful Christmas meal. Every time I see this scene it moves me. You see the delightful DVD of the great trailer with Frank Morgan, but Mr. Introducing himself as Mathusk and the film's director-genius Arnest LÃ¼bitz comes out. This image is a pleasure from the beginning to the beginning.
