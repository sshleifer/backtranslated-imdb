This is about a creator, Peter Ustinov, who infiltrates to the British company, TexaCon or another computer, which is considered as a computer wiz and security expert. His secret employee Karl Malden, learned to hack his computer secretly in the honor of his nephew Bob Newhart and his unarmed secretary Maggie Smith's love. <br /> <br /> Some business details were a little crazy with these non-business eyes but they were trustworthy and I got a general idea. Austinov, the founder of Peter, Rome and Stuttgart's penny business, uses Texas-based computers to send all sorts of money to this fictitious institution. Foreign companies, of course, are nothing more, Ostinov and these addresses are a looted artist in Paris, a sailor's shop in Rome and a bakery in Germany. <br/> <br /> I do not think that I like it for the first few minutes because it seems rather slowly. I'm hoping for a quick tempo along with lines of "The Pink Panther" or "The Lavender Heel Gang" and with more anger. But this image includes itself in your good intentions, because you came to appreciate the priceless humor of plot, characterization and dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's probably the poor idea of ​​removing many mistakes away from the gags but here are some more noticeable examples. <br /> <br /> Secretary Smith Ustinov: "I have the resources of these companies." Smith: "Wealth? What are they?" Ustinov: "Little female ass." Now, this is not a little exchanged. There is no delay for a quick cut and no laugh, which is the reason why Hasina's reaction is probably more than a laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is covered with cobwebs. The bricks have been torn apart and some have left behind the drawings of the former residents. The landlord does not speak English and Ustinov knows no French. Ustinov indicates a nude woman and chuckles like a child painting, "Ah a fam fye-tal, eh?" Landlord is very chocolate, replied: "Vous le Prenez pour une anee?" Ustinov: "Oh - Annie, so its name!" Landlord: "Wow?" Ustinov: "Entente Cordiale!" (Messi Amies, if I misunderstood those jinns, Jess McGues.) Bob Neighart has Greg Smith's hats as Gestapol (!) And seems to be running his house, but he accepts it as a "nice way". There is an immediate sequence of proposed traffic signs. "Be careful." "Lay - Bye." "Give the way." "Yield." Finished with the rich "stop / baby". There is another montage when Ustinov's plan is invented by the board of directors - blurry roof, police carriage, clasp from a farewell cat Maggie, ending with a sign: PRISON, Wormwood Scrubs. <br /> <br /> Okay, maybe one more. I still can not get Maden like a boss, deciding, "I'm never bothered about the decision", then hanging a few pink ones and washing it with a glass of water. <br /> <br /> Playing is fine, fine. This is Bob Nuheart's best role, for example. He was not that much, and his range was not limited, but he is perfect in this part. Music score by Laurie Johnson apparently was a good deal to put effort into it. He seems to have written a short concert for steam. Ustinov's passion is led by a false name like music and its foreign organization Cloud Debussy and Giacconino Rossini. The President of Stuttgart Fonye called someone called Schmidt, and he has a slight clinker. Maggie Smith is beautiful, sexy, bourgeoisie, and it seems that she can face her as not stupid. <br /> <br /> Do not expect comic fireworks, but in your cool way.
