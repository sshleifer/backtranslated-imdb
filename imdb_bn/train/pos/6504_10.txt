My wife and I have seen this whole series at least three times. I can not imagine how it could be good Is it not WWII's "complete" history? Which library can not contain such history? But it is the best summary of history. Many details, lots of personal stories, and still keep the overall image visible. <br /> <br /> The description of Olivia has been written exquisitely and, of course, given nicely. Interview is not allowed on all sides except Russian, because many of the producers are not allowed to speak with Russians. It is worth a lot of owners of this full program on DVD. We eat our copy. <br /> <br /> The producer of painting and painting, which almost does not exist in an archive, has done a great job: For example, almost no film of coal and submarine war, but the episode has been very good at this time.
