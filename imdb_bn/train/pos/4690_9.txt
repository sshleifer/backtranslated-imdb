Twenty-five years ago, I showed this movie in automobiles in some children's class and still can remember children's tension; They were spelled! It's not just words that "made of clay sickle" and live, but other animals who use the head. An extraordinary scene where a Cobra fights with a monitor laser and shows the colony of the Mongols. It is not only good for antomology classes but also for environmental education, because there is a lot about correlation between matter and other organisms and the entire environment of all living organisms around the churches. <br /> <br /> I hope it can be found in DVD, so that I can see it again and show it to others.
