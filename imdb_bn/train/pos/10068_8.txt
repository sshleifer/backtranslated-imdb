This movie was excellent. Culture is a sad fact about how conflict with sex goes. It's just a big hot unclear film. A master who has been heritage and deeply impressed, despite being a girl to compete her love for dogs and you have put it on top with a clever monkey with a thousand facial expressions. This is the end of the big happy movie. This film does a good job of showing how much it can enjoy the tradition, so that they are willing to share their secret and die. You look at any culture that is never seen before, which helps improve the drama shown in the end of the picture. Film-photography is excellent, especially with open-ended parade sequences with all the sparkers. The Oscars are considered to be the best debut for foreign film.
