RadioFrescia is a film about all of us, our dreams, our friends, our emotions, our addiction, our fears. This is a brilliant film, where a group of friends like us all live through the difficulties of growing up in a small town among the most remarkable decades of the last century. The film does not take a happy or sad view on the subject, it only tells us a story, which we all could feel. One of happiness and excitement, sadness and sadness. The power of this story is that we grow to love the characters, this is a movie that you will be watching over and over, in the small city of Emile Romagna city. Waiting for one day to be able to walk on the street next to Francesco and his friends, the song heard that the radio has changed the world through Radio Raptus International's old radio cracking sound, playing their dreams or dreams. RadioFreshSkyia will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will give you a shock and comfort you, it will give you and take it from you. Personally I believe it plays an important part in my life and my friends, and I let you see it everybody and let it become your part.
