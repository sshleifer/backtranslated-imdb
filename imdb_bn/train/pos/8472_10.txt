I totally disagree. I think it was a great movie for children. Well, suffering from the Gilligan Island, and the rarely known Deana Plato was like a Disney, and for this it is rarely flawless fluff. 'It was not scary and did not mean that. I will not destroy the end. But the way it was done was unusual. This means that the kids' letters were great and I do not know what to expect at the end. There was more to plot with these kids that you are saying that specialty fisheries expert of these children, especially the very center of the plot. It also helps them at the end of a jam. Being too long I think it's time to watch in 95 minutes
