Although at one point I thought that this would turn into graduation, I want to say that an elderly woman of a mother is a wonderful job to explain sexual desires. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy a British movie because Hollywood could never do it, even if they are, they do not take the time to develop the characters. <br /> <br /> The story has been released slowly and actually. Acting gorgeous, the characters are credibly faulty, and dialogues are sensitive. I tried many times to predict what was going on, and I was always wrong, so I was very curious about the story. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. And I must admit, I look at my mom in a light forever!
