And perhaps Dickens is the closest to the storyline. Although I was very hard to see young Ebenezer (who had the idea that at the time of the hair, of course they could do better than this!), Did incredible things like Scott Scrooge. His delivery of several lines of Dickens finally came to life for me. Edward Woodward We Hope All And The Christmas Eve Exists More I found GC much more believable anger than Scott's Scrooge Patrick Stewart's latest version. Christmas morning scene when Scrooge realized that he did not 'miss', it is enough to convince a man how Scott works against Overweight. He is amazing here. Almost the entire cast is incredible. This version of Christmas Carroll is a little hard to see the Tiny Teams very sweet. Still music and scenery this will show each holiday watch. Enjoy!
