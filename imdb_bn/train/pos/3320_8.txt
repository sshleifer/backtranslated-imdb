I liked this movie, nice and funny I found this photo as a good family film. The most beautiful part of this movie was when it made reference to New York Yankees. NY Yankees must be in Red Sox Nationals for you to understand a messy word. Yankee fans are sorry to say this. I recommend this picture for the whole family. Of course, at the moment of a long film with your usual love / comedy film, I'm in love and what I will do, but the film creates it for all snap moments. In a few moments of the movie show, in the Red Soks Nation (Fenway Park) how fans fondled almost all of the Socks for nearly 86 years, and how the love of Sax and the love of other people increased.
