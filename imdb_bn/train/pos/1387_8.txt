Slowly (somehow like Sofia Coppola's film), but still a very impressive film about the discovery of sex in three teenage girls. The magic of film lies in his ability to bring back many memories of how his age chooses to be. Confusion and helplessness are generally portrayed but life is true. Music is perfect and amazing acting. The camera works nicely. We highly recommend it for those who fear our psychological passion and those who fear to look back at this particular time of life while discovering our desires. I would say that through this period it is a fine film for ages. A lot of movies have been made about the adolescence, but it's really the realization of the advent of the adult world of romance and its complexity.
