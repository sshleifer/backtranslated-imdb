Perhaps the most exciting movie in recent years is Ju's Legend. It exceeds all expectations and is really a work of art. With stories of strange visual sceneries and divine proportion, Zu legends fly over its viewers with its majesty. This movie has been created wonderfully by using high tech cgi, which allows fantasy-type fans to see their views. This type of acting is perfect for movies; If you were immortal with supernatural power, then I think you will want more to yourself. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many opinions, the plot is really easy to follow, when a fast dynamism can be maintained. Anyone who can not keep track of different characters can not pay attention or it is not used in tetanic levels like sedimentation. The plot is coagulated and coated with the theme so the epic that they will leave gasping for the wind. Zu's legendary majesty is so superior to a level that probably many people are stopped by its grandeur. Allow yourself to completely engulf in his fantastical vision and you will love this movie.
