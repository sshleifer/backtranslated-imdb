This is a great British film. A clever face script with many citationable lines, which can take a magic spell on a weekly holiday. Above all Phil Daniel is best rated by British actor Geoff Bell's rating. Peter Bowles with a hanging joint from his face brings something of strange atmosphere to Gary Stretch with a cast masterstroke and his brooding looks. Although it seems to be a biker movie, I think the audience will be found outside of it, completely in that context many people have done it and got T-shirts. Also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird. This really famous Ealing comedy might be a 21st century heir. Weed like the Welsh field: it's a grocery!
