My college professor said that Othello could be Shakespeare's best drama. I do not know whether I still agree with her. I bought this video version. First I love Kenyith Branagh as Yago, he was quite complex and did very well in this adaptation. Surprisingly, he played a role in not managing it. Lawrence Fishburn shows that American actors Shakespeare as well as British actors can do. That was not a British versus American issue about it. In fact, if we all work together, Shakespeare can reach the public, which is very much worth it. Apart from Shakespeare's other tragedies, ethnic problems are tackled. Something that exists since the beginning of time. The relationship between Yago and Emilia can be better and they can simultaneously complain of their union. Although Othello loves Dedemona with all his heart, so he becomes weakened by jealousy and is afraid to lose a lazy man like Casio. At the end of the film it's a great scene but I will not publish it at all. It's just worth seeing. I think they have edited most lines in 2 hours but they always edit Shakespeare.
