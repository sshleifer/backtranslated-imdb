The Shining Adaptation is a Wonderful Example: It is very few with the source novel written by Stephen King, but it is widely considered to be one of the best cinematic presentations of horror master work. This is due to two reasons: Stanley Kubrick's skillful direction and Jack Nicholson's Chilean acting. <br /> <br /> Nicholson played Jack Torrens, who is not influenced by a writer who took care of Canada's Overlook Hotel in winter, is not afraid of the surrounding area: He claimed that a new, unique location is his new book. Need to finish Therefore, Overvalue has become the new home of the Torance family: Jack, his wife Wendy (Shelley Duval) and their five-year-old son Danny (Danny Lloyd). The boy especially feels right from the beginning that something went wrong: Dick and Hallan (Skatman Crothers) told that he devoted himself with the help of a mysterious psychological force, called Shining, which is like a man like him and Dick is past and other things from the future. To see. Because this "gift", the hotel resident in the hotel immediately expresses interest in the Danny, though he is capable enough to resist them. In Jack's case it is not that he gets increasingly paranoid love for his wife and may seek consolation among the best-defined organizations as a ghost, creating disorderly disorder and breaking fear is very dangerous. Burning film as a burning film works because Kubrick never used to work in such films before, knowing exactly what was and what was not, big focus in atmosphere and psychological shocks than wind and creative bleeding. . King criticized the director for changing most of the story, most of the Jack / Danny Subplot dropped (only cited in the film) which led to the emotionally strong measurements of the book and that there was a sense of disappointment, but the mistake was really necessary: ​​although the novel encounters the liberation This is an extraordinary way, and ransom is a human erosicker The analyst Kubrick, for which there was not a soft spot. He is interested in what is emotional, and subsequent physical, unbalanced character that threatens, and he uses very cold methods and steadicam shots thanks to the unclear tone (two deaf twins face Danny being the best example). According to the author, in the beginning of the film, his trademark bondage Jack was already insane, thus making the story more frustrating than the rest: writer, about another critically acclaimed actor, especially Nicholson. Now, it is true that Nicholson is looking somewhat unexpected from the very beginning, but it is also true that Martin Shane (the ideal king of the role for role) probably will not be able to provide a performance as awesome as Nicholson: from the moment he is immortal "Johnny before!" Grinning started more intensely than ever before. It is impossible to portray the scene to another viewer, and although the TV version of The Shining is not bad since 1997, the Torrance character is inseparably associated with a flake on Kaku's nest star. As Duvall and Lloyd, both add horrible support, the legacy is particularly devoted to a place beside Harvey Stephens (Damien of Woman) and Helly Joel Osment as well as the film's great Awkward Child Icon. Duval can be completely different from the book's opponent (blonde and beautiful) and complain about not doing anything more to scream and run, but two things should be considered: a) "queen of scream" is still one in 1980; B) Very rarely, the actress is really afraid of the cameras, making the book's movie difference secondary to the real fear of Vendee's eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Freedom should be given to Danny Boyle), but this does not mean that the movie is certainly bad. The Shining proof proves to be perfection: Very few, about 5% of the novels are included in this movie, but in this handwritten by Cubic and Nicholson, it has become one of the best, most original horror films in the loose cinematic translation, which is actually the continuous current poor form Giving something to say.
