This almost unknown gem was based on a French frees - which looks, and I mean as a compliment. <br /> <br /> Caroline (Lee) is being admired by a wealthy Argentine (Roland) who asked her father for a wedding to her father. But Caroline has already married Anthony (Colman), who came only flat and immediately launched an audience-oriented flirtation, Caroline decided that she loved someone else: A Delant-eyed sculptor (Gardin). The film tells stories about Anthony's strategy to obscure Caroline from her sculpture and how her experience helps her with her Argentine. <br /> <br /> It has been completely cast: Ronald Colman is his most sophisticated and charming, Reginald Gardner is his most prominent, Gilbert Rowland is his most exotic, and Anna Lee is just delicious scary. The film is wonderfully managed by Luis Milestone (who is produced); The whole production seems like labor of love. The pens have broken features such as frames and cameras, and exceptional use of a sliding bar-cabinet door has such a wonderful touch. This is a sin that it has not been released from DVD - it's a kind of movie that can be combined with interest in classic movies.
