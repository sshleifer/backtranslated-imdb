Matthu and Lemon These are exclusively their best - everyone else in the film is awesome. The dialog is nice and very, very malicious - and the scene where Lemon's character tries to clean up his sinus in a restaurant, when I see laughing around the floor. Anyone who sees such a big signal should not turn away from the original. I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone - I just like it. And Jack Lemon made his character so straightforward that the sad overturned only matched with my opinion. These two great guys made a string of movies together, but this one is the best - no doubt.
