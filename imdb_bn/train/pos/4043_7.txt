Actually I went to the video store to get the version but I'm fine with Alive. <br /> <br /> If you want to start at the beginning of the wall on the wall wall, you do not like Elive. There is a lot of action, but it comes as pay-off for the full-length character-build build-up. Personally I think it's good and valuable. <br /> <br /> Certain scripts are stupid like SCI-FI action films and I think subtitles can be replaced by parasites using the term foreign objects for greater effect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />) But the film does not enjoy for it. Another bonus for this movie is the Gothic Imagery that is done with great artistic mood during many flashbacks and dream sequences. <br /> <br /> Rent this!
