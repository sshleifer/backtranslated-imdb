The only other movie except the Swant Green is frustrating in the air. Copies of both the film species and the results of the disasters of the planet from humans. On the beach with the nuclear war and ecological swarming green with the environmental toxicity of the planet. Maybe <br/> maybe some optimistic because since 2007 we have not reached the world of the film described in that film and we were now supposed to be by now. In New York City, still 8 million people have become Milanania described in Swant Green 23 million. The environment is always proud of the global warming consequences. It shows the right to run life rights policy for itself. There is clearly no family planning in this world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An executive with the corporation, Joseph Cotten, has come up with a food product, feeding various populations of the world, some types of colors like wafers. This is the latest product of Swant Green. <br /> <br /> Charlton Hesson has found his man in the investigation, but it leads to some awful truths about the future of the Swant Corporation and mankind. Houghton finally shouted that the Soilant Green man was made, we became the nation of cannibals, the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative. We tired the planet and we have to eat our dead to live. <br /> <br /> This is Edward G. Robinson was farewell, and in his memoirs, Hesson said Robinson's ongoing talk, although he had various political views. After weeks of Robinson's screening of the final scene of his screen, he died in real life. Not many, but Hesson knew that Robinson was in the end and there was no play involved in the last death scene. <br /> <br /> Although the timetable was off, it does not mean that the world can not pass envisioned by the Soilent Green. Hopefully we will not only have intelligence, but the feelings of fate will continue to be felt.
