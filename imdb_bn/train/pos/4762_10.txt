I thought "River of the soul" was a very good 5 movie, with Martin Shane, Tracy Skogins, and some amazing performances of Ian McKenzie. An episode of this series (except comedians) it might be one of my favorite single stories of the series. <br /> <br /> Personally, I always liked Skrogens to Christian, although JMS did not write to him in most of the series and he had to bear the Bayern / Telepath plot. If you take a smile on the scene of the scene and the poor "poor" actor, this film is a tough element. Probably four movies are my third favorite, but in no way bad.
