When Sabrina came to the first screen, I was 12 years old, and so my teenage years saw teenage sorcerer in all the strange predictions. <br /> <br /> It was always one of my favorite programs, Wicked feeling was the 'Bewitched' sitcom of the sixties but this time the character was cool. I always like Sabrina because she was smart. Its enjoyable was enjoyable to see which she is friendly and easy. The letters at the beginning were great; Harvey, Jenny, Libby, Coexmaster, Salim and Mr. Pole (my personal feeling, as soon as she went away) Hilda and Jelda her cousins ​​were all right, but then got excited. <br /> <br /> I like Mr. Craft, he was very close to the discovery of the secret secret of Sabrina. What I liked about the first three series was original ideas, family privacy discovery, and new spellings, but it became more convincing. Many letters came and left, such as Valerie, Drima, and Brad, and then they decided to Sabrina in college, which destroyed it for me. <br /> <br /> Sabrina was self-absorbed in college, there was less magic, no spelling books, she had no oxygen, Roxy, Miles and Morgan boring. <br /> <br /> The last series was annoying, and I only saw to see what had happened at the end. Hilda and Jelda do not seem to be mistaken in any way and Miles has gone exactly the same way. The last episode makes me feel better though (Speaker) Sabrina ended up with Harvey on her wedding day to destroy Harun! Overall, a great program if you forget the last two or three series of poor ones that remind me of a lot of misery. Magic
