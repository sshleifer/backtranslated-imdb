The debut? Wow - cross-id is one of the most enjoyable indie films I've seen in the past year, it's hard to believe that the cross-eyed first movie of the author. I mean - I have logged into IMDB to find more of this author ... because there is a unique cross sign ID - you want to see what this author is trying to say. These days, it is rare to see a rare, well-known, well-edited and well-liked movie. For me - Contracts that cross-ID should be about making movies - the best mix of all the film elements to create a cute, artistic and shocking story. Do more.
