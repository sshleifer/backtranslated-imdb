This movie kept me constantly entertained. Compared to this serial mother, Mr. Waters has returned to his best. This is not nearly polished. <br /> <br /> there's a dark side here. A message of success and fame how a person changes - but more importantly how it changes people around you. <br /> <br /> There is no false moments in this movie. <br /> <br /> Characters are somewhat cartoonist ... but I want to believe what Mr. Waters is trying to achieve. <br /> <br /> This is very interesting to see how Mr. Waters has improved ... it will really be the best.
