This unsung cool gem tells the true story of a POW escape from the second time WWII. Performance is incredible, especially Anthony Steele. The film works on different levels: cerebral, emotional, visual, and literal. Dialogue is impressive and very true ring. In fact, an unusual all-around authentication puts the head and shoulders on most war epic.
