It is easily the most intimate film inn Brooks Canon. Sure, its flawed. It does not give a realistic view of homelessness (for example, how civilian lounges give a realistic view of the lounge singers, or the Titanic's Italian view of your reality). Interesting enough to fall flat. But still, this movie is not much like a joke, and it is very prevalent for most traditionally presented in a story about rebel members. Her fisher is not king, but her punk is not. My only complaint is that Brooks should throw someone else in the leadership (I love Melake as director and writer, not so much lead).
