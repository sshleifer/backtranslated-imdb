I do not think most of us would like to apply the word "must see" in action movies, but I was very impressed about how good this film was and it was desirable to receive a "must-see" stamp from me. <Br> <br /> Playing by Mandy Shannon Lee (daughter of late and great Bruce Lee's daughter and late Brandon Lee's sister), Martin employs a professional thief to help bring a diamond hierarchy to a criminal for a criminal syndicate Have done , And rewarded nicely for it. They do not know that another pair of thieves (Lucy and Tommy, a pair of love birds) who left them before reaching the agreement between Mandy and Martin, they are also planning to steal diamonds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is an exciting thing to see how each pair of thieves can see the plans of the thief. Martin and Mandy have unknowingly found one step behind Lucy and Tammy. Because <br /> <br /> You are finding yourself for these thieves because they think they need each other to stay alive from the criminal syndicate. Not happy with the diamonds that are not in hand. <br /> <br /> Do not be frustrated by action fans, because of the good dose of gunfight, martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that this movie is not only a carry, but romance and laughter (and I do not mean that your normal one-liner action applies to movies) which sneak up <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, miss! <br /> <br /> 9
