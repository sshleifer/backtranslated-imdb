I think I'm a great fan of David Lynch's work, because he provided unique unique pictures with viewers with the unique "Lynch-Elements". Seeing most of his work, I undoubtedly thought that I could predict the next phase of Lynch. I was wrong. Dumbbell is something I could not imagine as David Leicher. Yet, after my recovery from the first shock, I started thinking about this very primitive main character, and I concluded that mirroring the bit from all the rigidity, cruelty, cruelty and hatred reality present here, it is distorted and stressed. There is something in our life that we sometimes do not care because they are either hateful or horrible, but they are around us, so I dare say that Dumbbell concentrates on these bits and pieces. It's not a movie to enjoy, though you'll sometimes smile from weird, malicious intelligent humor, but it's an animated reflection of all things, including our simplicity, illness and illogicality, that we refuse to do. Take it as it does, you do not have to like it. It only exists And finally, if you are attentive enough, you will find the general element like linen. I recommend it for tolerant people !!!
