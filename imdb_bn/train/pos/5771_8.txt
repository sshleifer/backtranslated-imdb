When you surf the channel on Saturday afternoon, it's one of the movies and you drag it into it and the end of the whole thing is gone. I thought it was well played and it really made me feel for the characters. Although it's going on a bit slowly, paying greater attention to the relationship between Bonnie and Clyde and their family members, it's not boring. We do not really see so much robbery that they were so curious, and instead of police firing, most of them were shot. I'm Trainee Neigham, who played Bonnie, really did a good job with his character. Describing a cold blooded killer from a beautiful country girl is a challenge, and I enjoyed the role that I have come up with. <br /> <br /> Overall, the above average effort, especially made for TV movies considered it.
