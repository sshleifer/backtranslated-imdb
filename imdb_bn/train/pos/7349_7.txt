Of course if you are reading my review you have already seen this film. 'King Babu' is one of my favorite characters. I just thought of a spoiled brat concept with a 24 * 7 servant on his motorcycle. See movies and imitate character etc. I love the scene when Kadar Khan's stone cracks while eating. Apart from this, where Rajkanya describes a story of King Babu in Kapoor's food table, and Govinda commented on wearing 'Dharmam-Wair' uniform. Thats the movie my favorite scene 'Achacha Pataaji To Main Chalata Hoon' is the only chemistry between two great Indian actors, who are ridiculously present without any conversation. Its bright This is a cat mouse film. Just watch these actors help each other and still take away scenes from each other. Its total entertainment. If you like Govinda and Kader Khan chemistry, then it is a must. I think in the list of the Arabic batsmen David Dhawan 6. Before this jewel of 'Deewana Mastana', 'Ankhin', 'Shola or Shabnam', 'Sugar', Coolie No. 1 ' 7/10
