Moving out of the movie to rent, I picked up freebird. Through the third quarter of the film, I am surprised that the rest will not be able to see. Fortunately, it's really hot, and I liked the movie a little bit. In the second half of the film I was full time and sunny. Thankfully, although CGI bits were included, they were not overdone or conventional. <br /> <br /> I would say - all of the actors have European languages, so if they have difficulty understanding them they will be warned. Voice or their cultural humor. <br /> <br /> I really like this movie, and have to order a copy myself for my own collection.
