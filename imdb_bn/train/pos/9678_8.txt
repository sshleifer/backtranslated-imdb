My own happy bird could speak. Tisk risk on critics who break the movie. A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy. Poly is a lovable little treasure. He has made several cute tricky lines really smile to me. I especially like the order of the dance during his showbiz Stein. You can forgive the obvious clich√©s as you are happy to her in her expedition with Marie. An impressive movie featuring two powerful characters that actually differentiates them from their young masters. The woman has become more blind and women should have abandoned their mutual journey. I liked his artistic and poetic inspiration, Lulei could not divide the party's reunion. Finally, with Marie congratulate Pauli on her new home, perhaps the beautiful young man joined him who helped defeat the opponent to complete his journey.
