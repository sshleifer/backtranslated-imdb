I admit, even for the first time I have seen the cover blues, I do not think it was memorable in any case. But after seeing 7 times now, I acknowledge that it has increased so much on me. The characters of CC, Mrs. Jelin and Counties have become very popular. And romance between Sissy and Jellybean is very sweet. Although the plot is very weak, I think ridiculous humor is more than this. Then there's a kick-ass soundtrack, which is very talented. D. At the best of his time, Lan (who reminded me a little bit of Paties). I can not remember any movie that has "increased on me" after the "improper first impression", as there are Cowgirls.
