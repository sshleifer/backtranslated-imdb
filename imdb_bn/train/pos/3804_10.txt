My 3 year old likes it. I like it, my wife likes it. So 10 out of our family 10. For the level of violence? Not really that fell, most of the slap sticks are different. No one really dies, no roar, no blood, no torture, it is certainly appropriate for children, much more than the cartoon on Saturday morning. <br /> <br /> This movie will actually accept the idea of ​​CGI movies where it should be <br /> <br /> First of all, the beautiful graphics, the textures are amazingly complete, with true depth, trying to be realistic No, rather it's an artistic formulation. Rocks on stone, metal rust, relief on wood and stones add everything. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many contemporary CGI films, character modeling is not diverse, yet not intelligent, in an artistic whole. The faces may be less damaging than any other movies, but letters are more doll-like than humans. I think this is a good thing, it gives authenticity, how strange it might sound, it is easy to suspend your mistrust. <br /> <br /> At least Pixar hair, fur, dress, Only in the opening scenes while fighting with Lian-chu giant slugs; Guizoda is in front of some farmers, and they all have detailed clothing that gives me the break in the film just for being appreciated. <br /> <br /> setting. Preferably the car, Wall ?? E. The space has been done many times, but Dragon Hunter's imaginative environments are sometimes not comparable to the last story and Lord of the Rings, but again it is an artistic group and many good ideas are easily cast. Fantastic vistas like the Monsters Incorporated scene where they have its storage facilities, or Wall ?? E through all the doors on the premises where we see its abundant crude tower, many of these movies, all glorious, have not yet lived; It's just the whole background! The interlude where they walk through the area with fantastic crops. Chinese wall, floating island in the sky Broccoli in the sky? It's true where I believe CJI will go, do something that can take your breath, and do it again and again. <br /> <br /> The term is good, diversity of music and not just an epic, and no voice without thanks, and the whole movie for the movie. <br /> <br /> Animation is pretty good. The cartoon borrowed its inspiration, especially stretching and undoubtedly some good use. Sometimes that is realistic, but 3D models are not realistic. <br /> <br /> Characterization is well done. Lien-Chu, gentle and uncertain monster gradually growing with confidence in the light of a little Joe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All that, but knowing that intelligent child wants to change anything? I love Lean-Chuke more than any other recent character, since the Monsters in Sannistes Incorporated. <br /> <br /> The internal conflict of the group is exacerbated by external pressure, just as it should be in the fairytale story. <br /> <br /> The story is memorable of the lasting story, especially how the world is isolated happens. Apart from the one flocking the monsters, the excellent quality is renting. There is lack of mental impact on the wall? E, this is a really strong aspect of the movie, but it's a more fun journey, and the first of these is the lack of repetition of the annoying musical scene and it took action from the first scene. This movie is what you want to see for any fun and exciting time. <br /> <br /> The entire movie, as I mentioned the whole aspect, seems to have been strictly followed throughout life. <br /> <br /> - It seems that this setting is ready for more events, and I hope so. <br /> <br /> There was a leak, French actor Liane-Chu gave a little response like Jean Reno. First, but I was not happy, though she is my favorite. To hear a new one, to me, the voice is wonderful. <br /> <br /> I am surprised at some middle and low rating, to give it a maximum rating; I have tried to address some concerns with concern with two reviews of minimum votes. Consider this movie as an adventure, and as a European film, Hollywood does not oppose it, but it is different.
