Drug years are actually suffering from one of the mini-series or other documentary TV programs for several weeks on TV. It's actually a way, not long enough. In the decade of decades, the main figures are covered and they are interesting to keep an eye on modern history and opinions from different perspectives. But it does not cover enough, or at least once given, it is given once when it is more time-consuming. For example, the entire process of shipwreck (partially marijuana, next cocaine) in the amount of the vessel and business information and details are really well presented, but there are more details which are kept in the instructions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Over the years, and the interplay between all was very clear. There is no one in the movie - except for a short hint with the pot) - The drugs are fully supported, but what is shown is fun sometimes on fun clips, and then sad, about taking certain medicines. The different strains, ridiculously, the presence of drug-resistant officials, pushing certain points-even even over the drug content overview and completely connected to the United States-are really the only main points that are made several times by an interview. The only way to move towards the problem of narcotics is to 'Do not Say', because the fight of medicine has shown that it is not as effective as thought. It is true that all the drugs and those who can be hypocritical about them (eg, Oxytin continues in the market) become clear to all parties. <br /> <br /> Is it great a Ken Burns documentary interest and depth? No, but to see the young people (i.e. my age) for some summer TVs who will often see it as an ancient history, although it is not much more than a generation ago, as well as the 'older' who can reflect the great peak, unexpected time after decades , And then the confusion spread further through the same media which was preached many years ago and it was notified Did it Those documentaries, which may be especially favorable, are not completely untrue, but try to take adequate amounts of enough social, political and recreational conditions (better or obviously bad). An interesting scene.
