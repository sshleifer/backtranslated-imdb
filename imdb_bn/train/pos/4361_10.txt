Perhaps it was one of the best-made movies of 40 - Warner Bros. Their style height. Its great achievement by photography by Sol Polito - excellent composition and light with fine galaxies. Max Steiner contributed one of his most complex and beautiful scores - the figure of his classical light motif method. Music plot adds great passion and excitement and is fine and memorable. It is very interesting to note that the same production team that created this film that year after the "Voyager" was able to create - a fine film that won honor and prizes and went as a historical favorite, because it played Bate Davis. In my opinion, "gay sisters" is a good film - all sections are better, and more interesting, complex and enjoyable. Instead of projecting their modern creative sensitivity or hyper-critical perfection and projecting the values ​​of the claim, it's a great movie that entertains for those who accept it. Each thing will be judged for its own time reference and what it is trying to achieve its own terms. The majority of the allegations that I have read in these reviews are very young and completely absent. If you're hungry for a perfect file mignon, do not go to burn the bakery and start whining and complaining about fluff pastry. Film criticism A large part of the industrial population is really lost. Sorry guys - maybe if this movie had a score by Rolling Stones and a hundred complex and subsection of soul searching, you would be grateful to all humbly. Without a modern intellectual perspective, one day of the week I will take an old movie!
