Outside of Disney's story out of all the princesses, Cinderella has probably the most lasting appeal. I can not really say why, but for some reason, the next generation of generations pushed him to the top of their list. As a small girl, I wanted more than Cinderella with her glass slippers- it was my favorite favorite dress. <br /> <br /> In fact, there is a story that can understand the long-lived, human heart rather than Cinderella. Who wanted to escape from everyday life and could not find anyone who saw someone else? The story is old from the English language and in some way it really is. <br /> <br /> Disney can create a wonderful villain if there is nothing else for the characters. The evil from Lady Tremaine T, is a wonderful count, not too much physical way. His cutting tongue and eyes work for him - he does not need electricity workers to scare your heart. Grate animal friends, especially that stupid Gus tend to I would be glad if I met his fate in the jaw of Lucifer. Cinderella did not push herself - sometimes it's just a fair comment. However, she lacks the drive to make her completely sympathetic. Sure, he was beautiful and feeding animals, but was kept in that place? We do not know. Even if she becomes a slave in another house, at least she gets paid and she is respected. It seems that for Cindy's end, the only thing to do is to work everything in his shoots. She never works for her dreams that she sings so beautifully. <br /> <br /> which brings me to music, which is as beautiful as it was before. Ilin has a beautiful, rich voice of wood, probably my favorite of a Disney heroine. Some great values ​​have been raised here - a dream is in your heart, so this love, BBBD Bobby Badu ... <br /> <br /> Cinderella is a wonderful heartwarming story about a musician highlights.
