'Przez Ryan' is a beautifully watched picture of a young French gay experience. Throwing both stereotype and publicity, it plays an amazing natural movie, has performed nicely, with a feeling for the seafront city where the action takes place, sometimes not melodramatic but often painful. If it is almost too realistic, small as a path to conventional conspiracy, only a scene. But in the absence of conventional dramatic tensions, it can drag less than the world. 'Prizake Ryan' can never be the most exciting movie ever made; But its general humanism works well in comparison to pre-conceptualistic or ruthless views, which often beat the treatments of this theme. A clock value.
