Despite the success of comedy or drama, Turkish director Horror-Thriller's failure "Okul-D @ bbe" is a good example for the horror of Turkish movies. <br /> <br /> But if you look at "Jane" then understand that this is the strike. The movie is impressive and dark in the atmosphere. Also the special features are colorful and not cheap. The soundtrack fits the movie but the script is not perfect and the theme of the film is simple. <br /> <br /> "Jane" does not make any difference in horror movies, but it is not frustrating to thrillers fans. In this case it is a success for Hessilakam and Turkey. (7/10)
