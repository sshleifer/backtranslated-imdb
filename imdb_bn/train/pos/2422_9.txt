Yes, this is a low budget. Yes, this is one of the first movies of candy, but it's probably fun! John Candy did not move away from his SCTV day "Going Bershawk" and it shows. When Candri tries to help a man with her grocery, she is not objectionable, when she has sexually disconnected her girlfriend and hand-cuffed a runaway coat with her girlfriend (Hah ?, watch the movie! ), Or Eugene Levy (the creator of Kong FuU), the phone is talking to his mother, or talking to countless numbers of faces That's just what Candy can provide to your puppy better! If you like "Alone Alone" Candy, it may not be a movie, but I would recommend to show you, but if you enjoy John Candy's SCTV day, the film must be seen!
