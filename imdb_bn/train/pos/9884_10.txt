Rawhide was a wonderful TV western series. Focusing on a band of lead drovers by trail boss Gil Favor Most of the episodes - especially from the first 3 seasons - were the study of grace and genuine character of his men. The guest star came and went, but unlike the wagon train, they rarely dominated the epidodes. Raoheide was a real, great Western and Gill Faest forgotten as a memorable character that can never be forgotten. Thanks to the performance of Eric Fleming, this exhibition has become a huge hit. Of course he was well supported by an excellent cast by the actor - Clint Eastwood, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines, James Murdoch, Rocky Shahan, Robert Cabal. All of these actors left their mark in a piece of television history. Rawhide has managed to do so, however, in any series that holds the smell of that time in the west for me. After the periods between the seasons tend to divide and give their separate story line. It did not work for me in some time - provided livestock and regular stories. But there were still some classic stories and Rawhide's top drawer remains. Black and white photography is an absolute, realistic idea that other western series is rarely captured for capturing. Rostler, Indians, Commemorrhoids, beautiful maidens of trouble, serial killers, they all seem to highlight the issues of our heroes. The series came for a series when the final season lost less than halfway to the series. Because - Erie Fleming went away and Rahed had no head except the body - the bitter reality ended, Gil Foyes commanded the authority of authority and authority - he was never incredible and it made him more attractive. We will not see her again. Whenever you can see an episode, they are rarely frustrated.
