I have shown this film several times in college, and every time I show up, the number of people who have met me grow rapidly ... Besides the virgin, anyone wants to show it again! It takes a little while, but eventually the whole room shout, shout, shout, make repeated appearances, repeat dialogue, and is fully and fully involved with the film's experience, "The Lonely Lady". Most vaguely illustrated, bad writing scenes, horrifyingly trash marked as your campest thing R is (a short statement, friend). For me, there is no comparing the UK, Pia ... and I do not feel that I was the only one who felt this way!
