Neo and Bourne and those who made half-baked forgot modern heroes. Please see the wide audience of Geeks that they want to be their hero 12 years old to see. Since they may not be Rambo or McClane or even Indiana Jones, Hollywood allows a bunch of no-bearded focus and still want to see something that looks like an action flick. <br /> <br /> "Action set pieces" are painful to watch and any girl can challenge their manhood without question. This explains the repeat of our silver screen oldies over the last few years. For better (Rocky, Rambo) or worse (Hard Mite 4 - where John McClelen, bind yourself .... no beard!) <br /> <br /> I said it has become a high protagonist and An end to their reign. Although this "Largo Witch" movie is far from perfect, and probably mostly predictable, at least Tommy Sassley has given a very committed performance as an action-hero. And Malani Thiei took her beard, only once she became weak! I rest my suit. <br /> <br /> I could not get into the theater room, but I might have been waiting for a decade for the movie. For the first time in Belmondo-France, a movie can be well-adapted and transformed into a B-Genre without performing its task. Meanwhile, we had to chew everyone, or had a big bucket of goats or were limited to reaching a wider audience ... in other words it was "Le Pact Des Lups" or "Daberman" (remember, I like Doberman). I believe "Largo Winch" is what it takes to make both popular and quality films. <br /> <br /> I'm very happy with the theater room, and hungry for more.
