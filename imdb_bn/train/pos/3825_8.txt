After the accident, a young woman came to her husband's house. He rarely settled in this small town, but after a few days he had lost his little boy in the hopes and hopes of all ... It can be followed by plots in a normal movie: Find a new partner and be happy finally; Or desperately frustrated in struggle and ultimately kills himself ... he tries to kill himself, but not after God's deadly fierce fight. He believes in God, only God considers everyone to forgive even the harmful. Well, I have to be careful about God, the film does not matter to God. The manner in which the movie handles is quite interesting: not from the perspective of God or from God's point of view (in this way, many grass growing, clouds are becoming visible, I think). Rather, it comes from the eyes of the third party, the film does not allow us to understand and explain anything. <br /> <br /> The movie was not so attractive that there were only women. This guy is everywhere around that woman and is clearly in love with her, but on her own path She is a funny guy, like a shoe I would say, who hangs around us, hangs around our heroine. The combination of these two, the thirsty woman, to cry and always throw, and the people, the sunny and foolish fools, ends in a good balance of emotions: nothing in speech is utterly tiring or very tiring. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
