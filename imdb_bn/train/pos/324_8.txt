I did not expect to like this picture as much as I did. I found it easy because I saw it in the list of the top 25 controversial movies of all time. It does not look particularly great. I'm so glad that it is one of the most captivating composite movies of recent memory. <br /> <br /> This is about twenty years old woman who wants to know everything. He collects a large archive, he saves every bit of information. She experimented with the experience of gender, political activism, and human relationships. Meanwhile, the film crew is producing the film and we saw their reaction story and each other. Nudity, explicit sex and controversial politics prevented this film from being shown in the US and was confiscated by customs. The film is a descriptive story, but it is a documentary that shows us the story of filmmakers around the world, the fourth wall is broken. This photo is the most directly possible way of making a movie I have ever seen. The film originally worked as a capsule during the liberation war and liberation war of Cydadell in the 1960s. I do not think I want to waste my time with the blue version of this movie, but I really do. This image is a grave treasure. Try once
