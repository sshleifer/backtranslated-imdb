The whole part does not come equal to parts. There is no problem. This movie is a line-up for our most creative creative director of our time and some famous Cast names. Sections have been made around the same theme, "Love in Paris", but the similarity ends there. In fact, considering the nature of the theme from all these different managers, it is amazing that we still think we are still seeing the same movie. No widespread endeavor has been to introduce it to a comprehensive whole. There are many ingredients in this buffet, I'm happy that nobody has tried to keep their single dishes.
