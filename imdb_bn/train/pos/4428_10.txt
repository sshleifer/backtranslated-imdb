I would like to completely disagree with other comments related to this movie. Because the visual effects complement the supernatural themes of the film and do not stop from the plot, I love how much this action was against the Crouching Tiger because at this time there was no string attached to the action of the sword and most of the time you could see the action closed. <br /> <br /> I think Western listeners will be very confused with two scenes, one of which is trying to burn a monk alive and says to the villagers that it is the end of the world. The mentioned scenes are derived from some interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist texts (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and another scene discusses a joke on the Japanese calendar ... again people think that the world will end up ... Have fun, stories and visions to make the audience fun. I firmly believe that with some efficient editing it can be sold in the US. One of my accusations in the last battle scene (I'm not sorry, I can not give anything).
