What a great movie! It's very scary, great acting, good writing, nice plot twists, interesting characters, a very good look, and a fantastic finish that will smile on your face. It's a pop starring sparkle that may not be objectionable to non-awful fans, but still (though still) one of the best thrillers there! I highly recommend it to fans only: <br /> <br /> 1) Horror genre <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> **** **** elderly <br /> <br /> <br /> I am sick and tired compared to this, and other horror films including Scrum. Yes, they do not want to be like scrambles. Everyone like "Oh, they're scrap copies!". Well, if I do not get it wrong, copy other movies in the script too! In fact, almost every previous movie is a copy of a previous one. Scam, however, had a good film. But, still ... stop comparing and enjoy it for it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
