I grew up watching this series. I was about seven or eight years old when I was. I still think the 1st episode was known as "The New House". It will be terrible! I can still hear that idol around, crazy smile. And last, O my God! Kids come home to sleep well! It was the classic TV and it was one of a kind series. I found a DVD collection for sale on the Internet: 2 actually. Any questions to my readers: Has anyone bought this set? It's a bootleg. Both sellers have a very good copy of the claim. I have a sketch of "The New House" episode and poor DVD, and a few more episodes are good, but if someone knows whether it is more clear, it would be valuable to me to buy and share with me. Kids. A great series, cute, scary and bravely supernatural. Thanks to any fans who have been down among these - actually, I want to discuss it. Chris Walker
