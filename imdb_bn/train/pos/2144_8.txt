A sweet and completely charming movie, will we dance? Make me smile and cry In the first appearance, Sujeema-San was not very objectionable - an offender paid, perhaps dedicated to her family, but it is very easy to face a window. The objects of his passion are remote and cold. But at the end of the film, I love him, his wife, daughter and all the dancing instructors and dancers. This extravagant story of transformation and renewal is a little gem that I would enjoy watching again.
