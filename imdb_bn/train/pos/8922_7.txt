The only significant feature of this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first major acting role. <br /> <br /> Take a look at McQueen's talent and the raw little science-fearing piece is fresh but refreshingly honest. Steve shows himself as an anti-assassment, a hot rod car loving actor, which will become a polished icon of the film industry for just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen used to say that he hated this picture and "he was a blob". But everyone has to start somewhere and the blob is beautiful, fresh and innocent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> And Steve McQueen is very happy to be the king of Cool and seeing Anita Krosaut before being the girlfriend of AndyTers. A close friend sent me a few minutes ago and this is a stored addition to my Steve McQueen film collection.
