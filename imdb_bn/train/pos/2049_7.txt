This movie is quite beautiful, but at least I give it credit to give some character for its policies. The film has some great moments and there are some great moments along with dialogue. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's not just that good at all, but the compound is not bad at all. <br /> <br /> Tom
