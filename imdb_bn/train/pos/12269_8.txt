Four macho venture in a remote woodland area to find roughly boys and three sexy gals to search for a rear. The Hottle Quaid Group crazy Vietnam veteran Jesse (an effective vague illustration of Alberto Mejia Baron), who surprisingly does not take kindly to any strangers in his territory. Director / Co-writer Pedro Gallindo III relates to a strong motion story, creates a good deal of nervous sensational tension and provides fairly graphic graphics with slices set of brutal killings (slicing a nasty throat and a hand as a specific glam splator highlights Blow off with a shotgun rate). Efficient customs perform well, especially as Pedro Fern√°ndez's excellent, human drama, Edith Gonzalez Astrologer Alejandra, Charlie Valentino tragic Charlie and antagonist Jarac Morrisio as the fennel of tono. Better yet, supply some tasty eye candy by wearing both delicious blonde Marisol Santacruz and lovely brunette Adriana Vega skimpy bathing suit. The Antonia de Undara shiny, impressive painter, exciting Sylvain Scenery, Strong, Crude, Growing Score, Well-developed Characters of Pedro Plasenia, and Continuous TimetTremimatize the running time of the 76 minute running time. Awesome / Action hybrid winner.
