This movie is a riot. I can not remember that there was so much time in movies. I've seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are quite funny. But this wall is the great line wall. I think the best in in the end is the film that I'm so hard and so much cheerful Finally, the film was not stopped when they cleaned up the 5-minute sensitive plot. Otherwise it is a constant tie in a liners and fools situations. I want to watch it again before leaving the theater because it's like zooker movies where you will not get all the jokes for the first time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> that. All the characters are great. This is not like the movie of Adam Sandler, where he tries to be fun, and everyone else suffers around him and the joke of jokes. I think I'll remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all very fond of. No victim of this movie Also, thanks to God, 45-year-old actress to play her girlfriend! Catherine Keaneer played her and she is a sweetheart in this film. You just wish women like her really exist. She is not "10" like other leading women, but in other ways her smile is more warm than Julia Roberts's overdight. <br /> <br /> If you see the trailer of this movie you can not think too much of it. I assure you, the trailer does not do justice to it. They do not give all the good joke. Just something medium. <br /> <br /> Oh and more than one thing. I hope the critics put this on their top ten list. Many of them complained that comedy is not recognized by them and at the end of the year they do not list them. This means you Ebert!
