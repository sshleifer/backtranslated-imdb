*** 1/2 Scarlett Johnson, Woody Allen, Hugh Jackman, Yan Maksen, Romola Garia Directed by Woody Allen. After working with "Match Point" with Johanson, "Scoop" came back two for a korki, Johnny, and funny comic side. When a student reporter (Johnson) finds a new scope from a dead journalist (Mackenzie), he enters the material of a witch (Allen). The new TERT card killer's scup in London may be Prepered Peter Lyman (Jackman); When Sandra and Sid are playing a detective, Sandra was a murderer for love in Sunderbela. Alan has finally hit a mark as well as "Mark Point" but definitely more fun. I laughed a lot more than expected, one year must be seen
