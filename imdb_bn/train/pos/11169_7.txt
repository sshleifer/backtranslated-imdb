When I first saw the movie, I used to think that it was not boring because nothing was happening, but when all the scary events started to happen, when the church dies and life comes back and Gage and her mother are dead and there is a fool to bring her to Be careful and ignore justice, yet he returns to their lives. This is not the best work of Steven Kings. I thought his best work was burning. I do not think it is wrong to comment on how terrible the people have seen this movie because they think what they think. That person can do a good job of making a horrific flick. I make the gauze bad and how talent he is to kill the jou. The most innocent of the killers is the coolest making the most unclear character. Those who do not like the movie are stupid because it's a horror movie and nothing happens. Do not expect anything from a movie that it is not. It was still not good in a common area. I still recommend people to watch the movie
