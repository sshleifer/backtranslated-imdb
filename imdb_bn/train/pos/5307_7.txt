"Packer" A young Baltimore, unknown photographer who has become a great star among the public, the media and local figure shows the filthy reality of the human body, such as the dirty underwear throughout his life. It is a common issue of John Waters' basmati-based independent comedies, that the strange aspects of American citizenship are to discover the backgrounds of the political accuracy of fashion and conservative backlash by searching the backgrounds of middle-class society in their own villages. <br /> <br /> "Terminator 2" starring Edward Farlung Picker, Christina Ricci, photographer Syndi Sherman, legendary Patricia Harst and Water's longtime actress Minogue Chor. Although the plot of the plot sometimes becomes a big mistake and the water's bright "serial mother" can not compete with the rapid and agitated joke attack, but it still has some good smiles and some unforgettable scenes such as ex-junky-girl, who from a vegetable dish Beans become fond of vegetarianism ... "Packer" shows the pride of the art scene, media hype, mid Erotic wealth and how it does not feel a great comedy about the strange way of becoming pop stars. . Recommended!
