I did not see Richard Thomas playing a bad guy. I'm not sure I would love him like this. And I was not sure he could drag it. But this surprised me. He sent shivers up my spine and caused me to be a close look at people in the streets. The movie is engrossing and fast paced. Bruce Davison is convincing but all he can really play is a wonderful guy. Here is the real talent Thomas. The end was a little tedious, but perhaps that guy would fight ... if you're a Thomas fan, he must definitely see his worst condition!
