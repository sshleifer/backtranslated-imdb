It is amazing that a good, though not surprisingly, the film was brought back in the early nineties, the full franchise could increase. 'Stargate; SG1 ', without any doubt, has an appropriate combination of science fiction genre and the right to stand on the shoulders with' Star Trek '. <br /> <br /> The 1994 Star Stargate Command (a military / science organization) found that the stigarette system can be used to travel across and all galaxies from outside and military forces form several groups. . Explore A group led by Colonel Jack O'Elay of the SG1 military, and archaeologist Dr. Daniel Jackson, military scientist Captain Samantha Carter and Alien Tylak, who betrayed his senior leaders in the hope of releasing his one-day man. The world quickly creates an enemy of Goyoud, a Gentile nation who uses humans as a host and thinks themselves equal to God. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Richard Dean Anderson is perfect as captivating and satirical O'Neill, who can move fiercely from the boyish in the eye glow of an eye. Michael Shanks, Daniel, came with the desire of steel and heart of character, who became bolder and more rigid-cats in public eyes, the program progressed. Amanda Tipper, like Carter, portrays feminism in her character, she was not a strong, intelligent military scientist. Christopher Judge is as nice as the supernatural Tealc, who is able to draw the character's emotions with subtlety. And Don S. Davis is perfect as a respected General Hammond, who goes ahead with a good balance of integrity and firmness. <br /> <br /> Almost all episodes are involved and illustrated with intelligence, moral conflicts as well as friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through the arguments between O'Neill and Jackson). Guest characters are not well-portrayed and the story arcs do not bore the audience that is not conducted in a manner. SG1 also excels in ridiculous, epicodes from O'Neill's wisecracks that are just helpless and weird! In SG1, everything from romance to drama is hidden in hearty scenes of death. This is not just an excellent science-fi show, but a wonderful display as a whole.
