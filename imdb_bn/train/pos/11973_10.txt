The flower house is a wonderful sitcom, about a dad, Danny Tanner, whose wife died in a car accident. So Danny asked her eldest, JC Katspolis and best friend Joey Gladstone to help her three daughters, Donna Joe 'DJ' tanner, Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner. This is my favorite show sometimes, and I can see it all day. And some in the flower house always laugh at me and have sad parts too. There is not a dull moment in the full house. In the lead, Bob Saguat (Danny Tanner), John Stamos (Jesse Catspolis), Dave Coolier (Joey Gladstone), Kandes Cameron (DJ Tanner), Jodie Mitin (Stefani Tanner), and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle Tanner) .
