In the Spring of Spring 2002, "The Rookie" seemed to be "Best for the last !!!!!" with a Disney live action film at the end of an era of US era. It was here in Texas! Indeed, this story started in West Texas, as it was proven by a sign in the area found in a sign. It was about a high school trainer, who was so convinced by his high-ranking baseball team that he decided to become a professional !!!!! <br /> <br /> What I liked about this movie: it was very nice !!! !! This is a very good sports movie, Ala "The Matte's Doc" trilogy. It also took movigos across Texas, from Panhandle and El Paso to Metropolix (where I live) everywhere. I can say because I recognized Ballpark ("Arlington's Ballpark"; now it's "America Region")! The last part of Disney's "Golden Age" was nice to see here in my area !!!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Started with the mouse ... and it ended with baseball.
