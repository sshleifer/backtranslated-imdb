Compared to an entertaining and original movie, non-stop "Lola Run Run". The film quickly develops in a retreat order, through which visitors learn about three main characters through Flashback and Daybreak sequences. The back does not work as a quick climax, but a journey that makes most of the film. During "Run" we characterized the characters growing and passing about their harmful lives, about the role of "macho" forgotten, and finally they forgot why they started moving in the first place. Similar to the war giving a "transparency" to the characters of "Fight Club", this gives the characters of this movie away from the false values ​​that we all allow society to create for us. They work as a way to taste life from their real curious perspective and find some level of transparency and happiness in these three processes. <br /> <br /> My gratitude and gratification only slightly wigged at the end of the film, instead of learning from their experience, the characters who think that the wrong macho role played by the characters pretending to lie on them, thinks that they have fled from their journey. . <br /> <br /> However, the only true problem of this movie was not delivered very fast outside of Japan.
