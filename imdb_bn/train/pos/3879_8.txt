A usually clogen film, but then again it is not ideal. Clauson wrote, moderated and played a leading role. It's a great movie that tries to make the normal living of normal living. 4 primary actors were fantastic. <br /> <br /> Fritz Helmut was a believer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are problems and those who do not believe they are being happy. But nothing does come well, they have to fight for winning their life and love.
