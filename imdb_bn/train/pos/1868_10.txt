This film describes the life of someone who grew up in the worst situation, but unlike many people, he actually grew up as a respected person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Fountain of Antovone was so innocent and still misused because he was not white. Antwone Fisher has married the same woman for the same ten years and has almost fooled women, coke, cigars, weeds, alcohol, or any other thing where she was growing up. <br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this movie. The only rating I can give it a 10/10.
