Paul (Jason Lee) is an Undersea who is involved only with a princess called Karen (Selma Blair). She chose her clothes and her daily schedule. In his bachelor party, Paul becomes a little drunk and in no way takes a beautiful dancer named Becky (Julia Styles) to his dignity. They say, "nothing has happened", but the two will wake up on the same bed. Suddenly Karen Telefon. He is on his way to Paul's apartment. It is understood, Paul has been left behind from Beres Hessels, although his underpants are left behind. But, there is more fun ahead. At a family dinner at Karen's parents' house, Paul again kisses Baqui, a disciple of Karen's cousin. Speak to explain something! But, instead, Paul likes to awaken a stomach problem and likes to hide in the bathroom. Will Keane ever find out that Buckie stayed at Paul's place in the night? And what will be the result? I'm sorry for the movie pan critics like this. For this photo fresh and fun, they should definitely be light-up. Of course, Lee is a funny person, styling is an attractive beauty, or it's not a nice but natural form like an ankle. The rest of the cast with James Broulin and Julie Haggerty are also wonderful. The appearance of the film look wonderful, such as clothing and California settings. Best of all, the script is fantastic and inspired, making great smiles for the audience. In short, if you want to preserve the funny funny words, get this movie tonight. It may not be an Academy Award material, but it is absolutely sure to turn a bad day into a good condition.
