What other critics called the lack of character development, I call understatement. The film could not shake the head with ovarodsplanation or unnecessary backstory. Yes, there were many wonderful stories we just got a glimpse of, but it was initially a snapshot of an event that changed the life of all the characters. Henry Thomas's work was a really nice study about the ability to act, which focuses on feedback rather than action. Good rental
