It was a bit wicked and bad and I enjoyed it, the characters of the ceremony were also good and praised each other. I was sorry to see it cut .. I would like to see where I could go. Sheriff was more secret than anyone you found yourself looking at Lucas Baq. Lucas was awful and alluring. And I got to see him more and how his character was. But I want to buy the show to enjoy, something amazing on the TV. And Caleb's cousin Pazy Turco, where he wanted to explain in Lucas and was a great mystery. It's not embarrassing, it's still not around .. or if not finished, I'd love to see what happened.
