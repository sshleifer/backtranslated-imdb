Masayuki Suu, who has managed this fine film, is playing a role. The beautiful "fancy dance" and classic (college in Japan, in college) comedy "Siko Foonjtata", Suo successfully followed suit with his successful steps. <br /> <br /> The story is compelling. Both of us are often laughing (Nato is very lively, because he is in the previous two films) and actually the original for the character. But the big bonus to me shows that this movie gives Japan's real life in the Japanese society - to the audience. Suo has a knack to show real-life activities with recreational flash. As a result, a movie that will drag you, laugh at you, think you and both will entertain you and give insights into today's Japan.
