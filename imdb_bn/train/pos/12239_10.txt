Excellent Fars! Which, of course, it is intended to be all. Thankfully, there is no social or political message there, or there is little effort in that direction. Can the plot actually take, or have a specific time or position taken? Unexpectedly, finally, this is not just a film and film from fantasy but from spring movies, reality. The only aim of this movie is entertainment, of course educating and entertaining it, jumping in the air with delight and lightly. I think from most of the documentaries we hope to be enlightened and authentic. But for entertaining, I am describing today as "no-brainer", which is the mother language game in all cases. Imagine a few chuckles and a straight smile now and then, these fine fares.
