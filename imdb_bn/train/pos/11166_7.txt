George Rafter, like Steve Brady, who is indifferent, gambling gambling who can never refute courage, is suppressed against the long, sensitive, Chuck Connors (Wallace Bewary). A soft touch for every panhandler, Connors definitely receives orphaned strings, especially the fleeing orphans, "Swipes" (Jackie Cooper, complete with cats!) And homeless Lucy Calhoun, a foolish writer who became a writer. <br /> <br /> In this male-dominated culture, most of the communications happen in the form of violence (one sees why Bauer Martin Schorsch's is favorite). Bursting cigar provides an ongoing push. "Sweeps" threw stone through Chinatown windows, and one day the laundry ultra set. (Brady and Bir's volunteer both came together as an explosion due to the arrival of the building, causing the building to burn on the ground.) Berry unexpectedly destroys an annoying girl and disagrees with Brody, with whom he is defeated, in one of the boxing fights repeated in the evening In the fight, to jump back to his salon control, Brody was able to jump from Brooklyn Bridge Can not lose courage (Brody jumps, but only fails due to a loss with a dummy at the last moment.) <br /> <br /> Naturally, Walsh fills the frame in detail in detail, which describes the daily life of TenderLine; Prisoners from Voice Waiter, Bullying Burmese, Suicide Hall, have entered black Maria, facing the unheeded hiccas on the door and forced to buy the suit they want to buy. A small but pretty small film.
