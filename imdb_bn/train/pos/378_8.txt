This day Spielberg's "The Color Purple" is mostly thought to be nominated for Eleven Oscars and the Winner District. Spieberg was not even nominated as the best director. Not saying, filmmakers were more acclaimed than them. <br /> <br /> This story is concerned about the trials and tribulations of Seli Johnson (Hypie Goldberg), the African-American woman dominated her first time by her father and then by her humiliating husband. The film has spread for several years and often focuses on women's relations with women. It has been specifically told from a female perspective, but you need to fear that it's a celebrated 'chick flick'. <br /> <br /> The story is an interesting subject, but sometimes with the humor, it is the most important of the central character. Some people can not praise the vowel change at the end of the movie, but I do not think the content of less movies will roll my eyes. <br /> <br /> Three Oscar nominations were received for the film to be played. : Hupi Goldberg (Best Actress), Oprah Winfrey (Best Supporting Actress) and Margaret Avili (Best Supporting Actress). I think Goldberg and Winfrey were certainly worthy and Danny Glover was unjustified. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, Spielberg has not received the best director nomination for his efforts. Such a begging beggar believes, because of the top notch in the direction of Spielberg here. I'm not particularly crazy about the score of Quincy Jones, but this is no less than average in any way. Finally, the story is satisfactory, a handpicked film maker from a Pulitzer. Award winning element. Try it out and you'll probably get blurred because I can do so bad at the Oscar night.
