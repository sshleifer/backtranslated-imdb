I understand this movie as an anointing feature and thus it is very impressive. Although it is a feeling of "true indie" and pacing, director Tod Eeelin is definitely photographer and editorial vision, a mature and experienced professional order and judge. The shots are well-framed and serve to move out and move stories ahead. He, and the photographer Ivan Solomon, provided a story that is generally more deeper than the type "scripts" type scripts and lyricists. This is a story that requires a shot for the talented work of Jude Hirsh's character. The jute is as pretty as normal; Such as Scott Cohen and the beautiful Susan Floyd. The real wonder though Eliot Court who played Adam Groden. Yellin was able to submerge a role of young actors who could easily be devalued by stereotype or overreach. However, I found that the film is refreshing and entertaining.
