White Man + progress + industrialization = BAD. First race + nature + animals = good. Easy formula In fact, in the past, the same campaign was used to protect the situation; Now it is used to attack. Anyway, who says, I think this film succeeds in achieving confidence in the politics of hackneyedness because it appeals to everyone on freedom and real nature themes. You can not get close to the junk reorganization of the film that won the West. But since the horses can be released in the western plain, then anyone can feel the lasting feeling for the day. (The film could easily bring the white white man out there because there was no horse in America). However, I like it. Animation quality - especially the opening shot - incredible.
