If you have any kind of praise for character and dialogue and there is no sense of American cultural history, then you get plenty of drying material in this film. It was probably a game, and for that reason the dialogue was heavy, but I can not stress enough just how a shallow understanding of these icons made in complex and surprising characters. <br /> <br /> This movie is better than a college course to tell you to create a character-driven story. <br /> <br />
