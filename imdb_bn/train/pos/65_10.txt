This picture is not just about a school shooting, it's actually not even seen. But that just adds to the power of this film. About humans and how they deal with tragedy. I know that it has been shown to those who had survived the Colombian shooting and it gave them a sense of closing for many. Acting fantastic Three main actors (Bassi Phillips, Erica Christensen and Victor Garber) are excellent in their role ... I highly recommend this movie. A movie about it that you see after it talks about it. It discusses not only the school shooting but also the response to all forms of human emotion and tragedy. It is a tier-zarker but it is well worth it and I will see time and time again
