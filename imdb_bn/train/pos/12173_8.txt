First fast 'shut up!' Those who say this movie stinks. 'Citizen Why' hopes every movie can not go. It was actually a fun movie. Jason Lee Everything he is good at. The only flaw in this movie is, I do not think there was enough chemistry between Lee and Julia Styles. They should be dwelled that more. Without that, good fun in the movie. Selma Blair needs to eat something. She worries me. But she's still looking pretty So yes, I recommend this movie for fun on a date or light Saturday afternoon. See. <br /> <br /> Writing: ** **** of 1/2
