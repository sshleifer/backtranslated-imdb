This is a nice star and an excellent movie with some great acting. I do not tire watching it. I especially love the scene where Danny Glover's character and Kevin Clayne's character Simon and Mac have a bunch together. Kevin Kline is so natural and it seems that his methods are useless and you'll often encounter. So it's a very 'real' movie. <br /> <br /> One of the most powerful scenes in the movie, when Simon came to the beginning of the movie, Mac's car was broken. The film also has a strong message and unlike a movie-carrying stereootic message, where a person promotes his frustration with the audience. Instead, the emotions and situations of the actors provide an influential message that is good without using words. And finally Mary McDonald is always bright.
