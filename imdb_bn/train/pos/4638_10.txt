I saw this movie when I was in Israel for the summer. My Hebrew is not important, so the subtitles were very useful, I was not lost in the movie at any time. You tend to use subtitles after 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> This movie has blown me up !!!!!! It depicts two prominent tabos in today's Middle East: gay relations between an Israeli and Palestinians. It allows you to enter both areas of conflict with a person. Doubt, passion wished. When the anger and fury drives lovers to an extremist party, the film reaches the tragedy! An absolute must be seen !!
