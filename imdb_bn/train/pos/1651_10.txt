When I was originally promoted in 1988, I saw the PBS presentation in the United States (?). Miniseries is available in the supposed DVDs I bought the first version of the three books last year. Since then, I have been searching for a series of Internet Movie sites. Today I have not found this web site. I'll leave the search. <br /> <br /> I also want to buy this whole - 26 episodes - miniseries. After reading the DVD, I read every book, then see the episodes for that book. What I did with John Laker's Cara Trilgie and Larry McCarty's Texas Range Trilogy is that. <br /> <br /> Do you have any suggestions for a great book or book series that are very good TV Miniseries - or movie series - now that DVD is available?
