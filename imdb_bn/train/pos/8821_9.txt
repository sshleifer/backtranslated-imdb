The question is, can this movie really be considered as a "bad" movie? My husband and I chose this for only 99 cents used in the video store, and because of the title, the word "Western Pictures" was in the box (westerner has always been regarded as the quality sign since the beginning), the legendary movie "Saberia" and "Class of 1984" ). We were not expecting a movie as a completely as a movie. Your basic plot is as follows: Grenz, the Gombsacci bang from Earth's planet, looted "in the moon bank" and on a remote planet (I do not remember the name of the planet) punishes the colony and other minerals. The "governor" of the colony and the mine owners are exploiting laborers for the owners. Walker, a monster hunter (apparently only three of the entire planet) reminds the prisoners that there is no escape, because the entire planet has only one shuttle and they want to deal with it. Then the unnamed "colonel", a retired brutal hunter who suffers from a hunting rehabilitation nightmare. Most movies play "future" cars with explosions (dunkys with slim pails). The planet itself looks suspiciously similar to the outside of the Hamet, CA or other dusty internal empires. But the film is really brilliant, with a wonderful soundtrack featuring a few El Punk Bands of the 80s. I suspect that this soundtrack was ever implanted in Vainl, but it is definitely worth buying movies for soundtracks. I can not remember the name of the exposing white Mrs. Band Band (they are listed in the credits), because I heard what I heard before this movie, but I certainly see it. <br /> <br /> Basically, film is certainly not a waste of your time and Beer best with 12 packs and some of your closest friends.
