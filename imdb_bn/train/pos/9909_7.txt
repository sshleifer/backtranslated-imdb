A serious comedy. Hunt-produced version of France "Les JÃ³s de la Famille" (later "Americanization as a Very Rich Women") Plus, good throwing, sometimes funny ... and unfortunately the word. A rich widow of California, who feels her money bitter, two elderly, greedy daughters, who are both afraid, spend their heritage helplessly in their death. A very important thing - but the old woman sent her to a rest house against her will and subsequently the court was pleased to plead herself with the case, the sensitive material for a trick (and its credits, director David Lowell's wealthy) does not overload the picture with crass gags or clear feelings). Some humor is slightly broad and does not work, yet Rosalind Russell understands the underlying gravity of this scenario and does not hit a false note. Sandra Deo is good as Rosaline's grandson, and James Fontino is very charming as a young lawyer. The film has so much to say about the importance of our elderly and ways to spend the rest of my time, that "Rosie!" Its seriousness is gradually lost in the happy end. The picture lets you laugh - and at the same time wonders how old women were never very lucky. *** *** to ***
