French Nuyet brothers did nothing, they had a video camera on which the tragedy occurred. They were at building # 2, when you saw the papers decreasing, people were jumping from the height to the ground. <br /> <br /> I mean, when both buildings collapse they continue, their cameras were still going on, when the white dust covered them, they opened a shop door and came out, but these footage is real and I think they did a great job for us. <br /> <br /> Ten stars go to Nawdat brothers that I see this awesome movie 9/11, so that I will never forget what I forget about this country. I think if I think right, it shows the first death of the firefighter, when he is carrying the church and his honorary funeral.
