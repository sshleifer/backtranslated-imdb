Everyone will see this movie absolutely! It's scary, but it does not support "things-at-a-do-not-as-array-e-pass-in-off-non-draari" items. It's really great. Watch this freaking awesome movie !!! Director Stanley Kubrick, the greatest director who lives easily. One of the best colleagues in each of his movies, including this one. Shining is about this family, which acts as a caretaker for the winter and takes a bath in a hotel in Colorado Roxy. The house is frustrating. Child psychic Husband is easily influenced by the evil spectacular hotel, and ... well ... hilait mindset !!!! Not really. It becomes this chatter thriller where the viewers are thrown in the viewer from different directions and it becomes scary. Not just classic, "Johnny here" scene. It's memorable, but can not speak for the whole movie. This is a subject where words do not adequately explain and you can see it. So go on Netflix, and get it! GEEEEEETTTTTTT ITTTTTTTT !!!!!!!
