It's a very weird film by director / animation Richard Williams. Everyone who knows about William's work knows that it's a bit off-cutter (if not impressive) but it takes a cake. <br /> <br /> It has two unexpected ragdolls that protect their owner's new French doll from being lasers. Find yourself in the mercy of various bizarre characters along with pirate toys and paths. The power of this movie is basically located in its aesthetic quality; Contrast in contrast to its curious character design, its powerful animation, and sweet and scary. Williams's brilliant animation portrays the real angry dolls, flopps, and darnds instead of the general cartoon version of Raggedi Ann and Andy Doll, which has made it more credible (at least in a visible sense). Animation brings us with Camell-The-Rinkleld-Connie, whose body is running with two different personalities in each side, Sir Leonard Lonnie and undoubtedly pursuing silent film with greedy. <br /> <br /> Greedy animation, myself, probably the most subtle psychedelic animation I've ever seen. There's something about this animation that just creates your jaw drops - and it's something new every second. Thinking of "Tuffy Peet", greedy is a huge blubber who lives and undoubtedly eats sweets. He is singing a song that I can not help but feels some sexual behavior, then his cadie tries to kill Raggedi Ank for the heart. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that many songs It continuously drops below the motion of the film because they have SIXTEEN. There are about six good songs (which should be the only one) "I see, and what do I see?", "No girl's toys", "blue" (though she did not need to sing twice), "I'm never enough" "Because I love you" and maybe "I'm home." Others seem to be unnecessary and are not very surprising to listen to the truth. <br /> <br /> This is a weird movie about strange practice, but you will not get better if you are looking for it.
