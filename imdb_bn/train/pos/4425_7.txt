Modern Japanese directors try to redefine another mantle style. Successful, no, in different degrees. <br /> <br /> A Buddhist monk has a philosophy that he wants to kill a legendary (and very active) giant in Gozo Bridge to acquire knowledge. Although not on the front, Buddhist thought is like the heart of this movie, "Run" of Kurusawa. Perhaps it was near the "Rune league" movie though it was the most interesting to me. <br /> <br /> Stylish visual direction and gorgeous photography movie is mostly kept attractive for two hours and eighteen minutes. The lead actors are equally impressive. The music is really good. Two weakness stories and war scenes. Some of the movies which drags into the middle of it may be corrected by the educative editing. And war scenes are mostly portrayed in the biliary close-ups. It works for most movies but it seems like the ultimate deception. Another recent film, Tuhey Harak's "Seven Torch", a great movie but the promised war scene is frustrating. The coming of the monster is not going to force the monster to the sword, his performance is great but he will become extra in the scene of a traditional Champa war. <br /> <br /> Good movie, you'll probably see it interesting. Hope to fight the traditional sword.
