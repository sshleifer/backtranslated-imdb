This is a really funny (and sexy) film - it's not just stupid but the actress is superb. This is a movie where characters are so entertaining that you think you are connected to everyone in the theater. I have seen this at the Boston Film Festival, and I have often found a lot of laughter with others, and it has been removed in even more serious parts of the film. It's a unique film about two doctors, and I do not want to give anything, but some really powerful scenery as well as really funny - plus dialogue is also great. Wood Harriss's character is a unique relationship with Joe Saladana, and Brian White and Mia play their role in funny and sexy. If you see a chance to get it - go - you will not be disappointed. It's worth seeing again. Wood Harris receives an award.
