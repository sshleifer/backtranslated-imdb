Kolchak Sheer Entertainment Great story and a great throw and nothing else to weigh it. Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience with him. Simon Oakland, Jack Greenidge and Ruth McDevitt gave McGuivin strong support that most prominent actors only dream of having. Some gorgeous guest stars add color and veves to individual episodes - Eric Estrada of Terror, Phil Silvers in Heroes in Hurts, Antonio Fergus in The Zumbone. It is easy to see how Kolchak went to create a X-Batch file to see how a boy saw Chris Carter. Darren - RIP. Simon - RIP Ruth - RIP.
