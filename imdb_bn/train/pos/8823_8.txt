good picture. An elderly fantasy story tells us how we are trapped in social situations and what kinds of extreme steps should be treated differently. Or at least feeling: if you want to break, then every rule will break. If you do not know how to express love for someone, then how does pressure create pressure without creating social pressure? Also, about the fascination of deciding on the cultural life of others, we have some sort of culture cut off in our throats. Give Disney or Fox or suicide bombers the right to determine what we like. One morning it is not allowed to drink coffee. We have heard NRJ screams even though we have morning coffee, to see stupid tabloid title and street commercial advertisements?
