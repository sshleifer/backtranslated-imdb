Of course, one of the best British movies, not one of the best films ever made. Playing scripts, cinematography, direction and a class of their own. This film works so many levels. So why tape it, DVD is completely unavailable. Never show on TV? Why is it kept hidden regularly at the National Film Theater in London?
