It has been said that Dina had discovered the durabeen teen. This was the first one to be the best film. The ridiculous story gives the 14-year-old Dinah a nice beautiful look with a beautiful voice, which is divided into family by being divorced as "Miss Fictit". For the summary of the plot, look at other IMDB entries, but Diana quickly and her two older sisters plan to prevent her father from going back to Switzerland from Switzerland to the United States. Sisters, with excellent extravagance and great editing as well as editing, especially with Barbara Reid and Nan Gray, the film makes an impression even on the next look. Among the three songs of Dinar, "E.L.Bashiai" comes from classical repeater, but when he sings in the police station scene, the history of the film is confirmed. At least it was for this audience, who lived with both religious and classical music at 15 years of age. One of the most beautiful touches that covers all the three smart girls, is the short spark of a drunk, which stretches his neck for the ultimate glimpse of the fin, the police push him! An unfortunate result of the success of this film was that the next writer of remote vehicles was locked in the "Miss Fuxet" theme, which quickly became crippled. Dena has never done herself. As an actress, her trick is more suspicious than her charisma, which she certainly was. I think that like the personality of many other movies, he replaced "naturalism" for the sophisticated capacities of his lack. Good thing for doing 21 feature films.
