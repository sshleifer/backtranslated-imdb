"Hundstage" Silad's first fiction film (previously he referred to great documentaries as "animal love" or "model"). Seidl has been working on this project for more than 3 years but it costs about $ 2 million. Actors are very good, especially non-professional actors who have played almost themselves. Cinematography is also good. The whole movie is frustrating and some scenes can be a lot more for the "ordinary" viewers. This movie shows many sexes and violence but people are not able to communicate with each other. Finally I want to say that this is one of the best and most rewarded Austrian films in the past years. Forgive me bad English. <br /> <br />
