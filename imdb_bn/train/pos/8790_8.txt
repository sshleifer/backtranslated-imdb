Funny movie I saw this movie at the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Film Festival in 2002, and the sunny from the beginning to the end Acting was fine but very funny. I'm not quite sure about the "real world" effect, we did not find it here, but the film did not show the burden of the show. Heather B steals every part of his visible scene, especially when his red co-star of very few conversations. Highly recommended. I would like to see some time to be released from video / DVD in the future.
