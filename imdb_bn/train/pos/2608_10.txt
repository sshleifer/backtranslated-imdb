The final season of rosanna was a roller coaster ride on the rails. This final episode fixes the previous opinion, it tells us that we do not know the characters we know as much as we thought. Rojon returned to the season and told us that this event was his presentation of his life. In this final episode he said that he changes as seen in changes in events and people. Scott was not really with Lyon, but he existed. Marc and David married opposite wives in real life, and Dan died when he was alive. The incident happened in his life, he changed his writing to them. We all are not willing to do what we can do. Do not we have a moment that we just want to use an eraser and change our preferences. What did he do with this episode? And for another comment I would say that I do not feel cheated, the family was real in my mind, they changed in the way that events happened in their lives. Display A + End + A Show !!!!
