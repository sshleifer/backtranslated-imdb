Lion King Hamlet had a Disney version, but Lion King 3: Disney's version of Hakuna Mata Guildenstein and Rosendorf's dead Like Tom Stoppard's early movie, we can see the steps from the real two perspective: Timon, Mirkat broke the song in a hat and broke, warthog with flatulence problem. Rather than Simba, following their stories - we can see why Simba presented the life of all the animals from Pride Rock. To find out what we decided to follow Timon Simba back to Pride Rock to remove Timon and Pumbaa Scar. And we find out how they behaved together and with Hena. Nathan Lane as Timon best drama, but he is supported by Arnie Savella as Pumbaa. Matthew Broderick and Hooper Goldberg are better to reiterate their role. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stillar lend their two new letters to their individual voices: Timon's mother and uncle. The only negative constant stop-start-rewind-fast-forward device that does not always help to improve the story. Saying, there is a bright zoom at the beginning of the movie. With more smile than any other 3D-D-Disney-series film, Hakuna Mata is valuable to look at - if it seems to be just a little hot for the scene, it's funny.
