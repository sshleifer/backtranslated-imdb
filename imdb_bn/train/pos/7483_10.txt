Vanilla Sky is a 2001 remake of Abre Los Ozos (Open Use Aij), a 2001 film. And in my opinion, a lot more human and psychological versions. Tom Cruise David Aames, who plays a selfish egomaniac, does not like other people's emotions for the mind, and only thinks himself. Jason Lee Brian Shelby plays David's best, and in many ways only friends. Penelope Cruz Sovia Serna, Brian's girlfriend, who plays with David's birthday party. Cameron Diaz plays David's friend Julie Gyinyi in bed. David interviewer psychologist said. Curtis McCabe played Kurt Russell. Their all interaction and their consequences make Vanilla Sky one of the most emotional and complex thrillers ever made. I will not explain the plot anymore, because it is much more compulsory, less you know. Avoid all people who are very confusing to follow this image. If you pay attention, you will not be confused. The film is very complex, but not confusing. And in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made is one.
