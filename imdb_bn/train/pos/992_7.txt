I had no hope; I never heard of Jamie Fox; I knew there was some strong character actor in this film. I thought it was extremely entertaining; It was fun. The plot was quite different and unpredictable to hold my interest. To me, Fox is an original one. David Morse is awesome (true, this is not his best role). I thought the contribution of Chess and pyrotechnics film and was well done. I did not expect much and I was pleasantly surprised.
