I can not accept negative comments from other critics. They are very vital, probably because they are stuck in the past. I want to see a comment from a person who never saw Basic Institute 1, perhaps someone is very young? I left the happy movie because I was not going to leave the IMDB critics. After 14 hours I have been trying to find the plot errors but I can not think seriously. See my advice to everyone for yourself and create your mind. <br /> <br /> It follows pattern similar to Basic Institute 1 but plot less confused. It still surprised me but more satisfyingly. Sharon Stone as well as sexy and evil and her 48 years wear extremely well; This remains the role of its definition. David Morris was satisfied though he was not Michael Douglas. Among the supporters, I particularly like David Thulis as a police detective.
