How did I reach it: While watching this series on the cartoon network, I said I did not see anything like that, and it was the best. But when I started collecting VHS series, and after a few years, Bandai's Anim Legends collection included in the DVD section. It's amazing, and really worth looking for. There was a lot of explosion that would blow you away from your seat. And of course, theme songs "Just Communication", and Litam Emotions "were the best. The characters, and gundams: The show was my favorite characters: Hero, Doo, Renaissance, Trey, Lady Ond, Nain, and I like wing Zero, and Epoan and of course Ulton, and sounds like Deathsith I and II. I like this series: This series also tells us that in real life the battles are very difficult and we sometimes win Or Harri But peace can be hard to achieve and I believe that bullying pilots are doing the right things and <br/> <br /> <br /> However this show is really the best, so to stop this review Afterwards, after watching this show you see the movie Endless Waltz.
