This movie was excellent. I did not expect it to live up to all hype but it was not. Like all Bourne films, action is fast, dynamic, and intense. If you like the other two movies in the Trilogy, then you will also like it. The film's plot is straightforward and a plot twist that is very unrealistic. Well, the character Julia Stilus, shown in the Italian Safe House, was very far behind after what happened, but it is understood that she is the only character of "Bradstown", which Bourne knows that she does not want to be dead, and she is likely to believe and only on the right track May be leadership. The actions are driven by the characters and their response to what is happening around them. I always loved Bourne cinema that Bourne could kick Butt but when he encounters the war with the people, he struggles and he has a lot of harm between them. They never deal with viewers like Idiot. <br /> <br /> All actors were firm in their performance. I believe that Dammon could play in Bourne during his sleep, and get great support from Joan Allen's superbness, the rebuilding of David Straithnen and Scott Glen. I recommend this film and triangle. I do not miss Franka Potente though.
