Rachel McAdam. Cillian Murphy Wes Craven Dream team This is one of the best thrillers of 2005. A great plot A great turn A great eye candy. It is one of the greatest Crayon films in the world except "Schemes" and "Elite Street A Nightmare". This could be the best. The plot is one of the best things about movies and it is very easy. Lisa Reicher (McAdam) is a struggling hotel manager, LK returned to the late Red Eye board. He knows Jackson Ripner's number one Jack the Ripper (Murphy). They have a couple of drinks and eventually end up sitting on the plane. Later, he told her that he was a murderer, who was sent to kill the secretariat of Homeland Security resident in Lucas hotel. And this is what Lisa has with. Well, Ripner will not kill his father (Brian Cox) if he can move to the upper suite in his room, then he must be bombed. Bringing twists and stories really gives it extra zing and side characters and the next joke really adds to it. Overall, of course, one of the best thrillers of 2005 is one. Of course valuable to see. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 3 stars
