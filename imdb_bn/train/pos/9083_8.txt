I've enjoyed this movie and all the negative reviews I read before I was going to have very low expectations. I went because I was interested in this concern because some of these posts were so angry with the film and the Koreans. Oh and it came from Korea, which kept some of my favorite movies. I like the host but my favorite favorite. Some of my favorite ciphay / fantasy films that you might feel like: MirrorMaras, Stardust, Serenity, Gottaqa, Willow, Matrix, Resident Evil Series, LOtt, Stargate, Dark City. <br /> <br /> Everybody said it was not confusing and the monsters looked good and the war was great. The story has some holes but does not really matter. I like to pull things out and ask a long time ago to see the blockbuster. The Korean legend was interesting, the resurrection material was different, and I think the main characters are suspiciously dressed as Korean actors in other shows. Ethan (Behr) hair looked so Asian. Yes, it can be better and I hope in the future that Korea, the unusual playful feeling of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity in blockbuster style. Maybe the host and dragon war combination in the future?
