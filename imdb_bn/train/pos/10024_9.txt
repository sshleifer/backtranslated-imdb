There's a lot to see for Eero Tolbukhin. En la mente del asesino (inside the assassin's mind), it is very difficult to talk about it without any warning. Let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in movies but really, really did a good job. It is made with super 8, black and white shot, 35mm, color, interview, flashback. Aro Tolbukhin has created a documentary, such as a vicissarist, that carries you with the most extraordinary view of suspicion that you are abnormally suspicious, did she really exist? The film follows the life of a Hungarian sailor, who works in a religious mission and then kills some people, reaching Hello. A job for which he was caught and sentenced to death. The film started because some French documentaries are interested in this character so that they interview him before his death. Nowadays, more people involve more and deeper research in character. The picture we see is - <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the main part of history, we are being run by a semi-gradient, looking at the inside of the mind, why did he do it mainly to decode Has done. Nevertheless, the important thing is that filmmakers do not give us any direction; They left the trial for all of us and even we can understand his work, we do not justify them fairly. So, the first half is based on recollecting information; Later, as Auro became childhood, this film gives such incredible new strength (not even difficult, weak or annoying). <br /> <br /> I do not want to say - and do not want to - some to loot; So the only thing left to do is, if you get close to this movie then believe me, it is not worth the trip to visit.
