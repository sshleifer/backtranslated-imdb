Hi: <br /> <br /> I heard about missing from a colleague who liked the opinion of entertainment, he liked it. Well I saw an episode or two in the first episode and was bored, so I tuned it out. A few years later I stumbled upon; Bored with the current science fi rent. Wow I was surprised. Can you tell gravity well, I got very shocked. Speed ​​and scripting are very good, some are with flash forward / backlammer characters, but all are well. My favorite character is Ben, Lock, Jacob, Richard Alpert, Syed Zarra, Sayyar, Harley, Daniel Fard, Jean and Wife, Walt, Charlie, Desmond and Jack's father. Jack and Michael are definitely unfamiliar asshats, very spoiled and imperfect. Kate was ranked 1 above them, more than Juliet Kate. If Mr Echo's way is poor and not at the Charlie level, then both of them are very bad. Jacob (the way back) wearing a black-talked dress is a real curiosity. Completely great, very layered series: more looking. <br /> <br /> Wishes
