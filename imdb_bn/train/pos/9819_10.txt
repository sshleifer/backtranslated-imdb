It's a great movie from the lost age of the reactionary-for-television drama. My favorite actor, Robert Kulp has skillfully plots plots in the system with brilliant kindness and faith, in the knee grip, the conservatism and fear of crime, and hate psychologists. Thirteen is a collection of evil stereotypes of pure masters, and the last message of this movie ends with the comparisons of the draggate. But the film's great speed, by creating degrees of fear and creating paranoia, as well as the whole California settings, it was really born. The car is as great as I really remember. I gave this image 10, and I resist someone to see this movie and do not enjoy every minute. Remember, creating television does not mean that it is not a great art.
