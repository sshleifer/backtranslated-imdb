Legendary director Sidney Lumet has given her a great film in this very fictional film, and in the end, the family has a frustrating story about a family that works as one of the children. Filip Simmur Hoffman (an Oscars worthy of here), a listed cast under the leadership of Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomomi and Albert Finney, did not even take the stories of crime stories such as Lumet Reservoir dogs, but family stories such as ordinary people <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of showing it in a linear manner, he ran the Tarantino route And cut off from a totally different perspective of your view showed the central robbery. I personally found this to be very satisfying and left me guessing what's going to happen continuously. The script is very strong with husband and wife Hoffman and Tomie, as well as some nice scenes between Father and Son Finney and Hoffman. All the actors are absolutely intriguing to see and Lumet is probably fun fun under the direction of a style. She usually does not delve. Two-hour running time keeping the audience and lots of mysteries in action, this is a rare movie which is' frustrating for a moment.
