I just watched this movie two days ago, and I was filled with hope that Paris was my second favorite city in Europe and I spent very romantic 18 months in the 80's. I was somewhat disappointed that most of this group of Vintets did not hold the city's "light" and beauty even though it was originally and artistic. This is not enough for romance! We did not see any tree with a tree lined ... it was much dark, not literal but metaphorically. Some of the plots remind the viewers to see it and throw it down to "flat" (for Marriage sequence, coffin sales order, two examples). Uplifting, good ones: In Mime sequence, graveyard, Montmartre (though it was too much for the viewer to understand), "Cowboy" was a few and far between Wynet and Sakre Kouar, and I saw an extraordinary actor like Orlando Bloom Something that has shown its fundamentals even more
