I saw it on Christmas time, I do not know why but it reminds me about Christmas so I saw it, so we are there. <br /> <br /> One such film, which is a big smile on my face and a mixture of special performances, great fun music and scripts for scripts due to intellect and elegance Looking through a way through. <br /> <br /> Doodle Moore has created a character that can easily hate (poor, wealthy, lazy drunk who feels sorry for herself) but whoever makes her love you. Liza Minilie is as good as Linda Morolla, a queen waitress who operates inside the lady to become strong / soft, Arthur almost gave up his world. John Gielgud gets all the juicy lines and polishes them off with taste. <br /> <br /> I can see Arthur again and again and it always feels good to me, if you need a beautiful film lift then check it out.
