First off, this movie was a complete wild ride. The soldiers' training story, the fight with their superiors, and the group together at the end. <br /> <br /> from the very beginning to the end. This is a war drama in which you are constantly looking for cussing (sometimes outside of the factors) and what the boot camp is afraid for. <br /> <br /> How dynamics communicate with actors were quite surprising, and sometimes ridiculous. How to deal with Boaz (Colin Farrel) Pacton (Matthew Davis) camp from Tigerland, and even to the end, deals throughout his story. <br /> <br /> The innovative free hand filming adds a certain flavor to the smell of the film. Constant moving, constant action, and just constant confusion. Occasionally, it was a help. Others, not so much. <br /> <br /> Throughout the whole film, it was increasingly realistic. Some things in the film (especially sexual scenes) seem to be very realistic, although they have an impact on the movie which is not without them. <br /> <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Colin is one of Pharrell's best films (if not top performance). Acting for each character was fantastic. 9/10 - Sense 3
