In a while, a movie arrives that raises the bar for the other films of each type. A movie of this qualification will affect many films after being released for years. 'A Chinese Ghost Story' falls into this category. This is reasonably one of the best horror films made in the 1980s. Probably made the best one. <br /> <br /> Filmmakers have made a movie that appeals to every horror fan. The story is engrossing and original. Villeen is appropriately terrible and scared The set is weird and atmospheric. There is even a little blood and eagerness to satisfy the home splatters fan. But if you are not a fan of the 'horror' label, do not be afraid of you. This film fits easily into many sections. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers mix drama, comedy, horror, kung fu and romance generators with a delicious deluxe cinematic pie. 'A Chinese Ghost Story' is a beautiful epic love story, grateful nudity and / or explicit sex scenes that have destroyed many Hollywood's "love stories". Those who stop the romantic elements of the story come back to the fast-moving sword and 'Wire-Fu' and come back. If that is not enough, then actress Leslie Cheng and Wu have provided enough humorous situation to enjoy your hunger for Comedy. This movie offers something for every movie fan. <br /> <br /> Director Siyu-Tung Ching and producer Sui Har, gathered a wonderful amazing cast for this movie. Leslie Cheung proved that she is not only a gifted actor, but a talented singer and an impressive physical comedian. I probably can not think of another actor except Chung, who is well illustrated by Lin Choi Sin (probably excluding Chow Yun Fat). Joe Wang Chit as the noble, stealing the heart of the character of slavery, the slave-girl. Title character is really hunting and memorable in his screenplay. Um Mother is a happy Taoist who helps young lovers. <br /> <br /> At technical level, this movie is also very impressive today's standards. The direction is fantastic. I hope today's Hollywood officials will find talented artists like Sue-Tung Ching, but rather go back to normal MTV videos or Pepsi commercial directors. Cinematography gorgeous You need to appreciate a movieographer who can look good in the film, when most of the scenes happen at night. Special effects make-up are top notch. In fact, the effects of most of the creatures of this film blows violent CGI ghouls and goblins, which have become commonplace in modern horror films. After the release of <br /> <br />, "A Chinese Ghost Stories" is a two-dimensional sequels, a full-length animated movie, and countless imitation. Any movie that can follow it or copy it, is able to capture this classic magic. This image is needed to find a great fan or a great way to spend 95 minutes of your time. 10 out of 10. <br /> <br />
