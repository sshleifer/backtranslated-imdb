"Shanghai Lady" is known as one of Hollywood's most annoying productions. The original cut of Wales is cut away by the producers and the ribbons are cut. This already makes mystery more difficult to keep track of mystery stories. Because of the density of the Irish accent, they post a good amount of their dialogue, and dubbing is very clear and badly done. The most dangerous of all, Wellness and leading women in her screen and in real life Rita Hayworth was falling apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry came through the screen. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, all this is exactly how to overcome the fantastic Oscillation Wales' direction. She has created an incredibly stylish and atmospheric film - every scene seems to breathe only from your screen. Also, the character and the scenes are so wicked that they are wonderful and the boundaries on surreal. These ideas of curiosity often enhance scenes found in these movies, as in the mid-court sequences. I usually find a bore courtroom drama, but Wales's direction and quirky touch makes them as attractive as all other. The end of the carnival finally reminds one of David Lynch. <br /> <br /> here is also very good acting. Regardless of their failed relationship, both Wells and Haver give proper performance - but their interactions are just a little lacking. Everyone else is superb and delightful to see, especially Everton Sloane and Glenn Anderson. "The Lady of Shanghai" is obviously his problem, but at its best, only one film's master could see his worth. (8/10)
