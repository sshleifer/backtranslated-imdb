I think the 1983 Timothy Dalton / Jellah Clark is bound to see the adaptation of "Jane Eyre" because I wrote an article for The SequemOnline 2006 about the BBC "Jane Eyrei". So, I approached watching the way I doing homework this way. <br /> <br /> I was first irritated. This version is a bad light. Everyone / everything is washed in a bright white ink light, in some scenes shade the wall behind the letters in some scenes. <br /> <br /> and the word is badly recorded. I felt like I could hear playing high school. <br /> <br /> and pancake make up is very heavy. <br /> <br /> and the set does not fully reveal Gothic mood in the novel. They are very fussy, very Martha Stewart. I can not comply with Martha Stewart's domestic arrangement at Brent Rochester's Martha Stewart. Orson Wells' Rochester lived like a very suitable cavity for his novel gothic mood. <br /> <br /> And yet ... with all these objections ... not just the best "Jane Eyre". I have seen, this may be the best adaptation of any novel. <br /> <br /> This "Jane Eyre", despite its technical flaws, read the feeling "Jane" for me "for the first time <br /> <br /> The critics of this product said that the book is very close. For me, the book is valuable, and it does not need to be less "silly" or less "Christian" or more related to sexual relations, the authenticity of the novel has really written its best asset. <Br / <br /> <br /> Bronte Good book Li For more than 150 years, there are reasons for running, on the other hand, gradually, sex and easy books have disappeared. <br /> <br /> For a long time, like "Jane Eyre" fan, I had a bias like Rochester against Timothy Dalton. Rochester is not famous, not handsome; The famous ugly couple of Zen and Rochester literature, and nothing is done when Timothy Dalton is not uncommonly beautiful. <br /> <br /> But Dalton Raches Gives an appealing performance as PM. He just blew me away. Introduction, text, dialogue, and something I have never seen as his love for Jane renastarera. Dalton Rochester came up with the page in order to spend life on the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Dalton is awesome. Wales becomes very scary, for example, when he screams "enough!" Fontaine then plays a small piano piece. But Dalton is scary here more than once. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> this is cool. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> This effort has seen that this part is similar to the black hole of despair like Timothy Dalton. Do not even try the current fan favorite Toby Stephen. Hit it at Dalton Park. If I see Timothy Dalton in Rochester in the exclusive bar, then I would say, "The man is getting hurt, do not even look at him." <br /> <br /> Jella Clark is not only the best Jane, but General General General Generals General General Generals General Dr. . No, who knew "Jane Eyre" from the 2006 version, Bront * a * statue, a powerful statue with a well-folded and pivotal lip. Instead, Charlotte Bront's Jeanne is poor, simple, vague, and little, and not beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jelah has a small face, close eyes, and a little nose. He is really "little." She is no fashion model. And he is the best Jane, the truth of the book. <br /> <br /> Some people described him as cold or annoying. No, he's true in the book. Brontas is not a red red mother, she is a shelter, a deprived boy, whose inner feelings come out only in the moment, as Jelah is here. Book Jane, if someone carefully observes carefully, patiently, but if you really want to prune its depth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br/> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Aiar. "Christianity is not a formal theorem in" Jane Jane ", it is central. <br /> <br /> Helen Barnes directs Jen in the Christian language, thus reading her in a devastating, readable cultural way, and surviving, visually destroying her , The ant is life. It is Christian, and a Christian god, who needs to live in his ideals of poor, simple, vague Jane. And rejected the offer of an important marriage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I have seen any adaptation of the novel, and it says a lot. <br /> <br /> Other books , Does not fully respect the book, becomes a joke to watch in many places, if there is no thinking about the abuse of Charlotte Bronte's child, and the culture built on money There is no difference about the hypocrisy, but the majority of your book in order to proceed with the adaptation kissing scenes things will move faster. Jane and Rochester. <br /> <br /> This version, like Bronte's novel, has realized that Bront's everything - loaded with Jane's experience and his relation to St. John - which is related to Rochester relating to Jane's as explosive and unforgettable.
