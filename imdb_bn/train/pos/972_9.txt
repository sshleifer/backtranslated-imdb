How nice! A lot of fun! Perhaps a bit for normal American kids, and indeed this is a stretch to call a kid's movie, this movie reminds me a bit of time bands - too much terry gilliam all the way. Although the overall description is quite straight forward, Mike is still very high and there are many rumors in Bunu-Esquien's moments. The whole first law is visually visible as well as being present in the soul world and in the temple visually with the original family life of the original children / hero. And at the end, the message of Mick's work, something of the meaning and allegory level, especially anti-war / revenge-revenge, which is a vague aspect, is quite funny. As a mental and fantastic fun as another great michaeli film, only on top of torture and pride, he gave us unlimited amounts of monsters and yoke by the Japanese folk-lovers covered in Singapore and fantasy multi-fasd adventure. . F'n Rad, and the best one of Miike!
