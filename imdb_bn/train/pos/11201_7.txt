Wonderfully good first effort from Alfred Hitchcock. One of the only original paintings written by Hitcoo himself, this image shows the amazing story structure. It jumped with an enthusiastic boxing match, in which the Carnival Champ "One Round" jack defeats a competitor from the audience who is a professional prize. The film was then slow to develop character and to present a love triangle between Jack, his daughter, and professional boxer. This movie is a dramatic cat for the recovery of two men for the HumanWat crown. Even in these early films, Hitkak shows her talent for meaningful cinematography and proposition. An amband bought for the boxer girl continues to pop up throughout the film as a symbol of her unfaithfulness. The only major reversal of this movie is the picture of boxing gaming still not perfected in 1927. As a result, the final match is going to be a bit anticlimactic. The story, though, is what this film carries.
