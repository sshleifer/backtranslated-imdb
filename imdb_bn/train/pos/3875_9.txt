This film is one of the most barbaric comedians in Canada, Yves P. Created by Pelletia. I was surprised for one second to create a romantic comedy, but to know that he was a heavy senefil, every local festival and local cinema showed that I had a positive feeling about this movie. <br /> <br /> Hell, I was fine. On the right side of the bat, the scene (Pileyere himself wrote) is a little rotten and difficult to follow, but the 90-minute jack-in-the-box in Pel√©ier's fashion. <br /> There is certainly a note-writing game written in the "Les Essays" freeze with dangerous lizagons (most of the lacels) in the most inspired and highly adapted synthesis. Throughout the film you will find who and who is writing this goddam freeze ... which falls in love with an interesting love. <br /> <br /> Great story, great photography, great movie quotes in other movies. Should we ask for a first movie?
