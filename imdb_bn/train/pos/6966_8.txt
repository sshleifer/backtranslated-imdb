Overall I was rather impressed with the pilot. The initial first fifteen minutes were alarming because God was trying to create a science fiction version of OC, but a terrorist incident happened when the fear was corrected and from here on the themes in themes and situations that I rarely see television tacks. <br /> <br /> BSG worked on themes like monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism, but they were largely seated, if they liked the audience, they could consider or ignore it. Here, on the other hand, these topics are the focus of the show and I personally see things like Shell and The Matrix as reference points, and I am surprised by the way the themes are discussed. I think if you are both a fan or a fan of other film / television shows, which deal with the issues I mentioned, I think you can find at least something here. <br /> <br /> We started to explain the situation we knew in BSG, I believe that they have operated it very interesting, especially they tell how they believe in one God from the belief of Ceylon Coming and Crimea's creation was quite advanced and contemporary. The technology has been cast in the future to appear in the future but the audience is not completely different to us. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the really poor points were Greystone parents and actress who was 'Lacey Rand'. Although I loved Aring Staltz and Palla Malcolmson, their scenes were experiencing a lack of chemistry at the same time, at the moment it could only develop their character, but it seems to me that something like that. I saw Magda Apanovic too dissatisfied with his role. This may require experience and time again for the development, but his role in this episode has not been completely composed and completely confident. <br /> <br /> Based on the pilot, I look forward to seeing where I will go to Capricia and hope it will touch the magnificence once BSG has done.
