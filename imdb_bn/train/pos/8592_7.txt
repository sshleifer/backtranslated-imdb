Good for an evening's entertainment - but the plot was incredible. Garrison's relationship with First Lady was outstanding and emotional; The president had cut out a cardboard. And who was the real villain? Nothing is developed or explained enough. I still do not know why they wanted to kill the President or how involved. Villains were anonymous and resorting, so you do not involve their plot. Michael Douglas and Keefner Sucharland were good creators in this story to create some reality - consciousness and conflict were good. But both Kim Basinghe and Eva Logoria were unbelievable in their role, lacking the full character of Basing and Logoria was not a secret service agent. This can be a very good movie, but in some way it misses the path with many inappropriate questions. Despite some very good views, the whole frustration. And they used the 'West Wing' set for the White House scene? - CCC or Charlie hope to be present!
