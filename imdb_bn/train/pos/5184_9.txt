(By William Warner, Kevin Pollock, Elizabeth Parkins, Vincent Spano, Matt Craven, and Dean Lane), who is invited to invite Tom Camp (Campan) campus a week, Canada by their former consuelor (Allan Arkin) Writer / director Mike Binandar makes sense in the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understandable yarn based on his experience. Also, there are lots of fun moments in the film, which is completely strange to me as my favorite, in which masking tape is used. Newton Thomas Siegel ("The Yosey Sussex", "Three Kings") provides the film with some influential shots in the Canadian desert. In Cast, the movie "Evil Dead" and "The Gift" director Sam Raimi appear here as the right hand of Arkin's left hand. Another thing, this picture has assured me that the Camp will not be a bloody murder site.
