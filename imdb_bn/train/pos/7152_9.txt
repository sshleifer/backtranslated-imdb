'Holls' was a great movie. Disney made the right choice. I talked to every person about this, they said. Everyone was fit for the thrown part and really was the future of Shia LaBeouf's performance. Sigourney Waver was perfect for the warden, I was just exactly how I imagined her. Anyone who did not see it, I recommend it and I will guarantee 'dig it'.
