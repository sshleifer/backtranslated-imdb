It's an extraordinary movie and a shame that it will get a little attention from the fact that it will be both for the first time in the morning to see it on the moonlight and the students who are on the channel. <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot works simple but works very effectively, blurring in imagination like child and hard-night nightmares are very well blurred. The budget looks a little lower, but it is not often seen in the creditors of the perpetrators. <br /> <br /> I was so lucky, when I taped this tapes several years ago, it protested half a dozen views. This is a film that will not appeal to everyone; Although naturally, it gets much more with the more thoughtful approach to film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, The cross is very good, it is very good to carry the height of his character in the context of the picture. <br /> <br /> This movie has some sad moments (and I do not say it lightly) half-second shock and more tension is pulled out. See it with lights! <br /> <br /> Highly recommend. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
