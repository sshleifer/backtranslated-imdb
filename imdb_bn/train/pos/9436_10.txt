"Is it all you, Ed?" "Now you get to play the game." The day my father's mother kept my mother, she saw this movie her new girlfriend, on that day in the sinner's dome of Hollywood. I was but fourteen years old. I'm not entirely sure what I'm seeing, but I'll never forget, especially with Ned Batiey, the scene. It is today, six years later, it still gives me a quiver. <br /> <br /> My dad had a big Booney Reynolds fan, so it stood for nearly an hour because it was supposed to be an action movie. I have seen these two films in Dome: "Grand Prix" and "Song of Norway". Well it was not just Mario Andrei or Brady Bowch. After leaving the theater, I was shell-shocked <br /> <br /> <br /> At that low level, I commended artistry ... and after seeing it again today, I was surprised that I Still very annoying to this very witness, yet very well-made films. <br /> <br /> It's not saying that it's a tragedy of fourteen years old that did not kiss his first girlfriend. I do not blame my father for blaming him, but it was a little too much for a child to give a witness. <br /> <br /> As an adult, I still think it is quite annoying, but still I am very impressed with the quality of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> Bit Reynolds is absolutely wonderful, as all the principles ... Emotional Guitar from Billy Redden, like astonished Vinyl Dealer, Ronnie Cox ... Everyone does a commendable job. No one from the sound quality ticking to the chiping bird, second to the second. Photography, cinematography ... all the technical aspects of this extraordinary movie are the first rate <br /> <br /> In response to the question of moral questions, as well as moral questions have emerged since the murder of a man, after being victimized in sexual abuse, when they release today this groundbreaking film is as deep. And after tackling this unexpected cruelty, the classic sequence of trying to survive in the desert is life-changing. These four men, the dancers, were suddenly confused about the situation, and raised the bar of action. <br /> <br /> It's a classic to be sure of. And the term "you have a nice face" has been cited continuously, working from off-the-cuff on Saturday Night Live, near water-cooling comments, this movie suspects a huge part of our social pop culture! As long as the "Make My Day" or "I Will Come Back" was the same. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What would you do if you were sexually assaulted by your friends far away from the mountain men's gunpoint? City, comfortable bed, wife and kids? And if you took the action of Bart Reynolds (and I did that), would you soon bury the body under the lake, or face trial and accept your possibilities? The following line is: Deliver the distribution. You can take that bank If this movie is not below your skin, you are not human. <br /> <br /> If you've seen it before, rent it again and ask the above question. <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the film is similar: Ed failed to kill deer ... then it was changing. Life and its unexpected circumstances can change a person. And I think this movie is about John Voyet, in particular, as Ed, here's the best performance. And he is a more talented actor in the history of Hollywood, from the midnight Cowboy to Frank Harrison, Franklin D. In his extremely low-level activities, like Roosevelt, his performance took the film to another level. Climbing the stone in the evening, is awesome and it is necessary to see it determined to be determined to believe. I guarantee your heart rate will be raised in a new level. <br /> <br /> As a banjo string, pull tight, intense, taut and tightly painted, it is a morality game that asks questions today. Times have changed, but people do not like us. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten stars.
