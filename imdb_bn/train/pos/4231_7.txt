While returning from a Christmas Eve shopping trip, after a disagreement with a group of abusive youth, the housewife (Basingville) found herself fighting to survive in a living suburbs. <br /> <br /> Directly on the DVD release of the UK, Susan Montford's debut greeting will probably not be recognized. It's a shame, because writing quality, direction, and acting are certainly great, and of course your average DVD flick goes beyond the criteria. <br /> <br /> Some of Kim Basing's time gives his best performance as the fallen wife of an abusive husband (Craig Schaffer). Although nothing else was given to wait for the threatening presence of Shafar, but there is this in their short sight together with Basingai - showing painful weaknesses which will still blossom in the conflict with the young people. This is truly amazing performance, its victim has been transformed into an aggressor. <br /> <br /> I had known Lucas House wrongly because he (including three young men) just did not think too much threat. However, four young people were more physically applicable, the next scene where the tablets against basing started, they did not always work. These four average men, although slightly uncomfortable, why this film works, why is it so important? In addition to some of the pacing problems in the middle of the next half of the film, there are some chase lines here and there, which is here is a great thriller that gives viewers something to think after the movie ends. Some early scenes can be slow by slow - burning nature, or sudden end. At other times the brutal violence. I say this is an opportunity, it is certainly more qualified for your time than VV.
