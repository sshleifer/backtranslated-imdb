I simply love this movie. This is a perfect example of the amazing stories from Asian films. There was a recent Hollywood remake of Richard Carne and easily with the horror Jennifer Lopez. Please do not confuse the two movies. The original Japanese film is tuned, fine and surprisingly played. The exact opposite of the Hollywood version. When I first saw the trailer for the American version and I was acting, I was frustrated. It's Hollywood Eurozoial Cross Commercialism at worst. The rebuilding argument points out that some foreign films may never improve. The main reason behind submitting subtitles in the United States is not simply the original movie. <br /> <br /> One of the main reasons that this movie will never work in the United States is that the image of the reserved, very social conservative public Japanese personality is a problem in this picture. Of course, the main character wakes up for a more complete understanding of a vivacious life through dance, but half of the film's tension comes from stereotype and ridicule Bollywood dancers in Japan. <br /> <br /> Please try to watch this movie its main form, not terrible full screen. And please drop the US remix .... It is a shallow traveler than the original Japanese film. Yes, I know the "original" movie is old, and it's only a Japanese story, but only two will see it soon and it will be able to see a new US remake. <br /> <br /> To talk about foreign movies, I would recommend a few: 1. The first reason for the wedding in the season, the outstanding movie! 2. Jonny Stichino - Very funny Italian mistake mistaken identity! 3. Korean Action Pictures in Shariri, which mix both Asian air and US style plots. 4. Run Lola Run - A German film that integrates its techno score together. <br /> <br /> OK, yet a quick list: -)
