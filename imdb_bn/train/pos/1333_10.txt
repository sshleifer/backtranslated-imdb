I love this movie, I've seen over over. I do not think why anyone in this movie was not good. Maybe you've seen well or whatever it is I personally love it. This is one of my favorite movies and I am not Hindi but I like it. It may be slightly like "beautiful woman" but I have not seen it and I do not think it's even better. I do not know why you're hijacking everything about it, but maybe you might have a good reason, but I think I said it enough, but I love this movie completely, and those who say it's not good. But I wonder why it looked and you consider what good movies. The other people I have seen with it also enjoyed it, so it makes me amazed that many people do not like it. For Rani Mukherjee (I think how you make her last name) she is very beautiful and my favorite actress!
