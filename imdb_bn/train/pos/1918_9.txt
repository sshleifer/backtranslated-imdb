I'll be honest, I was junior in high school when this season was first broadcast on ABC, I do not think I like it. But with that John Ritter I felt that there was little chance, plus there was something else with them. Acting was fantastic, not one of the other horror second comedy lines, it's Comedy, John Ritter always brings his A game. It was a great show to see and why I would say you are a great show. My father never seen anything, he only saw movies, sports and law and order, he is actually sitting with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters, my mother and me, and I saw the program I think because John Ritter was this. I sincerely believe that this program will still work if John Ritter God rests his spirit, I hope he is not dead.
