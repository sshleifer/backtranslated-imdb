The 36th Chamber of Shawlin, which returned to the 3rd chamber, played a young man named Gordon Liu Shan T, who was a monk and a fighter. An unexpectedly injured person, who has to learn Kung Fu after playing this series in Liu, beat his friends. He imitated the original Shan, tried all kinds of techniques to enter the Shilin temple and finally got some unique skills to fight against some foolish Buddhists. This is a classic light hearty martial art story by the Shaw Brothers' SS production value and the strong steps of Louis Xia Liang. Coreyography is a great way of life, for the sake of struggle or for the performance of slopstick comedies and Gordon Liour, as well as other, especially sympathetic monastic objects. This movie is less epic than other stars, and deeper and shadowy Brothers movies are more violent and more awesome But few people have a little mix of tastes and warmth stories with a little different training and a magic combination of war. Light full of heartfelt joy, it does not give the highest score impossible.
