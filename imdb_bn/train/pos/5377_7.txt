"College Girl Murders" is my first introduction to the works of Edgar Wallace ?? And usually with my first real contact "Krimi" film ?? And I can say that I'm moderately impressed. This thing is really entertaining, though I would not expect it to be ?? Stupid! The film is a ridiculously and gorgeously plot plot, with a healthy dose of comedies, flashy twists and superb inventions. Is there some kind of bad mastermind in James Bond ?? Those who always shadow and in front of a big monitor - the detainees employ girls to kill girls with a new type of poison. With a whip equipped as a Communist KK, a villain is freed from the remnants of monks like monks, very strange teachers and like the Kukki police commissioner, who is going to solve the case with a psychological perspective. Seriously, if I already knew that these sequential movies were so colorful and crazy, I'd already buy their entire collection. The protagonist plot raises more questions than the answers, and the extra interest of the curious gymics in Scotland Yar Inspector Higgins is sometimes more than the melting, but I'm not careful because it was a great entertainment. Even the 60-year-old soundtrack has been stuck on my head for a long time. It's like a variant of Italian Giallo, but with slapstick elements.
