Although Shining is more than a quarter of a century, I did not want to be mad like Jack Nicholson's desperate man. This is an extraordinary example that can not make it unique that no one has been able to stop it; Instead it has been mentioned during the pop culture and again. Twilight, blood lift, redroom, crazy nonsense "writing" ... if it is not something else, then understand all the emotions of daily living. The film is scary, suspenseful, beautiful, and mentally stimulating. This is the classic mystery of Hitkouk and a modern thriller terror. And it generally lacks horror movies: a great script.
