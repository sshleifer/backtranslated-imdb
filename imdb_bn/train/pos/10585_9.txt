The Pottled Parade is the best of the 1930s musical comedy exterior. Jimmy Cagny, a snappy script and an all-star star, along with the lovely Joan Blondel, Dick Powell, and Ruby Keller, made a cut on the rest of the film. Creative genius Bashy is operated by Barclay and the dancer, this film will be gaining from Kan-to-Kan from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Of course, certainly Hollywood's musical freedoms master, "Gold Degars of 1933" and his credit of "42nd Street" (as Director of the Dance). Hundreds of pavement parade are graced by harmful-clad chorus girls, a Berkeley trademark. Extended dance numbers were shot only with a camera, and the first director of the close-up dancers was close-up movie. His emotionally amply displayed here with disciplined legs and "rear-scene" shot. The overall effect is extremely loving and mesmerizing. <br /> <br /> Our son Jimmy Cagney, shown at the "prologues" or small musical stage producer Chester Kent plays a movie theater that plays before the audience before the lecture. She is surrounded by miserable partners, a corporate spy, and a gold dig friend. Though Voodwell had a strong background on Cagney, this first film he displayed his dance genius. Juan Blondel Kagani's wise-cracking, lover secretary as memorable. And Ruby Keller always, as adorable. <br /> <br /> The film is topped with three extraordinary production numbers, "Hanimun Hotel", "Waterfall" and "Shanghai Lil", everyone is a wonderful work and probably duplicated in today's Hollywood where the so-called "special effects" creative cinematography replaced Has done. The following line of claudia: shiny and loving, sometimes some of the best musical production numbers placed in celluloid. A thoroughly enjoyable depression era romp.
