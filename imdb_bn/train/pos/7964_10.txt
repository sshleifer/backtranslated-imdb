It makes me amazed that I really do not like dogs, how much love this film is. Fox, Field, and Amech Chans, did a great job with the sound of Sassie and Shadow, and acting by animals is just amazing. <br /> <br /> I saw this image 72 times (I know that the word of fear, but it is true!), and the last scenes still get me I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially animal lovers. This is my favorite movie ever!
