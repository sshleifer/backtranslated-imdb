I've seen more about this movie once. It was the same with most surprising elements that were shown in television movies. For the obvious reasons I was the only problem with the title ... think of an immediate Drake famous snack cake! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The network was provided by. I like the part where Cranee flies to some vague countries, which finds the mysterious, who will help her win the evil beast. He asked the cab driver how to find this guy. Cubby breaks his own ethnic beliefs into a great dialogue between the native cab driver and crane. 'Oh, Mr. Barry, when I came down from the mountain, I left behind things ...' - The mention of the mystery that rarely sees or advises people and nobody knows how to really communicate with him. <br /> <br /> As far as the supernova goes, this movie is still enjoyable.
