<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I wrote, - Atish Kapadia Ratings - *** <br /> <br /> <br /> Eureka! We got it! Yes, Bhipul Shah's 'Weekt' lady and lady? We probably got the first hit this year. Re-fill with all the necessary components to rent a commercial Bollywood, there is all that takes for a movie to click with 'walk' Indian viewers. This is a great movie that makes a distributor happy and thinks of his next tour! We have a happy family (this is not always?) Among the three of these Indian sentiments 'sea' God (Amitabh Bachchan), Postman-Million Millionaire (How To Do not Ask ... There is something to sell the toys when supplying the letter?) Seriously to the enemy!), Sumi (Shefali Shah)) Big to Aditya (Akshay Kumar) Father God has to make serious decisions about his son's neglected attitude towards the responsibility of life. Although his love for Aditya, delayed results of his serious problem. However, when faced with a situation that examines his race against time, instead of putting Aditya outside the house, there is no alternative to God - it is expected that new accidents can make him more honest than his own life. But this supposed solution itself becomes a problem, because the conflict between the loving father-son increases and the fence continues to grow. <br /> <br /> You do not have to be a rocket-scientist that gives such stories an opportunity for comedy and drama to entertain as well. So, in pre-interval you have initially funny, then irreconcilable Iranian and Rajpal Yadav have tracked the boring comedy; And in post-space AB and Akki have to go for your miserable moment! Writer Atish Kapadia (based on the film based on which he wrote 'Aaso Bhola Fari Malishu', the original gazaji drama) has done a good job keeping descriptive fluid. The dialogue tend to get inconsistent from time to time. It does not help marin and work marvels appearing like a teenager's face. Obviously, some numbers may be done with. In front of the indicator, Vipul shows that he got the natural taste to talk about the story. The 'Walk' as well as his first debut initiative 'Akhen', led you to take interest until the end. A personal note- The passion I saw was a tad damn for me. But from the response of the audience to Gauguing, it was working on heels. <br /> <br /> Finally, 'work' is all its performance which is an entire point of overall rating! Amitabh Bachchan is always reliable. Her strength is visible and so is her age! Shefali a delicate performance performance and match with each step superstar. The bomb and the raja took the house with their indigenous people. Priyanka does not have much more than playing the role of heroine actress. Although it all flies, 'Walk' Akshay's car I am always conservative that Akki's role is as good as the Creator. Put him 'Mujhe Shaadi Karogi' and he is superb, but he is very bad at 'Baifa'. Here, perhaps Akki is his best. Whether it's her ridiculous time or her emotional presentation, she's near perfect. There is a action scene for his fans! Surprisingly, his previous best effort was 'Ananka' - the same director and Big B next to him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is not that it will play better films of our industry. But it is one of the public. And when the industry is awaiting a public injury, then this technique can only be 'work'! <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Badaakar <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After 'Bevafa' Time played on the stage! <br /> <br /> Ratings- *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good *** * Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> April 22, 2005
