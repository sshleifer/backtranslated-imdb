I swear that the zombie was killed twice, and was kept back after coming back. I gave this movie 8. Let's face it's people, what other critics say is a "handy-cam" shot film. Hey, hey, hey, welcome to make a total indy film. This film has the presence of Todd Sheets 700 zombies as a tribute to his competition. Yes, there is a gap in the story, yes, we see the same zombies repeatedly, but really care? Take this for yourself, a fun and glorious horror movie, to share with your shoots, or to people you really care about LOL. Embrace people, I think you all like garbage like "Titanic" or "Twister". Supporting peace, and independent film !!!
