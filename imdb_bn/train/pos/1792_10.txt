Last night I was happy to see this beautiful movie, after a wonderful addition to the question and answer session with the director. I suspect that the first commenter did not find any guardian or any person close to him at the time of his death. I have suffered a lot, and this movie talked to me. One of the main themes is that we do not deal with questions / topics / stories with our loved ones until we are too late - before they happen, they are very disabled or dead. Talk to your loved ones, listen to them, record them, tell people who love them, solve the differences. I like the message that there is no mistake. I love to portray the relationship between two girls - one of the six siblings, it is clear to me that the relationships are so complex As a painter, his history comes through loud and clear - what a beautiful movie! Welding outstanding - a film will not be missed!
