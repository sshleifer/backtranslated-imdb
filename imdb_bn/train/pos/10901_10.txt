This is probably the best documentary I've seen so long. Johnny Kennedy was and still a sad beautiful inspiration. He was not the only one who survived the most painful disease, but used his beauty to show the beauty of the world that there is life after death and he will never reach out to people and spread His love. Seeing the long struggle of his life, it seemed as if there was a heart degradation. Her smart ass heard the comments and was heartwarming to see her adorable gesture. And seeing his smile was uncertain. I feel happy being able to touch by this tiny monster. Please, if you have the opportunity to watch this movie - feel lucky to meet yourself with Johnny Kennedy.
