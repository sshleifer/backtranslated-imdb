I saw this movie on the night and demand, I did not know what to expect. I have heard of this movie, but there is no opinion on it. <br /> <br /> I said, I was fascinated by what I saw. I was really curious in some parts and I definitely jumped my seat several times. <br /> <br /> Blob was scary. Now, I'm looking at a jelly in a jar, if it keeps me away from my hand. <br /> <br /> Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews, the hero of the film. I like the old man at the beginning. <br /> <br /> For the horror film of 50, it also works very well by today's standards. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
