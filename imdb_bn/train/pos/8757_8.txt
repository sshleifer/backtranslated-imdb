I like movies which usually do not give a "happy ending" and this is my main reason to love my movie. Dais Marano (Danes) and his best friend Darlin (Bekinsal) were arrested in Thailand on Thailand for allegedly Thailand's bomb blast in Thailand on Thailand allegations of Thailand smuggling in Thailand in Thailand in Thailand. These films work hard to assume that viewers (or somebody) are involved with the girls and Bill Palman is perfect as his shameless lawyer. Jacqueline Kim is a more kind, great wife, Jon, who turns out to be a great performer as an attorney. I hope girls are tortured more and more in jail, another commenter has been advised, as I have heard that Thai prisoners may be quite brutal. Where this picture captures me, it ends. Alice punishes herself for 96 years so that Darlin can be forgiven, and we (visitors) realize that they are both innocent. A film that has won my point of view by denying my expectations to finish, and this good acting drama is certainly worthy.
