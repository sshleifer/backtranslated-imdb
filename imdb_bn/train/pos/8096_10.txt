Above all, people are concerned about this film because only a part of the real story can not be "changed". What is a good guess? Peter Jackson's film was not a perfect representation. Well enough ranting This is a very nice film. The background is taken from gorgeous and well-known Tolkein artists. The film covers almost half of the triangle (ring fellowship of the ring and two towers till the Battle of Helm's Deep) and at a good pace. Voice casting is a top notch and most of the characters seem to think that they might have imagined. Samwise is a little ugly for my taste, but Aragorn looks gorgeous. The film is a great score that fully supports the movie. If you enjoy good fantasy stories, hate reading (books are even better), try one of these movies, remember that it was created 20 strange years ago. Also note: Peter Jackson's Adoption Fellowship Ralph Bakhshi's (Jackson has repeatedly praised Balky's efforts) followed almost the same strand.
