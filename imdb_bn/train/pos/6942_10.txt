Fifty years of age restrictions for Brazilian films were as follows: any restrictions, 10 years old, 14 years old and 18 years old. Generally the West was allowed ten years of age, when they had 14 more violence, but Westerners under 18 were very rare to see. Winchester 73 was one of them and I think it was very good to explain how the film was different from the average. The hero, James Stewart, was fighting his own brother, who killed his father. He is looking for retaliation and quite well traumatized, away from the average good guy. In the next film with Stewart, Anthony Mann tried to change this type of character. Shelley Winters, the leading lady was far from kind, following the person she followed with the rifle. Dan Durriya is the one of the great villains who always remember as the Waco Johnny Dean. The film's story, which always follows the person living with the rifle, is suitable for a Western country. It was made in Fretz lang film, which did not come through it. When it was given to Mann, he did not accept anything from zero to anything prepared for the lang. With Winchester, Mann created a different conception of the West, but he still maintained all his heritage. Winchester is still a great film to meet again, but it can not be compared with such impressions among those who saw it during the liberation war.
