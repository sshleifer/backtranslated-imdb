I saw more than 15,000 votes during this writing, it has 5.8 ratings. Something wrong with that picture Personally I give it 10. I can see 7 in the lowest or possible 8 if it is rated by people who can see this movie for real. This is a movie based on a comic book hero. This film won more than the prize share. Wins Oscars 3 Another 5 wins and 26 nominations .... All right, I'm better than 5.8. Some very good actors have played some great, some great special effects and my opinion will not be a classic already for the coming years. If you are looking for pure entertainment, do not forget to check out Dick Tracy. Definitely a movie you can see a few times more. Al Pascino is as great as Big Boy Caprice.
