I guess I am the partner of these silent minorities. Is it the best of a "nightmare" series? Maybe not, but I had a lot of fun with it. Freddie Kruger reached the potential of his evil, wisecracking. Lagged down the series of parts 4 and 5, I felt this so called final installment (the "new nightmare" is the real end) series brought out its slump. There are some great nightmares, in which the Brookin girl plays a trouser in the trash, falls asleep and Freddie gets trapped in a video game. This is both a very original and ridiculous sequence, especially when we get him out of the scene of the dream, we're just like a super mario. And Freddy's funny one-liner, "Great graphics." And since the film was created almost 10 years ago, it was brought back to memory while controlling the game with Fredigov. Remember the first 8-bit Nintendo that anyone thinks Powerglove <br /> <br /> Cast is excellent. Lisa Jane is perfectly shot to cast. I did not see Yayfet Koto from "The Running Man" and I think this movie was seen almost 5 years ago. He is another great, unreal actor who possesses a strong screen presence. And who will forget Kemo? The best is playing a drug-resistant businessman from Janie Depp (from the first "Nightmare"). <br /> <br /> 3D order is really nice! So who is looking to check out this film - please rent or buy DVD! Hopefully all versions will come with 3D glasses, but I'm sure the video version has moved the 3D element. <br /> <br /> I personally did not see anything wrong with the film. It's even Freddie's backstory detail. The film is a great mix of humor and fear, and overall effects are horrific. Could this be a better trial for franchisees? Of course it can be. But the Rachel Tallah did a good job. And to find the perfect conclusion is easier said than done. <br /> <br /> And while closing, I first liked the montage on credit. The fans of the series will be happy, and will see Dear Freddy as a tribute. <br /> <br /> My score: 7 (out of 10)
