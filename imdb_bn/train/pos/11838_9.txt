It's one of the coolest, relaxing, and beautifully-animated movies I've ever seen. Through the beautiful music of the movie, words and music can make you feel in the movie! This movie is not great for kids, but adults too. It teaches you, as you never forget, you can do whatever you want and be brave and brave. This movie can make you cry very much, which is always a nice touch in the film. This movie is funny, sad, cute, and puts your seat on the edge! Some movies really give you a vague feeling after seeing them, and the movie "soul" is certainly one of them! With my vote of 9/10 stars for an amazing idea for animation, music, and a movie, it gave me a whole lot of soul!
