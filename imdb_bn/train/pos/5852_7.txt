Hood Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Rick Flyer, and Sherry Martell all kept WB as the first PPV in the new era. The talent needs to be pushed into a new crop. And all of these lex started with Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion has been given title shots against Yokozuna. Lex Express traveled to the United States on a bus named Lex Express to defeat Japan's monster (who was actually Samoan) and to pursue him to defeat the WWE Championship in the Americans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> a good match. This story was chosen by Diabys Ramon and even offered to hire him as slavery even after defeating the rubber's 1-2-3-kg shock in July. Radon got angry with Teddy Davis and Iryoune and Chemster's Money Inc tagged with 1-2-3 Kid against the team. To determine their differences both were given a one-on-one donation versus diabetes versus RADON and Shystorm the Kid. After Razor Razor hit the Edge, Razor was able to fix his position to sit next to the deal. <br /> <br /> Later on, the WWE Tag Team titles were placed in the line against Steven Brothers The Heavenly Companies. The "The Agency" manager, who hit Scott Stinner in the throats through a tennis rocket, removed Jim Cornette's intervention, they were able to drag the win into a decent match. <br /> <br /> <br /> Against Lex Luger against Shawn Michaels, from Rachelania IX. The difference was then spent for the Monty Intercontinental Championship when he confused him with winning the title against Marty Jenetty. Michaels won the title and entered the line against Mr. Perfect, but Michaels was now his strong partner in his 7-foot bodyguard's diesel corner. Mitchell and Perfect Here's a nice match, but it was the diesel who proved the difference maker, pulled the ring's effect and counted for Sean to put the steel step for stepping. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Shemerton complained of revenge against the loss of her tag team partner at night, easily accounting for 1-2-3 children. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest matches of the night came in the heart of Brett Heart Jerry, who prepares for the WWE's undisputed King title. But Lalla came out with a crutch and said, that the car had been injured in the accident before that day and he arranged for another opponent for the heart: The Decklace the Clown. Heart and Dowen had a passable match that the heart won with a sharp shot. Then he was jumped from behind by the salon. It was bought by WWE President Jack Tunney for a ring, who told Lollar that he would be banned for life if he did not compete in the heart. The heart then destroys the laser, won with sharp shots, but refused to give up the heart-hold and referee reversed his decision. So the name of the lalar is regarded as the king regardless of WWE. This match destroys Marty Jenet in a short match in the Ludwig Border. <br /> <br /> Undertaker ended his long race with Harvey Wippleman, which started in 1992, when Undertaker defeated Wippleman's client Kamal in Samplelame and continued. When Wippleman's latest monster, The Giant Gonzalez, destroyed the Rambler's bout, and then again in Reslemagia, with a conclusive victory over the Gonzelles. Then the gonjalas turned towards Wippleman, chocolate him after a poor match. <br /> <br /> Next time, six people were tagged as smoking guns (burt and bilei) and the title (Samu and Fatu) during the tag, and Left Banu Samu, for the communal relationship with Tamankank. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Lex Express. Lex came out of the attack, but Yokozuna controlled. Even though Lex came back before he was able to avoid a banner drop and then to slay him from the body slam Yokozuna ring. Then Luzer attacked the carnation and Fuji because Yokozuna was counted. Luger wins a good match !!!!! The balloon fell from the roof. Hero came to congratulate him on all his victory. Yokozuna may have maintained the title, but Luger has proven that he might be beaten. The only question was, who could hit him on the ring and grab the headline?
