This game is fun and it is a plot which you can actually expect to see in the comics. Spider-Man has been prepared by a mysterious impostor. The city is being overrun by a strange gas, and symbiotes like sadness and drying are displayed across the city. Who is behind this crime? Could it be doc oak? Well he seems to have turned into a new page. It does not appear to be associated with poison because he spied on Spider-Man obviously for a better photo opportunity. Well other casinos from the heroes and many villains will uncover the mystery behind Spidey. The basic of the fight, not hard to take, fight with the boss is rather fun. You get to collect comic, you run out of the web and it crosses a little funny city. However, it is a weak point. Swinging is not such that what you do is connected to the sky on the web in Hydro-Spider-sky, across the city. Especially in spider-man 2 movie video games, especially web-sling has no more skill. Yet it is made with other elements, especially for the bad change rather than the story. So prepare for a wild step to scorpio, rhino, toxin, brain, doctor octopus, and disorder flood.
