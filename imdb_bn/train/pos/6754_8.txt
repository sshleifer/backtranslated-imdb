Director Auto Primaemar reunited with his looming star, Dan Andrew and Gene Terney, to make this rough and angry silent photo ready: where Sidewalk is over. This image is full of interesting characters, unexpected twists, and a well-written crime story with a delicate look with striking conversations and great camera movements and dark and great movies silent lighting. Dana Andrews is a Detective Mark Dixon, Part Monder and Part Kopp star, who has earned fame with the criminals very physically difficult. Seeing a Dixon case in the search for suspects and answers, he wanted more involved. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is very good in his role - strong and tough, Andrew Dickson gets his bad side but ready to turn off their heels. He is the perfect movie silent anti hero - he is not very beautiful all the time, but we still have the route for him. Gene Tearney did a hard job in his role, as soon as possible, a sweet shoulder for Dixon. Terni's role may not be too much, but she must move on and beyond what she can do to the role of others, leaving every member of the audience shy of his smile, gently and in his eyes. Supporter throw is not too bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, likes and giving good supporters like Lieutenant Thomas. Luvara is where Sidewalk ends, but it's a great movie filled with great characters, stories, and pictures silent.
