My super ex-girlfriend is no less than an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very simple. Matt Sander (Luke Lewis) joins Jenny (Uma Thurman) at the subway and hooks up with her. Everything seems to be right at the beginning of their relationship, but then Matt finds out that he is G-Girl. The first thing that Matt feels really cool, but it turns out that G-Girl is very jealous and needy. So he decided to go with him and hook him up with his colleague Hannah (Ana Faris). This makes G-Girl very crazy and she starts taking revenge on her ex-boyfriend. <br /> <br /> G-Girl shows herself in the movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who loves 7 and beautiful comedy.
