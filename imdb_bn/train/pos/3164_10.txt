I can not believe we do not have 70 shows. All of my 70 shows have 8 seasons of it !! I absolutely love !! Every night before I go to bed I lie down in bed and look at several episodes. At the end of a long busy day you have to jump back before sleeping and have a great smile. I was so sad that they stopped the wind ... at least we got to run again !! I am hopeful and pray that they will return with at least a reunion ... when Dona ends college, we can meet him and get married! That would not be awesome !!! It will be better if they continue it for many years !!
