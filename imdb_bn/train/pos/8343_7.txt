Australian Fred Skcp (The A Cree in the Dark) refers to the comedy / romance that sets in fun, relaxing and spring. You will smile while watching this movie. Tim Robbins (ShashShank Redemption, Dead Man Walking) is an auto mechanic, Ed Walters, with a high IQ, which is superior to Albert Einstein, Walter Mathew (Grampy Old Man) and his academic friends Nathan, Kurt and Boris. You can tell them by their prepp shoes. Meg Ryan (Seattle's laziness, you got mail) Catherine Boyd, Einstein's nephew who is not worthy, but confident mathematician. Perhaps he is the reason that surrounds it by talent. He thinks he is married to someone with high IQ. His kids will have a high IQ. Besides, he does not know what he wants. This is a refreshing movie about the crazyness of Sunny Leo and Meg in Team Robbins. I love sweet stories. People should enjoy this movie of all ages. Catherine is involved in corrosive James Moreland, who works animal behavior, but too stuff. It is a love-first point of view, between mechanical and mathematician. Wicked line and the supernatural line! Cinematography is excellent. Princeton, New Jersey spring is beautiful. With many help from those brilliant men, Catherine falls for Ed, she knew she was an automobile mechanic. <br /> <br /> Favorite views: Taking multiple choice tests in front of the crowd with the support of Einstein, Nathan, Kurt and Boris. Ed and Einstein motorcycle Nathan, Kurt and Boris all the animals are free! <br /> <br /> Dear quotes: Albert Einstein: "Do not interfere your brain with your heart". Ed Walters: When did he say "wahoo" last time? Catherine Boyd: "Well I'm not sure I do not know". This is a refreshing movie, I recommend it. I have tapes and every once and after a while I will see it again.
