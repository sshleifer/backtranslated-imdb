Absolutely sunny John Waters shows respect to most of his people (Bartimorians) and laughs at them. It's like the teenager is getting loose in a museum! Since the serial mom I did not smile so much in the theater. I found older friends from Dreamland Days, Sharon Nisep and Susan Loay, in front of Waters Cameras. Throwing is simply surprising (especially Edward Farlung and Martha Plimpton). Uses the best elements of the past torrential tortures (especially the underlying polyester) and lots of new amazing elements. Make me sick in a wonderful way. Thanks, John!
