Eytan Fox did it again: took place in a shocking mess, moved the audience's heart into a decent paragraph. The picture is so thoroughly described and Tel-Aviv has succeeded in describing the atmosphere of the incredible city. <br /> <br /> I was there one month ago and here everything was: lifestyle, relationship, heart- <br /> <br /> strongly recommend: it is a journey for the heart with an interesting perspective, the city , Mess of chime, utopian monsate in luminous, blizy, blithe and oblivious megalopolis. In the Israel-Palestinian conflict. <br /> <br /> Note: There is a central gay plot of the film. If you think that you are not gay-friendly, then be prepared to challenge and finally see it as "just love". (And do not worry: chick is very hot!)
