With this movie it's all about style, atmosphere and acting. Indeed, I do not believe in all the facts of the plot, but it did not matter - horrible acting, unexpected plots twists, and wonderful atmosphere suck me right, and carry me along the ride, and I had great time. Kenneth Brangha is not only a great actor, but a master of accents, and he has proved it again with the faulty Georgia accent. He is surrounded by a lot of talent in supporting roles (Robert Downey, Junior, Abit Daviddatz and Falen, Tom Berena, Darl Hana and Robert Duval from Shindler's list) that I just disappeared. I recently bought a copy of this movie, and I'm not tired to see it. Just one of the best thrillers of the year. If you ignored this movie (and you have the possibility), then I suggest you check it out.
