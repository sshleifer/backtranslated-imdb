I grew up in Brazil and I painted the picture where I was amazed at the beautiful coast. The area is called "Parati" and it is part of the "green coast" of Rio de Janeiro state. It is located approximately 150 miles from the city of Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> This movie has returned to the 16th century Brazilian world, where Europeans were just starting exploring the eastern coast, which was still in the ancient state and partly populated by various local tribes. The French and the Portuguese fought each other over the territory and Brazil's wood business with each other, while always negotiating with negative, fought for one another for any reason. <br /> <br /> A French m isf ("a tenant") left to die by his own patriots, but he managed to escape and was captured by all the naked native tribes. According to the custom of the tribe, because he is the chief's "slave", he is given the right to take revenge for the right time to die and to be eaten in a revenge style. <Br /> <br /> What I like about this picture is that it reproduces in the affluent villages and their loving details of living (they became naked and canned) and asked us to recognize and accept life at that time. It was: In a wonderful garden, life was full of dirty, violent, sincere prejudice and bizarre custom. Europeans arrive and bring their own problems, including better violence and more violence with greed. No romantic "romantic savages" or "heroic warrior" here is here, it is only trying to survive in a difficult world. <br /> <br /> This movie is not sympathetic to spare or dismissive of the Nativity. From what I know about the subject, the illustration is perfect, which adds an air to the uniqueness of the project: How many films have you seen about their primary issues with Brazilian citizens and Europeans?
