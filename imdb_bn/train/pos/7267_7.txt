Curly mama is a 6 year old hair with an abundance and a life as a drifter. He and his father, Bill (Jim Belushi), tried to survive on the street as a small time artist of the art. In Chicago, the bill decides to jump in front of a car at a price parking garage, when Clly will shout a case against deliberate pretenders and track. It can be a very ambitious lawyer called Gray (Kelly Lyncht), which she is worried by the well-wisher. Scammers do not earn some cash, they can spend the night at the plaash apartment in Grae. Nevertheless, Gray thinks that he gave them more, so three hanging together for their spell. Gray knows nothing about only profitable law business and life. Those people who teach better than experts in intellect and practicality? However, all good things will end and there will be no legal expert and there are no men for men. Or is there? It's unexpected about a sweet and funny movie. Curly Sure Surely Shirley Temple is as entertaining but much edgier, of course. Bullus gives her unfortunate angle and lynch below as a radioactive but soft-touch lawyer as brilliant as a rare touch. John Hughes as the author and director sees us touching the magic again, because the script is alive and unpredictable. Just take a look and take out the gray night out for night, no money, and ridiculous results. Are you long, committed for the happy ending and finally, with some uncertain moments distributed in? This is your made-to-order movie.
