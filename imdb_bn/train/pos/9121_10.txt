Sponsors controlled for surveillance <br /> <br /> For 20 years since 1984, this film talks about future loads of the music industry's prince. <br /> <br /> You will have a great album if you take the best two songs from the last 10 albums of the Prince, the musical output of the prince in the last 10 years. <br /> <br /> The scene is going on in this way. Prince went to the dressing room after playing a song and the owner of the club entered the dressing room in the 90's, reminding the Prince of his favors because of his grace and extracting albums that only the most hardcore fans can bear and <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br> <br /> I said, how did he defeat Apollonii on two separate scenes, but Prince Concerned musical instrument underscores! It has cooled me that this is the only scene where women abused the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm all for Comedy Sparring between Morris Day and Jerome Benton, because these two stole each of their scenes. But what was a woman funny about throwing in a trash? This is normal nasty! The other nasty bit was the prince's father worried on the floor provided by Minnapolis police, which caused Prince to mock more !! Fantastic !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But then again the film gives another theory about our Prince and his music, because the film tells us The Prince of that movie, Wandi, Lisa and Prince's wife beat the musical father! <br /> <br /> <br /> And the filmmakers are trying to tell us that Prince finds his father's song lyrics and steals all his best songs from his father? Maybe Prince started out of steam during the 90's because he escaped from the ideas of his ancestors ............ Humma .....
