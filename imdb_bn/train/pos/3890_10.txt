This is a wonderful stand-up DVD! Eddie Izard I've seen the most interesting person. Its routine is pleasing and it makes for great conversations with others watched. I highly recommend this one. While the history of Europe is slightly slow, the French's last jokes are quite good, because you can not speak French to get it (even if you do, it's still fun). Also, part about being a transvestite is quite good. The first scene (about San Francisco) is not cool, but it's fun for the first time. You can leave on those who can It's not nearly valuable. However, this is a really fun, funny stand up show that everyone will see. "I was dead at that time!"
