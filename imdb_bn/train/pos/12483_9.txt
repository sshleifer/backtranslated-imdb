Although I played part of Sheriff Hughes in this movie, it still jumped me in different places and believed me that I am not so easy. You might say that I favor the film, and, okay, me, but I did not see the finished product until 12/27/2006 and was very happy. I like the old "B" movies and the black and white Saif Fay movies, not just the Horror Film fan. This movie will make you think of something "happen", when it's going to happen, it does not happen, then it does. It will keep you completely off balance When I first suggest to show the film, the director's notes and special features. It is very well written, directed and illustrated and I can personally tell you that it is a real pleasure to work with this cast and crew. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Lawrence's future projects.
