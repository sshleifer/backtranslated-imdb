Actually my vote is 7.5. Anyway, the movie was good, it's a fun part that is worth watching it, I do not get it wrong, it's not the world's most fun movie, and it's also not original because it's an idea we've seen before, but it's a different taste, A friend told me that there was a movie for these lovers ... I think it's okay but who does care? Also another movie which shows almost the same thing to us, Chris Rock appears in him, name down-to-earth, men, it's a very funny movie, if you want to see both and I know that you agree that Mr. Rock won his movie. I like that the character's male character was given to Ashton Kutcher, but the film is good.
