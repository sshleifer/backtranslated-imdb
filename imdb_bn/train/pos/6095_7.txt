I'm a little confused about this. The show is terrible, the act is horrific (even when we act like a real name act like Brad Pitt and Bill Moselle), the dialogue is neutral, and some 50s educational briefings that seemed to be ethical / ethical in every episode. You will not be afraid of any moment from this episode, and Robert Englund's comoos are small, unmatched, and a little smaller, like the most fun home videos in America. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it is one of the most fun things on television. 80s fashion, soft focuses, actors always look like them in the viewer's view, the material in the premises is more self-parody than the horrors, so we are left with an episode where a high school child is afraid of the failure of his SAT, his girlfriend Dump him and his parents will deny him, someone else will fear that he will be kept in prison because he A humble mom (played by her husband Brad Pitt), someone else is afraid that all the parents who are away from the world are in the league against him, the other is afraid that he will be confused with his socially annoying young man, and someone else will be scared if he Without breaking the mother and the father-in-law, he will be killed in order to have a party in his house. The list continues and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They are dreams, I think I would go to see shiny plot points and devices, but they are far from the left field that there is no chance for writers to actually scare the viewers. You are wearing some 80-night-themed nightmares, which give bad conversations to the Hamy Fashion and create illogical decisions that do not work for any other purpose, but move the story to the next peculiar plot point (usually showing as a peripheral character). Our main character becomes helpless and is very disappointed to do something about it). <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something that scares you, then you'll be far away. On the other hand, 80 seconds of the most fun things on the other hand if you are looking for See it. It was recently shown on Chilar TV (much more every day) and I have seen before, out of terrible curiosity, and now I can get a good smile every day. This is the most fun thing to officially present on TV with the arrest of off-air development and additional.
