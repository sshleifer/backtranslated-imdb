It is difficult to keep the film in many ways in different ways. Everything works really well here; All the first rates of casting, acting, scripting, and cinematography. For the film, it is a moving, love lovers and stories of human liberation war. For film critics, there are lots of sharp techniques and technical capabilities. There are some strategic flaws, and as discussed in boards, there is a lack of reality if the CIA agent strictly with the training angle. However, instead of following the practical method of the CIA agent, I gradually praised his soul without considering the result of Ultimate, because it was more than running.

An excellent soundtrack, great writing, flawless welding and firm performance across the board makes it a top 100 (or better) movie.
