I really enjoyed 60's. I'm not waiting for that generation (I'm waiting for "80"), it was interesting to see a unique four-hour capsule for that era. <br /> <br /> The film was a big problem, but how it was unbalanced was the picture of the family picture. According to the promotion, I watched the movie on NBC, this story was originally related to the conflict in America in 1960 about two families related to the conflict. Now, I missed something, but I think we learned more about the white family than the African American family. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I . <br /> <br /> Very good movie!
