My friend Peter Jackson had the idea of ​​viewing the Return of the King of Animated LOTR. So I finally bought it ebay, starting from the beginning I thought it was being sucked. Actually, it was not really bad since I think it will be. Animation was good for its time, they used a unique method of combining live action with animation to create some interesting effects, and the freak voice voice made some sounds like Elias Wood. <br /> <br /> One of the biggest adaptations of a book, but believe me, I saw a lot worse. It omits several things, because both fellowship and the two towers are compressed into two-hour movies. Definatley might be a watch price, like kids, but still, no comparison with absoutley Peter Jackson Trilogy.
