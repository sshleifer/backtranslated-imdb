One must definitely be awake and do not have to enter this movie (and I have also seen a few Hindi and Bollywood movies). Actors, beautiful settings, location, and surroundings, illustrated deep emotion, sweet songs (especially the voice of the Udyan Narayan song, my beloved) - everything was beautiful. Humans (imperfect) elements are also knitted, some have been allowed to make plays and plotters, as well as to have hearty resolutions. Alak Nath is such a horrible actor, so he is open with the passion of the characters described, he stole the show from almost young star. I really recommend this movie to anyone who truly loves romance - who goes outside of the real love beyond the glorious beauty - one of the best movies in Hindi or otherwise!
