When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would look like Duchess (2008), but when I saw the first 30 minutes of The Young Victoria, I knew it was not a tough movie. Almost all of the movies are excellent, the dresses are really amazing and the settings are also shot nicely. <br /> <br /> The only thing that throws me down is performance. The star of Emily Blant (The Devil Wears Preda) movie, she brings Victoria to life, and through this movie she sees that she is a great actress and perhaps her first Oscar nomination for performance. Rupert Fray Prince Albert is almost as blue but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also difficult as Lord Melbourne, although I expect more of his. Jim Broadbint and Miranda Richardson both supported the role but forgot. <br /> <br /> I think the film is incomplete. Screenlitters may have changed many things in the script, I do not know, but how do I feel about this movie? <br /> <br /> But overall it's a great movie about a great performance in Victoria's first years. From Emily Blunt.
