I voted for this movie for some minor child errors due to 8 votes. Other than that, this movie is my favorite one! It's entertaining for the least to say. Although shooting scenes are ridiculous, and I think that GÃ¤tte (who wrote the book) takes a lot of "matrix obsession". It seems that their enemies are just standing ... waiting to shoot. However, this movie touches the touch and it always makes me cry. It has a lot of humor so that it lets me laugh too. Gackt is a fantastic actor I must say. He looks so passion. This was the first time Hyde was acting and she's OK. The role fits him. Wang Lee Home is absolutely great. The whole cast I would say, is suitable for this movie. Do not miss it! You will register it!
