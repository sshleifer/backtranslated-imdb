Love or hate it, it's not hard to take Warren Bitzy's "Dick Tracy" to the 1990 film adaptation, Chester Gould's famous comic strip, which is less artistic than the style. In recent years superhero films have come out of woodwork, and can soon become a genre of their own. <br /> <br /> The BT movie deeply uses Gold's source material with full effect, this is the primary coloring of shooting in these six streets, and thus the trigger-happy mutant gangster and loose, a lovely visual style of seductive women and tone is unique to this unique yet known Provide the world. <br /> <br /> It can be said that the film's strong visual aesthetic changes in tuning and their acting ability, which I think may be more from the truth. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is ready to bind her appearance and terrible character, and Beatty herself, who is dogged playing and invisible to the title, the appropriate creator and the bad expenses at any and all costs. <br /> <br /> An intriguing look without visual make-up and Oscar-winning makeup, and big boy Caprice (Al-Pacino, delicious over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance), Aci in a precise move, but under all the fighter Unite the gang wants to control all criminal activities across the city. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Caring (Charlie Coursema), who has finally found Father's image to look at our crime-barbarous hero. The trust of Tasee's trail was tested by the enticing progress of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also the Chief Skevel of Big Boy. At the same time, all this is happening, when a new criminal comes to the city town, everything gets hot and the two parties decide to play against the middle. <br /> <br /> Perfect good, such as the focus of the Batiyas, becomes the center of the strained and romantic relationships between each lead, which only opposes the focus on unnecessary steps and special effects. Pacino chews up a role scenery that is standout from the rest freely. <br /> <br /> "Dick Tracy" is one of the best and most overlooked in the movie section of the comic book. I think if Chester Gould is still alive, then his favorite crime-warring detective agency Warren will be proud of Batty. <br /> <br /> 8/10
