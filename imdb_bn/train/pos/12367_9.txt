Well, after watching a few clips in Bravo's 100-square movie movie, I was looking forward to this movie. The plot was simple, beautiful model Alison Parker (Christina Renaiss) headed towards an apartment building, which is the entrance to Hell. Sentinel is a slow motion film, though it is a slow motion. This is a mixture of omen and Rosemary baby. The acting is fine, and some really annoying bits such as dead parents and hungry female cakes eat and the middle of the middle of the middle of the heart is painful kittens, distorted people and the strange mix of cancer. This is a very weird, but ultimately, I believe in a great film! One of my favorites from 70, even if it does not have any roots. It's painful and extremely vague! Probably my favorite one of all time. 9/10
