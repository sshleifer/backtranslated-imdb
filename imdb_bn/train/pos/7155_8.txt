More than just a "kids" movie, "Holles" shows how past events affect us today, whether we know about them or not. When teenage Stanley Yellnats III (Shiite Leibouf) was sent to jail where he was forced to dig all day, he discovered a number of things about the camp and discovered his personal connection. Through Flashbacks, we learn that many things are far more than us, (it can be better understood when you see the movie). LeBoeuf is a fantastic good work, as other cast members: Sigre Weaver, John Voight, Team Blake Nelson, Henry Winkler, Patricia Arquette, and Earth Kitt. A very interesting movie.
