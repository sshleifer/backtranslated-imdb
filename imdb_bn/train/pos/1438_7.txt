Full sign of passino rendering for lecture on the deceased child's coffin; Shakespeare's Mark Anthony will be shocked !! <br /> <br /> Was it Paul Scrder or should Cain Lippar praise the extraordinary dialogue? They are rich and intelligent and if you prefer movies with your script good movie then your price is good. I got the story story very well until the voice-over postScript. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to talk about in this movie; Even John Cusack has a better role than this one. Interestingly, this film is very male-based - women are just complementary.
