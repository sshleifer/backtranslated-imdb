When I saw this picture in London in 1958, I was bowled over. I have not seen such a film before. It was a weird, hypnotic effect, which I saw before and it had a lasting effect. It has mostly effected. <br /> <br /> I believe that Odil Vernosaj and Marina Vallady sisters, if not a pair. Of course, the interaction is amazing in the ability to influence the viewer. <br /> <br /> If it is converted to DVD - in Region 2 format - and in the original French language, I can hear about it and where it can be purchased.
