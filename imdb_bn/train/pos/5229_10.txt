This movie has received awesome ratings from everyone who voted here, but I'm here to tell you that if you like movies like Dude Whits My Car and Dome and Picture, it's for you. If you were to quarrel at a different angle between movies like Citizen's and Casablanca's IDs Still I still like this movie and everything about it, even if it is the kind of "Kiddy" but it is one of my films and my friends have been able to keep quotations in years and years. Awesome movies. This movie should be the reason for AFI Number 1 because it is so freuggan 'high class. The only problem with this movie is that you may have trouble viewing this because it has been made for a TV movie that no longer exists. So I do not know how to get this movie, I would like to buy DVD but I can not find it anywhere. When I first got it tapped from it, you can come and see if you can sleep it but you can come. These movies rock and basically all that you will know.
