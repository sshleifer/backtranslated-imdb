Harmfully, America's 98% of the most spoken Spanish language in the 2008 New York Film Festival. Additional film debate started at the Cannes Festival. Love-hate was noticeable, and there was enough doubt about the commercial potential. The star, Bencao del Toro, as a consoler, got the best actor award here. I'm talking about Steven SÃ¶nderberg's 'Che'. This version is going on in this version, which is shown like cans in two hour-plus segments, without opening the title or end credits of New York. Ernesto "Che" Guevara is almost everywhere, while Che is definitely worthwhile. Del Toro is hanging reliably through impressive, thick and thin, in weeks of humiliating defeat in weeks, disgraceful and sympathetic in all its diversities, even incognito as sneaky gray gray person in Bolivia. . This is a terrific performance; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thankfully, Universal has decided to make a film decision in Spanish (although some actors, in the English section Oddly, especially wood). You've got a good outline like guerrilla battlefield, Che Style: teaching, campingin's appointment, morality, governance, hardship and war - as well as morphing from the company's doctor in Cher, developed by the military leader. The new 9-pound 35mm-quality red "digital high performance cine camera" is used which is available during filming on DG Peter Andrews and his crew, which is a bit cold, but can sometimes sing and always sharp and smooth. <br /> <br /> There are two parts in the picture - Soderberg is calling them two "movies", and plans to liberate them commercially. The first is 'Argentine,' Che's leadership in the jungle and in the city, which led to the fall of Havana in the late 50's, and the second 'guerrilla', and the failed attempts of China were a development in Bolivia almost a decade later. Revolution, a result of which led to capture and execution in Guayaar in 1967. The second part was the original movie and the first was written and it seems like it was shot first. Producer Laura Bakerford says that part two is more than a thriller, but part is an action film with a big fight scene. Yes, but there are many similarities between the two parts - too much - because both of them follow guerrillas through rough country and spend a large part of their time. Since the Bolivian rebellion began, guerilla gave an unexplained condemnation. The Cuban group, which tried to handle it, did not receive friendly reception from the Bolivian campsins, who suspected foreigners and considered the Cuban communists as cruel rapists. In 1964, a third of a celebrated black and white space formed by the speech of Che in the United Nations, and there is a third part of the interview with him, but it is the first segment inter-cut. In the first part, there is Fidel and it is even more enthusiastic, because of victory in Santa Clara in 1959, it led to the fall of Fulzensio Batista in Cuba to the dictatorship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In Mexico, Fidel can go to Guevara's lucky meeting and to be listed on 26th June. July movement There may be more about his extensive travel and diplomatic missions. It is from the whole picture of man, his interest in eternal childhood, his life interest in poetry, he wrote books; Even his international reputation is only touching. And what about his harsh, cruel aspects? In fact, Soderberg's most interest is not che, revolution and guerrilla war. 4+ hour holidays have been spread through wounded and sick men and women through forests and jungle, by offering ideological sacrifices to end the oppression of the rich. Some have reminded the Terrence owner of 'The Teen Red Line' and yes, the scary, epic warfare system is the same; But there are strong characters in the 'thin red line' (rarely, except for Che, someone is forced), and this is a really good movie. This is an impressive, but incomplete and unfortunate, effort. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Radical editing - or big extension - it can do something more successful, and it is a long slogan, especially in the second half. <br /> <br /> It is clear that this slogan can be pruned down, though it is not so clear how the result was taken by the film - but it was quite a bit of luck though.
