I love this movie, Juvente, Earlty, Blair, Carney ... Almost everything has already been told about the movie, but there is a detail that I want to highlight: any footage of the reality, still standing, Hotel Du Nord (it still has ? I heard that it was destroyed ...) used for the film - the whole scene was rebuilt on the set, the main reason is that they are in St. Artina canal traffic could not stop. For several weeks.
