I think this movie is very funny, I like how I created it in modern day sports politics. This movie is not funny as the south park but it's quite funny. And since I'm a sports fan I like how fun fun is some more fun in sports. This film is very good for the great sports enthusiasts, probably good for them, because their life must definitely be surprised why people follow so much insane rules and the intrinsicity of sports, and actually why not stop playing games so close to nothing. I also think the original game is interesting, it is like horses and horse-drawn psychics (for the person shooting). Overall, I recommend you watch this movie and believe that you will end up loving this movie. But if you do not have this style of comedy your favorite then you probably will not like it. (But with any comedy movie)
