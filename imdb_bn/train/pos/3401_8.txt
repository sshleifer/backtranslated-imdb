Advanced Technicolor Cinematography (Winner of special technical achievements) is really amazing. A romantic movie like Marlin Dietrich and Charles Boyer covers an endless variety of dreams and you've got rather a nice "picture". <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the unfortunate plots leave aside acting as well as over-bright. Nevertheless, this (1936) did not have any more exciting technicolar films before, and then rarely could this be the top of this exciting visual experience. Filmmakers who have enjoyed glorious color painting in "Robin Hood" (1938), "Jesse James" (1939) and "Gone with the Win" (1939) will not be disappointed with the fantastic works done here. "Garden of Allah" will always be synonymous with a bright color film.
