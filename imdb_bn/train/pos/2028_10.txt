Barlingson and Thornton have played outstandingly in this movie with Denhey. Although it is considered to be the first love, it really turns out to be deeper than it. The beauty of nature holds this film, which I have ever seen placed in the best one. Horse scene is absolutely fantastic !! Any horse boyfriend will love this movie! <br /> <br />
