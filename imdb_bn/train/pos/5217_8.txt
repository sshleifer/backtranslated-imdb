I grabbed the movie late at night, and I was happy. I can only imagine because this film is not even more familiar, because it is very annoying. But you can manage issues of sexual abuse, it is a well-played, suspenseful and very interesting movie. Both Richard Gere and Claire Dines are very good at this. And although the matter is not for frustration, the film is not going to be brutal (eg 8 mm). <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and mystery type movie.
