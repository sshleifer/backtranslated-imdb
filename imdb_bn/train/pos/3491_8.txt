Cast is nice, good acting, the plot is interesting, confusing mysterious ... but it is difficult to stop all elements in a movie that is almost 80 minutes long. If it takes more time to develop plots and subplots, it will have a better effect. Another 30-minute substance can be a very good film rather than a good one.
