One of the more intelligent comedians to hit the Hindi film screen. The remake of Boeing Boeing in Dear Malaysia's Maya Maya 80, which was later a remake of Holiwanan's 60 characters, Garm Masala highlights humor in Hindi cinema. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is proven that one of the best super stars in Hindi cinema can do a comedy. He has met well with New Hong Kong John Abraham. However, John still remains in non-permanent shades and fails to emerge on occasion. <br /> <br /> New cheeks are beautiful and their role fully judged. <br /> <br /> A comedy will be seen. Leave your brain away and smile for 2 hours !!!! After all the smile is the best medicine! Ask Priyadarshan and Akshay Kumar !!!!!
