After reading the other reviews of this movie on IMDB, apparently there is a consensus among these pigeons that this film is nothing like those books based on it. At this point I can not actually comment, I've never read any of the dramatic literature ever before. However, I can certainly say that it strikes me that many critics must surely have the feeling of comedic bypass; Let's be honest here - this picture is so funny! <br /> <br /> OK? .. So I must admit this fact that the picture apparently does not represent the character but it is a clear perspective ?? .. Does not the same person who is carping about this image also remain faithful for the character of real DC comic books? Or perhaps there is unrest among the same people that the version of the flash version of Gordon in the 1980s was far more than the original series? <br /> <br /> The point is yes, this image is incredibly camped but it's just <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Having a force with their own role Also look for a very brief but highly welcome appearance by the scary movie favorite Michael Berryman. <br /> <br /> Best scene? Sayes and his men pose the ultimate mistake of ordering the order of coke, lemon and milk on the occasion of the ceremonial occasion, and check the expressions of the sunny words received by the waiter! There is also a well-known scene at the end of the movie, where Sage uses Namesis Captain Says to use different martial arts disciplines that are labeled on the screen! ?? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the great fun from the beginning! (And you'll sing the theme adapted to John Philippe Sosa for sure day after day!)
