The disciplined, but largely mildude of living, which was well-connected to the author / director Pilat's autobiographical account based on interviews with lead Isabel Huppert; It does not get any congratulations because of his involvement with mainly incomparable characters - and he seemed frustrated, Huppert further said that the pilot often spawn the shoot! <br /> <br /> The acting is very nice, however; Despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (title character!) Were already in front of the modern French stars - a status with different degrees of success, they still hold this day. <br /> <br /> I have 3 more Pyalat films while receiving my "VHS to Watch", though in French without all the English subtitles; Because of this fact, but iron outrageous realism - despite its inadequate artwork - I can not say that I'm in a special moment to check them out now ...
