I saw this photo at the Imagina Festival Ant-Premier in Munacote. <br /> <br /> I saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, I was waiting to see the final results. I'm not disappointed. <br /> <br /> This is a complete 3D movie which render high contrast black and white. Certainly inspired by some comic books, such as more than F. Miller. In this optic, it goes one step further than R. Rodriguez's excellent "Sina City" adaptation. This time, (almost) no gray or middle color, but a graphic style has never been seen before in a realistic animated film. (Scanners can not wait in the dark) <br /> <br /> Much of life's life and credibility with the use of motion captures and we can soon forget the technical outlook such as paying attention to more classic elements such as directions or plots. The direction is calm and controlled despite the medium's infinite prospects, and it's really a fantastic surprise. <br /> <br /> The story of the future (Paris 2053) makes it a classic fantasy movie and ends up maintaining interested visitors. In spite of being a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond the previous expectations) the atmosphere and some interesting repetitive themes (full power of genetics, specific companies ...) give this film a great interest. <br /> <br /> This is an animated film, it is probably not made for children. You will not find any fun pet or moody family, just cold reality here. This is a good movie near the silence. <br /> <br /> I saw that this setting is one of the best aspects of the film: we still feel the familiar Paris, but it is wasted by a delicate touch. Prediction <br /> <br /> However, I'm sorry for some mistakes. Montage is sometimes a little flat, one or two very close slow effects and some poor dialogs. While the technology is remarkable, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (somewhat like "Final Fantasy"). These little things make it 7/10 <br /> <br /> Together, this is a successful artistic challenge that you can see if you can. Director, Christian Volcano, knows how it is not possible to trap (Fortunately, they did not ask John Woo to work!). Finally, it is a film with a visible visible scene, an intelligent story and an amazing art direction. See if you can! <br /> <br /> Please forgive me for spelling mistakes.
