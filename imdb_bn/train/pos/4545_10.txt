I recently saw this movie. After 2 hours, my head still hit from smiles. The plot was so awful, the jokes were very bad, but what I did not count was: <br /> <br /> 1. 2 scenes (which was more than enough of a smile) before and after the Pat and J-limp movie <br /> 2. <br /> <br /> This movie is 20 times better than the Rush Hour series, and my copy came even with a publisher even if you did not like the movie. Send HBO certificates. Although I thought it was the date it was sent to you in January 1991 (which could be a cause for disappointment).
