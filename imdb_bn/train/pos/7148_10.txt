This movie strongly recommends one. It is a son Stanley Yellnats (Shia le Bouwf), who has been wrongly convicted and sent Camp Green Lake to a detention center of a boy. There, he forced to dig 5 feet deep and 5 feet diameter hole. There he met (Zero, Magnet, Armit, Squid, X-Ray, and Zigzag) with other boys of the camp. They are all excavated, not to 'make quality', but to find out the treasures of Kate Barlow. Stanley can learn more about filming (and books), more about herself, and digging holes. I give this movie 9.5, because I'm very much interested in books in movies, I (I want to follow the movie's book properly). But, still it did not do well.
