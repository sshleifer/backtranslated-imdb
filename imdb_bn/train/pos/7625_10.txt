Although Cart Russell was the closest person to the show and business, like Alves, many things were false in this movie. First, the makers claim that Elvis opened his famous live show in '69 after a 9-year strike for film with a white jumpsuit case in 1962. They also claimed that he used to sing 'burning love' which he first sang in 1972, and in the 1970s he wrote 'The Astony'. He claimed that he got his first guitar for Christmas when all AVC fans knew he had found it for his birthday. I know everything lying on the past based on the past but this thing is very clear to those who love Avis.
