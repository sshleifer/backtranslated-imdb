A brilliant show. End with the first mystery, where the second season begins. Most suspense, not all episodes and mysteries everywhere. One that reminds me and thinks again. It's really amazing how the author can come out with all the connections and link all the letters together and make the life of the hobby characteristic of these elements as meaningful. Never fails excites and I'm looking forward to the new season. Hopefully more secrets will be released and at the same time, more mystery will be resolved. Very good selection for this show, fit perfectly character. Finally finally can not wait to discover the secret. I hope all the promotions will not end.
