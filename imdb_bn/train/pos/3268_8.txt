A charming romantic comedy. The plot is a bit complicated - I tried three times short and I can not. It is worth the price to see. The movie is funny, beautiful - the plot is totally unreal but it works. Everyone in the movie is so beautiful and likes to see everything - it creates a sweet, romantic feeling through the whole film. <br /> <br /> Great acting - Robert Doni Jr. and Cyber ​​Shepherd are at the top and they are enjoying every second. Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are fine but fine. If you are a sucker for the good, sweet image (like me), catch this one. Doni also looks great in his underwear! <br /> <br /> Additional Bonuses - Singing songs of Jonny Mathies and singing songs and songs by Peter Cattery and another great song "Offer All".
