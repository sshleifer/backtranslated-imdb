An entertaining Kung Fu film with acting, plot and battle scene, a cut above the average chop socky. Casts are all characters and skilled martial artists. Alexander Fu-Cheng's proto-Jackie Chan tries to watch the comedy Antics and his strong partner looks especially impressive. For me, the only shining flaw in the film is Cast size - sometimes movies are confused, because the film changes and changes in various subclasses and some letters do not swell completely, as anyone can wish. <br /> <br /> <br But the Qungfu film should be judged first and foremost for the quality of the trial, and the Shawlin Temple is definitely the calculation Depending later. The film is finalized with a high-body war, allowing each character to show its competence to the competitor. <br /> <br /> Overall, the Shaolin Temple is a low-budget Kung Fu movie. Good Jet Li is not on the quality of the film, but it is definitely worth its fans. My rating: 8/10 Various notes: I saw the 1987 Warner Home Video release (predictably) dubbed, and there is a complete cast and crew credits lacking.
