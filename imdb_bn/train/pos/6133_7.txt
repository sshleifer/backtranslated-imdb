The best ever low budget horror film of all time. When I was about nine years old, I saw this movie, and not telling me that it was afraid of me. Now that I'm all grown up, I actually see this movie ... a talented one. Everyone, or at least with any taste, have dreamed that they are going to kill volunteer people, even if they do not accept it. I've always been really frightened about Snowwheel, so naturally, such a horrible junk myself, Aimovi became a dream come true. Some people say that this movie is stupid, or else an intelligence is void ... This is a movie about a serial killer Snowman, what did you expect? It is also very objectionable for anyone who gave this film a low score, to sit back and catch a fool-fishing and cheerful gore. For what I love this movie, a comedy, and the film industry does not grow until it creates an incredibly awesome glimpse of a killer snowman (which, unfortunately, seems impossible), I will hold this awful piece of indie awful near my heart forever.
