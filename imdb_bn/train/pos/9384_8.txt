A wonderful example of "Cowboy Noor", it is said, among which Baker Michael (Nicholas Cage) lost a job because he claimed to be strong (he got a left leg), to be honest. With nothing he can not do, he once decided to lie. When he walks a bar, and Mallei Owen (late, great jetty Walsh) makes a mistake for Hit-Man, whom Owen has hired to make his sexy young Suzanne (Laur Fleen Boal well), Michael plays along and takes Waynes' money Do it. * Then * he goes to Suzanne and tells about the purpose of his spouses, and to get rid of wine * his * money! If this is not too complicated, then the actual hit-man, "Lyle of Dallas" (Dennis Hooper, shows a perfect role for him), and Michael has more problems than before. <br /> <br /> "Red Rock West" finds a lot of places. Director John Dahl, who co-wrote the script with his brother Rick, was smart at realizing the possibility of a story in a truly isolated small town, which may have seen better days and residents may be involved in any skim. . If it decides to abandon their policies and reach a level of temptation, then if an honest person faces such problems, it is a fun idea. This is an extraordinary dark and twist-laden story with a storehouse of original characters that is morally compromised like at least Michael if it is not corrupt. Cinematographer Mark Rashwski's light sparks his mood Even a graveyard climax lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing. Although writings are not particularly "logical or credible," there is a great way for the film's audience to confuse and accurately draw them properly. <br /> <br /> The castle works well for leadership, but his co-stars have a big old time drowning their teeth between their muscles and greed-inspired characters. Hooper, Boyle, and Walsh have fun to see these parts. Timothy Carhat and Dan Shore are well-known as Walsh's deputies (a particularly good turn, Walsh is also local Sheriff) and country and western star Dyet Yakam has an entertaining cameo role, who enjoys the film with an enjoyable final achievement. Toon <br /> <br /> It is very well worth checking out a small film. It goes ahead at an impressive speed, and if something else is certainly not annoying. <br /> <br /> 8/10
