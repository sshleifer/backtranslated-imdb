If you have not already seen this movie of Mary-Kate and Ashley, then what I can say is: "What are you waiting for?" It's still another awesome and wonderful movie, we all know and love fraternity! It's fun, romantic, exciting and absolutely breathing (according to the scenery)! Of course; As always, Mary-Kate and Ashley here are the main scenes anyway! Any other fan wants it any other way? Of course not! Anyway; It's a great movie in every sense of the word, so if you have not seen it already then you have it right now! I mean so much now! So what are you waiting for? I promise that you will be disappointed! Sincerely, Rick Morris
