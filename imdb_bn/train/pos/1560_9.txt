This is a reunion, a party, and a great episode of Justice. From hesitation to resolution, Clark created an important leap from a troubled teen who was scared of a controlled destiny, who, like a nobleman, a green arrow, has prepared some of his loved ones to save his or her whole planet. This is not just an exciting story about teamwork, loyalty, and friendship; What is more important in this life decision, is a lesson for Clark. I do not want to end the series, but I hope the upcoming episodes will show up without a "rewind" justice, and stick to it strictly and there is a great end to the younger brother and a great start to Superman. <br /> <br /> In this episode, we must have seen more contrasts between the Lexus and the team. Nine stars will pay enough credit.
