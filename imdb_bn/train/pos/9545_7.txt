I do not know whether fans of "Tetsuo" recommend this film. Why "Tetsuo"? Because you can easily label some things about this movie as easily as "Tetsuo" Rip Off. The idea is the same, the edit is equally horrible and fast - which is good, because it makes the movie more dynamic, it hides some errors due to low budget and other reasons. <br /> <br /> In the case of "complex machine", at least in the case of sex and "macaw machine", converting humans into something that is partly called a machine (known word?) "good robor" (too The original) is due to thin little aliens. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This slim little scam from outer space actually uses humans as ships for their gladiator games that they play with each other. They oppress the body, keep the insane amount in any mechanical parts and do not throw them out of nowhere and make a killing machine targeted by other good roborgs. Their goal is to overcome another foreigner in another Necroborg, crush it to the corpse and eat it. <br /> <br /> All, the plot sounds a bit silly and I did not expect much, but at the end I really enjoyed this picture. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this is a low budget flick, but it is still relatively decent. Do not expect much from the actors, they are not very good, but it can be tolerated. I like the atmosphere and Gore, guided and executed ways in some wretched situations and movies. Although the story is not very original, it is a special attraction to me - to me <br /> <br /> <br /> 10.
