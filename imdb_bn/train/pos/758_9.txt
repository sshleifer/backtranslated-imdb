I knew the same program as Jacques, and I saw one or two episodes in the freeway, and it's the same, even more extreme. Originally gathered in the love of three Welsh boys and a crazy British blockbuster skateboarding, and completely anti / mesokistic pleasure to harm themselves and their health and safety. They were rubbing, eating pubes-covered pizza, nestles stinging, nude paint balls, jokes on small people, sleeping during sleep, stunts in place of work etc. Army, Cowboys, and many more crazy stunts that suddenly make, obstruction, blood and vomiting, not just for themselves. Matt Priorchard Starard has done a lot, Dan Joyce (British) who is doing a lot of physical stuff and laughing at it and doing so much to the five (Mike Lock), but smaller, fat and lazy are more popular. It was the number of 100 great fun moments. very good!
