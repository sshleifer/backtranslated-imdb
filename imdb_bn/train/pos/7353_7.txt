This movie can be the most intimate movie of Bollywood's history. In 1994, it had all the best performance, music and direction in Blockbuster. Remember I was in Allahabad during this movie and Holi was somewhere in March. People played the highest amount of "Oh Amma" song in their voice loudspeaker. If anyone likes to watch Hot and Drills in Marilyn Monroe, then he will have to watch this movie. Upload up to Govinda. How many of you know that this image was shot in South India and some might be shot on the blockbutter to hit the silver screen. Movies like these Indian comedies will never die.
