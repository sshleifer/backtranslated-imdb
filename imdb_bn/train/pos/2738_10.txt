I have not seen this in 20yrs, but I still remember something about it. <br /> <br /> This image could not be painted. Stark grays do it, and life was really really that of the 1950's ?? My memory is going to leapfrog Perry Smith. Just before his fall, he breathed his breath down. I do not think that I can see again ... once a lot. It's like the unnamed man who got dragged into the guillotine terror at the beginning of "Papilon". It should have been included in the last 10 minutes of "I Wide to Live" that the person said in a double bill with "Dad Man Walking". <br /> <br /> My ancestors "Aristos" in 1794-95, my feeling of guilt is rather intense for the gallotine.
