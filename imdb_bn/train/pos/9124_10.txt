Regardless of some suspicious performances (musicians at the end of the day there), Quintin Turinone's term is "the best rock movie of all time ... time" <br /> <br /> Think of 8 miles, but without raping - a young musician, to the local community Trying to prove yourself, struggling to deal with a broken house and rival band. Drop into sex interest and really extraordinary performance, it's real 8 miles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Spectacular performance. Do not forget about some of the best rock / pop / fun music you will ever hear.
