Q.E.D. There was a brilliant TV series and it was really one of the very little pricing! I suspect that in this era of TIO and recording devices that would be much better than it was in 1982. I look forward to waiting for her DVD! It is true that some of it's commoners are junior to other television shows like The Wild, Wild West, The Beerkates and Brisco of the Adventures, all of which I am a huge fan, QED, it's a much more intelligent Had quality. It did not suffer for it, however - the dialog was malicious and the verb was high. The program ran as a mastermind in the UK, and felt a bit of the BBC, but better production prices were generally in that era than the BBC. <br /> <br /> The series ran primarily when I was a young boy and there was a lot of things in my life to spend time on television. My favorite mom remembers, but to remind me, Dr. Was there, and we would sit in the phone and see it together. Wonderful memory <br /> <br /> Verily, the question and answer This is a tragic loss and, if it can be done with today's same values ​​and values, I would like to see it a comeback.
