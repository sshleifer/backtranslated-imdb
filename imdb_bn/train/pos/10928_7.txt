A deceased dog Fu Master sent a banned banquet member to ban member of the previous five students to ban his last student. He wants to see if he is doing well and if he can not stop them, the master wants that the student wants to find another member of the tribe who ran through groups of money, which the master wants to use better. Previous students were taught various style snakes, centipedes, scorpions, girls, toads, when the last student taught a little in each style. All students are searching for the old man with all the money, and soon everyone is fighting to get money. <br /> <br /> The title of the classic martial arts is titled that even many non-fans know. I talk to some casual fans and it seems to be a movie that stick their head. This is a very good movie, although I'm not really sure why this movie is with the people because I have more movies than Shu Studio for my money (for example, an armed Swordman or Brave conduct series). It is not because the film is not sold, because the film is made like a mystery structure, there is no source of heroes, and no one knows that Vishnu knows himself well, while others are two. We got four identities, but we still have to do the fifth thing to do. In addition to a training sequence at the beginning of the film, the movie is strange for the martial arts film about old people and the killing of his family for money, it is not a step for about 40 or 45 minutes. It's a bold step to do it but it closes to keeping your attention on the plot and performance. (This film is also impossible that its first martial art film I think there is no woman in which I have ever seen, I do not think that one has a role and I am sure there is no sign in the background, there is no indication that it hit me Some.) This is a good firm small film that can not achieve its fame in some circles, but it's really a bit of a round trip with your couch Film. </ br> <br /> About 7 out of 10
