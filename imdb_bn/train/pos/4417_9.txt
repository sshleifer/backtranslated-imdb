This image is a lyricist and romantic memoir in the eye of an eleven year old boy living in a rural Cuban city of the year. It is probably a truly worthy labor labor of love. <br /> <br /> The name of Kuba Library and Kuban Blawd is a mistake attempting to market as a film. Julia's dream makes much sense. It is more common with European movies than Rambo and the revolution is just a disadvantage of people's daily lives and businesses. This phenomenon only makes the film more honest in comparison to most of the work related to this time in Cuban history. <br /> <br /> The excessive use of the voice story makes the story weak, but the film makes it incompetent. The clips of Hollywood movies seem to be more visible than the narrator. <br /> <br /> The movie can be compared with paradiso and movies are faded about movies, but this is fair play, but there is an intrinsic pain in losses that is a lifestyle that surpasses lost love. <br /> <br /> Revolution, never ending like a movie jungle.
