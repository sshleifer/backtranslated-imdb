Sam Kleinman (Peter Foke) came to the place of his son unexpectedly. Her son, Ben Kleinman (Paul Reisar), was surprised to hear that his mother, Muriel Kleinman (Olympia Dukakis), left his father. When Ben, wife of Rachel (Elizabeth Parkins) and Ben and his father, saw a farm to sell, he tried to find three sisters, Muriel. But this is not the end of their journey. His road journey turned into a long-standing therapist session between Ben and his father. My people about Raymond de Felita Director Things (2005). Paul is behind the Reais player and he did a great job. The conversation between Ben and Sam is just amazing. And he worked with the script for 20 years, so it is no surprise that it's a good person to play dad better than Peter Falk? Nobody, I can not tell you. And really love the story about why I wanted Paul Folk for the party. Peter was an actor who laughs at his father. And Peter certainly laughs at me in this movie. It only goes to catch laughable fish and how the old man hits the smallest in the pool and then beat him with a stick. The movie is very funny and I smile myself a lot. But it can also touch from time to time. You could not tell a story than it is called here.
