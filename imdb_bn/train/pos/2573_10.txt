When my 14-year-old daughter and her friends are together for the night in the movie, they show a movie which is strong enough to look back over: you guess, K-911, the third installment of the most successful K-9 franchisee is the favorite TV father , Jim Belushi. <br /> <br /> Friends, I knew that VHS tape was possible, but a DVD?! It's often played that is skipping it; Not fun! But of course you will have a movie when you are very beautiful, so bright. <br /> <br /> Of course, thanks to one and only Tom Hendes for our presentation in our favorite capsule style. With Turner and Hooch; However, even that movie does not measure the absolute superiority presented in three K-9 films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Poppycock, I'm saying. Although you might suspect the third video - direct to the video - it does not seem worth it, you will prove yourself wrong after seeing this quality movie. <br /> <br /> I will not leave the plot, but I would say that Balushi and his pinting partner are still giving their best performance - the one who laughs! It is shameful that John Balushi did not know what great action he has seen in his live acting world is not alive. <br /> <br /> I recommend your teenager to present this film to her BFF in her next sleeping party. Do not forget the puppy!
