I want to say that the events of 9/11 did not hurt me until I saw this documentary. It took me a year to get involved in the destruction. I had to change the radio and channel station on TV if there was no talk about the tower. I was sick to hear about it. When it was broadcast on television for a year and a day later, I looked up at my eyes. Since the attack, I shouted for the first time. I highly recommend this documentary. After 5 years I'm watching this on TV, and I'm still crying over tragedy. This tower is one of only one of the only video shots on the ground, which is really amazing. It was an accident, and look where it got them. These two brothers would like to be there to help me.
