The soldier is not a great movie, and everybody who hates it has good reason. But I liked Soldier very much, partly because of my expectations that I was surprised that I saw it. <br /> <br /> First, the industry side was tight and well-executed. As far as science fiction go backdrops, the soldier was working 90% of the section with more design then. All of the sets, dresses and props are executed consistently and efficiently; I did not love all of their future military style, but I was impressed by the effort. For me, show how long it took to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I'm the fan of Cart Russell. I grew up seeing this man among the most memorable movies of this young man ... Barefoot Executive and his John Carpenter film. The soldier is essentially an action movie, and the hero of the Sergeant Todd is an essential action hero. This is not an award winning role, but with very small dialogue, the cart creates strong emotions. Third, fighting scenes and battles are good dance books. It is not iron monkeys or even matrices, but again, it is more than the standard of the standard quality. <br /> <br /> If you do not see it and you like scientist action films, you prefer to pick it if your passage passes Depot. Just do not expect the next Bladerunner.
