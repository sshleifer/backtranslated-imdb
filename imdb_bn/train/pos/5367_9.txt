This movie is one of the most endless films of its time. When you see this movie your action is filled and when nothing is really happy, the humor does not match. Brilliant writing for a film made for bloody mixing for a movie, where criminals are rivals and thirst for blood to the neighboring people. Arnold also does not let anything throw us with us. Its one of the best liners. I do not want to hide anything for you, but when Arnold gives her "I'll be back," then I'll tell you that he got the best response from everyone on this movie. You expect as much as I enjoy this gem.
