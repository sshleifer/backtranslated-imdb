Frankie Deo (Lee Van Clef) is a high-minded person who turns himself into a police or illegal gambling (the reasons seems vague for me). Tony (Tony Lo Bianko) is a low-level thug that makes a pool more frequent and frank Frankie for his free time. By staying in the right place at the right time, Tony Franki is arrested and sent to jail ... where they create ties that can not be friendship, but it will be done right now. <br /> <br /> This picture came to me under the title "Frank and Tony", which is frustrating because I see an alternate name "Mr. Frank and Crazy Tony", which helped sell this film more effectively. I guess it's a tribute to "poor Mary, Crazy Larry" but what do I know? I've seen it soon after the Italian crime film "Fierce Professional", and I'll talk to each other complementally. <br /> <br /> Italianians always lag behind America in their budget and production prices. A real shame with this film. It is considered a "greenhouse" film, it is a B-movie (or worse) that displays it properly. With a cleaner word and picture, it might be a hit on Hollywood, I doubt it. I think the story is very interesting, better than letters (and actor) average and against "violent professionals", this plot is fairly clear - not much more than secondary characters. <br /> <br /> If you like mafia movies or crime films you should try this one. A movie about the reality of Italy (how much more genuine you want?) That you can ask Of course, this is not "The Godfather", but it should not be. It's not a drama, it's a light comedy, heavy-duty friendly film ... "Die Hard with a Reward" from the point of view of the bad guys. Well, that's right, not true. <br /> <br /> <br /> If this is not something else, then I would like to see this film from other directors and policymakers. In addition to "escape from New York" films (where Venklief plays "Haq") and natural culture films What is more fun than a lost classic discovery?
