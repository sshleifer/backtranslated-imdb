Six degrees was hooked to me. I was waiting to come forward and when the trees were replaced at the time of the spot, it was absolutely frustrating. I thought it was just a hindrance and would be back in early 2007. what happened? All my friends are really surprised at it last. We could have related the characters in real problems. We talked about each episode and were our favorite characters. There was no one to hear that I did not like and the acting was fantastic. I want to see the programs being taped where you can locate local areas in the cities. I want to protest the cancellation of this show and ask you to bring it back and give it another opportunity. Give it a good time slot, do not remove it from day to day, and advertise so people can know it.
