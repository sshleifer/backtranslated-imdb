This movie is just funny. Foolish, but funny To fully enjoy this movie, you can not understand how you see a movie like this and enjoy the joke and blame on all sides involved in the film. I still started to find bits at the fun time when he said "want a beer ........ cock". Ridiculous thing But how the film makes it beautiful is that it does not work hard to create a serious spin in the film, many comedy tries to take serious aspects that you do not believe. But this focuses on being different and just funny. Although I must say that Yasmin is not terrible in the film and added nothing but the three main boys, Kop, Rima and the skikk are very funny to watch and the film looks great
