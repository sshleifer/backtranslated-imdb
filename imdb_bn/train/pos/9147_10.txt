In the last three to four years, I really can not believe like Prince Fan that I just got round to see "violet rain". The brand new 2-disc anniversary special edition managed me to buy it. Wow, I was really waiting to see it, but I was not really prepared to actually know how much electric it really was. The musical performances of the Prince throughout the film are not surprising - it's really going on. I've been very familiar with the classic "Purple Rain" album and all his songs (heard from repetition), but in the context of the movie, they completely change your perception of tune and music - like the blue of the computer, beautiful, when angry and rain in the rain. There is something hypnotising indecribably about the scene where the Prince and the Revolution perform. Closed songs Bobby I'm a star and I'll die for the UK. In the mid-20's, how many power and low talent showed up with Prince (he overflow!), It blows me up. It even seems that Michael Jackson is unknown in his peak years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Prince has shown you how your dream girl will win - take him to the lake, jump him up and then run - absolutely sunny <br /> <br /> Scenes of the 1980s and the oddly sunny but associated with the overall attraction of this photo Morris Day Bloc (and Sunny), and when its group The Time Bird is performed, you will see Morris Day and will stir the Miniapolis Fanque style on the Jerome Benton stage - I like their dance at this point and how the Benton mirror is mirror mid- Performs performance. <br /> <br /> I can not wait again, I can not really! Extra horror - especially a young Eddie Murphy admits pre-Beverly Hills Cap, he is a "Prince Group".
