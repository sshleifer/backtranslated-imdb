This movie is really genuine and random. It's really hard to find Hollywood movies like a luncheon. I really enjoy watching this movie, I bought her DVD this week and I saw it four times. I love Pange's Spanglish accent, it's really nice. And its acting and Morgan's funny and normal. <br /> <br /> The taste of my movie may be different from the other, but I want to say that I really like this movie, the simplest is the best! <br /> <I learned something good from this movie (good, or at least in the United States life) ... life is really random ... sometimes you meet someone, they pass by your life and you can be your friend, And you do not spend so much time with them, maybe some time but you enjoy "time" with them, and then you and they will not meet each other again, but you're all together It's really unforgettable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I can rarely learn anything from the movie, but this is an exception.
