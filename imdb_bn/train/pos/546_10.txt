I thought that in a while I saw one of the best signals. Sometimes I felt as if someone wanted to die, the murder of Stanley's killer character was brilliant. This is a good movie that you would like when you were happy and died. My only problem was in some of the scenes that it seemed like a guy that was taking photos with the camera and it was weird. Jade Nelson was at least tricky in my opinion and he was fascinated by the role as Stanley Caldwell. Bright movie
