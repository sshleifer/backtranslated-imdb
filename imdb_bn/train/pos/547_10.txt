I just do not know whether weird or not, but I've enjoyed this movie completely. <br /> <br /> Come back to the cabin with the lake, another sigl by the lake of my favorite movie cabin. Actually, I think I enjoyed this movie more than the first one. I thought the cast of this movie was great, Jod Nelson is always the best! I fully enjoyed the plot. I focused on filming this second film with Stanley's painting cabin Lake - it wasolated one of Stanley's daughters and was not a completely ornamented movie. If you are looking for some deep meaning, then this movie is probably not for you. However, if you are looking for the best way to spend two hours, then proceed and see it. I've probably killed this image at least ten hours already. :)
