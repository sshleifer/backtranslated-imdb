Contrary to popular belief, this title, at least not too bad to me. Actually I regarded it as a preferred film all the time. Wondering the differences between the series, the cast of the stories was not formed very well, but in spite of this, you can see it quite happy. For a feature film of his day, the scene is a good proportion and the characters are consistently reliable. <br /> <br /> Sound / audio track is my personal favorite. Almost everything has the right sound effects and many voices suit the characters better than them, now it is worse that the US dabbles, throwing the opponent. Each shot in sync is perfect. There were some problems with Casting for my 'Alien' voices (Please forgive the unreasonable nomenclature, I've seen it for a while). Otherwise, the cast looked completely balanced. I think and believe in this movie characters Dubs are often an issue I rarely agree very less than before. I love the OSD before, but Casting often leaves the series. <br /> <br /> At this point, I want to add that this was the first one in my life. I have historical value, but when I see the original MEGAZON 23, it is my firm determination and firmness. <br /> <br /> The title of my knowledge has become the US only in Texas. Personally I think it's a big shame. If the right audience was subject to it, I think Robotek the movie will not be acceptable for years. I have been involved with Anime every day of my life and everyone showed me this movie, it kept a beautifully titled title together. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < However, without seeing the original, a visitor will not really notice. Since the animation is similar in style, so there is no reason to ask it again in its day. The UK had very limited access to anime. Laser Disc was the most productive media. Personally I liked the way Karl was the force to push the style at least. I mean, Sirius is not going to pay cash for the promotion. <br /> <br /> Despite this few favorite errors with this photo, it keeps me in love while feeling over eighty. If you now see my original Japanese audio or new dubbed megazon 23, I believe that you will be frustrated with the OSD. Take your intelligence to the original Bulge Crisis dab soundtrack and E.V.E. Imagine this new eight audio <br /> <br /> saying all this. The popularity of this movie is unlikely to be of rare rareness in the open market today. Personally, it spawned a collection for me. I am now screaming the earth for trade from three components, which I have created and if I can meet Karl Mesek, then hold his hand for the effort, and buy me a pint or crow to go for anime.
