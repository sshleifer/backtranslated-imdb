Another feather in the cap of "The Man in the White Suit" expert Scotland's director Alexander McDricketer (Whiskey Gallery !, sweet smell of success). The film stars Alake Guinness (whose comedy Side Hearts and Coronets and The Lavender Hill Mobile) Guiness brought her usual class to the film, and it makes much more than a common comedy. <br /> <br /> In fact, the comedy is not completely overt. At the end of the picture, it became almost complete drama. This is a hilsha studio comedy which is not counted for laughter production, but general entertainment ideas as the best British comedy of the time. <br /> <br /> The whole concept of this case is not very basic, but it is the way to get it done. The film is very original, and it is recommended to have a fan of Guinness or Brittany Commedia. <br /> <br /> 7.6 out of 10
