It is a movie which has it all, pushing hero, beautiful daughter in the teen, noble figure with tragic errors, and a really wonderful robot. The forbidden Planet has maintained a special magic over the years and does not lose its scent with the repetition of the show (although the sexual appeals of young Francis Enranslate help him enough). <br /> <br /> The movie fans will recognize that young Leslie Nilssen portrayed the handsome and heroic commander Adams, although among those who have encouraged her love interest in a curiosity, they would probably be astonished by her appearance in a serious role. Distinguished and advanced Walter Pizaddon is also a featured player as a secret (ID) scientist. Specially for Warren Stevens, another supporter cast, the brain is capable of recognizing the character of "Doc" and of course the French Francis. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Electronic music, in 1950, less. Credits call them "toonly", but those of us who tried to combine "Heimin" devices in the early versions of the device will sometimes know the idle and wonderful wheels used in the soundtrack and the scripts. Still, it lends credence to Craell's mysterious and forbidden earth's external and foreign landscape images. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very arresting. As a young man waiting for the next release of the invisible "id" monster, I remember my fear, and when it finally becomes visible in a war scene, it literally pushed me to my toes and astonishment. The matte art magic craft is completely absorbed in the disassembly of the scientific complex, because the characters make their way through various laboratories and pathways, which are indicated by Magbius Dr. Maribius. <br /> <br /> I feel something that Dr. Morbius rabby measured a robot with a cool toy in the form of a robot. Robi's personality is quite charming and in some ways he feels more human than some other characters. On the follow-on viewers like Twilight Zone and Lost In Space, they will recognize the recycled Robi Promotions in some episodes, although I think that their original Robi's "personality" was not. <br /> <br /> Understanding different references to Flodian psychology and the dangers of hidden and naturally occurring fears and anger, I did not fully understand the complexity of the old plot. Underwater and social code control through loyalty. Although the original story of the story is released once, it remains unknown (or perhaps deliberately ignored) by Dr. Maribius, who is notified by the thought-provoking Adams, who said. Mourbius forced himself to face evil. When Crayle Adams pushed Du Morbis in front of the crayel machine, he gave me the Han Stamp, which encouraged him with a higher intelligence, which opened his subconscious wild animal with the power of the machine: "Here, your mind was artificially enhanced, consciously. The power to run the machine is in need. But your subconscious has been strong enough. "<br /> <br /> The Forbidden Planet is probably the last of my favorite Saifi Fi film, and it is timeless and classic for surprising imagination and appreciation on carefully created tales and screens.
