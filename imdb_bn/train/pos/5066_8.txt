I know some people are annoying movie but I disagree. This is a biography of a very complex and extraordinary person. I like the characters of the film and believe that a mystery has earned its humanity with some parts of Archie's life. I do not think the purpose of a better life should be to describe someone's life, rather the complexity and relationships that make them attractive. And what is more impressive than someone to successfully reinstate yourself? "People are dreaming - you've seen good dreams." Lord Attenborough works well I wanted to mention that Nathaniel Arcand is really standing as a career actor and I want to see him in more movies.
