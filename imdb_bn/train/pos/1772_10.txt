I'm not imagining this program to find out what a relief! Summary from taxman is great. I find it very scary and especially not watching family, I saw it 10/11. I think a girl is the very blonde hair of lead at the age of attraction, and her permanently sad state seems to be. The theme I played on a flute was reminded - though I can not remember how it could go. I think the article shows him playing - or he might have played flute in the program, and especially when he was sad? Maybe I do not know whether to finish it or listen to the clip, but at least now I know it's not just me.
