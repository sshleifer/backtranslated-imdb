Let me tell at the beginning of the cerebral palace and I went to the movie which hopes to create a allowance for lead performance. I hired the theater half to make sure that he played an actor, who was Cerebral Palsy in the role, although I knew that it was not. Brenda Fricker and Hugh O'Connor (I believe that its name) played specially as young Chris Brown. Christie's talented, slowly, arrogant, sometimes obscene and petulant-other words, people. Along with Gabriel, this film: A True Story and Documentary King Jim, a wonderful illustration of life with CP This is not a complete picture, but rather a good example of the disabled people. Very highly recommended.
