Unfortunate B-17 pilot tragedy Brady is shot down on occupied territories. Local pioneers increased their kindness and security to the value of their own lives. I never heard of this movie and it slipped me for two hours. After the movie was over, I was glad I took the time. It is said to explain the appearance of Brady's face at the beginning of a complete story film.
