Note that those who do not like this image and enjoy it comment that the book is not as good or as it is different from the book. <br /> <br /> I do not understand such criticism. Books and movies of different media There are hours and hours in the development of characters and story lines, there are about 120 minutes of film. Yet the film has the advantage of several sensory stimuli: visual, audio, as well as imagination. If a movie is not good, then I do not make any difference, in fact, there is a similar resemblance to the book based on it. Who care? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An old and past tense story, clich√© prone, it can be easily embarrassing. However, the Reefan and Reeves pull it off. One critic is found old in the Reefan. I was not 40 years old when I made this image. It is his achievement as an actress that he played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. I think it seems about the best thing ever in the Revo. The stories can be strong, and I might use the screen play "stronger." Yet, it is looking good value; Definitely a strong love story, rather, a charming romance that will satisfy you that the love crosses a strong emotions and good evil. And compulsory f # $% looks beautiful to see the "love story" without the words, nude hip, or hours of sput-kiss. <br /> <br /> Finally, the musical score is excellent.
