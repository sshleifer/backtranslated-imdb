If your child or daughter loves actions, adventure, conspiracies and imagination - without the need to break every twelve minutes of music - then this is for you the Disney movie! My boys love this movie every minute, and I must admit that I am very lively all over the movie. There is no sad song to get to the way of a wonderful story, and the letters are all loving and recognizable in their own right. This beautifully visible scenery and its unstoppable turbulence will diminish like Disney "classic"!
