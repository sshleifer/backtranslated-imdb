First seen 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 (Dir-Sydney Franklin): Details about the accounts of Chinese farmers and their emergence and strife spread through the nature of their mother. This film is based on an award winning novel and starts a slave with the marriage of a slave to a married son. Despite the slightest hammy performance by lead directed by Paul Munie, the film does a good job of maintaining your interest. It is the book, Wong Long (character played by Muni) and how he did land work, bought more land, eventually became very rich and then he returned to where he originally started. The relationship between him and his wife, directed by Louis Reyner, is a wonderful work to show the country and its people, despite the main thread of the story (apart from land) and clear non-Chinese actors. It is clear that MGM used its meaning in an era to create such a true epic where they could possibly carry it. The locust scene is very well done and the rest of the year really looks good on the Oscars best cinematography awards. What is this story in an epic specific definition and it is quite well pulled off
