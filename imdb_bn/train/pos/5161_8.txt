Kirk and crew land on a inferior planet where the Sun is going to explode. They wanted to bring out the residents but did not find any place other than Mr. Otoz, manage any kind of high-library. In spite of getting direct answers from everyone about his position, Autoz is indifferent to their questions and says with a loud voice, 'There is still time but there must be elections.' They do not know what they are talking about, but look at the mirror-like disks in the hands of the viewers, they roam around and look at the past images of the planet. Then, while having a disc in the audience, Kirk goes through the gates and the magic is back in time, like the time of Louis XIV (1660s). When McCain and the Spak is followed, the audience has a different disc and they are sent to hell in an ice age. It's too late, they realize that the library is a time-traveling device and storage. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was sent. The views are very interesting and very logical for ordinary logical people. <br /> <br /> Ideal speaker exit, wildly innovative scripts and various diverse people create this exceptional episode - a very valuable view. <br /> <br /> FYI - Nice character actor Ian Wolf, Mr. Otoz played. I am a huge fan of old movies and supported him in countless movies of the 30's and 40's and have seen him as a bit player, and since 1969 he has seen almost the same way as this episode. The other 23 years - 95 years old died!
