The only reason to know about midnight cowboy was the top 100 of the AFI critics. This is not a well-known movie for the top 100; Actually, I had to work hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for almost half. Surprisingly, it was rated only 15+ (inactive version). <br /> <br /> I doubt many will accept this review (more opinion) notification so I will shorten it. <br /> <br /> This is probably one of the amazing movies due to fingers, artistic photography (very art-house) and unusual themes. There are so many things in the movie that I still do not understand (I have seen it twice), and it creates an emotionally confusing film. <br /> <br /> The filming and acting were great and it is bigger than the life character that makes this picture memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a 'cowboy' in Texas who is a male prostitute who moved to New York. He met the weak Konman Enrico 'Rato' Rijo and, of course, he became a friend by the normal escape. <br /> <br /> I think the film did not develop the relationship between the relationship between Buk and Enrico Rijó actually in relation to a real emotional connection, though the last is quite sad and sad. You probably already know what happened by reading the reviews <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Humanity's deprivation (shown by city road dark, broken down-to-tunnel). Most of the characters in the movie are out of the law (a conman, giggolo.etc) you still can not like them. Joe Bock is respectful because he is very naïve and hopeful, when we start to apologize for the film afterwards. <br /> <br /> I think the movie got so much ratings because it was very ground breaking its time. The time (and even now) it was definitely not a typical movie (quite art house). A movie with such an unusual theme as the midway cowboy pop-up, tired Western, was a time in which the movie was influenced by music and drama. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I would definitely say I liked the film. Imagery conveyed good quality like a dream. I have been in your mind for a long time after watching the scene of the party, music, images etc. especially. However, as a movie for entertainment it was somewhat lacking in Thrills (really my style of movies). <br /> <br /> Although I do not consider myself eligible for the analysis of this film, the characters and their motives are quite interesting. From what I understand from flashbacks, Joe Bose was sexually assaulted by her grandmother, although it still does not seem relevant to the story. She is a happy-go lucky young stud, who suppresses her dark memories. Religious notions in the film are also confusing. Some have suggested homosexual relationships between Buk and Writers, even though they are unable to see where they got this idea. The home-sex theme is more than touching their conversations, and later, in front of Jone's face with a lonely person, it does not have much to do with the original story. <br /> <br /> Of course, one of the decade's best films is technical direction (it feels more than 70 and more than 60) and the revolutionary touches with some other films for its time. Although it has a simple, intriguing story (incognito by a tough edge), the beauty of the movie is weird, often in the cyclical order.
