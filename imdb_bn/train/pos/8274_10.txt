This movie is excellent. I'm having fun at it. I thought Wendigo legend was quite calm. The acting was also great, as well as clothing, production, photography, instruction and scripts. <br /> <br /> A very happy family, on holiday, they fall into the middle just after hitting the deer. Very angry and angry on this fact that a hunter is then displayed and the antler's deer of the deer is broken. Then he started to grab the family and the strange thing started to happen to them. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie. It's important. Cast, cast and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!
