Believe me or not, the last case of Inspector Gadget has put me in the whole gadget stuff. <br /> <br /> My name is Mary and I'm twelve years old, so obviously I was not there when the Inspector Gadget was at the top of her career. Sure, I heard about him, but I did not really know him. While reading <br /> <br />, remember that I was never able to use serial series (if I used to come it!). It's just the only gadget thing I've ever seen (though I'm obsessed now) and focus on the way I like it, because everyone's negative. For all of you pessimists, I have got some cons benefits here. = P. First off, humor for a childhood feeling, you could think this movie is quite funny. I was in it, so sued me I thought animations and character designs were good, and I had more gadgets on it, because she's my favorite character. (I do not like pennies.) Then Clau (though his voice was awful) and drugs; I think they are fairly well done. The gadget's stupidity seems to be very good, if it is not exaggerated (like hitting its hat). But a good screen shot will be created. = P) Oh, and I like the song running in the credit. Yes, I'm weird <br /> <br /> And there are some negative, like all movies. <br /> <br /> Who are you talking about? What's that with? You can say that these little boys were the target. It was not true that the cars actually kept the day alive if it did not bother me so much. Penny and Brain took their place if I liked a lot. And, apparently, the gadget prefers its car as natural. Bit is weird, at least for saying <br /> <br /> Oh, and the Chief Gazette was free. I mean, Sheikh, yes, he was not always happy with the man, but he did not hate the gadget from what I read. Like an inspector, his personality was exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Well, I want to talk about this movie. I thought the animations were made for centralized plot and it was fairly nice; Live-action gadgets are more than movies (pregnant, changing, delivering!) At least Maybe I'm not favorable because it got me in the gadget at the first place, or my mind could be interrupted, or maybe I'm weird, but I really like this movie, even if I'm old, but it's recommended to.
