This is one of the most overlooked gems ever produced in Hollywood. A young WWII British fighter whose plane is crashing, has a radio contact with a young American woman, who comforted the brave pilot, knew that he would die within a few minutes. For some reason, the person who dies must go away from the debris and finally learn that he wanted to report to heaven. When a messenger was sent to take the pilot to heaven, the man rejected his claim for his rejection and claimed. The man argues that his condition changed during the last life of his earthly life, that he fell in love and there he became a different person, who had the opportunity to live. <br /> <br /> "Heavenly Court" Enjoy a movie! "Colleagues jury announcement" is a specific highlight. The story seems to be pretty, as an impressive one and you will keep spellbound during playing about 2 hours. The final scene is simply beautiful and most viewers need "clench treatment". This photo is my personal best top 10 top, this is my highest recommendation!
