We all know sexy comedies sub-series beautiful crowd. Just being too messy is not enough. I have seen and heard that many horrible jokes and verbs have any other positive points to apply to any sex comedy I currently have. <br /> <br /> I'd hopefully come to the 40-year-old Virgin; I did not see the commercial after all; "Is it true that if you do not use it, you lose it?" I do not expect to find out the character development of a heart and honest effort. Still in the film of Adam Sandler there is a strange "off of the wall" character and there is a fairly inappropriate language to drown Noah's ark, but in some case the movie has an appropriate love story and even a message. <br /> <br /> The main character Andy (unfortunately for me) I can relate to a person. In the first shot, I found that he shared my love for the mystery science theater 3000 (a poster for his wall movie) and throughout the whole film we saw the old old collections completely. Andy also has a working knowledge of plenty of video games and movies and technology. Andy does not want to buy a car because he likes his bike. Most important of all; Andy is a wonderful person, she does not swear and she revereates the woman so much that she is away from them. Combine all these factors and everyone thinks he's a serial killer. It's like the story of my life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think that I have mentioned an error in the other one of the light. The story is cute but very expected and go as far as romance; It's pretty easy. It has long been related to Andy's relationship and we all know what's going to happen to the end. Make sure that its final ride is a bit different than we can expect, but you know what's going to happen in the end and I assure you that. There are definitely small spots in this movie but it is so good that I can easily understand some of its flaws. <br /> <br /> When I say "good", of course "bad" This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. In most part I think it has been successful. After denial of sexual intercourse with 30, Andy tried to get rid of Andy just as she saw many hard work scenes. Or a scene where Andy takes the girl in her trash to the sex education class, where she asks more questions than anyone else. Ah and we will soon forget to order the classic chest candle "Oh! Como se llama!" An interesting little note about that scene; Actor Steve Carroll actually did his stomach wax and the pain shown is real. Of course they only took one but it was still very brave in his part. <br /> <br /> I'm really talking about Steve Carroll, I want to say that he has grown up now that the comedians of the respected comedians were strange in my list because I do not even know before seeing this picture. I was so impressed by his writings, acting and time that I now want to keep an eye on his future roles. The 40-year-old Virgin has proved this man got a talent. <br /> <br /> I was skeptical about this movie to be honest, but the initial word was positive and I knew that I was finally going to see it. I'm very happy because this is probably one of the fun movies I've ever seen in most of the time and it's doubly something that you think is valuable. It's not just sex gags together but a series of long sex gags that are very relevant to the character and genuinely romantic romance. Now let me excuse when I go out to puke my guts; I can not believe I just wrote ... <br /> <br /> My review of Freder Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin
