While browsing the Internet for the previous sales price, I ran across this comment. Why are they all so serious? It's just a movie and it's not obscene. I have accomplished this short film from my parents 30 years ago and have always been completely happy with it. I showed it to many of my friends and they all liked it. Before becoming popular or well known, Sheryli had the privilege of being the owner of this 1932 8mm black and white silent film. After reading other comments, I acknowledge that the film is "warm". Big deal! I just had it long. It seems, I want to be the sole owner of this, at least for sale, so I wonder how valuable it is?
