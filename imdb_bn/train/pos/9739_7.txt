I made fun of the movie, mainly due to Simon Peg, who quickly became a box box draw for comedy movies. <br /> <br /> From the end of his death, he was appointed from London's job of publishing the NYC media mogul <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> be yourself a minor celebrity The story is very funny, and Gillian Anderson plays an impressive supporting role as a cutlery campaigning agent. Along with the road to success, he found the true meaning of love. <br /> <br> On one side of the formal plots, the film was very fun, mainly due to Simon Pegg, Jeff Bridges and Jillian Anderson. Kirsten Donast was good for love. The rest supporter cast his job well. <br /> <br /> It was a good comedy and well worth checking out at the theater.
