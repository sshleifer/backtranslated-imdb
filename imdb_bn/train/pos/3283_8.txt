I was happy to discover this film on the IFC as the supernatural boyfriend (art and film). It's definitely a keeper. Most other reviews are common plots (not all correct), so I do not want to be disturbed with anyone. The main thing is the idea of ​​an alternative world that is brought by Anna's upcoming illness, and after that being "alone," the process of linking with someone else, and finally with her family, I believe that at least some of the bothers are still there. It can be thought of as a horror film that has horrific scenes but it is a fantasy (with a little hint of "coming of age" because only pre-teenagers who "hate boys"). I sincerely recommend it to those who appreciate stretching their imagination.
