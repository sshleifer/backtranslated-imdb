I'm always looking for something new and unique, I saw this film online. I thought it would be another "B" rate movie but I was surprised at acting by two main characters. All the actors in this movie were very capable and well guided. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And please show some deadly reality in life with enough cruelty to keep it interesting. <br /> <br /> I like this movie in "A" Rated Movies. Even a great number of high box office earnings are seen. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie.
