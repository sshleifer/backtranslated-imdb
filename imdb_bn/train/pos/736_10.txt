For a punk rocker, it is a film that Ramones made in a family name in the early 1980s (when it appeared in premium cable stations only). It is one of the first and best of American punk rock films, with Rocky Horror Picture Show where there is a classic classic status. Indeed the producer wanted a trick like the stars, but by releasing the album "Live at Budakon", only their superstar and very few items were hottie in the budget movie. It is very fortunate for Ramon that the underground emerald was out of the rock world and wanted to refrain from the mainstream market (which had never happened since the band's death). The band, DD, did not always like the mid-80s film, but fans always liked and could have read most movies while waiting for Ramon Shows. Like most classics, this film is stupid with some classic Ramon footage behind them. Do not expect more, you will not find it. It's so fun, so enjoy it. Similar to other alan arcus classic movie Crazy Crazy, which features Lee Wing from fear of the legendary hardcore punk band.
