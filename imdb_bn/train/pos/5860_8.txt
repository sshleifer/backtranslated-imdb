An enjoyable game, which offers fun and easy game play and fair replay power. This game does not show much of today's most action cartridges, providing comic lessons and less learning curves. Also, descriptions and animated scenes have been used (though longtime animations are replaced by the slide show at Nintendo 64 version) using the full features of the platforms.
