I saw it at the age of 17 and never saw it. 'CBS Let's Movie' is used to show it at regular intervals. I think it was so sad and sad that it really got sick in my stomach. The effects were not what they were, but in spite of this, it expressed feelings of being alone in Amazon, after losing both the guardians and after finding the way is very good. I remember most of the bugs and maggots, so realistic they were, eat her meat. It was a dark film that was controversial, although it was probably strongly edited for the TV. I wish to remember more details, and if I get the chance to see it again, I can comment more. I have been looking for this for years. I believe it has still shown CBS under another title. I have no idea if I am released on the video.
