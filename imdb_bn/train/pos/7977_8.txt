Basically, the film's two scripts (Ridley and Tony) can be the most fun title ever made. Let's make it straight, the film sometimes deserves its campaign as one of the most stylish / thriller crew created. <br /> <br /> When Denial Washington and Tony Scots really make a perfect pair, when comes to unsatisfactory tragic heroes. This movie and Deja Bhu are both better thrillers that you can expect. Washington got really shaky camera and execution of each of the movies is very comfortable. All murders are enjoyed on the street so one can easily relate to his character's passion. This is a success that they create in a big dark Mexico city, with many events happening. Man on fire will be easily trusted in the amount of corruption displayed. I do not know what to think when Mexican people see it ... <br /> <br /> Okay, let's face again. This is one of the best method of demise system, but it was subjected to widespread violence. It's a boring thing that makes the movie very realistic and gives Dingle Washington a "missing sheep" trojic hero type. In the end, they even had abductors shot in his own swimming pool like an incognito. If I check IMDB then the movie was based on real events for her ...... so if you find the movie theme then it is for your consideration <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, I hope no one will take this film for real. <br /> <br /> Art Direction / Editing / Movie / Dingle Washington 8/10
