I saw this photo at the Brussels International Film Festival. I also called the photo director. I heard Ed Wood wrote the story in 10 years! I'm sure he will compose his best - his win <br /> <br /> Well, if you take the film seriously (like Mr. Wood has done) it's really one of the worst movies. . And this is cool. The day I was dying, the big joke I had died on is that it does not try to be a decent movie. <br /> <br /> It makes the film very well. Fill the script nihilism and anarchy - much black humor. Billy Zen's role is absolutely amazing. You see, this is the high industry ... or less garbage. <br /> <br /> **** / *****
