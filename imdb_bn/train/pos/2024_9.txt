I like this mini series. They did a wonderful work by fitzgerad Helen Graham from a mysterious past, portraying a beautiful young woman hidden with her little boy. As an English of romantic love ... this movie was just my cup tea and I would recommend it to anyone in 1800 for England to run for a few hours. I certainly have mentioned that Toby Stephens illustrates the very magnetic Gilbert Markham because this wonderful product is reason enough to see it.
