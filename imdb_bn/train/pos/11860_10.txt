This movie has it all in it. This is a classic example of events surrounding thousands of Cuban refugees. Antonio Montana (played by Al Pasino), one of the thousands to get the chance to choose his fortune in America. This cinematic yet highly accurate illustration of the Drug Empire of Miamese is astonishing. Brian DePalma performs an extraordinary work to manage this picture, so the audience is involved in both stories in the story as well as each Cast Cast. Steven Bauer (best friend of Manny, Tony), Mary Elizabeth Mastantiou (Gina, Tony Sister), Robert Loggia (Frank, Tony's Bose) and Michele Pfeiffer (Elvira, Frank's wife), with the pressure of Tony's characters being so credible and strong . I enjoyed watching the movie every minute, and I still see it on a weekly basis. This year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime film, I truly believe for one another that in another 20 years, people still mention this film in an astonishing number. Other crime movies are so dramatic that I find this movie a shock for the system.
