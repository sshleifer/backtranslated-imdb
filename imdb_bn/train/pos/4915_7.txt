And even for the unexpected plot line-up: New Orleans has a plug-in city-and only Richard Wyndmark can turn it off! Elia Kazan's trademark: Waterfront, Working Men, Crowd, Harmful, Blue Collar, Retreating Violence - all are displayed here. <br /> <br /> Jack Palance is an effective big score, as cold cold mob of ice, Zero Mottel like Dere Deloise is a bit unruly but definitely visible as his cow. I enjoyed Barbara Bell Jades as a gentle, cool wife - I thought she and Wyommark were a believable couple. <br /> <br /> He himself has reminded me of some kind of silence - and if any praise is quietly meant to be appreciated. I have never heard of this movie, and yes, you have to appreciate Wymark's performance. I also enjoyed Paul Douglas - he played this role many times, they created an unlikely but effective team. <br /> <br /> This plague itself is McGuffin- and you know it was not done properly. Actually there is at least no one than a small graduate in reality? But I saw it carried the plots nicely. <br /> <br /> Check it out. It's good. *** out ****
