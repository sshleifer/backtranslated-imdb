"Yokai Daisensau" Tuxi Mike is a child film, but you can expect, maybe it's too dark and scary for young people. However, big kids can eat it, that is, if you dubbed it in English then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After with his grandfather. During the village festival, the boy is honored as a "Kirin Ryder", but his respect comes with a lot of danger and courage. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the evil work goes as a woman in a white mini skirt, boots and a drudgery, working on a bad yoke for the people's annoying changes and removing items against them. And this recession has revealed itself as a flying city in the form of a monster like the City of Rug City Tokyo. One interesting scene is that there are two diarrhea which shows the monster flying over the city ... one, "Oh, it's only gamera". <br /> <br /> This little boy has made friends with Yokai, which is a monster, most modest, who has separated themselves from humans and all Yokai in Japan have gathered together to fight wickedness. <br /> <br /> In many ways, Mike and Crew took the Yokai films of the late 70's / 70's and made them a modern action adventure film for kids (older), which also added some strange mechanical monsters that make me "transformer "Thinks. The look and feel of the film is superb, the effects are entertaining, and some humor will just move on the child's head, but older people can still enjoy it. For adults, there is nothing to like here, if you are a fan of Japanese giant movies then you will enjoy this hack. <br /> <br /> Cool and fun things, sometimes dark but probably that's just Miike..and what a wild ride. 10 out 8
