I find it a very entertaining small children's movie which is actually much more fun and humorous, but they can understand more. Some things are inappropriate for kiddies, but only a few. Othewise, "Grinch" (Jim Carrey) many jokes can not be kept with you from sex, from cultural to inner-to-home, from ethnicity to Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film looks very colorful and DVD is great. Here the little girl, "Cindy Lu Hu" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and fun to see the little man's clothes and stoves here. Anthony Hopkins's voice is also very pleasant, so the film further enhances its description. Interesting to hear his curiosity. <br /> <br /> I saw it in the theater, although it was "fair", but in DVD, it was much better. I saw it three times and it has been good every time.
