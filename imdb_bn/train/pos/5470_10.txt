One of the "forgotten" movies before Bobby Fake Code. It was shown in the last night after the Waterlow Bridge version of Turner Classic Network in 1931, so I was able to see the film now because it has now been restored four plus minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Stanwick is living in East Saint Luis (where he may be able to congratulate Mother McCray on the Waterloo Bridge). Her father Robert Barrett He lived with her mother since her death and (at the restored dialogue) she had an ank at her 14 years of age. Now he is a resident waitress and part time slut in his class, his closest friend Chico (Theresa Harris), a African-American servant who makes Barat fool. Two good aspects of Stanwick's personality are that he is standing in front of his father in connection with Harris, threatening to expel Harris (and he threatens to serve them rather than those who enjoy Stanwick, see NAT Pendleton) <br/> <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> If she simply leaves him and leaves, then the cheerful girl sees great potential. He is also pushing the idea of ​​Frederick Takege's philosophy and will. More about this later. <br /> <br /> After killing the local political rebel (Arthur Hohl) and there is a debate with Barrett, an explosion kills Berrett, and enables Stanwai to leave his hometown. He and Harris head to New York City, a railway is managed to get free transport by freight car to sleep with a Brackman (James Murray). They reached New York, and they went on to see the Gotham Trust Company (established in 1873), and the friendly guard tells him that the worker is in the office. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Morsh was a man from a man-owned company. Stanwyck knows his arms in his sexual allusion She went through John Wayne, Douglas Dumrell (a part of the film that I always felt was the worst - most interestingly - when I saw it), Douglas Wood, Henry Callakor and finally George Brent. Having fallen on one side of each, and then not being useful, or destroyed by him. The new president of the bank, Brent Brad founded, eventually married her - and when the crisis of the film diminished the economic situation of the bank (especially Brent bought a fortune in his land and gave his valuable bond). Brent was charged. Will she stand for him? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! At the end, Stanwick was going on a ship for Europe, leaving Brent to abandon his fate, but realized that he could not do it with him, his apartment would return home and shoot himself. She is finally riding with her in the hospital. Before the newly discovered footage was found, the film ended with them and ended up saving them all the money to the bank and lived happily ever after to return to East St. Louis. <br /> <br /> This is good ending. Stanwick will continue his destructive course, with Brent's last victim. But apart from Brin's office, the script writer (after one day Darryl Knowne) thinks it is appropriate to find a moral center. There is no one with him - for the least powerful men (whom he hates). I do not think that the audience could tolerate such conclusions by sadness. <br /> <br /> There are other problems due to changes in public opinion and changes in society. In the corporate world in 1933 it was a man's world, so Stanwyck was cutting his work for him. Wood (when he will be fired for his discretion) acknowledges that he did not want to do his job. <br /> <br /> But in 2006, Stanwick found women everywhere. Other publicists and women activists are annoying remarks (obviously some jealousy) to Stanwick. In 2006, she will often face female sub-directors, and she will be able to quickly overcome her. Of course, if he finds one or two lesbians, he can try the road but it is suspicious. And he seems to never meet any male of gay. They have men's business men who do not blame their legs or breasts. <br /> <br /> then its counsel, Mr. Crag. Cragg is remade in the "bowllerized" version for trying to find him a moral center. In fact, he pushed Nitz, but the path (in greater sense) pushed the Nazis - find the way to get power and push it. Neutosh sometimes applied pressure pressure, but all his theories were not endless and endless. Otherwise someone will read him in college course today. Cragg is probably self-educated, but only semi-educated. In short, anyone who is studying the Niksets thoroughly confronted Cragg, he considered him a half-educated fool. And this stenwik consultant! A good movie, and it's worth 10 days ... but serious errors.
