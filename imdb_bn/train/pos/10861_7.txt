Hack She Wei (Election in English) can be denied because it is not a well-made and well thought-out movie. The film still uses a variety of pieces of identification, which continues with modernity, but can still prevent tradition? A theme played throughout the movie where John Hahn's Hong Kong films are hardworking and topped among the top performers on their explosive material (1992) and when the Hong Kong films fall in the tone of story from 'bad' perspective, they sometimes become stutter and just disrespectful Maybe, City on Fire (1987) is a good example. <br /> <br /> is a memorable film for the perfect truth of a tremendous scene, spontaneous action and violence, which is a tricky 'piece' of filmmakers with realistic and tasteful (if it is the right word) method. It is difficult to spot during the observation, but the election is actually built in three types of constructive structures: the first point of expressing concern about the real elections and voting for anyone voted ?? Everyone does not like the decision, but what cats say, goes. The second is the opening ceremony of the inaugural ceremony of the inaugural ceremony after the opening of the ancient battles from China and the specific characters coming out with the idea of ​​how the trips should run and how to run. Needless to say; Some events and twists may occur at three-thirds each time, some are small and miraculous, some are big and spectacular. <br /> <br /> There are some faults in selection with the majority of the first elections. It took a couple of minutes for the writers and filmmakers to take a few minutes to try to overcome the time around the election and it shows up on many points. I felt that a specific scene started going somewhere before being interrupted by the police and then everyone was arrested. It happened several times: a fight broke down in a restaurant but police remained there and all were arrested; The secret meeting of the baton is going on in the tragedy but the police showed it and everyone was arrested; Some other tragedies have a pre-election speech but guess what the police looks and do? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After pursuing a truck, there is another Chase with a motorbike and a Klingfu war with the load of Mally's arms on a street? Scenes are unpredictable, realistic and violent but as I said, they are in a 'tasty' way. Where the selection is really big, attention is given to the delicate details. When the triads are in jail, the bars are covered with cables, they suggest that they behave outside the outside when they conflict as animals in all cages. Another fine part of the detailed attention is to use uncle and alcohol to use champagne (The Long Good Friday), and to mention the heritage of tea to celebrate head or celebration, other heads enhance themselves above gangsters. <<br>> Selection is a good movie that is adequately protected to enjoy and a movie that has amazing mise-en-scene which you see is what you see. As well as indoor settings and clothing, style buckets that are pitted as search and chezes for the exercise intensify. The opening is like a small film and very well-organized in movies. Hinting at the Chinese heritage in the process. I think the best scene is the last scene, like the last scene, because it is completely relative: The two worst characters are realistic, unpredictable and violent during the debate over the fishing and the rule of the Triad: the rest must be delicious.
