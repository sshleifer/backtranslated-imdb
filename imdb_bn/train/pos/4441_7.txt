All right, before we review, I have to ask: Why is this not listed individually? It may already be a TV item in Italy, but its own movie of international Lamborghto Bava fans. In America, the film is distributed as "The Augre" or "Demon 3" in VHS and DVD. Yes, I know it has nothing to do with a cast member and "Demons" without crew. But yes, I was personally annoyed that this site was so difficult to find which is otherwise useful. <br /> <br /> Finally, review "Ogrey". I've seen the trailer many times on YouTube and honestly found it scary. The film itself (this is the length of the feature, so it creates a movie) has many strong parts and is afraid of it. I was unhappy with the last action, but seeing the whole thing, I did not apologize for buying DVDs (available from SG Show). I think the film proves the end work of TV sources. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " There are vague echoes, but this supernatural awful is a different brand. The woman (Virginia Bryant) found more evidence that this is the real life of her nightmare, but her husband would not believe her. Follow the Great atmosphere and terrorism. <br /> <br /> The sequence of multiple nightmares was fantastic. Ogre cocoon effect was good, it reminded me a little bit of Uncle Frank's resurrection from "Hellraiser" first. There are some good shocks and a well done underwater scene. I have proposed to them that this movie does not meet similar concepts of American films, such as "Nightmare at Elm Street" "Ogre" is an original one. And when the giant itself was a scary, it was presented correctly. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> He gave the film a lot of credit to the real castle in the film. In fact, this setting contributes a lot to the film. Simon Boswell makes music very supportive. <br /> <br /> There are lots of good things here. "Ogre" is not perfect, but it is very valuable to see. Take it to a low Lamberto Bava achievement.
