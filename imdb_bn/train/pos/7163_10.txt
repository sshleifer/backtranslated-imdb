I seriously love this picture ... I started reading the book and I liked it ... everything was fine and everything was a purpose ... I think this movie was so good because Louis Sachar wrote the picture. And of course Andrew Davies managed it ... Shiite Lebuf gave a great performance for his first film ... The story is very cool and interesting ... There are humor, heart and intensity ... It is similar to the book. ..I think this film is not less annoying ... I love it ... and I encourage anyone to read the book ... these films have been put together and carefully created ... for each one of me alone Thumbs up
