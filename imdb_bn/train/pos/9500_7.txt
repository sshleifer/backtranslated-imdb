I saw this picture on television and fascinated by the beauty of Jennifer Macbomb. It was a handsome movie and you can see it for the beauty of Africa and of course Macbomb. At that time I was delighted to see this movie and since then I have been trying to make this video VCD, but I can not find it. The huge African lion makes its film int int and we will spell bounded by the size of animals and their grace only. All the listeners can see this movie, especially the children will enjoy this movie. But some scenes involving MacCam parental guidance for this photo. It's an enjoyable holiday movie for one and all.
