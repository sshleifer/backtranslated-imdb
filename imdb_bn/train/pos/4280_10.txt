A group of people is traveling to Belgrade in a scary conductor and a stupid bus headed by his foolish son (who likes to drive his eyes off). Their journey was often hampered by many pleasurable events, which, with a lot of satire, described the fall of the nation's spirit in 1941, and it is so interesting that they are still used as a common trick. The person who "steals steal" is four feet tall with his four children, two times bigger than that. Finally, the film takes a dramatic turn and the journey is nothing but a harrowing song in a mortal country.
