I have seen this picture many years ago and it has made a lasting impression on me. Well, I worked hard for many films for many years and recently I did not want to be influenced by 'Califaar'. I'm glad to say that it's worth 10 or more years ago and it's worth every bit as safe. <br /> <br /> Two movies which really give this movie. The first is its cast. We have a fantastic boring turn by a young Brad Pitt as the primary Grace. Like Pitt, as we all do, like one of Hollywood's longest heart-throws, it refreshes him to show such a vague, unreasonable character. Pitt pulls off the show using white-junk clich√© or parody, and managed to remain genuinely awesome throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Old girl with a forty year old life experience playing the character of ten years, equally impressive as Juliet Lewis Grace's sad girlfriend. Lewis expressed regret (his character's life for the station) as well as humiliation (for his supper), but he reduced his performance with very little benefit after seeing a very young actor. Personally, I think it is a tragedy that Pit or Lewis was not nominated for any award for his performance. <br /> <br /> Both David Duchowy and Michelle Forbes both have completely thrown the Uippi couple who unknowingly end the tour throughout the US with Pitt and Lewis. Dovovoni is a well-liked creator and homosexual, and Forbes seems to be impressed with astonishingly and shut off, but both actors definitely define their character change because they are equally distraught, disturbed and surprisingly attracted to Pitt. <br /> <br /> On one side of casting fine and uniformly brilliantly, this film really grabs us through proverbial balls through its flawless panning. At this time, 'Kelifilier' was released, Hollywood is a wonderful character-figurative-out-to-mind-psychotic movie ('Single White Women', 'Pacific Heights',' The Hand the Rocks The Cradle '' Deceived ',' With the Enemy Sleeping 'etc.). Most of these films follow the same source, the only diversity in the nature of the relationship between good people and bad people. 'Califilia' does not really travel far from this region, but its first two acts are perfect examples of a slow-thriller and are kept at the very edge of our seats waiting for tides. <Br> <br /> When Penny drops, and Pitt abandons the psychological bad guy, the film completely changes the gears and the last 20 minutes most of the movie does not remain. That said, the action is thick and fast and cool to cool the resolution. The war is over, but the stains will always be there. <br /> <br /> Most of the descriptions (some huini, pre-x-files supplied by Dvoovni) are added to one. Of course, Duvovini's journalist character is understood from a written book, so one might argue that most journalists of self-aware descriptions have respect for such an exciting style. <br /> This film is mostly played on 90% of the thrills in the last 20 years and success. Highly recommended, but not for stomach or to weaken the mind. This film is annoying on multiple levels. But then, it is meant to be.
