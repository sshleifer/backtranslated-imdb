This movie was probably $ 750 budget, and was still managed to surpass Titanic. I've crashed my mother's car this day, and this is the only thing that challenges me out of trust! It has to be bound with the 'killer Bimbos' Ass Assult. The things that are searched for: 1. Drive to Chinese girl scene 2. Suction shirt bleach blonde which never changes 3. Running Flintstone-like driving 4. The killer (do not worry, I'm not spoiling any wonder, because it is very predictable) 5. 6. A mental patient who works hard to maneuver the eyes of man. 7. Hours long chase in the last session involving teachers and priests. 8. Pregnant bathroom wall writes graffiti. 9. The last, but at least, wonderful special effects - especially those packing that makes ... the heaven helps me ... .. <br /> <br /> Have fun <br /> <br />
