I watched the film at the Nashville Film Festival. It was beautiful, acting from cinematography. This is the story of a father and son, and during the family crisis they came to appreciate each other. Uncommonly written in dialogue that does not lie, the movie demonstrates the acting talents of Paul Riezer and Peter Folk, among others in this outstanding cast. Since the beginning of the film, elderly father (Peter Fok), his wife (Olympia Dukakis) is trying to leave her. The father presented himself with disobedience to his son and daughter. The next day after the father and son saw some property and finished the classic road trip, came down. They see fish, pool play, a baseball game, get drunk, get involved in a bar room cats, and dance with kinky women. But more importantly, they all face vague tensions that can affect any family. It is such a movie that touches the heart and it appreciates the closest to them.
