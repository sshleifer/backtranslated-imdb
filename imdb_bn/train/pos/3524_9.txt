For Chuck Davies and Emfire's attention: I have seen Fantasia Lady many years ago, when I was not yet jazz buff. An exhibition is going on till the end of June in the Paris brand new month Du Cooke Branley, which does not have the name LE SECLE DU JAZZ, which is not a special entertainment for jazz movies, including the Fantum Lady's famous drums sequence. I've seen the presence of almost all their movies - Jean Cropa and Elisha Cook Jr., and I can confirm the following: 1. Elisha Cook drowned in junior movies. This was some progress, since most of his other appearances were victims of the murder (mainly the Howard Hawks's Big Sleep). 2. Krishna is probably the Cook Duck in the PL. I could recognize his style, since he graduated with the 1937 Hollywood Hotel Singh, Singh, Singh Signature - as Tom and Tom (and Abuse) at the beginning of his career in the 1930s - and finally we got everything that we got in the French "La Caisse Call Claire ". 3. The order from the PL, at least not seen in the museum, is sensor. House carasso, Paris, France
