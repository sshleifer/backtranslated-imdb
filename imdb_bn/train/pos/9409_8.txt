A chemist develops fabric that is never dirty or is not dressed, but it is seen as a threat to the survival of various industries. This delightful Ealing studio comedy, wonderfully as a light-minded but continuous chemist in Guinness. Greenwood, his passionate voice, playing love interest; Parker is her sick father. Thesiger is amusing as a principals of fabric industry. While telling a compelling story, some provocative questions about film science, economics, and politics raise questions. It is managed by Macendrick, who will move forward to create "The Ladicellers" and the great "sweet smell success" after the 1950s.
