I like this movie. It is a great film that combines English and Indian culture with feminist-type problems, such as girls who want to play for sports before girls. It shows an absence of an Indian person both want to break out of its cultural barriers and women want to break out of sex, especially in England, in sports. I think cultural struggle is stronger than other cultures. <br /> <br /> Contrary to other comments, I do not think Dirty Dance or any other chick like this movie is nothing like Flickr. This step is very similar to many people, men and women, young people and older people.
