There are movies, and there are movies. Films are not just movies "candy" but movies are more than true artwork. Fraulein Doktor is certainly well placed in the next. As most of the audience, I was very impressed with the scene of the war, but I consider the beauty of central character painting as the most sarling quality of the film. With the help of the German High Command, frullin is treated very carefully, despite all efforts, to make everything possible to serve its country as the real daughter of Dualland, morphine addiction always dies. In the back seat of the Mercedes-Benz command, the scene of a private, secluded, secluded, and savvy scene is perhaps the most tragic but true illustration of a "spy" of the scene. Spide Who Comes Into The Cold The only mental pain that Richard Burton presented. A lot of deeper film than French Doctor can realize on a single scene. I just want to see that its producers are suitable for freeing it on DVD, so that those who do not see it, those who have seen it again (perhaps and again) can enjoy this exceptional motion picture.
