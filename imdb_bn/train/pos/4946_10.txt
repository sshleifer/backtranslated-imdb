Say! Morgan Freeman is an actor, who discovered a character before he chooses to play, before he is committed. Freeman had a good fit for the movie (as he was "Miss Driving Driving"), and he is not only believable, but he gets the chance to change his image to play a character and preserve a character. There is no guarantee for life, but for some, it gives an actor a great chance to show different or unique characters to prevent stereotyping. And it must be said that stereotyping has been interrupted, or completely destroyed, a significant number of acting careers. <br /> <br /> This is a low-budget movie that was created in amazingly just two weeks. . This is a movie which is well-directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager has selected Carson, CA for the manager, and the location helps to determine the tone and timing for the movie. Good to perform, but a little rough. <br /> <br /> Silbering was the 'sub-contractor', to get the film Freeman, the actor was in the film project. There is a good chemistry between Brazilian frameman and Paz Wager, and it opens an effective dialogue between each cast member, who comes from diverse and different cultures. This film encourages people to understand, who come from two different worlds of race, race, sex, rule, morality, folklore, ethics and values, not just two languages ​​(English and Spanish). The film tries to genuinely honestly, and reaching the truth, to maintain the integrity of the film. <br /> <br /> The comedy section is an unemployed unemployed freeman who has been unemployed for four years. Verily, Freeman claims to be an actress that he is constantly working. <br /> <br /> Films provide an adventure to bond, care, share, change, and exchange. And, the exposition of the movie must give an actor a little bit preview to keep the role of the audience. <br /> <br /> If needed, tell your boss that you are 'giving mental health', and go to see this picture. If you are able, take your significant other or your family with you. I rank 10 out of 10 films. It's enjoyable, interesting, informative, crazy and fit.
