Michigan, Edgar Allen Boo, a toaster, and a frying pan. . . If you do not mind the type of psycho-thriller or horror film and you have a special heart in your heart, it's a movie for you. Like the mainstream hit "Drum of the Lambs" and classical classics like "Darkness of the Army", an amazingly successful first film, "Hats of a Minute". Editing and effects are good, styles are better than many films. Kalio wrote a complex story of painful painting in both the bible and po articles. In the big budget, there is a great deal of the benefits of large substances, the independent film revives this death characteristic. If you love Michigan, check out a good story, or a great thriller "hate for a minute."
