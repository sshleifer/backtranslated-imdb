Perfect Cast for a few people's plays Simon died, but somehow the resurrection from the outside. German ante-guard composer Verna Hennez displayed a nice sketch of what he had seen in the form of empty spots. Simon was afraid of his death, he looked at the other side to comfort him by supporting death. His girlfriend tries to keep him alive, but fails to follow him after his death. Very sensitive and moving, deep psychologist, but a little slow and somewhere even boring.
