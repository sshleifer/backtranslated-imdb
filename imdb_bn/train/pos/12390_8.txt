Wonderful horror movie is filled with famous faces, but Christina Reynes (after TV's "Flamingo Road") stole as a beautiful but somewhat unstable model, which tried to commit suicide in the gateway to protect the gateway! The scenes of Renaiss modeling are considered very well, mood music is perfect, Deberah Raffein is very attractive as Cristina Pal, but when the rains come in a vague Brooklyn heights brown stone (living under the blind blind pastor), things really start to cook. As well as a fantasy villainous Burgess Meridith and kinky couple Silvia Miles and Beverly D'Angelo, neighbors, as well as a ghostly Lot and Eli Walch, have great fun as fascinating police detectives. Almost a cross-pollination of "Rosemary Baby" and "Exorcist" - but what a combination! Based on the best seller of Jeffrey Convittes, "The Sentinel" has completely closed the shocks by the manager, Michael Winner, with an entertaining surprise, which ends up thinking efficiently to the end. **** to ****
