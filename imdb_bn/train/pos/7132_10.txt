An impressive film. John Thaw, who played the usual spanking, who recently passed. A man who was always so unassuming. He must have been one of the top 10 actors of my time. <br /> <br /> He could be remembered for his famous role as Inspector Morsch. As a barrister of the 1970s hit TV series' Jack Reagan 'as' Sweevi and Kawanahah QC. A must see for all the family and a great DVD for my collection. The filming will bring memories of remembrance to the memorable people in Britain's war memorial, and certainly must remember those who have left London for bombing the Germans. Two main characters. The interaction between Tom and Boy William really works well and the true Michelle Magrian is the true book.
