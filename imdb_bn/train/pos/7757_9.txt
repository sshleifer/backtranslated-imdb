Like 50 films written in Douglas Cyrock's Wright and Written in 1956 - Pure Melodrama Still strong, rich enhanced melodrams, and the trademarks of the Sikkim's Larryd color expressionism, throbbing, currents, annoying emotions, emotions and class compounds make this movie excite. <br /> <br /> The image opens brilliantly. The plot to be launched as four central characters and credits is still rolling. Sirak uses a cute flashback form to take our world ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> She drinks and sleep with women. He drinks and sleeps almost with men. They are both valuable, thanks to the Hedley Oil business. Hockey, still poor, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) friend in Kyle's lifetime and Mary's dream lover. This sourced mess is Lucy Moore (Lauren Buckle), a thin, attractive young girl, who has fallen under the Kyle's skull and picked up the phone and covered one evening in the countryside. Mitch loves him very much, but Kyl wins him. They marry fast, and Kyle drinks off. But the fate seems to be written in the wind, and it's not a long time before killing Marily ("Mitch", not married or married), secretly injured mug, confused Lucy and sad drunk kills. <br /> <br /> <br /> Mal's Harleyy is as wonderful as Marion, his wonderful actress Oscar is worthy. He stole all the scenes he stole. The stack is nearly as good as holding the melodramata, although it still maintains low and quiet frustration. Hodson and Beckle are more restricted than they are, but the characters they play are to be observed. <br /> <br /> So what is all these melodrams? Well, a lot. For one thing, male potency and fear stack's powerful portrait. Sirac surrounds the stack with the falic symbols throughout the film - notice his small guns, oil deeric and the final fruit symbol, the impossible inability to contain Kyle's children. The stack appears to suffer from a greater male superiority complex, with the likelihood of her sister's choice for Hodgson, her sister's wishes for Hodgson and her doubts that her wife is worse off than Hodson. With all these resources, Kyle Hadley has still gone wrong in the city, bought "left" like cheap seeds. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to dream and give them up. When Kyle, Mary and Mitch were playing kids, the river was constantly depicted throughout the film, Kyle's symbol and (especially) Mary's innocence and her desire for simplicity. In an impressive musician scene, completely drawn by Maryland, standing on the banks of the Marily River and holding herself as a child, through the voice of Mikey, tells Mary that she will always be her daughter. Here is a huge emotional hit with Sirac viewers. Who did not dream to return to that special place in childhood? Who, at some point, has lived a treasured memory? They did not want something they could not have? And Hudson's last line of this movie (yes, there is no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes, only close-up) how we came to "Remarkably far from the Marily River". Amazing
