It is one of the best films from Hong Kong's New Wave, which starts with Sui Hark's "Z: Warriors of Magic Mountain". Taiwanese wrote a voice for New Wave's view in the martial arts film that most of the New Wave directors (Jackie Chan, Samo Hong, Wong Jing, Ching Siu Tung etc.) were accepted for most of the time; That is, if you do not have a complete joke from the methods of such films, it will be more than the touch of ridicule. "Junk burn" all that, and put a stop with revenge. <br /> <br /> There is no humor here; But it starts with absolutely humorous humor, such as the old Buddhist priest, in any way, newborns hide hidden in a fast pace of prostitution. But this is the same as human, even Buddhist priests can never be the entities. <br /> <br /> When the cat is finally presented in the film, it is the most viable, it comes from 'Abbat'. Red Lotus Temple, a study of pure non-violence that has never been recorded in the film. He is the very epitome of Satan of Milton from "Paradise Lost": "It is better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven!" And if he can not reach the devil's hell soon, he will turn around the earth around the world, which he can rule. <br /> <br /> This statue is highlighted below cruel violence in most of the images here. Abbott just does not want to kill people; He desperately wants to accept them as their frustration, undoubtedly the feeling of despair, the catastrophe. In this way, the scenes of the Red Temple are in a broad sense that there can not be any other reality outside the temple - it has all been in the universe, and is in charge of claiming the power of the unlimited, infinite power. <<br /> <br /> Of course, the film does not end. Although there is loss, till the end people should generally be general people. (If you want to know, check out the movie!) But we do not have any doubt about this movie. We do not testify to our own followers; But we certainly feel disciplined by experience - and it's pretty good for it.
