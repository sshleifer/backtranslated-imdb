It is a shame that deliverance is mainly known for redneck rape films and dueling banjoos. Even people who have seen the movie can not move their mind from the scene of that rape. It is not as bad as the rap fiction scene. This is certainly not as bad as a woman rape scene in a movie. People who lose sight of the infamous garden scenes lose their power. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of acting, plot, cinematography, and distribution all hands to her brudging career. It was pretty close to backcountry beautiful and dark subject matter. Both actors are big and minor that you feel that you are right rafting down that river as well. <br /> <br /> The image that separates this movie from others is a terrible horror sensation that inspires it. There are many movies you can think of this creeped out. Bottom Line: This movie is a classic. I really can not say much more than that.
