This is actually 3 trilogy of short stories from somerset mosquito. The first is the burger, which is about 15 minutes long and very enjoyable. After 17 years, Albert Foreman was fired from church jobs because he could not read or write. So what will he do? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, another 15 minutes one, and very good. This has done a good job for me in a film than a book, but probably because I was just 14 for the last time. <br /> <br /> The third is almost demeaned. About one hour length, it drags easily. It's not all bad, but not as quick and snappy as the last 2. I saw it in the first quarterly hours and then last quarter hour went ahead, and it still got to understand and really I did not miss a thing! <br /> <br /> Overall I have 10, 9, and 6 of them respectively.
