Foolish title is not fooled by people, this is a sweet ride! The real heir of Irene Man and Aichi The Killer is Tetsuo, this jewel begins with a bang and pushes the horse until the credit rolls. It seems that the aliens are accepting human bodies and amending them on war machines, which are used to fight each other in an impressive form of their species. The winner of the war loses the living. This is mostly for the plot, but who is careful when Gore is good? I did not know how many buckets were used, but it was hateful to see. When takeovers are in progress, there are interesting and effective uses of stop-motion, and loving care is lavished on all creatures and make-up effects. CGI is limited to a bit, but is actually not deterred from at least one bit of overall quality for me. It's really a fun and stomach-bent movie which was very much appreciated and in reality it has got a place in the styling of the classic classics. Find it and watch it, you will not be disappointed!
