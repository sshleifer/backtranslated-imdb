I do not know about any film in order to raise such debates in my life. Believe me when I say this picture will be remembered as the classic of all time. I was waiting to wait for this picture because I liked both Locks, Stocks and Snatch before, but after negative reviews I thought I would be very disappointed. I absolutely love this picture and I can not wait to see again. This photo is completely different with Richi movies mentioned earlier, and better. My favorite managers have a favorite place, but Gaya Richie has not been able to remove anything similar to this movie. I believe he has taken another stage of film making (I know most people will laugh to respond to this picture, but I believe the time will prove me right). This film is very confusing and has been running for more than 2 hours or longer because I could not think of it or try to break things together. I have received a lot about what is happening in this movie (some answers from the endless hours of thinking, some of the answers to reading other people in the movie) and now I can not wait till Sunday. I hope people will go to the movies with open mind and hope they will be rewarded as I and others have a lot.
