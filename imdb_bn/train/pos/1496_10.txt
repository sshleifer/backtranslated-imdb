It has enjoyed watching this movie on late-late TV and it has kept my interest through the whole picture. Looking at this wonderful vague, still mysterious English home, bad looking decorations and exhausted furniture and rooms that make you wonder why nobody likes to rent this house or even own it. There are four (4) tales about this house, and every household in the house meets all kinds of problems. You will see beautiful lakes and ponds and birds singing sweet songs around the house, but do not make you fool, there is a horror everywhere. Peter Cushing, "Black Jack", a resident of 80 homes and even Christopher Lee, "Currison Ulter Curse", 68 and his little girl, Clo Franks (Zen Red). Together a wonderful sensational story, for some reason his daughter loves to read WITCHCRAFT books! If you like surprising, terrible and mysterious films, with plenty of surprises, it's a movie for you !!!!
