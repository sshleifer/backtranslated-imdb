Indian summer! It was very nostalgic for me. I like it funny, heartwarming, and absolutely! Anyone who went to the camp as a child and sometimes wished, they can go back to "good ole" days, for a short time it will really look! After 20 years it started, a group of older campers returned for a "reunion". Do not comment on the plot because you will see it for yourself. The actors were great, and it's an all star cast. It plays a terrible role for everyone. You really felt that you were part of the movie to see it. Alan Armin was particularly good at the role of Aik Lu. He plays like a man that everybody wants his life. This is mostly a good family movie. I recommend this to anyone in the hitbat! Highly recommended!
