This movie like Chess love. <br /> <br /> A group of people stuck in a abandoned school. They start off killing, they know they are being trafficked, so what do they do? One girl decides to take a bath, and another husband (who is there) decides to buise her so that she can find some bed (old abandoned school?) And go to the other side. <br /> <br /> and it comes with Gore and T & A. <br /> <br /> And it's also interesting from a historical / social point. Whereas we see ourselves as a normal 80's slash, or how adults can see young people, or others, because of the views of other countries, it is a unique perspective. This is a Brit film made of an American slash. The British who are trying to talk about "American", without knowing them, are delighted to see how well they are doing while returning to UK accent. <br /> <br /> If you like 80 slashers (like pieces) you like it.
