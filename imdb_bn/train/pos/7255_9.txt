This is not a movie that you see for entertainment, at least most people I do not know. <br /> <br /> It happened in a war that gives both the body and mind the cruelty, especially the characters seem to be commendable, especially because you "read their minds", in the book and rarely found in movies, but Works very well in this piece. I will leave this permanent impression and put it next to "All the cool in the front of the West" and "Die Brook". <br /> <br /> I hope I can screen in screen at school, along with two other movies - but it seems to be very difficult to find a copy of - which is shameful.
