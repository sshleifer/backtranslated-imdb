I really enjoyed the movie, however, I did not understand that Little Richard was having too much of his life. First of all, I was not aware of Lucele. There are very few (rarely) references to women associated with Little Richard. There is no mention of women being involved romantic in today's life. I wonder why I was referring to this part of his life. Overall the movie was great. I do not like Leone to play Leon's part, he is a good actor, but I think that's another part of this part. Apparently he did not remind me Little Richard. I was fully aware of the imperfection that was part of Little Richard. He was pictured as a sex addiction from the film. Nowadays she will be referred to counseling for her sex couples. She was a vigilant. I do not want to destroy the movie for anyone who does not see the film, but there were a lot of things about the film, which I think should not be part of the final cut.
