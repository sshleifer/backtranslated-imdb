And yet another run of South Park ends. I hope that it was not like a strong episode, but there was a powerful Finnishist in Living Homel's Night of the Stanley Cup, Stast, Bloody Mary, or Emerson Day. It still does not hold a candle in Woodland Credit Christmas and Goebbes, but it can do several episodes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Instead of eating meat, the bodies seem to change the request that homeless and live it off. <br /> <br /> The roof and other residents have been locked in the community center, although this time on the rooftop, where they could have a visual survey. Especially interesting moment is when a member finds that his house has gone, and becomes heaven, and there is no other way than Randy to shoot him. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, four boys came out to solve the problem. The whole story behind homeless takeover is trying to publish a message, but seriously uncertain. South Park is ridiculous when it's the best time to find it. Matt and Tray played safely this week and did not criticize the homeless problem. <br /> <br /> This shocking moment comes when a scientist tries to refrain from homeless. . This is the first time in South Park that suicide has happened, and we see that poor people fall in the absence of their brain, and then he tries to shoot himself while painfully die. Another inspired South Park moment <br /> <br /> Overall, this episode was fun, but it's going to be great by stopping any real comment from the homeless and sticking directly to the Jimmy Shatik. The last is a little fun, but nothing new. <br /> <br /> Now we have to wait for our next episode October. It is a long looser, but it should be appreciated in South Park course for running. The show seems to be running out of steam in the last season, but now it returns to full form.
