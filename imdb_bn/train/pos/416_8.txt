Plainsman is a recreational western, no doubt a classic, which is still real today. Gary Cooper is ideal for this role with Wild Bill Hikk, John Wayne and James Stewart, they are the best actors of Western heroes of their generation. Jane Arthur's accident is great as Zen, I know that someone played better than him. Even if it is not historically accurate, then the film deals with Hikoc and the most important capture time of it. Sometimes you need to make history to make your points and that's what DeMille is here. Hikoc's friendship with Baffle Bill, soldier's rifle by a great producer to compensate for his loss due to helpless relationship between Caster and Little Big Horn, wife of Buffalo Bill's wife, ending civil war. With a hikoc, a religious woman, who was killed a lot, an amazing love relationship between Hikoc and Kleemati, all these 'The Placeman' created an outstanding and interesting movie. Anthony Quinn has a very small appearance, that already looks like a great actor is going to be. At that time, many care was taken to show the original gun.
