In 2006, AMPAS was awarded one of the most innovative documents that depicts wildlife in the world's coldest place, this image is described by Penguin's March, as the Academy Award winning actor Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now a decade of animated circuit is a monopoly. They took their stab to make live action film and it has been hit and missed across the board. Disney then created a sub-section named Disneyine and published the film's first feature film titled. I have seen it in a very sensitive and informative documentary. <br /> <br /> As told by the great James Earl Jones, the world does not offer new things in the last five years, or the person who follows the global warming crisis closely following the discovery channel. The world touches very deeply and takes a very generous view of the subject. <br /> <br /> It enables a mental relationship with nature which I have not experienced before. It also does not show the beauty and mysterious parts of our superb planet, but it often shows round and annoying aspects. The "Muhfas" falls from a steep hill in the middle of the mountain, or Bambi soil is one of the things shot by a hunter in the middle of the forest. It's all good because at the end of the film we know it's just a movie. It shows lame, smoker beer, elephants, life of all kinds of lives, living and dead in their normal habitats. These real things create a real movie experience. <br /> <br /> Although there is some heavy weight on the graphic nature of the photo (which many people would disagree), the world is a sensitive experience. Here's a stunning cinematography work by a wonderful camera team and a wonderful score by George Panton. Compared to Penguin or Grillley Man's March, it does not actually hold a benchmark, but it's great for itself. At the end of the day, you appreciate the praise of our planet and some sadness, because many of us can not meet these movies that we will be witness to the film. We still live here because we can not look for one or another planet. The earth is beautiful <br /> <br /> *** ****
