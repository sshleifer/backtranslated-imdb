This movie does not believe all of the negative reviews. Yes, it is made cheaply. Yes, cow's ridiculous. And, yes, acting sub-par. However, this is a textbook example of an elementary scalar flick, and if it is your "thing" (of mine!) You will enjoy it. This film has enough good aspects more than compensating for errors. For one, then the score by unknown Christopher Young is very unclear and utterly utter violence. The ending is mostly a welcome separation from the seemingly ending picture of the movie. And last, but at least, the setting made the film for me. The makers of this film can work better to "dress" the set to be more credible as the college dorm. However, you can ignore this error, setting is great. In a large, abandoned, reprehensible building, four collegiates are waiting alone to break. This is a repeat of the possibility. While watching, allow your imagination to do some work and I can enjoy this movie as much as you did.
