A great movie Lansbury and Tomlinson are perfect, the songs are wonderful, dancing, "Portobello Ballet", with excellent specifics for the specifics. As an animated section, the match between animals has become an instant classic; The final mountain with surgery is cool and attractive. I recommend reinstating a 134-minute version or at least 112 minutes of video. Here we have only 98 minutes of version in Italy, although the film was presented at the 117-minute running time of its original release. If possible, check out the German Video Cassette: It was generated from the 98 minute running, but it is a reflection of World War II and the absence of all the scenes between English and their Nazi attackers!
