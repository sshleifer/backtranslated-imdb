I am amazed at the negative comments I have read and can only guess that such commentators are less than honest. This is Joseph Smith's most moving and realistic images I've ever seen. It played well that sometimes I forgot that I was watching a movie. It was Yusuf's affliction, well-established optimism, lasting life in a way that made permanent sacrifice and permanent sacrifice between people and people in a way that made me feel foolish to be very foolish. If anyone can see this film without touching any Christian religion in a positive way, I would say it is not a person's image and film. I give the movie "10" and encourage the spirit of honesty. In a very short time, it gave an impressive illustration of a man who gave everything for his faith ... In a world where values ​​and beliefs are derided, this film has to be seen as a lasting reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be- We do not hold any religious beliefs. - Anne Pretie-
