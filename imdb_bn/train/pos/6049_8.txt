Freibard Road Trip Comedy, Gang Copper, "Stoner" movie and feel good British movie. <br /> <br /> This character is different from other movies in this role. Star Phil Daniels, Gary Strach and Geoff Bell have a great chemistry and their characters are very selective and realistic. The main story is that the adventures and mishaps center that happened around London along with their road trips to London, and the streets. This small film is also a great heart - it's not just for fans of bikers, because it keeps each other with the character's relationship with the dreams and sadness of the family of Girl Stretch Fred. Cinematography is also great - Love letter in the Welsh countryside and the impressive London street and in cities of Welsh countries, usually stopping pub life. <br /> <br /> I would recommend a heartbeat freebrush - stylish, acrobatic soundtrack, favorite characters and funny stories!
