There is nothing I do not like about Moonstruck. I'm from the Italian family of New York and when I see it, I sit in the house. Actors and actresses, conspiracy, mistress, comedians .. They all were fantastic. It starts a bit slowly, but there are many things happening within two days! Because of this movie I love Labohem. In the list of favorite movies, Moonstreak number 3. This is a "well-liked" movie where you leave the hamming "The Amor" in the theater or repeat your favorite line: "Old man, if you give those dogs a part of my food, I'll kick you dead"; "Chrissy, bring me a big knife", "who died", "You love him Loretta ....., because when you better, they drive you crazy because they know they can". I keep Moonstruck when I am always happy when there is nothing good to see.
