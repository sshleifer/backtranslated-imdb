A new direction for Victoria and Albert's story brought the life of the director Jan-Mark Vale. The tremendous thought of most people of Queen Victoria has ruled for decades and spent her life in mourning. Emily Blunt is much more than capable of the role of the audience, because she gave viewers a different perspective. He illustrates his youthful Victoria, ascend throne, and the primary year. Blunt's Victoria is both fresh and sophisticated throughout the film. In his strong scene, Albert (Rupert Mitra) and Lord Bettany (Paul Bettany) All actors have removed myself well with Miranda Richardson. There was no rigorous role in this. <br /> <br /> Although it is not about the story of dramatic arc and stylish "acting" moments, but the story is still interesting enough to be valuable to see it. There are some historical freedoms taken by screen writing, the film believes Victoria and Albert and the relationship between time and social and royal structures are true. Set designs and dresses outstanding. <br /> <br /> This picture will be most appreciated by history, duration plays and blunt and attracted to other actors. Sincerely recommend <br /> <br /> Grade: A
