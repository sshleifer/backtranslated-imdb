Parker (Janathan Shake) is an aspiring writer who is still looking for his big break. Meanwhile, he worked as a telephone advisor for Manhattan's mental hotline. One day, unfortunately, burned down his apartment building. Parker and his cat make it alive, but now trapped with the difficult task of finding affordable housing in the Big Apple. A woman who comes to the word Parker, Samantha (Alison Eastwood) is looking for a roommate, but only a male man will take it. As Parker is straight, but the price is right, he claims to be gay. Samanta loves him from the beginning and welcomes him as his new teacher. But, poor Parker. Sam is beautiful, cute and very customizable. How can he keep his real nature under control? Besides, Sam is not a successful businessman-boyfriend? It is a sweet, favorite and humorous movie with two very interesting stars from Eastwood and Shake. Naturally, the plot "How will I continue the ruse" shows, a string when asking for shampoo with Sam Sir, when he gets bad news when he gets bad news, shower or ask him to keep him in bed. Also, it is important for Parker to create his own "fake" gay partner Boris, when Sam insists he fixes him with a person. Hopefully, the gay community can not find too objectionable, because the viewer felt that most issues were considered sensitivity and damage. For a small film, clothing, set and camera work was also pretty cool. Therefore, if you love those funny stories of love but get it soon. I like what you see, I know.
