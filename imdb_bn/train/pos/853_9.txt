"Matador" Pierce Brosnan star as a burned killer. She went to James Bond's seeds, very tight, girl dresses, gold chains, and an ugly haircut. Our struggling killer, Julian Noble, is trying to get back to his nerves in Mexico. While at the same hotel, Danny Wright (Greg Binair), his fate trader, is trying to get his balance back. Danny is reluctant to go back to a contract with Davro (Hope Davis) to stop an agreement and good news. <br /> <br /> Nobel and Wright became friends unexpectedly. Wright Noble convinces to reveal some strategies, which he has shown at a bullfight. Noble is finally targeted by its employers and shows Denver. <br /> <br /> Writer and director Richard Shepard has answered after this delightful film at the Austin Film Festival. Shepard was down on his fate. After losing his agent and rejecting the recent script, he decides to write a story and does not want to create a character that nobody wants to play. Then Pierce Brosnan. Bazzan returned to his balance in this movie. (There is life after the bond!) She has a nice mood for the spontaneous comedy. Do not miss it. <br /> <br /> For closing credits to stop what movie makers are saying about ballifting. I look forward to more projects by Richard Shepard
