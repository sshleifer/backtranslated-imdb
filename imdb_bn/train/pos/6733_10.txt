There has been a spot in the recent surfing films that I seem to be going through dangerous alert without warning. I was caught this treasure on this digital cable this week and what a wonderful surprise! From the Greg tube of 60, our focus has been on the progress of the big wave surfing of the jaws from Mavericks in Waimea Bay to our current Leard Hamilton. Hell, I can only see this film about Layered Hamilton - one of the best athletes of this generation - so the rest is only gravity. Past and present surfing stars meet with good surfing loads, which is a happy, relaxed and flexible fashion. Among all the surfing films I have seen it is the best of the big waves story and I think it's my favorite. Enjoy!
