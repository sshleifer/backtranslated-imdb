This is a crazy scientist who created half a shark - makes half a bird bird in unknown island, then calls on his old business and academic friends and comes to see his creation (bad smile) but in reality he wants his sharkman to kill them! Many bad GCIs, hidden plot components, and tight t-shirts followed the bitter babes. <br /> <br /> All these giant movies follow the same formula, but it spices up with a fun thing (I'm sure those who made this person firmly planted their molasses), not to mention sexy babes. But let's say those sexy babes - many hot babes, tight t-shirts, fall in love. One at the beginning of his undies, at the other end. Thank you, bad filmmaker! The plot is full of dark matter, a man enters a jeep, drowning it in a tree, then flies off the island in a helicopter. Yes, Um, well, how we think a little bit for it; We will get back to you. Sharkman Sunny - Both horror CGI or a rubber case equally ridiculous. The crazy scientist gives a fantastic performance; He is evil, his motivation, he does not forgive. <br /> <br /> Overall, if you want a fool, FUN B-movie, this one should do the job.
