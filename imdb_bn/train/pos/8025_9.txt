I love this picture. Songs and story lines are great fun. And the song "Saying Goodbye" always moves me. What a brilliant thing to bring the puppet back to life, the way you dress and fabric and everything you have created, you are really concerned. Great voice and great talent Why are such other Muppate films so interesting, moving and funny? That's Mr. Henson is just so missed too?
