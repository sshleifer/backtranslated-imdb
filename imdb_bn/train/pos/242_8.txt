I thought the film was very well-formed, Heath Ledger was very convincing and his Irish accent was flawless. Orlando Bloom and Naomi Watts were really good and trustworthy. I have no idea what really happened, but it has been portrayed as why people are ever doing what they do. Probably in the authorities who were always corrupt and I found it interesting that a petition was signed not to hang more than 30,000 Ned Kelly, so maybe this film was more true than the first thought? In many ways it reminds me of the Cold Mountain which is another good historical movie. Above all, I would highly recommend this movie and I would be a bit annoyed because it was not much better in the movie.
