I have not seen many German comedies, but if I have to go to this movie then I am forced to see more! The simple but effective story brings two very different people from Germany to Italy, the two unemployed mother named Eva, shows her relationship with a wealthy lawyer's wife with her artist husband's wife. I will not publish anything else, but what is a very interesting series of events about the consequences of the consequences? Seeing the first movie I have increased my interest in international cinema. I recommend it to anyone (do not allow a adult to fool a family movie to include small children) who love comedy - even strangers with languages.
