I'm a big Beatles fan. My dear Beatle Paul and my least loved John. Along with the truth behind Beatles music and breakout, I already knew something like Jon Lennon's family and Paul's band Wings. I was very interested to see how this movie will handle John and Paul's relationship many years after the break-up. <br /> <br /> I was not frustrated by this movie. Although the story itself is fantastic, but the two musicians used in most references were very correct. They were also included where Yokko Ono lived in the place where he always lived, the song "Silly Love Gans" became the hit of the year, and music was played from the concert album "Let It Bee" on the Apple Studio Roof. <<br /> <br /> Actor John and Paul did very well by playing. Pronunciations may work a bit more, but they started working as much as I used to do two ex-bitls. I also like the conversation between them, which was originally the original movie. <br /> <br /> At first I was disappointed, but as much as you thought, the more you would appreciate it, especially how it really went in real life. They display a wonderful skit from "Saturday Night Live", where Beatles were given $ 3,000 on the show. (Others were offering them $ 22 million) Overall, I was not disappointed with this movie. It really makes you feel more about why the beetles fall and why they do not go back together.
