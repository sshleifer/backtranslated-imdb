Miss Lenon is quite excited about a series of random, seemingly irrelevant theft at her sister's boarding house. A ring, light bulb, a rucksack, a lighter, a stethoscope, a shoe ?? It seems to have no rhythm or reason. Miss Limon asks his employer, Belgian detective Horkel Pirot to monitor the issue. But what Pierreot saw was more sinful than Miss Lemons. And the fear of pirate is ensured when one is killed in the boarding house. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I am thankful that the script is how faithful Agatha Christie's original story is. I understand that some will have to take liberties, but I am still grateful. Is there all the main points of mysteries ?? Little thieves, boarding houses, students, traps, rickshaw, and, of course, it really is happening before looking at something terrible of Pierot. With a few exceptions, students cast almost as I impressed them. Among the teams, Damien Lewis and Jessica Lloyd standout. As I always enjoyed David Sucre Poirot as Mush, I get a real kick of episode with Philip Jackson's Inspector Jap and Miss Lemon of Palin Murder. Miss Lamon gets more screen time than normal This episode is a real treat. Finally, I enjoyed using the current mouse as the observer of the hostel's activities. This is a funny little game titled Hikori Decree Dock. <br /> <br /> When I re-seen the Hickory Decree Doc, I realized that the glue Christie's work was very impressive on Italian stylus, or gaeli, on it! 60s and 70s. For example, kill Mrs. Nicholas. If you are bump up the graphic nature in the scene, you will straighten something from Giallo's early 70s. In fact, the entire plot of the Hikori decree dock could be used in Geyolot. It is just enough convoluted and interesting enough to be done.
