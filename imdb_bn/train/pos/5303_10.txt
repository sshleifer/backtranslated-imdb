John Waters ("Pink Flimings" ...) "Packer" I have seen in a while some of the best movies. Barleymore (I live in nearby Washington, DC) uses visual color, exaggerated speed, and emotions to give a realistic picture of the lifestyle of the audience. Packer grew up to manage her city, and she is separated from her beloved-boyfriend by her industry director (including a sexy rickshaw). The picture has a refreshing taste in my mouth - like fresh strawberry ice cream on the hot summer day - and although this taste was rather flat and simple, it only makes the whole thing deeper and more critical. It is the right to celebrate life, freedom and arms ... and this country has stood in all other things. -Juan Pikazanski (jpieczanski@sidwell.edu)
