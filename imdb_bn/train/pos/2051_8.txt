Ah, Macben ?? The name of the character is immortal and is forever ridiculed "Simpsons" but will it always be ?? To me personally, at least ?? Stay in the 90th Workshop with the name and title of a great recreational and oppressive violence; Our "The Extreminator" directed by Cool Dad, and finally, starring Bidas B-movie hero Christopher Walken and Michael Ironside (later with a cute little macho ponytail). I guess "MacBean" will be labeled as a guilty pleasure, because in no way can I satisfy someone. This is an intellectual motion picture. The picture is unimaginably overwhelming (mostly the action hero takes to a small gangster attire, Macben takes the whole country) and still takes himself very seriously. The script is a non stop and incubator spitfire, nonsensitive twists, intrinsic intrinsic intensity, large-scale action sequence, and completely unclear character drawbacks in a clinical situation. This is a complete stimulating movie; I love it <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> They all keep a half-dollar note as a symbol that Macbayne is in Santos' debt. Eighteen years later, Santos was a persecuted rebel who led the revolution against his country's corrupt president. The initial attempt to transfer the power of Santos failed and he publicly executed El President's Balloon execution. Her sister travels with a dollar note in New York and becomes a Macben for financial support and manpower. Macbayen and his ex-Vietnam friends, all of whom have been involved in this injustice, made themselves unfortunate little flat and went to open a demon of Hopup-Ass in Colombia. <br /> <br /> Well, do not fool each other The user you are reading already indicates in "MacBean" that you have some interest in the low-budget B-movie action. One of my fellow critics, spent some time writing a list of all the original stupidity and breaking moments of "Macbayne". This listing is absolutely correct and I can only agree with it. Hack, I can add more stupid sequences to that list (like a soldier's unreasonable and unreasonable heroic self-sacrifice, who has no mission to the mission and the rest of the Macbayne team), but the point? You definitely do not know 100% coherent and potential masterpieces. We already know it will be a stupid and exaggerated shocking movie and this is probably the right reason why we want to test it! This is a confusing and thrilling movie about a bunch of Vietnam's ex-Vietnam friends, who declare war against the corrupt Colombian President and the National Drug Cartel. Please do not expect another "apocalypse now". Lead this special motion picture ruff 'n tuff macho, complete an explosion and gunfight and many? Last but not least ?? Joan Boyz is a surgical soundtrack that sings a cover of "Brotherhood of Arms".
