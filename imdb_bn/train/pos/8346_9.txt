I just saw the eye. I forgot how much I love this movie tonight. It is amazingly entertaining and you feel that is true with all the world. During the IQ testing of Ed Walter, to highlight Ein Klein Nachtumusik, we made fun of everyone from the beginning of opening Violin "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" with "Einstein". I love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and has been encouraged for a career, especially in the 1950s, the unique situation that has been set in this movie. (I was a teacher myself but stayed home to raise my kids, so please do not think that I am a deadly female freedom fighter.) It is wonderful that finally a man who is "only a Greek monkey" is important and worthy of Catherine's fighter, A clinical behavioral researcher. The message to me is that we do not do what we do, but we are so much defined - there are no labels. If you do not see the clock and do not listen carefully then there are many small Gog and one-fishing scenes. <br /> <br /> I grabbed a few things in the movie which is not listed on the Goh page. Speaking at Ed Walter Symposium, apparently hanging from shining to the right three instruments (protectors, rulers, etc.) The next camera is only 2. There is a list of Bob Waters, like Bob Waters, in the credit picture on our video, not Bob Rose, he is presenting himself in the film and here is the list of Emblem. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie. Some of it may be a piece of lung, but it has a lot more substance to give credit. Just that, what a great cast is gathered here. See it and enjoy!
