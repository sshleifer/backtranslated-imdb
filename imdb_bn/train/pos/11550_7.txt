If you delete the first twenty minutes of this movie or more, then you will leave an extraordinary comedy. Since, I still found it as a beautiful movie, which was not a small achievement that I had to keep down with the first scene. To keep it lightly, this movie is a great start, which was even far-fetched even not even excited. Once things become silhouette, you go through a comedy that is still good for more than three decades. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you want a young fan of Lemon and Matthou who wants to see their previous work.
