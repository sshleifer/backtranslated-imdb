This is arguably the most awesome game I ever play. It's not nearly shooting-everything-which fps types (which I do not care about most often), but acceptable gfx, interesting weapons and magic, great surroundings ("screen, screen ..") and above all the incredible atmosphere. I love Skry, which enables you to watch or listen to events that happened in the past at certain locations in games. The only game was to take regular breaks after a few minutes of the game due to the intensity of the atmosphere. I love Clive Barker's stories and movies, especially a terrific frightening fan, and taking part in such a horror story encourages me to play more games that emphasize in the atmosphere and more involved stories. 9/10 (-1 because I did not have any FPS fan, and perhaps the game was a little short?)
