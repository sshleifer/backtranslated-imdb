Before reading this movie, I read a little while and you want to know, he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and he hated what his forces did for the oppressed forces. As well as all other Latin Americans are common! Now, I do not know about others, but due to socialism, he has done the right thing so that everyone has to share their fair share. However, the powerful elite is definitely not going to go for that. So, instead of understanding what Che Guevara was, he was forced to kill him to try to suppress the revolution. This does not work for him, because he had a lot of followers, where he rushed to where he left. It was a good example if Castro continued leadership of Cuba. As far as I was concerned and Che said that he had just said before he died: "If you kill me, that's right, but you're just killing a man, because you will never kill!" I could not say it better than myself. <br /> <br /> But ... ANYWAYS ... So I'm giving this image 7 out of 10.
