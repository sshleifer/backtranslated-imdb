When I was in the theater I used to read a lot and they were all bad .... It seems that in order to enjoy these movies you must be a certain type of person. If you are not a person who enjoys Walton or Little House ... you will not understand these U movies and do not enjoy these movies ... <br /> <br /> Now love to maintain happiness ... I knew That was the bad news the movie started .... I hope it has shown you more instead of finishing it. This movie has done a lot with Jeff .... After 6 years you know that she will be interested in girls. <br /> <br /> I want to say that I have enjoyed four movies so far. ... the book was not crazy ... wait until the next movie. Clark discusses the ways you get each time. I do not see a look of January Jones ... maybe a family reunion or anything.
