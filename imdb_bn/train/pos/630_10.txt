I did not expect much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I've just gotten close to work It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait for 40 minutes in the movie line and there was no cold air circulating through the hallway of the theater complex. <br /> <br /> Once the movie was tired and frustrated, the movie started. , I did not recognize any actor at the beginning, but the film's stream was perfect. From the beginning, I ate with the movie, being more excited by each minute. I was determined to be a fantasy / fairy classic in this movie. The actors were fabulous, the speed was perfect, and the last witch was.
