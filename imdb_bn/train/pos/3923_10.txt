This is a wonderful film, for both incredible energy emerging from the progressive Flamenco dance, and filmmakers distinguish the story of living life of characters prepared for it. Spellbinding is the only word that I can use to describe the experience. This is not the 'Carmen of Budget' by any common value. This is not a normal film by any standard. Every minimal eye, every column on the foot, every piece of music is stuck separately so that you can not take your eyes off the screen. You do not have to love the opera or flamenco (I do) for captivated, enraptured, captivated by this image. Fine and straight; High and still; One, if not the best, it's kind of kind, because it has very little.
