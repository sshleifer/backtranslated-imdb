I do not really laugh this hard for a movie for a long time. Hollywood has been putting out that garbage to drive me up a garbage! This one was definately fresh and malicious. For the ratings you look at the demographic statistics, only a few women have votes! I do not want to destroy this movie for you, but I'm sure everybody saw it on their computer and why it gave a poor score? Because the movie puts men in their place, that's why. If more women vote because of the real humor of this movie and it is not harmful to men, it can easily be a "7" rating movie!
