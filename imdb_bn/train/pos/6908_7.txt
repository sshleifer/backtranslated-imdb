Richard Dreyfas starred in "Chun Over Paradora", in 1988 Paul Morzarski also starred Raul Julia, Sonia Braga, Jonathan Winters and Charo. Paradise in the Caribbean country, New York actor Jonathan Nolan played Dreyfus for the production of a movie. When the dictator dies suddenly, the Secret Police Chief (Julia) is actually a dictator and controls the country, Jonathan drafted to play autocracy, saw the similarity between them. Soon Jonathan Alfons came to the palace as Sims and Sims's prostitute, girlfriend Madonna (Braga), who switched to the conversation that he promised to help him in any way. <br /> <br /> Mazar√ßi, who pulled up as Sims, said, 'Our mother, the CIA, looks at how it works in Third World countries. Winters character, supposedly a salesman, is actually a CIA operator. Although the film flirts but does not really walk on very serious grounds, it is more of a text and it's a fun thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The actor and Alphonse dictator, created two separate letters and both nailing. Fantastic Sonia Braga is as great as Madonna, and Raul Julia hands out a harmless fun performance to Strumasman, who was behind dictatorship. It's one of the performance where you do not know exactly what the character is thinking - he may be happy or psychologist at any moment. Four are holding hands as a maid and at the same time to be funny and irrational. <br /> <br /> is a very good movie, not a big blockbuster, but very entertaining.
