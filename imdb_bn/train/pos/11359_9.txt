Citizen XT, the real life of a serial killer, called "The Roastow Ripper", tells the drama that this great movie shows the long journey that a killer has to capture. This movie shows how politics can have an effect, for more than 12 years, the killer helped keep his anger. (Probably more than 50 people, mostly women and children) were spellbound as the limited detective and Donald Sutherland performed as lead investigator Stephen Rhea. Jeffrey Demon is called Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chichatilo. This is a movie that makes you gentle and instantly you are on the internet by researching the real case. This one film will not be missed. It believed in Habibut and was not released in the theater for my understanding. Great Film
