I started seeing Apprentice nearly 4 years ago (probably 5) and I really liked it really. The first thing that strikes you about this is the refreshing format, which is very similar to many other reality shows in its core, but still very entertaining. The Donald Tram as the chief judge of the host and event is excellent. Casting coup with intelligent individuals is appreciated as well as being selected as competitors. But the best part of the show is New York City. Mark Barnett could have made a lot of bad talk in his time, but the management of cinematography was great because he looked like a NYC character like himself. Jam Tunes combined with some great camera-work makes New York spectacular. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you see it for a while, then the originality of the ceremony will be worn quickly (i.e. the same case with TAR). Broadcasters in this country, global broadcasters have started working on the show. The first three seasons are shown in the queue, then two years later the next two seasons are shown, which keeps the concept fresh. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, you will love this show, especially the first 2 seasons. But if you look at the series continuously, the next charm will be closed.
