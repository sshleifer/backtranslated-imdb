This is a beautiful film. The truth conversation between the father and the son bonds. To this end, Tom Hendhes at its best. Tom Hans is really out of this movie box. She usually has a nice guy role. Yet in this film, he appeared a little bit beautiful in this film, but still a rose-like perfume appeared, even to the last scene, the murder of his character. The cast of this movie is well together. Tom Hans is the character when Mr. I also love the whole silence of the people of the Rooney group and beat them. Cool and still deep in any of the scenes in that scene, just easily emotions. I love Lou Rooney's face when he looks at Paul Naynman's character, but he realizes that Tom Hans's character is taking revenge and he knows that his fate has come. For the first time I watched this movie and I knew that I had to go out and get the video and because I added it to my favorite movies collection. <br /> <br /> Tom Hans is my favorite actor, so this film has a special place in me.
