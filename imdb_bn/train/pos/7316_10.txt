This image is the best one of all time, certainly in the horror section. The clustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is as good as the film and the killer may be frustrated! Actor Pretty, Rept Donald Pleasance was fantastic as you Dr Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital element. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as our favorite scream queen! His innocence makes him aware of the real evil, which is not murdered in his house after finding his friends, of course, one of the best films. She gives a tremendous performance. I saw it at the age of 80 when it was scared like hell, and I still see this day because it's an incredible film that brings you to this world, you can get lost like a fish. Frequently! This is a simple arrangement of a masked mad man who escapes from a mental shelter and has no idea that he is ready to kill everyone without any idea that he is there, it is just frustrating and horrific. Though the fiction as the event may be true in fiction. We all know that unfortunately there is evil in this world and crazy people are not extraordinary with a knife, it is a deeply dangerous fear for everything. No shortage of death Of course Halloween shows it the most awesome way. Horus will be credible, and that makes the film enjoyable. This is an excellent story which is created in a wonderful and terrific environment. As well as the fantastic storyline of Psycho, which I adore both, I believe that format has the best awful offer. For me, the best movies of Halloween and the sequoies that I have ever seen and I will look at them throughout life and they will not be tired. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.
