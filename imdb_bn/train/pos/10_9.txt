I am not for a man, women film, but it's really a good work special story I have no personal love for Jane Fondara as a general, but he has done a good job, even though DÃ©rono is his usual superb self. Everything is working so well: acting, instruction, visual, settings, photography, welding. If you can enjoy real people and real love stories - this is a winner.
