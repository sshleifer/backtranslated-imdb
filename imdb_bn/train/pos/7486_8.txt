I will go really late like this movie for some reason, I will go late but I do not want to touch people why I do not think so. First off, those who have just loved Tom Cruise hate. I do not really understand it Secondly, Cameron Crowe has successfully completed the two groups of movie-gear with this picture. At the end of the movie, during 180 complete movement, movie-passengers groups "do not want to think too hard", are casual, discouraged. And deep, philosophical, mysteries are destroyed when Crowe explains the whole mystery of one character. <br /> <br /> This is a good movie. And Tom Cruise makes it a very good job. I think I've probably seen all of his movies, even most of them probably did not see it, though it's probably his best performance from what I saw. Supporting cast is as good as well. Penelope Cruz gave a strong performance and Jason Lee was enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I like the story, and I think Vanilla Sky is more than that. It's a mystery, an adventure, and a romantic comedy, but it's mostly just a good story. And it has many philosophical initiatives, and many such opinions and stories happen in the historical perspective. David Eames (Cruise) is the person who wanted everything that was less than or less than that, was given a second chance to return to the bottom and ultimately faced his ghosts and face the full scope of what was happening. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think it's necessary. The audience then crosses the shadow of a doubt that David is aware of his situation and makes it ultimately stronger. <br /> <br /> and the music in the film is superb. It's probably what makes it as enjoyable movie as In particular, "Njosnavelin" Sigur Rose, which is a wonderful song. <br /> <br /> All, I want to give it 3 out of 4 stars. This is a great story for a film that likes to think about something and looks for peace. This "moderate" approach is probably why people dislike it because it is not a whole mystery, or a complete leakage story of love. Mix it and match different elements and styles.
