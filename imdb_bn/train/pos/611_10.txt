I have blundered the blame for anyone that blames anyone responsible for the creation of the trailer / endorsement for this movie. I wanted to see this movie based on this preview and everyone who really saw it (that I know) absolutely love ... Advertising Dislike Disorder / Disaster / False <br /> <br /> Open # 4 behind <br /> <br /> # 1-Rush Hour, which I did not see, Average IMDB score 7.4. <br /> # 2- Bourne Ultimatum, which I saw, a horror movie but out of the third week, an average of 8.7's IMDB scores. (I'm worthy to say). <br /> <br /> # 3- The Simpsons movie, which I saw, is OK but in the 4th week, the average IMDB 8.1 score (slightly higher in my opinion). <br /> <br /> # 4-Stardust, Average IMDb score 8.4 (Lower Bourne, but it's been for 3 weeks). <br /> <br> It was bad timing or bad advertising. I think the power behind this movie is big time! It should have been advertised as an amazing movie which can be a fantasy / fiction and not advertised as any other story? Too bad :( Anyway - now I have ranted unnecessarily unauthorized ... extraordinary movie, go see it!
