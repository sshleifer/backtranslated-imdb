After the success of the second installment, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton decided that the Blackdaughter should have a third appearance. Instead of Times Bar or Elizabeth Bar, Edmund Blackdream (BAFTA nominated Rowan Atkinson) lives in the French Revolution. The "faithful" Butler of Prince Prince Regent (Hugh Laurie) of Wales with the now stupid but loving Baldrick (Tony Robinson) Blackdader This third series tries to make all that can be enriched and powerful to the wondrous written sitcom blackdader. He tried to sell a book, trying to sell a book, trying to win a bit about Scarlett Pimpernel, tried to be a highway man and eventually poses as a prince. It's a very good installment of the popular comedy. Robi Coltren, Tim McInnary, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Frey were present. It won BAFTA for the best comedy series and it was nominated for Best Design and Best Make Up. The 50 best British actor Rowan Atkinson had 18, comedians were 24, and Britain's favorite comedian was 8, Edmund Blackaard was the number one of the 100 best TV serials, and he was number 3. The world's greatest comedy character, and Blackdaughter (all four series) was the second place in Britain's Best City. Distinguished!
