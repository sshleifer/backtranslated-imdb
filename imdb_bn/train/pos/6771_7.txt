So yes it is quite annoying to see the 1st episode, because I certainly remembered this episode. I enjoy watching the first season and with the yes action pack show we think now this show is Lam. But I really like the "low violent" part of the show, and the story line now has more material than the new ones. Belgian AirPaul and Jaegee have the same theme - I think the main actor (Haq and Haram) is both a MIA relative (brother, father) looking for. It is surprising that Robert Belisarie's personal life illustrated the theme of these two events. <br /> <br /> Q - Does anyone have pictures of Hawk cabin? I love the cabin (like a dream cabin like me) and it's one of the scenes, which I think of airup.
