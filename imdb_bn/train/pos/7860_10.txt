I never saw a silent film until July 24, 2005. I've never seen a movie with Mary Piccord. I saw thousands of movies. Very few are hypnotic for me. I saw the last of the glorious and unforgettable (hypnotic) memories, so consider it as a source to read. I started watching Storm Country Tess in TCM, just wanted to see this Mary Pikford, who has been credited by many for the introduction of Hollywood. There was no idea what I was for. After two hours, I moved away from it, and realized that I saw the beautiful woman I saw, her role is perfectly suitable. Imagine the movie fan in 1922, never seen anyone who was fantastic and publisher before. You will see him again and again. The setting was perfect for a girl that was publisher. He had a poor hole, King could not speak English, but you would appreciate him. What a movie ... while starting my Mary Pickford movie collection!
