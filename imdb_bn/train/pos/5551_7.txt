I really wanted to like this picture and I do not think I was very frustrated. Being an American history teacher, I often felt a responsibility to watch this movie, and the extent to which it went away was not bad. Of course there were some mistakes here (especially with the timeline - the film appeared only in a few months or maybe a year - not six years of actual war), but the overall spirit of film and war was excellent. Unfortunately, the movie ALSO includes a poor patriotic and difficult to believe in romance between a godly loyalist is a difficult nonsense subplot. In most cases, it really delves into the whole plot and just "likes" - like a platy device rather than a true honesty-to-romance romance. In fact, most of the romance has become warmer in the "little love" mobile phone, as much as I was bothered about it. <br /> <br /> However, despite the romance, the film is really interesting and inspirational --- plus, in many ways, the next image is being taken from Patriot Griffith Film !!! Both films use a terrible leader fighting for the British and civilians against terrible and evil techniques - and both of them use the secret intention to use it as a "springboard" to start their OWN nation in America! The only major difference is that the image is located in North and Patriot Caroline. If Mel Gibson and the rest are for the ideas of the story. Wow Griffith accepts his loan but it must have been good. <br /> <br /> PS - Like this film and a few other pictures of Griffith, he again "portrayed all the black men in the film for white actors! Griffith is a sick and intelligent thing - especially on a nation's birthday in many of his films. I should guess based on this and illustrate Blacks that he was non-obeying with slavery and this "vague antibody" Done "(Do not be crazy to me) - for this it was blame.
