I'm not sure what I say about this film. It's a romantic one that will sometimes consider a handful of a boxing. To try to talk about the plot or performance or technical details about this movie, "junk like architecture" will be spoken in Frank Jupa words. It absolutely hurts the nail on the head completely, taking away the passing moments in our lives and not experiencing a run away from us. Charley Kaufman's character version looks like this movie at the movie adaptation. The last open and hesitant left, no happy ending here, just mystery. Only a few of the discovery of the power of deep learning, the power to feel the most irrational and unrealistic feeling of the feeling of evil and intelligent kids ... romantic love. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 see this with you special lady and a stranger recommend it ................
