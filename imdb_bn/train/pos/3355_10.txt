May 1938. Hitler in Italy. Preparation for a historical appointment with Mussolini. Emotions, tension and self-defined forms. An empty city, a housewife and a journalist. Two different world meetings Refugees for a mother with sad life. Small filling for a classical victim. A story about loneliness and silence. About the forms of life like the nooks of life and the form of war. Great Character - A gift gift to a spring afternoon. This movie is a poem, extraordinary for the industry describing the general loneliness shadow. A pleading for an ineligible relationship with reality. And with your internal world. Two great actors, the director of the Illusion scene, antagonistic prejudice, patience and Gabriel's tiredness, giving the impression of the grace of the scriptures, about the film's subtle, subtle fineness, an extraordinary film about hypocrisy and deliberate judgment, the essence of life and the repulsiveness of any oppression. Lorraine and Mastriani are a great intelligent acting master. A clear masterpiece.
