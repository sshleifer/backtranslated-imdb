"COSBY," in my opinion, to see a CBS hit! I'm not sure I've never seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to tell which is my favorite. Also, I really like theme songs. If you asked me, though I would have liked all of you, it would have been better if you could not keep the ear at Madeline Cannes. As that happened, I always wondered what the show was like. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, although it can be seen now in TBS, but I strongly recommend that it will be caught if the wind is stopped properly
