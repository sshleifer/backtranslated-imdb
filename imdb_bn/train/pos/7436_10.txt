This illustrated representation of "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" is one of the most beautiful and interesting presentations of the collection of poems. The epic poem of 1798 is a painting of the world's famous artist and the excellent illustration of Michael Redgrave, in the painting of two centuries of striking paintings, this wonderful view is very good. <br /> <br /> In the Television era, this type of work is an invaluable tool for young learners, as well as adults, exploring and learning about the value of great poetry. My knowledge is best, such work is really rare; That's tragic. As a professor of world literature and a former college professor and academic councilor, I think that many other epic poems like "Rim of ancient Marina" should be "translated" by Coleridge. Although not a movie critic, I am delighted to suggest this fine product without any reservations as an enthusiastic reader of classic literary.
