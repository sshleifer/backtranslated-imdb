Michelle Rodriguez was made for this movie, when I first saw him and The Furious. You can say that he was a tough woman. Through this movie, he has not only proved his acting, but there is no fear in him and he is difficult to be like this movie. She is also a bad girl and I like what she's about. This movie is a frustrating daughter, Tom is living like a boy and there is a constant problem with school and family. When he was interested in training his brothers from a boxer, he agreed to fight after his love and asked his brother to train him for training. Although they do not think that there are possible possibilities, they will prove proven wrong. <br /> <br /> I think the movie was a bit slow, but it was well done. It shows that people can do something even if they do not think possible to you. I recommend to meet it.
