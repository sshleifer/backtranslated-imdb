The film expresses concern about Philip (Leslie Howard), a serious but offensive drug student. He is in love with Melodious (Bate Davis) cruel, predatory waiter. He gave her away, hugged others (Alan Hale, Reginald Denny). Meanwhile, he romance with another suitors (K Johnson, Frances D) but he went back to mutually destructive relations. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> A bottle of Cockney's brutal waitress won a fantastic explanation with Davies's an alluring and smoldering performance, from the beginning to the end which bondage is absolutely hypnotic in her account. Davis rose stardom with its performance. The female role-playing posteriors of her role as tough and crude will be repeated several times. Leslie Howard basically gives a nice and tricky performance by completely destroying good and decent students. He was an outstanding actor during the WWII era producer and writer and died in the crash of the aircraft. Both will play again in the Pythropied Forest (1936). The atmosphere film has been extensively reaffirmed in the Rocko (Radio Picture Inc.) studio. Alan Parker and Paul Henryd in the memory of Admand Goulding in 1946; And why did Hughes with Kim Novak and Lawrence Harvey in 1964? Motion pictures like classic movie buffs. Ratings: Very good but a little dated.
