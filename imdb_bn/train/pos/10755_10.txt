The greatest documentary about the lives of New York's firefighters during the greatest terrorist attacks of all time .. The only reason why this should be the collector item should be .. Do not I just amazed, "High Fat Diet" and this firefighter some physical appearance I think many doctors would agree with me that they were in physical shape, this firefighter would not be able to carry some 60 gears of gear until the 79th floor. I now have a greater respect for the firefighters and I work to change a life to understand becoming becoming a firefighter. The French have a great documentary history and this is a great documentary.
