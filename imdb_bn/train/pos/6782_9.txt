Ronald Colman is the famous Broadway actor who started to lose his mind and identity. After several years of playing in different parts, he can not remember who he really is - who is his role and who is the soul. And, more serious, he regularly sees his play even in daily life and starts to listen. So, he is currently playing in "Othello", so he started jealous and suspicious work just like the title character. In the end, it leads him to the depth of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> I saw and liked this movie years ago. I just saw it again and loved it. Now for my excitement, I always like Ronald Callman and it's a great win for him - and for which he earned the best actor Oscar. And, looking at the competition of that year (Gregory Pack for Gentleman's agreement, John Garfield for the body and Solar, William Powell and father to become electron for Michael Redgrave), I think the call was a very good choice <br/> <br / > Now I have seen that a critic hated this picture because he hated Shakespeare - and about half of them reviewed them Spoke about their dislike. However, this image is not about Shakespeare, and it does not matter if you dislike Shakespeare. I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare, but I'm surprised at the small parts of the pen reconstruction - though I said it is not a true Shakespeare movie. Instead, it's an amazing portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage with reality. This can be a play, although the "Othello" was a great choice because of the killings - which later acted in reality for the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, the beautiful script of a very clever film - with some overtones in the film muted. Thankfully, the performance was also awesome, because Callman got excellent support from Sign Hashto, Shell Winters and Edmond O'Brien (who was particularly good - he played exactly his part). And, Great George Kikor was directing, it's no wonder that it's an extraordinary movie since its inception.
