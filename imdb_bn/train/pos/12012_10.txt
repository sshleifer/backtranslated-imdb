I saw it in the legacy theater at Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City in the morning. I think the level of one's enjoyment during this movie will basically be based on the recognition level of Joseph's story. <br /> <br /> However, it is very well made, well played, and a nice score. When you get to Salt Lake City, it must be seen in Legacy Theater. I was not a mere theater up to the quality of my whole life, sound quality and ambiance ... I wonder if the church will start to see me batman! Since I consider LDS and a Joseph as a prophet, I touched in several places and many times I came to the tears ... which I think, before the movie starts, they are expected after the release of tissues! However, I have been told that this film is available at various LDS visitors centers around the world, if you are tested for 70 minutes because you do not believe in Joseph Smith or not, he tells an interesting story.
