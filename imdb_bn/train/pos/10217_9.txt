According to this theory (I'm definitely not sure about Choice theory), each step, how small or small, a chain reaction will start, which can lead to big events. This small jewelery in a movie shows us the characters that are not related to the vast majority of them, most of them in Paris, because of which the influence of each other's life influences. (The six-degree separation-separation theory can be applied.) Each story is a jewel of this jewelery. The acting is fine-tuned and low (Audrey Torque Bright), mixing stories with fraud, laughter is right, and the viewer submits the theater to the contract.
