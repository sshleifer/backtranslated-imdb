From the early days of director John Ford, a painter pictorial from Abraham Lincoln's primitive years, which mainly focuses on a trial, where the young lawyer protects two brothers for the murder. The image and the movie were well-made by providing an interesting screenplay of this important American, but it seems that at some strange moment, her debate with her presidency or even with Stephen Douglas. Laksman's youth wanted to express clearly to develop the qualities that would make him a great man. But the result for me was that it was not satisfactory when I praised the film because I think it might be with a greater chance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Funda's performance includes some gangli system and other effects that are fairly effective in presenting a picture of a link, especially when some effective makeups and expenses are expensive to spend for a while. Strong and surprisingly, Ford's regular supporting cast does not include many (sometimes referred to as his stock company), but we have the most popular actor actor Ward Bond in Hollywood. Original and Revised List Bond More AFI appeared in the top 100 movies than both actors. He was nominated for the 11 Best Actor nominees. <br /> <br /> This picture highlights a scene that seems to have inspired a similar look in "Tole K Mckingbird", where it would be even better. Here, though this scene is the most effective one in this movie.
