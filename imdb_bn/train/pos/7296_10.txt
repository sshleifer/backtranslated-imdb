There is no relation between Fortari and Profiler, but these two incidents have a police series about violent crime. Profileile looks crispy, looks classic in Fortis. Profiler Plot is quite easy. Fortier's plot is much more complex ... Fortyears show more like Prime Suspic, if we have to show similar characteristics ... the main character is weak and weird, but there is "clearance". People like to compare, judge, evaluate. How about just enjoying? The funny thing is, the people of Fortier's writings show American, but on the other hand, they like the American series (!!!). Perhaps it's language, or spirit, but I think this series is more than the American English. However, the actors are really good and fun. Not acting on all surfaces ...
