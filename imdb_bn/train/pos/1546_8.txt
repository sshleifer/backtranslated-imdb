I have seen this film once or twice a year (1969) of the War of Liberation 36 years ago. Although I can now think of it only bit, I see it again long. In the right or wrong way, I remember, brain tends to train trains and Suzie Kendall as a German spy, to offer some sexual tension behind a surrounded truck to get military information from her. The music score was particularly memorable and emotional stirring in the air with the air and I would like to hear again. Why this movie is not available, it must have some commercial or copyright reasons. Anyone know why? I suspect something to do with the lack of quality or interests.
