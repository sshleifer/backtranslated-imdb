The movie was completely extraordinary and cool. The graphics were fantastic and it was amazing, especially, Flick was superb and awesome in the movie and he was funny and he was and sometimes he was cute. Circus bug colorful and they are fantastic in the movie. The pallet was superb and cool in the movie. Hooper was a pure and perfect villain. Even, the dot was tricky. When, birds come to eat bugs, that scene was fantastic and well. Even, the last scene was cool and calm. Even, Flick's discovery was good. The creation of an artificial bird was a good idea to fear away the pallet. When insect artificial birds were created, the scene was good and beautiful, I really appreciate the creators of "a bug life".
