Bette Midler is uncertain in this concert. She gives her all of the time on the stage. Whether we are tearing our eyes on his jokes and antics or tearing our eyes to his extraordinary ballads strains, Bate Miller has removed his audience. If you do not see it live (which is the best way to see BAT) then this is the next best thing. An interesting thing to watch is how incredible his voice has changed and has been going on for years but his power is not lost. The more "voice correct" version of "Stay with Me" version does not lose anything from the soul either from the daily or Divine Moderation, here it is more pure and heartwarming as before. I will have this concert braces for a very long time.
