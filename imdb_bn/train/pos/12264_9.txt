If you have a very close and long relationship with Tinanine with me .... please have yourself and see this beautiful documentary about the heart and his life. I'm so bright and producing a very cool. For the good and the bad, the whole background stories about the different situations affecting Harz and people and he is amazing. There is a very fine and obvious link between the comic book. I'll definitely dig the tintin album and stay in my basement. Also, the movie itself is very well called and it has a great surround sound. I really hope people do the same thing as I do!
