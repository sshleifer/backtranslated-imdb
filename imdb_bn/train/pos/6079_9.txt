Shakespeare's plays have a way of passing over time. The language prevents the time barriers. But perhaps it's the actors who really do it. <br /> <br /> After the disappointment of Romeo and Juliet (Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio's version), hesitated in another modern version of Shakespeare. Oh my surprise was Othello great! <br /> <br /> <br /> Yoga character Kennith played so well by a colleague! Even Yago was even really evil and hateful, the character played so well that the shutterpiece made for a charter, for a pleasure to hate the audience. I want to say that the fishing performance here was also good. <br /> <br /> I recommend Shakespeare scholars and lazy students (who refuse to read this book) as well.
