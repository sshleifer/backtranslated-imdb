"Broken b" starts all of us where it takes it back. Set us 150 years ago and Kirk, Spoke and McCoy 100 years ago. This installment of the "Star Trek" franchisee, in my opinion, is the first series to recover the feelings, dangers and feelings of excitement from "TOS" to "Where to Go Before the Series". Scott Bakula threw away the first captain of the Star Ship Enterprises like Captain Jonathan Achare. He and the whole cast really show a true respect for the inheritance of Star Trek. John Billingsley satirist Dr. Floss, and Jolien Blaucock are tempting as impressive but rationally well-known as the Volcanic Science Officer Tiple. Broken b is the best premiere of a trek in my opinion, and I believe Rodenberrey must be proud to know.
