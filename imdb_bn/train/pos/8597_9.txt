I've enjoyed this picture. I thought it was such a wonderful political thriller that never happened before - a secret service agent is going bad and involved in a murder plot. Unfortunately, for the character of Michael Douglas, "Pit Garrison", they think that he is a joke but he is not. <br /> <br /> She's just morally destroyed the first lady with the agent! Since he is doing this, he is unable to take an acceptable polygraph test and reveals that he suspects him number one because he has a plot to kill the president. <br /> <br /> "Garrison" but at the same time he is still trying to do the right thing to protect the President. This role of Douglas does a fine job. I always do not care for the players but he is an excellent actor. Kefar Sotherailand ("David Brunijes") equally equally (at least here) colleague SS Boss who hunt down Douglas until he is telling the truth. When he works together at the end of the discovery of both of them and then stops, if they can. Crooks are very, by the way, interesting. Also, unfortunately - I have never ever been - see a lady like Kim Bissing <br /> <br /> <br /> This is simply a sticky action flick which starts from end to entertainment. What is it holes Of course; Perhaps their number, and a reason you see so much critical comments. Anyway, it's deprived here, here unfairly. It's not enough just enough for talent here on this website. My advice: Chil, just go for the ride and enjoy all the tasks and conspiracies. Yes, it finally gets a little Rambo-ish, otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment ... which is about movies.
