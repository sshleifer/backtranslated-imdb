A very promising directorial debut for Bill Paxton. A very dark thriller / who-really-done-it is recommended by Stephen King. It is a fatal after getting orders from God to destroy the monsters in order to control mankind, but a strong man from Thurman, Texas, who is a strong, well-established horror story on a grimly violent character. A couple of intriguing twists and an eerie end makes for your worth. Most of the violence you do not really see, but enough to double your stomach. <br /> <br /> Director Pacton believes the violent man is known as the Hand of God Killer. Matthew McConnie Demset FBI Agent (Power Booth) is equally impressive as the last son of David Man's eldest son to tell this story. The booths, as always, are difficult and flawless. Suspicious white scam! Highly recommended.
