This review is for extended cut of this film. <br /> <br /> I saw Dragon Lord in the first year when I bought it in DVD several years ago. I always like this movie and you can read more of its positive reviews to get the general idea. <br /> <br /> This is called. I have always found a bit confusing story. Movies, after all, is a love story. And it seems strange to me that love story should end with a 20-minute battle scene. <br /> <br /> Well, this is no longer in extended version. The old "original" version starts with a large barrel-climb / rugby-like sequence, in which the new version is in the extended version. The opening sequence is dragons (Jackie Chan) hanging around his house and when pretending to train and study around his father. <br /> <br /> Other series have been moved or extended to extended cuts. A lot more knowledge when you watch it. Pens better and overall it works just fine. It feels more like a love story and does not ask questions about why it ends so deeply and dramatically as a regular version. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> I (Or at least that's what I thought was its purpose.) Why did they create it and rearrange some scenes?) I saw that I saw a whole new Jackie Chan film though most of the sequence was the same.
