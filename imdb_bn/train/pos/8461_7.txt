The title is in English and the IMDB lists the primary language of this show as English, along with the publication of the DVD set in Bundai, I will concentrate on the English version of Gundam Wing (2000). My actual review for the entire series is under the symbol of IMDB's "Shin Kido Senki Gundam W." (1995). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> this show Depending on which language you want to see, depending on your taste. What the Purronora wants to do to Chinese people can be with Japanese, but for the more "realistic" experience I recommend the English track because all characters except the Hero Ewe are not Japanese. (Most of the Japanese Americans mostly Caucasian.) For one, Character personality comes directly from the Japanese version directly. The contrast between letters is even stronger <br /> <br /> Wing Gundam's Pilot Hero EE is a highly trained soldier who imposes his passion but gradually learns the value of his humanity. Deadpan delivery can be criticized as "bad acting" but it is very well matched with the heroio's personality. <br /> <br /> Death is given to the gutsman Duo Maxwell, a life of joy in front of death and a crash course between friends. He probably played the role of the best actor in the whole of the film, by Scott McNeil. He can hear a very young voice for his age, but Duo's English voice easily unites his annoying Japanese. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Has been fought; Despite the inner intent of connecting with people around him, he only knows how to kill, not to be friends. Karbie Morrow gives a poisonous but realistic performance as Troy Burton. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The voice of Brad Swail is given to the winner of the Qatar Rebar, whose character lacks the caring nature and is no problem in the separation of her innocence because she experiences horror. First hand war and death. A big plus point that quatre sounds like a girl (and yes she is voiced by a female actress in the Japanese version) but is an appropriate 15-year-old guy. <br /> <br /> The Uphai Chang, which is spoken by impulsive but scheduled Ted Cole, may seem a little over, but with the more humble roles of heroes and trovas, it can play a totally opposite role. <br /> <br /> Relina Darillian heard the old word in English, Anne Bailey pronounced by Lisa. At the beginning of the series, she can not sit well with her young personality, but her character appears later in the story, followed by her voice and fits very well with the character's development. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> be one of the more widely heard voices when compared to the Japanese version. Both voices brought different sides of the same character. His Japanese voice gives a violent, authoritative and honorable command, in line with its high ranking status and charismatic nature. The English voice of Brian Drummond has become even more bent, the more secret and the "snake-like" word, the secret of Jake's secret about the secret agenda and his beliefs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> David Kaiyar's voice Kusrinada delivers a more realistic and down-to-earth performance than the fantasy of Japan's larger living style. However, unlike the Lady of the Japanese version and Luqurencia Noen, she does not discriminate in her divided person ................................. .......................... Canon sheet pilot and military leaders are nothing to talk about. <br /> <br /> If they reflect on their ethnic background, then take time to separate different characters separately for different ones. Magnac Corp's voice was generally unclear, but it may have been more attractive if the pronunciation of the Middle East was given. RomarFellar Foundation's members have also played better with some excellent European accents that reflect their ambition position. <br /> <br /> Despite great acting from side-characters, the original cast shows the show and its results are managed by Gundam Wing's scripts as a whole, less top and more realistic presentation. Faithful to the original Japanese script, all intuitive thoughts follow the inspirational ideas and themes about politics, war and human nature. Sadly, it also retains the original Japanese scripts errors.
