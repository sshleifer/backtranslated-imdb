Wow, how can I talk about this movie without the tears of my eyes? It was definitely the highlight of my year - no - my life. As the rapper graphics were not surprising enough, the winner of the prize winner used the same shot throughout the film, even when the background does not match the scene. Wow, what talent? And the film is full of Plot-Holes (for example, some of the T-Rex type animal clips where a rapper should be, and an important moment that Papa's torture chamber can be found, "A girl from Colleen!" And screams.) The brightness that I have on the Captain Raptor Planet do not forget. Thank you for another classic Sci-Fi.
