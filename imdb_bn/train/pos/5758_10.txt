In my opinion, it was one of the best action films of the 1970s. This is not just a great cast feature but can still be loaded with wild shootout and explosion which is still useful. The story is about a Vietnam vaat (Chris Christopherson) being recruited by his brother (John-Michael Vincent), to clean up the criminal element in a small town and when Chris begins to take advantage of his position, he should pay the criminals to get rid of them. Is. It's great to see Chris playing against type. Barnard Peters and Victoria Principal both give great support to both male-female women. John-Michael shows the original movie star personality in this movie. I'm not on Vigilant Force video but it can be seen on TV occasionally. It's a great flick for those guys who love movies.
