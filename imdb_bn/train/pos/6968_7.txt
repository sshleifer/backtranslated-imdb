As the prospective BHG fans expected the new BSG, so what do new BSG fans expect (in most cases) the capricia could not deliver it. This is very interesting, if not a self-contained show, or at least a pilot. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for bigger CGI throws (new) BSG, then you will be boring disappointed. If you like the play, you can probably find what you like and even recognize it. <br /> <br /> The story testifies how the silons were developed, why Adam hates them and the sources of monotheistic society. The authors manage to deal with the creation or rebuilding of humans 'playing God' and 'human'. It will be interesting to see how it is playing. <br /> <br /> I got into some parts of it and was very public among others, but it was all committed. My small part (or hope) there may be some minor ink of BSG (as well as the story behind me), but perhaps it will make the story very strong. Like the BSG, I have to wait and see if the Mapica is big on me, but it is very quick to say. <br /> <br /> If compared to this, it will be really easy to upload it for failure, the previous series, but I want to give it a chance. Overall, I thought how it showed how it was before throwing in the original series' Pravehral Twelve.
