I'm never really big in IMX movies. They are cool, but once you start that hua "wua, it feels like flying!" Movies are generally pretty and simple. Exceptions "Everest" have been strengthened, cheerful "wild California" and now the BBC's "The Human Body", a super-look inside our body. <br /> <br /> Our bodies are complex machines which are easily unimaginable. This 50 minute film can be up to 10 hours long, and I still do not read the reviews and listen to all the radio systems to listen to my radio, and most of us accept it for all. <br /> <br /> Here you can see inside a pumping heart (an alien looks like spaceship), inside your lungs, processing small hairs in your holes and developing a baby inside the baby's mother. Pregnancy, and surprisingly, a few ... um, less interesting work that I thought would be far away from it (pimples, acetic torch in the stomach ...) <br /> <br /> This picture is also a rather phunky style, Which makes it different from other IMAX documentaries. For example, we saw the sperm to be taken out of the egg, but have you ever seen the Marvin Gai's "Let's Get It On" tune? It's a creative moment that makes fun of the "human body" rather than just teaching health.
