I should qualify my position after reading another review. The film is not great, but it has a lot of cool stuff in it. The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great. The story is slow and weak, but entertaining. The acting is bad, but no worse than you find in the SyFy channel The music is quite good and the Gore is good. It has the best leather face in film and it is produced by Bruce Campbell. I saw the whole movie and it was still enjoyable when it was mostly anticipated. Women are a lot of compelling and lead actors brooding and being awesome makes a good job. This movie was noticeably clean for a modern film and suitable violence for 13-year-olds. There was no sex scene. I think it's fair out of 10 out of 7 and I think that's fair. I would see it again if I had not had anything good. The gay oscillator was the most annoying side of the angel film, the devil is quite awesome.
