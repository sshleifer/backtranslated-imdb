This is a movie I saw when it was first published, and which I saw several times in a few years. It's always enjoyable <br /> <br /> One thing is that the comedy can not take sides: it equals labor and capitalists equally. Only Sid seems beyond the classic struggle, though he is responsible for it. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy, Ask yourself: Can anyone support most of the weight in the single trap of fabric? It will be cut through almost any support. Also, when using corners in a lane, Sid could cover a garbage like a garbage shield. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br
