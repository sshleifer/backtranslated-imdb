First thing first, Edison Chen did a fantastic, credible act like a Cambodian hit-man, was born and reproduced dumped and a gladiatorial ring, where she killed her skill to run a violet battery to survive, live in a slaughter house or kill Be done In a small dialogue or at least a few lines in Cambodian / Thai, its performance was compulsory, perhaps what would have been the case with Danny the Cook, who was born for the sole purpose of fighting a guy, <br /> <br /> < br>> Like Danny Dogs, a lot of talking about the sequences of fake fake warfare is not stylistically dancer but rather general, brutal fishy Where everything goes back to the design. While extricating one another from the throat of each other's neck, it is probably a sense of reality and hold fast. It literally and metaphorically makes both a great, great and dark film, and it differs from the usual run of production of the mill police thriller. <br /> <br /> Edison plays guns from Cambodia, who became a ghost, ran from the police as in Hong Kong, his pickup has gone awful. The team led by Chung Siew-Fayyi is leading Chewing Sei-Fay team, who wants to fight with the members of the Mewaric Force Inspector T. (Sam Lee), who has to contribute to the party's inclusion and acceptance of his father. So start playing a cat and mouse between the dark shadows and shadows in Hong Kong's cearier looking direction. <br /> <br /> The story works in more than one level, especially in the research of Hit-Man character and in the opposite of police law, we see gray and white in each character, rather than the gray ones. With Hitman, we saw his caring side when he developed the desire to love the girl (PEPE) and expressed her heart, maturity, tenderness and gold. Police with suspected tactics and attitudes, do you think how to get rid of if you want to do anything to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral interrogation, how anti-heroes, disgusting strategies are adopted. You ask, how does a man create and how to make an animal, and if we have a tendency to swim depending on the circumstances - do we have that dark inner line, transforming dogs from humans, and dogs? The dog bite dog keeps you from the beginning and never lets it go to the end, although it seems to decrease the points, especially at its flexible moment, and may not even be known after the end. If I should take my favorite scene, it must be in the market food center - very well controlled and delivered, a secret edge of your seat moments. Listen to musical scores too, and if you hear the roar of the dog you are not dreaming. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you think you've seen almost everything from the pool thriller section.
