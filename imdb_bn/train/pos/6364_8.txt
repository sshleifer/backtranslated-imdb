The "Atlantis: The Last Empire" preview indicated that everything was there. It's often that you do not find that. Most of the time, the previews only show the best parts and the rest of the movie is terrible. Not so with this one. Although I was pleased with the original plot, there was no sub-plot. The animation did not break like "Shake" but it was good, not least. The plot and story lines were well presented and there were only few slow spots among them. This keeps you interested. I enjoy this one myself Receives "Atlantis" and keeps your attention. You have to think a little bit, but not too much. Once you think about it, you can determine what should happen but you do not know how it is going to happen. <br /> <br /> Welding was good too. Michael J. Fox, Milo was an excellent choice. His personality fits nicely. Zafar General Commander Rurke was well-selected with James Garner. His character reminds me of the performance of "Manverik", which I like. I like Claudia Christian as castle Helga Sinclair. A dirty personality game makes its power film more interesting. It's so bad that he's a villain. <br /> <br /> To all, of course your valued (8 out of 10).
