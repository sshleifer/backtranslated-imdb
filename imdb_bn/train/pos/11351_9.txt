Nice movie. The whole picture was illustrated in Budapest, so I'm proud. I had a small problem that the film trains belonged to the Hungarian State Railway (MVV) and it was easy to see that they used to be in big trains, not on the local railways - the chicito also picked up its prey. Local railway station. Except this, the film is superb.
