The reality of Cheech and Chong which includes drugs, songs, more drugs, cars and driving, even more drugs, P Way, aliens, gasoline, laundry, comedy stand, surprisingly more medicines and space cocks! It's not as consistent or probable as the smoke up but it's still incredibly funny, as the Nice Dreams are becoming weird. There are some classic scenes, which include the opening scene where their cars and drives get some gas to work. Cheech's songs (Mexican Americans) and Chung's follow-up songs are also interesting. Another notable scene is the Jones (human crystalline instrument) from the Police Office Academy, and the welfare office scene with an old comedian. Above all, it is quite watchable to smoke up until a great follow up and calm or not. <br /> <br /> - Cellulite rehabilitation
