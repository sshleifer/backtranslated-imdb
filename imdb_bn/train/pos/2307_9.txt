I would say this movie is really amazing and heartwarming. Reese Witherspoon is so charming and Jason London is not so bad! Danny seems very sweet to fall in love and it broke my heart and at the same time forced my heart to fall in love with the love of Maureen in the court. But it looks sweet even how much he cared for Danny. I must admit him though I want him to finish for Danny. It's just so clearer watching her fall for her that I do not want her heart to get so badly broken. But the biggest tragedy I've ever seen has happened in this movie. When I see him, I cry all day long. I just could not believe it. But there was no loving relationship with Murin and Danny. They can really do it through something. I give this movie 9 because I did not want to die the court, but it is still one of the most wonderful movies I have seen.
