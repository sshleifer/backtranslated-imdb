I liked this movie very much. Most reviews have gone bad, but most critics feel that a movie should be like an idea drama. There is a little drama in this movie, but the rest are just fun and very entertaining. Julia Roberts forgot to be a beautiful woman, Emma Roberts is a beautiful young girl and more than that. Mamma was so funny to see the role of Nancy Drew. It's good to see a new face. I believe he can go a long way. <br /> <br /> NANSI DRUA may not be based on the book, but the story is still good. There is a good combination of other character actors and actors supporting Pat Carroll, Barry Bostwick, Rachel Leigh Cook and Chris Kattan - do not credit. I'm surprised Disney has not released this movie. Some people may not like this movie because it does not have sex, violence and curse. This is a good family movie which is very rare this day. So take your family, watch this movie and judge how good it is for yourself. I can not wait for a seagull.
