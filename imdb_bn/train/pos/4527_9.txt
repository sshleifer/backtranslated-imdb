<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Keaton's comedies are _innerly, harmoniously , Knowingly order, thinking. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully deliberately, delightful and inventive, three AGES should have a comedy top ten draft if I had a sketch. A three times love story will be enchanting viewers; I want to bring this method here? Keaton's Contrary to the Destiny of Comedy Lang ?? Down ?? Or Ã€ REBOURS. Again in the era of Roma and Ketan during the twentieth century? Era era ?? Renaissance Italy and a Mohamedan country in China? Does the same instrument work in both movies ?? One, a serious, eerie melodrama; - Another, a light, virtuously ?? paced comedy. This is basically the same couple at Keaton; And probably the same with Lang. Pretty baby is beautiful by Buster and Beery. I found three AGES well written and smart, without oddly sophisticated; Plot basically too Pope ?? Such a child is a piece of furniture, the only hero is the two male rivals? Keaton and Biri. <br /> <br /> Keton movie is easily liked and probably someone would be tempted to look like this ambitious fun? It's not yet, but it's grand fun, big fun, enough fun. And Wallace Beery makes a subtle kindness.
