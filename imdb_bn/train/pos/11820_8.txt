Hey, if I tell you to compare Dark Knight with an 18-year-old comic-adapted movie, 5.9, would you call me crazy? That's just catching your attention. Every day I complain that there are no good movies, only those who know the recent blockbuster. Searching and exploring old movies is sometimes not a bad thing, especially those who have good artists value. Dick trasi can not be easily old in terms of technology. <br /> <br /> Negative reviews mainly complain about the "upgraded" story of the DT. But I think the story is quite clear, and I had no problem. I did not see comic books, yet I'm not a huge American comic fan, but I appreciate the top-rated movie and the performance. Maybe most people's expectations were too much about the story. But, what would you expect if you watch Moodona and Warren Bitti together in the movie? There was a little scratch on my head, but could not be surprised, did we really see the same movie? The title role, although it was not as capable as capable, was still able to attract him and draw the audience. Madonna was more pronounced than "sedentary" in her seductive role, but added much fun to the story. Al Pacino was funny and was lazy himself. Apparently he is brave enough to go before his earlier successful role sarcastic. We can see a hybrid of Smurfs, Michael Corleone, Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro, which makes us smile. And thanks so much to make-up. <br /> <br /> It's not bad for me. The spiritual feelings really got me.
