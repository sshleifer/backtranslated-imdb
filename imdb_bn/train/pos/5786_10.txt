Simple story ... why say so? It proves to be fake. First World War killed three or more of the human race, and we have two survivors. The message is that there was no disagreement in the first place in the two battlefields. Exhausted from each side to the delegates, we see them all to gather together: <br /> <br /> ... Seeking wealth ... food, shelter, etc. ... everywhere ... love .. < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Simple story, publishing in the limited budget of the 60's television horizon. In 2009 we see it as somewhat old and probably expected. No one saw the stuff in the early 60's ... I give it 10 ...
