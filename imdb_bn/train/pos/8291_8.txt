Jean Wing played "The Lady in Q (1999)" a good acting mysterious drama that reminds me of the old black-white-white Raymond Boone Perry Mason series. Perry and "cash" both end up guessing me. There were many suspects on the motive of murder, but I had no idea what it would be like. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gin Wilder has his special expression, even his expression and voice as a voice. Perfect for her part. The portrayal of the movie has been done very well by the actor. It ensures an extra challenge for I pull off the cast. I'm not surprised to see some textbooks for watching movies. Even his songs were singing. I liked the role of "The Young Frankenstein" and "Wiley Wankala" rather than his former "Silian" roles in this role. I hope AR will continue this series. It should say something like "A & E Jean Wild Mysories". <br /> <br /> Music is suitable for the time. I enjoy the live live combo and swing tunes. I was a bit unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or the action taken within that period. And I agree not to include immorality in script streams. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Perry Mason of Burr.
