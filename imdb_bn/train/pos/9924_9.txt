Ah, domino is actually a fresh air stream, something new in the film. I enjoyed the movie a lot because of complex movies, different characters and intense camera effects. I've seen some complaints about the camera work, in fact, according to the creators, shiny and wild shots were the fulfillment of errors through time. All you had to see was the desired effect. Perhaps some complaints have not been done because like this many ago, although it does make it different. In a deeper perspective, what you see is how Domino sees with his eyes, think about it. <br /> <br /> When the story comes, then I can not see anything bad about me. Despite this "dirty" nature, in some cases, it is actually the fastest form of the story. The plot is really hard to follow, if you really focus on what's going on. Maybe it's because of me, because I can see movies from different aspects of acting, plot and so on. I'm an "interpreter" or something that separates movies, it comes to me As such, I believe that this is an extraordinary movie, indeed a civil-classic, blockbuster, or whatever the future, despite the future. <br /> <br /> and characters, there is no doubt how different the cast is. I believe Cast is wonderful because they all work well by portraying their characters effectively, it creates a movie lady and lady. All of the letters are very unique and plus that you are set apart further, witnessing a small piece of each of their lives. Basically, I personally liked Cast and Character. <br /> <br /> Those who wake up and burn this image do not just see them, it just does not appeal to them. No matter, it's own right to own movies, no, it's a great movie time.
