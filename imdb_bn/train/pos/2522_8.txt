I must admit, firstly I had some good hope, all of them. I'm expecting a Chess movie to promote pictures of gaitets and hedays, but I'm not saying that there's more to it. Yes, acting is not very good, but it is not to suck, all cast's disciplined well and they bring enough energy to their characters. Effects are incompatibility but the action scenes are quite satisfied. <br /> <br /> The essence of the story really confused me, though it matched with fantastic elements, it also shows a strange reality. Character development, their doubts and their feelings really came to me and I think this is the key to the movie. It lets you think and it sends it well to all the collectors. <br /> <br /> It fills a prospect for a better play. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
