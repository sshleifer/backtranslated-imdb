Oh, it's so cool to see once a silent classic! Director Weidar is simply pleasing and even makes herself as long-term (at least for 1928) Camio. The story is about the success of life and how it changes you. Marion Davis plays a little girl who leaves her friends as part of a big "drama" studio in a small comedy studio. He became a great star and indeed he is isolated from the real world. At one moment he denied his (poor) past! The kymes are only sunny, of course the scene where the main character (Marion Davis) has seen ... Marian Davis in the studio and the conclusion that he does not seem special ... it could be one of the first movie-in-in. Here and the movies are great on the way back to the camera and the elements for real frequencies. One must definitely see if you ask me !!
