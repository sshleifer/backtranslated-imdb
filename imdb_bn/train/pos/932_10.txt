********* Ten stars in 10 ********* <br /> <br /> It is difficult to believe that it was made for television movies. Only the phrase "made of TV" makes me bitter. The production value made for TV movies is often significantly lower than the production standards for professional movie studios. That said, "Christmas carol" this version should be released in theaters, because it's good. This is my personal favorite of "Christmas Carroll" films because every aspect of this product is of the highest quality. Yes, there are few minor in screen glitches with two ghosts going to Scrooge, but there are no movies in existence at which there are at least some errors. <br /> <br /> A great performance as Scrooge, she is a pleasure to see. Actually, I can not think of a performance in this movie that should not be appreciated. Costuming, location shooting, and winter backdrop are mesmerizing. Musical score is loving and heart warming. Add that, difficult instruction, flawless cinematography, and reliable scripting; We have a day here that will be considered a holiday classic. It has not been long enough to really be a classic, but to mark my word, one day it will be soon. This image has become a growing Christmas tradition in my home because it carries the true meaning behind Christmas: love, selflessness and donation. In the selfish, greedy world, my family and I myself find "The Christmas Carol" in George C. Who can act.
