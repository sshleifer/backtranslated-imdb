Christopher Lloyd is the funny and really credible "Al-Head Angel". This movie is much better than the first, but it has special effects, which did not have much better plots and text besides the first one. <br /> <br /> All right - it has been written for kids, but adults are so much fun with kids. Tony Dunnja does a very realistic job in his role - but this is not a taxi reconciliation. <br /> <br /> Danny Glover is really good and even his emotions appear to be very human and some real acting talents are being shown. For a change, a nice change. <br /> <br /> Watch at least once - the value of trying to catch it.
