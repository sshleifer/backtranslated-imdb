15 years ago as a child this was experienced several times, and now I've found it again it still has a film experience like some others. Risky, it is a great display of morality and living which is recommended for young family to visit the family. While it still kept up as an adult, I was lucky to have learned it many times from many years ago. Trying to find it out today is hard enough. . . But I believe it's a good no matter what the price is. Especially anime fans will find it a great entry for the movie Masmaat. "Chiron no Suzu" with an impressive artwork and unique design represents an appropriate experience. Some of the lyrics recorded in English are not too hot, but the musical score is still mindful. But even the voice acting is much better than many releasing today. Unfortunately, in the mid-1980s, RCA Columbia has been printed out of home video, and at least no new format for my knowledge was published in the United States. Work hard for this and you'll be quite pleased! This is a tricky, intense, enjoyable and important landmark in Japanese animation.
