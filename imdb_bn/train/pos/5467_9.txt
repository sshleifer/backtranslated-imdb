According to me it will be one of the best performances of Stanwick. He was only a few actors, then and now, with a single face compared to the entire page of the dialogue, could say more. And I was lucky enough to see original and uncensored movies with extra footage extra 4 minutes. Very bad movie too small. Lily holds a young woman together for her father's work in his illegal possession. Her only link is wonderful performance by her good friend, Chico, Theresa Harris. Although Chico African-American (and a white woman, despite being the best friend with a black woman in 30 seconds, was controversial as the subject of this movie), and not Lily, they have special bonds. And it's not sex. Only two women detained, or shoved, in a situation beyond their control. After Lily's father died, she did not know what she would do, she was told that she has the power to go out and get what she wants. Yes, it is immoral, but it is the whole point of this movie. Then "stars" were to go and destroy the last few minutes. So, until the last few minutes of the film, it's a fantastic movie and viewable. The film's "lesson" is still valid even today, and I am sure it will be 100 years from now. Woman, what Lily is terrible to get what he wants, but it works. Men, take notes.
