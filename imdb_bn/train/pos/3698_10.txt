I did not know what was in this movie until I read about it in LA Weekly. I generally agree with LA Weekly reviews and decided to get a ticket for this movie. Movie star Molly Parker (from my favorite television show Deadwood) and Lucas Hass - I suspect we'll be able to see more in the near future. The film features fun, heartfelt, great acting, and beautiful photography. I do not know if the film is delivered, but I hope - it will be - or - soon. This is determined to be a real indie wax. Even my favorite band is the silver music of the Jews! The only disappointment was that Molly Parker was not in screening. Even in addition to this ... at the festival I saw that the best movie was in my hands.
