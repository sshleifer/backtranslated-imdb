I really enjoyed playing the main cast. Emma lungs are bold and attractive. The director developed performance where the characters are not one dimensional. A complex story with the change in the era. Also appreciate the impact of losing power on the Union and the impact of a large employer on a small town close to the impact. I do not agree with the comment that the older person has to be interesting. There are many relationships with older men and young women - men do not like. The depth of character can not be so shallow appeal. The film is a good look and cinematography is also good.
