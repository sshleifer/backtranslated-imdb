One of the best Ealing comedies in my mind and one of my favorite movies of all time. The development of the theme of the work (with a lot of discussion on union and rights) is probably described as a slightly recent date, since it is not discussed in any other topic, but it does not stop closing the "White Suit" class. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The revolutionary is trying to create a new fabric, which makes the textile industry unstable , Does not appear to be exciting while writing, but the film maintains an essential spark of mixed imagination. With the reality that marks it as a true Ealing comedy Fabrics repels dirt and can never wear! A whitish white suit wearing the Alec Guinness on the second half has become a center for several symbolic images and sequences, such as its uninterrupted thread of Guinness being able to measure a lower wall! The script itself is full of dry wit - "Is he okay?" "Yes." "Mercy." - and the first rate of characterization. I am always surprised by the wonderful aspects in these films. Next-era comedies will "accept the camera in actors and allow it to roll", but Ealing films always try interesting lighting and corners and innovation. This image is no exception. <br /> <br /> Of course, it is a throw that moves the elements to the height of the dazzing. Alex Ginnis gives a fantastic different performance, which shows surprises, joy and miserliness when the eyes claim the story. Stratton neglected everything except his work. Such a vague character can quickly become annoying or annoying, but Guinness makes it effortlessly, so that the real concept of urgency is created at the end of the film because Straton tries to get out of the world, who wants to bury everything that he has ever worked for. Joan Greenwood plays another one in her strong female role and is seen as an absolute pleasure, as Cecil Parker and slimy Michael Gaff are befuddled; Everyone gets a smile without even trying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
