It was a hit last year in the South West Southwest (SXSW) festival of Austin, and in it was E.R. There's a fine cast and a scene-chewing John Glover under Gloria Ruben's. Although a small budget shot in New York, the film seems to be beautiful and fantastic and takes us behind the scenes through rehearsals, and the actors move forward towards the acting episode "The Scottish Play" as a reference to the word "Macbeth". Thinking of bringing the ancient curse of the game. The acting company displays all the emotion of the game itself, passion, jealousy, anger, suspicion, and fun. When the Games started, a successful actor was replaced by a well-known "fantastic face" from the TV soap opera scene (in the main role) to attract big crowds. The green-headed giant takes it there, and the drama unfolds nicely. Fine soundtrack, and good performance around. DVD director's commentary and some deleted scenes are there as well.
