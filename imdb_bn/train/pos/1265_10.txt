Hi .. I think that's just one of the reasons for my favorite Sian Kaneri movies, it's an exciting emotional thriller, which is a great performance in casting Castor, especially Connie .. Also I'm one of the best lines seen in movies, so this dialogue is pretty good. This is one of the best scenes in the movie, when Shane interview fame in prison fame Ed Harris is very cool. I enjoyed it a lot and I can not recommend enough, really do not miss it! Do not pay attention to the negative reviews that chicken in the last 30 minutes, it was as intense as the rest of the movie, I really found it a very entertaining movie.
