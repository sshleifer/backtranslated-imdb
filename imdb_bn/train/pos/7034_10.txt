When you add all aspects to the movie --- dance, singing, acting --- the only person standing in Cast as the best, Venacea Williams ... a perfect role for her by making her sacrifice, energy and timeless beauty. Sometimes I have never seen anyone with such vibrant shoots! Vanessa's singing talent looks nicely with all the songs she performs as Rose and her performance skills do not stop to surprise me! His dance was so incredible, even some people used to say that if dancing was bad - his dance skills were shown better than before! I would recommend this version above '63 because I discovered that although very fantastic acting by Vanessa ----- Jason Alexander and the rest were not considered too impressive (except for the familiar Phillips ... when they had thrown him What were they in hell?) <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this version is excellent and I recommend everyone see this version!
