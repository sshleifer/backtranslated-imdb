In this swimming pool, there is water lily in this pond and there are frogs. Sit down the pig lilies. Frogs and water lilies have a parasitic relationship. Mary (Polyn Acquette) is a water lily, fluorine (Adele Henel), a frog, the captain of his team, who is a rich swiming group with the cross. Floraine's teammates betrays the mentality of the harmony and discipline of synrhronized swimsuit that conveys a loose personality because curt and balanced blonde curves because of their leader's leave. But fluorine has a secret; There is a bomb explosion in Bombay, which reveals "Niceness des Pivrayrace" to the audience, apparently, before he believes in Marie <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Lolita" is a wicker morgan. Marie gets double the fluorine when her imitation water breaks Lily's heart. When the frog goes through the speed of fly for the look, when someone sees it, he kisses with water lilies. In the most amazing view of the film, Water Lily agrees to give frogs to defeat her virginity through verbal breast-dealing mechanical laws. Flourines want boys to like him, but he does not like boys, but it is more important for the frogs that are popular. When the water lily finally flies frogs, the frog remains a frog The frog can not be transformed into water lily or princess, because the water lily fungus is lost. After unlocking their lips, Flourine said to Marie, "Look, it's easy," which is the way to equate kisses with frogs with tremendous frog that his friend does not give more than any rituals except a string. Floraine is a burden of beauty. He carries the weight to meet the expectations of the boys. Using Florence Marie for a final fling, her fatwa morganizes her imitation at the beginning of her feet. <br /> <br /> Another water lily, another frog, Marie's best friend Anna (Louise Blackhear) and the frustrating boy-son Francois (Warren Jacobs), like any water lily and frogs, have a parasitic relationship. Using Marie for Love in Florence, Fran√ßois uses Anne for sex. But that life; That represents an increasingly betrayal, even if a friend even introduces himself to a good friend the opportunity to make up the food chain. In McDonald's, after washing lots of la liggy frogs, the water lily disciplines other water lilies. Physical beauty is a coin. Marie gets to call the shots because Annie, far from ugly, overweight and it is a vague hairy hair. Annie tries to fight behind her breast using enough revenge (Magnifying glass from her happy meal accidentally comments on Mary's flat chest), but Tadpole (Mari thinks she is better than an anna better than the water lily) her breasts are fat The tribe is <br /> <br /> Teen girls can be cruel to each other. Later on, in the final shot, "Niceness des Pureus" proposes that there is twice as much of Mary, and if the symbolic water lilies are not in the future then there is a possibility of a parasite in the future. Teen girls can match any boy that can be cruel to each other.
