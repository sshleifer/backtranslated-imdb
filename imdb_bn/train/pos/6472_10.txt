One of the best pieces of television drama of the last decade Within five hours, many aspects of modern-day British society are discovered, such as understanding and sympathy, constantly challenging. David Morrisey, as usual, is bright. Initially, heavy elephants came into conflict with the heroine, but then proved to be intelligent and careful, because she worked with him to uncover the truth. I've never seen Surren Jones before. I believe the television soap comes from the world. His performance was excellent because he tried to handle the demands of the case and the care of his soil in maintaining his fun and restraint. I can talk and talk about every member who contributes to this great drama, but their efforts will be a little meaningless without a suppressive script that constantly challenges your assumptions about a character. It is an event that restores its belief in television dramas, simultaneously, it often makes filling in ventilation almost impossible to settle for garbage.
