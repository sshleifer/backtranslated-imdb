My name is John Morbi and my story about this magazine: In May 2003, I saw Alfred Hitchcock's monoco, I was very scared and deeply disturbed. I started a terrible search for a movie that was also scared. But none is satisfactory where there is no one. Those who tried and failed were birds, night of the living death, The Silence of the Laughs, The Blair Witch Project, Ring, The Evil Dead, Century Sense, 28 days later, Texas Chanso genocide, Halloween, Dark Dark, Alien, Peeping Tom, The Cell, Rosemary Baby, do not look now, Wechfinder General, Friday 13th and Omen. Sure that I was frustrated! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paperhouse is based on my favorite favorite book, named Marian Dreams. I have been in some of the books found in horror films in Paperhouse, but they did not tell me about the book and the link to the film. I discovered the truth on the Internet, that day I bought this picture. <br /> <br /> I thought the paperhouse books would not be revealed. It was certainly unbelievable but certainly not dull. My prayers have been named North Mariana, but most of the original stories are the same. School Anna one day draws a house in her scrap book (something extraordinary about her), she gets sick, and when she comes to sleep or sleep, she finds herself out of a strange old house (and I'm really ineligible). He also sees that every time he keeps something new in the picture, it can be seen in the dream, it is an apple tree. Anna entered into a dream within the dream, a person in the real world. Mark wants to leave a shit but leave the house, forced to draw in a lighthouse (go to a place) but still the problem remains can not be traced. So Anna decided to grab her father. She pulls out her pencil and gets a lot of work, but the result is distorted and disturbed, especially Anna dislikes her eyes. Quotation "She looks like crazy". So Anna tried to get her out again, but the pencil proved impossible (which means nothing can be omitted). Then Anna lost her temper and cut off her father's eyes! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Paperhaus is the answer to a nightmare on Elm Street, the British responds! I was surprised to see this picture. But after two years I got what I was looking for. The question is how dose is compared with psycho? The answer, 1 old dark house, 2 fear of mental parents, 3 a real shock, 4 and very scary music.
