Although I have never seen the best anime but I've enjoyed Lady Death. <br /> <br /> I never read a comic book and saw it in the video store and decided to give it a chance. <br /> <br /> The animation was okay, I got an 80's idea of ​​anonymity which has stopped it for me. Why everyone hates me hating <br /> <br /> Character development was okay. I turned around to Lady Death around as they liked. For those of you who do not like it, probably did not pay attention. Lucifer said how you happen to do it, and he uses his word. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Needed. Everything shocks people because it can be said about every favorite anime vampire Hunter D.
