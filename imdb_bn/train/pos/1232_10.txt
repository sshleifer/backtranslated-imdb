Very funny pictures. 80's classic film Funny Eddie Murphy. I had a good memory when I was a child. Murphy's classical satire does not fail, the movie is fun, well-done. '80's Murphy has created a lot of action films that present a way to joke about dangerous things for him. The results can only be appreciated by a few but since 1986 the Ii film has now changed. The atmosphere is good for a movie of that time and is good for a special effects movie. Recently an actor, invisible actor, laureate Murphy, is an excellent film to admire and enjoy. The final part is anthology, part of the Tibetan monk who plays the enjoyable actor. That's it.
