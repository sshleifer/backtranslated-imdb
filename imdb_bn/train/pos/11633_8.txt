Red Eye is not a film that can win Plume d'Or, but Wes Craven is never such a director, and a good indication of whether a filmmaker can expect his branding. <Br /> <br /> Red Eye is a 94-minute tight, inhuman package that is part of its common part and lightweight, but usually enjoyable, a hint of Crayven Craft for making rent at the box office. Indeed, without the intellectual or emotional challenges of the audience, it is a pavement entertainment, perfect film to be seen as attention-holding. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is a delicious feeling for the plot, there is a TV movie feeling of unclear terrorist mistress motivation and supporter characters, and the main section. However, there are specific components of Hitacchian suspension and the cell phone booth echoes, which are eventually more sophisticated (and induced) games with the same concept as the mental crisis imposed in the public. <br /> <br /> for a movie that mainly focuses on sitting in the seats of the airline, it dies or dies in letters and scripts. Silenn's ice but astronomy Jackson Ripner and Rachel McAdams singer Lisa are the main reasons for the film closure. Not just by creating dialogue jing, but instead of sensitizing women, 'male logic' gives Adam some way to give Rib type levels of war. <br /> <br /> At the end of the photo, Kreene himself has done very little style style with a knife-style-girl-knife. After the treatment of 'Just for Main', the most surprising release of Brian Cox is found, her bright look in various movies such as Super Troops, The Ring and Jude Law's Sexgenierian Version. <br /> <br /> Brief fun is fun.
