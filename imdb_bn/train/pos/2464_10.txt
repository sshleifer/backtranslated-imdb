One of the best movies I've ever seen - the drama is one. We do lots of church work and it can be used as an organization that plays all the good things that actors can do their job. I highly recommend this one, especially for those interested in acting, a "must be seen." There are various views in the notes. For one, when the scene of the graveyard is confronted by Hamlet Joric (everyone knows about the scene going to primary school only), and his interaction with the hip was very well done. The reasoning used in this scene was extraordinary - I guess a rule of Shakespeare than anything else. For a second, I talked about the upcoming contests played by Hamlet, Horatio and Robin Williams, where we enjoyed the scene.
