This bit of film making bit of time. Obviously, it was included in this world for the first stage, but from the beginning it was a very good movie. Peter O'Toole and Susanha get their stage performance law for the silver screen of York and do it effectively both. The story is too small and someone who is not familiar with such off-bound character studies can be a little away by it. Finally, though, a good movie that has been restrained by Peter O'Well and Susanah York.
