Does anyone know, can I see or download the "What do you like about me" Season 4 episode on the Internet? Because I will see them and die here in Germany, will not be shown on TV. Help me I'd like to see season 4 episode badly I already saw the 4 episodes and episode 18 on YouTube. But I could not find more episode 4 of the season. Is there a website where I can see the episode? Because I read some comments from the forum from Germany and there were people who had already seen Season 4 episode even though they were not shown in Germany TV. I'm happy about every information I can get Thanks Kate
