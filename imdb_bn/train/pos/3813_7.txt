Initially, I assumed that there was something serious to say about the religion of the Secret Sunshine (and here Christianity), and was surprised that it was a style of protest against the rebellion of blind beliefs, or the impressive power of the supposed Holier was surprisingly more than you, and it was not Was non-judicial, established events as events and the audience's own conclusions and conclusions Mkate it. <br /> <br /> I can not help but refrain from playing the song Kang-Hole, a man who likes widow Shin-a (Jong Do Yen) and when he does, he starts going to church. All the reasons for the church are that many people think that I find inner peace, seek help, eternal enmity between Hell's fire, repetition of faith, or something that would be like marrying a church or scared of skirt. Chase (I do not have you baby). But for everyone to return to church every Sunday and for everyone's participation in the prayer groups, what is really dangerous, because of the underlying hazardous objectives are not satisfied and when set out in frustration, or when you discover that there may be deceitful people, inside the house of God Show one face, and do another display on the outside Do not. <br /> <br /> Shin-A and his son June goes to Mirang town, which is the birth place of his dead husband. . When he wanted to start a new life, he opened a piano shop to read, even though the discovery of his new found independence and lack of proper justice for the moment, another tragedy falls on him. And that takes one hour to get it. The Secret Sansine really takes time to reach this moment, where Shin-Aa starts to start a conversation with Shin-Aa and accepts his current status and gives comfort to religion and fellow believers, can offer suggestions <br /> <br /> The beginning of the crying for sympathy began to be accepted and the belief that religion is the solution to solve the problem of all mankind. The pool supplies bullets and sometimes you think that this is what your almighty is doing for you because of your personal mysterious scene, that you start taking a slightly selfish opinion that everything is going well and in Shin, the insulting behavior towards him is forgiveness for others Asked for apologies, which may have forgotten something very basic, it can spend both sense in the way. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Start with asking with available. It is either we are continuing with the pathway, or rebel destructive work. But somehow the plug is dragged to San Sinai, so that there is no insult, and any ugly character can be a mouthpiece, it becomes silent. <br /> <br /> If you create this movie, then you will only realize in Zone Doock - the beautiful screenplay of Yeon is notable, because her role as widow Shin-A is completely spontaneous, who may face many tragedies in a short time. Probably the most unexpected person in the world. , And you look at it carefully, which is doing most of his own. Seeing his transformation, the price of the ticket price, and despite my personal favorite Korean actor Ganga Kang-hao being in the film, it is something that he has retained.
