Some people think the sniper is not good because its performance part was not good enough. Well, if you consider it to be an action movie, then this scene may be completely true because the action part of this movie is not really exciting. However, I think this is an action drama instead of a mental drama. <br /> <br /> The movie was mainly inside our two sniper, who certainly had different personalities and different experiences. Thomas Beckett, who was an experienced and 74 surety killer, seemed to have a cold heart. However, after the baket showed his Montana day's dream, we can clearly see his softness. It was a cruel war and the sacrifice of its partners, which called Bakettake a cold heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sniper. Billy Jane did a good job of making Milner hesitated and feared when he first tried to "set bullets with his own heart" (like Beckett said). That's what he thinks about a suicide mission can be done easily and he can safely return and get reward. <br /> <br /> এই দুইজন ব্যক্তি তাদের ব্যক্তিত্বের মধ্যে বেশ আলাদা ছিল এবং আমি মনে করি সিনেমাটি সফলভাবে পার্থক্য দেখিয়েছেন এবং তাদের ব্যক্তিত্বের পার্থক্যের কারণে তারা একে অপরকে প্রভাবিত করেছে। This was the snipers conflict, doubt each other, and finally through communication and what they did to help save anyarake came. <br /> <br /> Sniper is not a good action movie but a good emotional one.
