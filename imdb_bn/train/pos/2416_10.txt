Yes, this is a bit of a silly film, so if you are looking for an Oscar effectiveness, forget it ...... but, if you love John Candy's humor it must be seen. She has lost John Kandy before Candy made her a great brand, and she is good in only one movie: Plane, Train and Automobiles (with Steve Martin). Unusual support performance by Eugene Levi, probably his best work as the hot-headed leaping time. Richard Liberty, Alley Mills and Pat Hingle also performed well. If you are a John Candy or Eugene Levie fan then you must see this vague and out-print movie.
