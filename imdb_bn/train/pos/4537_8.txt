I saw this movie for the first time in the BBC on 27 July 2005. For me it was a good explanation of the Conan Dowell person and I'm really surprised that Sherlock fans wondered about it. I also believe that this is a movie they do not agree to or agree to for the fans. You can ask yourself whether AC Dole was a strong man or he questioned himself. But he was the creator of the famous Homes, but how much was it semi-biography? At least I do not strongly reject this adaptation, it's a movie you want to watch - even if you are not interested in Sherlock Holmes films or books - see it, enjoy yourself and take your opinion.
