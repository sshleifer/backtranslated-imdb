At this moment, one of the best comedies of television is to be. It accepts the sweet idea of ​​the show surrounded by a close family, and it turns out to be a completely realistic but funny illustration of a common family with mother tongues, Brat Brothers, additional protection fathers and Bimbo sisters. I almost Disney surprised it! <br /> <br /> Its credits, '8 Simple Rules', it does not know a comedy and tries to be more. Many shows (for example, 'sister, sister' and 'Leiji McGuire') seem to be because their main character is now a teenager, then they should solve their social problems and lose their humor by making a very hard hit. This is a trap '8 simple rules' avoided; It tackles some issues (such as school outcast) but it does have fun while doing it. It really became really serious when it sensibly led John Ritter and his character's tragic death. <br /> <br /> And I think, even though John Ritter has missed a lot because he was the reason that the show made his mark, '8 simple rules' can still do it better if it feels his humor and Kate's father Paul Hennessy The second version does not create.
