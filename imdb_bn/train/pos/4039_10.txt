Most of the allegations of this movie have really been heard: it's not really that. Yes, cast and crew are basically the same. Yes, Kittamura reshared several shots of battle scenes that came in the second half of the film, but there are similar matches where there is a match. Versus is basically performed all over, exhibiting Kitamura's ability to film an interesting B movie in natural locations. For the living, almost everything takes place inside. Small, cramped space. Art design here is pressed into your mouth, and it's design design! We have treated many complex and attractive places, and our letters are the maximum parts for limited areas in those places. Also, the main difference is that we do not get much more steps here until the end of the movie. Versus was all about action and cool, here is a lot more emphasis on letters and situations and messing with your mind. For this reason, more interesting movies than Alive Versace. You can not pop it in a random view to see the cold or cold jumble of five minutes or ten minutes, but you can stick to the screen for about two hours while you are communicating with some of the most interesting characters. <br /> <br /> I'm glad now that I ordered DVD despite some naysay. You should also! But from Vereus it seems to be a different animal - it is often slow, and most of the benefits are of some kind of thinking. I hope the media blasters have its headline for Right 1 DVD release!
