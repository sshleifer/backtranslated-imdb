Paul Ryder stand away from the comedy Spotlight, which is about to write a warm humorous and quiet story about the family - what we see and what we do not see, what we hope and what makes us wonder. The theme does not set a new value for the film about my focus, but it is a beautiful little story that is well-told that reminds us of a significant bond that represents the family. <br /> <br /> Sam Kleinman (Peter Fawk) occasionally pushed his wife Murray (Olympia Dukakis), her daughter (Mackenzie Konnyi and Lydia Jordan) and her son Ben (Paul Reisier) in the background. One day, Murray left a note that after the marriage year he is leaving! Along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Parkins), her daughter immediately started looking for her somewhere, confused and hurt, and left Sam with son Ben for things to be sorted on the road. The road trip becomes a time for two men, who each refers to each other and each of them as their father and son and their status as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and is now delighted and presenting WorkHoles Ben to the joy of living. This journey is about why Murrayel's position and why he has left and draws the story of reconstruction of the wise family to warmth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said, on the screen, he reminds us that he is one of our strongest mother tongue films.
