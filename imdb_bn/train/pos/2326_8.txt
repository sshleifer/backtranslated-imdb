Danny (Reid Witherspoon) was always very close to his older sister, Marianne (Emily Warfield), until they both started falling in love with their neighboring court (Jason London). But this is not a terrible tragedy after the hartal that two sisters realize that nothing can separate them and love for each other will never fade. <br /> <br /> It really is an impressive story of first love. Perhaps the most painful story about young love that I've ever seen All acting is amazing and Ridge Witherspoon gives her a great performance in the first movie. I will give people to the moon 8.5 / 10
