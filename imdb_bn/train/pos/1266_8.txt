I read some previous comments that the movie has lost steam at the end of the movie and it is also the same as the Cape Fear. I totally disagree. I'm going to give a simple review for the general moviemakers out there. I thought it was perfect to throw. I thought this is one of Ed Harris's best performances. What an evil psychopath !!! After watching his performance in this film, I have great respect for his performance. I was riveted across this movie. If you want the mystery thrillers then this definitely wants to see you in a movie. I noticed a young Scarlett Johansson in this movie. This movie is filled with top stars and I highly recommend!
