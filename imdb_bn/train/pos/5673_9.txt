I think the 'Blackdaughter Third' series is one of the best. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Humor. <br /> <br />: Never say again; Always call it Scottish; Blackdaughter: Oh, so you want me to play Scottish? Actor: Yes BlackDader: Instead of Macbeth ... <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Ruwan and I have most of my work, but I think he did a particularly good series of Blackdream. <Br> <br /> I hope Raon continues his wonderful style, but I think we can rely on him, because he's already working in a Bian 2 movie, this year will end, I can not wait. <br /> <br /> I gave this third black card 9 out of 10 ratings.
