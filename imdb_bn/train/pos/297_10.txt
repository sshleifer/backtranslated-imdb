I'm glad others enjoyed this movie, because I know it's not the greatest fame and it did not make any money in the box office. I thought it was very dangerous and because of this - Bogdanivich gave direct direct direction to touch, cast (especially Kola camp) is perfect and Big Bad Apple has never seen movies well. You've seen bad movies!
