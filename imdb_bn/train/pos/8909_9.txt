It's a pretty well-known one so I do not get it very deep. The basic story is about two teenagers who find a thin alien blob to reach the Earth through the Earth's temperature. The people with this suppressing force burn through meat like acids. It became larger and absorbed human body. Nobody believes teens (Steve McQueen and his girlfriend) and finally when the blab can not be stopped. This is really good for his age and speed is faster than over 50 Flickr. This story is very unique and it must be seen for a fan of old science-fai and giant movies. If you can dig 80's Awful 80's Gooey Gore, then do not forget to check the remix from '88 also.
