Othello, love of classic Shakespeare love, betrayal, lies, and tragedy. I remember to study this story at high school, in fact, I thought Othello as the story of my favorite Shakespeare because of the fact that I am really impressed, Shakespeare actually gained a full sense of friendship, love and racism. I mean, when you really study this story, why can you go into so many philosophies as Othello became envy by the eyes of Othello. But after my report I also saw this version of Othello and I had to say it was absolutely brilliant. Lawrencees and Kenneth just took the story very well and understood its darkness. <br /> <br /> Othello is a great soldier in his city, he likes everyone, including the king. But when King finds out that Othello has taken his daughter Desadmona, the king was angry, but denied it. Welcome to the city of Othello and his best friend, Casio, instead of Yago, who was standing next to Othello. Due to his crazy jealousy, he was out for revenge. Pretending to be Othello's best friend, he simply does not gently indicate that Deedemedona is cheating with casino, they never say that Othello thinks this is happening. Othello is insane driven and not happy to help Dedamona or Casio and Ego. <br /> <br /> Othello is an incredible story, I recommend you read it. This is an incredible story that you think after reading it. The Othello movie is also great and I recommend it, it holds the story completely, and it is a big tearjeker's feeling, or you can just get frustrated about what can happen between Othello and Desdemona, his true love is how fast he believes Betray. It was an awesome movie, great acting, good set and good aspects, while writing this story, Shakespeare meant. <br /> <br /> 10/10
