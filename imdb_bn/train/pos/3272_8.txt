Coming from the same director as "Candy" and "Immortal Boyfriend", I'm not surprised that this is a good film. Ironically, "Poppyhouse" is a movie I've never heard of yet, but it could be one of the best movies in the late 80's - partly because it has come down to the worst movie season for recent decades. (Not talking about Iranian or Swedish "movies" here ...) The performance is not only bright, but also not difficult - here are some people claiming it (they must have seen this "amazing acting", much like Anna's dream). The story is an interesting fantasy that does not end in a clever way, which all loosely combine slowly. These inappropriate questions have probably been abandoned intentionally, it has been left to the individual's personal explanation, and there is no mistake in this with any theme. With the use of "Pepperhaus" sound and music, a slightly unusual mix of kids' film and horror. I like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-clich√©, but a regular, normal child; a super-shy-but-secret-bright social-expelled girl; Very refreshing I have become sick and tired of the authors, presenting their own childhood memes, in their books and on the face of the screen, such as if someone is curious about seeing or reading about single childhood childhood, as well as the background of the character, the better the possibility Holds a monopoly. Anna and boy "Snooging" (for a great deal), the scene was a little bit more - both obscure hate and joy expressed feelings of feeling - it seemed that she was only 11 years old, but it was predicted that 13 years or 14th in the chest was imprinted Is. I do not know why the character does not get upgraded or a small actress. It is quite obvious that Burke is not young. Why do the directors throw older kids than they always play, so do not know reality, dilute, I do not know.
