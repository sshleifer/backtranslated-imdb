This is the best dubbing for Danny listening and also the best adaptation to the greatest abuse of all times in soundtracks, themes, letters, conversations in the Kiki Delivery service. Urrghhhh <br /> <br /> This one has deviations from different atmosphere, especially the common heroine. This is both a hero and a heroine (although I do not really support the use of heroes and heroes, because Miyazaki has come out of stereotype and general theme). Naturally, after the introduction of Spirited, Manoo was surprised, disturbed by the firefler's grave, and deeply touched by Majo Takkiuubin, it started with some suspicions in my part. This will be the first gasoline's bud wonder. Well, just like yesterday and the Heart of Whipper, I gave 10 ratings. I want to rate 9.8, but there are additional 0.2 people who are encouraged to share the good feelings with the film. <br /> <br /> The way I see it as a tragedy, people die it, lonely robots, abandoned places, and it ends with destruction. It does not really live with mankind's very power. The collapsed scene gives me the end of the metropolis. It's sad in any way. Most of the plot is as clear as the review and soundtrack rules (as always). Joe Haseyhii really belongs to Umatsu, Kano, Williams Caliber. People can bring such a movie, a game, an event in life, and even a wonderful work can be a lasting moment. <br /> <br /> This is a good feeling. Films that were used in the classic days as part of the American film (it's an amazing life etc). Well, things are changing ...
