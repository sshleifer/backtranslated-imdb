This movie can only be banned in my foreign country. The Japanese people (?) Who acted in this star must have become frustrated for the job, or we are just friends. Here's the scoop: <br /> <br /> Three ghogs torture a helpless woman to hell, eventually using all kinds of things to kill him, they burn him, kicked him, wanders around the chair (200 times) !), They use word abuse (forced to hear static words for more than 20 hours! It does not look bad, but it can turn you into nuts). When he jumped, they breathed (probably from an animal) in them, and he woke up when he woke up. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you have not heard of these pictures and seen a person without having a symmetrical snack film, you would think it! (Just ask Charlie Shane) It annoys people to make some sick! Like I said underground underground. Check it out if you are underground awful, or a fan of foreign gore. If you do not see me, you have to recommend before the series! But it is 10 things from the story of Gore, Shock and creativity, and all of the things that are 1. An undergraduate classic ... <br /> <br /> My final rating is an 8/10 <br /> < br />
