I am not a parent, nor am I a man. But I was able to recognize the heart rate and anguish of each character. <br /> <br /> This will be a teenage teenager. Perhaps they will again start praising the value of the family. I do not understand the value of love, family and friendship, sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Patrick Duffy was very interesting to play a different role than Bobby Iving. And 19-year-old Ben Affleck is great to see an ongoing and sincere performance giving his best. He showed at a young age, he was able to play an impressive drama. She should have given more serious roles. Remember that Hollywood ... had her first serious role in years and she went on to win Best Actress at the 2006 Venice Festival. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is appreciated by people of all ages. Children may not be seen under the age of 10 because they fear that their family may do the same, but I recommend it to the whole family. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie in DVD and saw it many times with friends. Because it portrays important issues of life.
