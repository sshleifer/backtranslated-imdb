It is a tongue in the cheek film that starts from the beginning of the voice-over which makes everything funier in French and then creates a na√Øf of Phanfan La Tulip but a very courageous hero. Illustrated by the gorgeous Gerard Philippe, the great young man luckily believes in Lolibrigida prediction - especially he will marry King Louis XVI's daughter! The problem is, La Lolo soon goes out of love with the fanfan ... <br /> <br /> The movie is running fast and according to the order of good fight, Cavalcade, and other excited action, the moment with many comics. The direction is probably the weakest aspect but the film is so light and makes myself so insignificant that I can not give the second thought to those flaws. For a traditional heavy tube racquet of French films, try to steal La Lolo, make yourself annoying and feed the script to the fortunate writer of Leono Lloyo! And a gem of Marcel Herrand is a messy and passionate King Louis XV! It's not all: In one movie, many beautiful women want me to be in France and that was in 1952! The film may come out that year, but its embryo, cheeks, superb narrations, uninterrupted photography and memorable Gerard Phillip confirm that it is modern and a joy to see. I do not hesitate to recommend to my parents, especially like movies and especially love Sash Blocks! See it!
