A 14-year-old girl develops the first serious crash to a 17-year-old boy trying to overcome the feeling of inadequacy compared to her first sister. This is the symbol of Rabindra Mulligan's simple, poetic upcoming age film. Moulgan is famous for the summer 'summer' instruction, and in 1962 to kill a McGrabber, two genes for the arrival of age style. Here he directs newcomers to the main role: Reese Witherspoon, as a 14 year old girl on her debut; Emily Warfield, as a big sister! Jason London, 17-year-old son as a court. Ridge Witherspoon is astonishingly impressive of her film debut, the 14-year-old girl expresses feelings of youthful love and pain, expressing every emotion that she does not make a false statement. Both Warfield and London are equally good as well. The film depicts every teen's thoughts or feelings about love with heartwarming sensitivity, and sometimes sometimes it can not increase the modaline. Music from an autobiographical screenplay from Jenny Wingfield; It is one of only a few young films of young love that is not psychologically bad or sensational, but honest and consistent Music is apparently easy, accentuating tone and mood from scene to scene, but not becoming intermediate. The beautiful cinematography was the famous horror director Freddie Francis, who shot at this 70 years of age. Tess Harper and Sam Waterstein, for the purpose of the death of 1957, accurately plays the children's parents, care, hard, and emotionally easy. GaÃ«l Strickland is the mother's mother as well. An impressive wall pack that has feelings of coping in this sweet-nature film, lessons to learn, and has true feelings of face. To date, it's Robert Mulin's last film. This is one of the best films of 1991. **** 4 stars.
