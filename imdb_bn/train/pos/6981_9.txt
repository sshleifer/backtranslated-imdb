To all the enemies there: After reading the first few pages condemning a TV series with one episode, the whole book will be judged. It was said, I was a huge fan of BSG, I thought it was the best TV drama in the air (not only scientist). But it was time to finish and the story goes on. I like the BSG theorem "plan", but it raised many new questions as answers, so I anticipated "Caprica" ​​anxiety and I was not disappointed. I was hoping it would not be another BSG, and I was happy that "CAPCICA" was a bit different, and I personally found this story exciting, different from spaceships, explosions, and science-specific effects. The way (do not make me wrong, I like stuff too). Eric Stodge and SEO Morales gave strong performance, and Allendandra was just wonderful. I can not wait until next week.
