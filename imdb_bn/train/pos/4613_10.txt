The most impressive plot I saw in this movie. For me, it makes it so extraordinary! Very well in what Fred Guin and Al Lewis achieved in the original Munster series Had a low slapstick, they still work together wonderfully "comedically." I like Yovonne De Carlo as Lioli, more plots involved. He showed that he could do comedy in the original series, but it was mostly spoiled in this movie. He also acted in great Sid Sezer in this film, but sadly he did not have any interaction with Gwyn and Luis. I think some good work could come out that.
