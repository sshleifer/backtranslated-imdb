A Pentagon science team seems to have perfected a ceramic that disappears but if the lead bofin tries on its own, it can not reverse the process. Frustrated and drunk in power, he turns psychologist into classic HG Wales tradition. <br /> <br /> This is a wildly invisible story invisible, distributed as a genius by the ever-favored Vereovan and Bacon, loonytoon-mad. In most of Verneau's work, it has found a great idea of ​​the age-old comic book adventure (secret underground lab where scientists work only). It combines the most horrific and abusive visuals (in their underwear women, by assault and infected by an invisible fiend, death beats animals, literally gallery blood and kill whack in the last two reels). Although the story does not ring any new twists in an old concept, Scott E. Anderson's special effects are seen by CJ, such as we literally see the vein and arteries, cardiovascular system, muscles, tissues, bone and meat. Nowhere. Specifically, in a sequence where the group returns to Gorilla from the invisible position and the scene where the Deven sinks in the swimming pool, the scene is very exciting in detail and in the artistic discovery of the effects. There is a great soundtrack in the film by Jerry Goldsmith of Jost Vacanza and classic horror-movie photography. Young casts have been much more influenced by the technological descendants of the film, but both Shieu and Dickens are influential outside their depth. This is a great fun nasty movie.
