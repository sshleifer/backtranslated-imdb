One of the best parts of Sundance is watching movies which you will often miss. If you are not a real art house fan, you probably will not get many documents. Get a recognizable allocation only to a boxer. Thankfully, in recent years, she has increased her commitment to the documentary documentaries. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare Behind Bars is a powerful documentary from a dramatic production group at the Luther Lacet Correctional Complex in Katraki Lagrange. Each year a group of detainees present a Shakespeare game. Director Hans Rogerson and his crew follow the trumpet because the roles are customized, interpreted, rehearsed and performed at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie has filled up interesting stories for us, the prison was not open in the environment. Despite the labels we know them (criminals, murderers, murderers, etc.). We soon started to think and respect this feeling of humanity. In surrender, the drama selected for filming was a thumping focus on tempest, forgiveness and release. Actors are involved in the relevance of their life play, finding similarities and parallel with their characters and plays. <br /> <br /> For a documentary film like a book, which is expected that we can experience something that changes our lives. Bar behind Shakespeare Bar was a personal revelation for me. "O brave new earth, there are creatures in it."
