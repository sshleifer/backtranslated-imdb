John Carpenter Halloween <br /> <br /> Is this the greatest horror film of all time? No .. Probably not everyone, but it will be mine and always. The film's sheer talent and will always keep a very special place in my heart. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that I did not see this movie till 20 years of liberation war, but after the twentieth century many slashes copies went after the cats and the film still had the same effect. Then must be done. My father went to see the Halloween H20 that I would whip Halloween out and get Halloween 1 and 2 of the whole story and after watching Halloween, it was clear that it defines Slasher Genre. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is simple, in 1963, Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with his big knife knife. Dr. For fifteen years of his behavior with Sam Lumis, he escaped and returned to his hometown of Haddfield, where he called three young girls: Lori Stroud is a silly bookshop, Annie Barket is a tough talk and Linda Van der Clock is a beautiful and sexually strong Young girl Dr. Loomis tracked Michael where he started the city Sheriff leg bracket, who is skeptical of his story about psychologist killer. Michael looked silently and started killing one after another, until the innocent innocent Lori Michael is the main target of the list. Still, the film's cast was brilliant and all actors and actresses played the highest credit, Lamy Stroud and Donald Plasance's Lumis starred in the minor role Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first film. Nick Kassall portrayed Michael Michael as a lazy and evil killer, and his walk and body movement was perfect. <br /> <br /> The great highlights of this movie is that John Carpenter himself created one of the most familiar detection horror themes today. The blue light was vague and effective, and one of the best moments in this film is when young Lori trembles against the wall when she sees her dead friends, and the shadows behind her Michael's face are full of hartal. Michael's mask was one thing that cooled my spinal cord, and the white embarrassed face worked perfectly. <br /> <br /> This picture makes it so big that it is not a poor movie like Friday. The 13th film actually has little blood in this film, and instead it works on suspense and excitement. <br /> <br /> It has become so clear that Halloween made movies like Friday 13th and Jason Bhurish's character, which he only torn from Michael Mayers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I recommend you see this image at least once in your life because it is not a landmark for filmmaking and the greatest of all the greatest horror movies of all time. There is no doubt.
