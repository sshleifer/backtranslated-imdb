The JDP represents the Hippie movement that relates to the dream of Youth. At the beginning of the film, the college's debate describes the cultural situation that led to this movement. Daria's imagination, the explosion represents the collapse of all social structures, and in the same way, due to the development of the massive transformation of society, the death of Mark eventually ensures that it sees itself for a movement. If we go back in time to life then the film will understand more easily. During the '60s and 70s' period, there was a driving force for deep searching for young people to change. One of the more significant changes was the introduction of sex from the collage, and I think the scenes do not represent an orgy in the desert, but sexual relations between men and women will run in full-fledged hippotonic situations, where there will be someone to hide. I saw the scene where the couples threw each other sand and were grateful in the great way that it depicts the inability to conceal this basic human nature. Torture was the way to control the social explosion at that time and that method is to enforce the police to stop the students. This society suffers from hypocrisy, and it becomes clear when students gain access to weapons from all the counterfeit control. The college professor, who has been stuck in the works of somebody, dialogue between police officers shows this youth feeling and part as a part of the completely selfless society. Presenting the flight as a more accurate symbol of freedom, Mark represents the inner will for flat stolen but his (returning or returning or going back) (Segun) shows the problem of getting rid of these bonds and I said, winning this game is the dream of seeing this dream Dreams die. I remember a movie in my eyes.
