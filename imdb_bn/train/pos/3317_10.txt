Bate Milleare again the Divine! Funny ridiculous In love with Burlesque. Ability to bring new songs with old dresses or tears with old songs with more power and punch than just before. Everyone sings new songs, singing electricity songs like old / perennials like "Rose"; "Stay with me" and yes, even "air below my wings". The best way to appreciate Divine Miss M is always to be released - because it is the next best thing, I am fully proponent of adulthood and a mixture of gratitude, and advised to mix the child's evil desire to push all the borders!
