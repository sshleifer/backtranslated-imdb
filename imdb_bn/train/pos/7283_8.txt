I love buying cheap, lousy DVDs from alpha videos. One day, I happened to buy this one. It's 50's perfect silly science fiction movies, all sex up. Apart from the absurdity of everything, it is a lot of complementary to the girls and madderama, it is an enjoyable film, who appreciates such things. And if you can suspend enough 'your disbelief', you can really get frustrated - not just by the psychological head or by stabbing the thing in the bathroom, but in the end, 'the character of the perfect body'. It is so . . . What is another word for ****?
