I saw this wonderful production, and I was surprised that anyone about the actress could say anything about the actress, I'm not sure of the character's name. I went to the BIW with him and the lost touch with him - his first name was Kim Luke - and I wonder if he has any information. He is not listed in the credit. This production is outstanding, all the tear-jarkers in all accounts, all of the superb acting. I guess that I do not want to keep it in the general category of ordinary actors, as it 'experiences amazing phenomena which leads to the opening of heaven for this final act'. That Please tell me if anyone has worked with Kim or has a website or something !!! He was fantastic in his role, thanks .... Thanks, Melissa Thorny
