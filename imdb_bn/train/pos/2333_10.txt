I've recently started watching this show, and I have to say that it made me laugh. You have to appreciate the unrealistic direction, along with everything else. Among the others, it has been said that in this show, there should be more realistic response to the dead among other things. If you accept that Ned's may bring the dead back to life, you must take all other crazy bits of the show. I can not help laughing after every episode I saw. I really think it is great to have a show that can take a great weird thing and really great to see it. I love the description completely, I think it adds an extra bit of surprise to the whole show. You can not always compare with older writers with an audience of their novices, you have to take everything as your own thing. Definitely give it a chance, and they only enjoy the ridiculous part.
