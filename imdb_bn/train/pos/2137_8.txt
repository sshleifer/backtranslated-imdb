It is much more than the fascinating story of a middle-aged person in the discovery of Bollywood dance pleasure (though it also has). It once again pushed the person's story of learning to love life, work pressure, and the past past the past to discover the past. An interesting insight into the gradual change of modern Japan in everything from bonus Bollywood dancing to physical contact in this picture. The scenes will laugh at you laughing ... there are some places you want to go up and tango ... and many where you feel good. <br /> <br /> This is a great role in creating a contemporary Japanese film that can be under the impression that all Japanese movies "heavy" and accessible <br /> <br />
