This movie is good for tv. I like it because I'm a huge fan of disaster movies but it's a family movie. The exactness of the picture from the book is about half. They got the letters correctly but the book did not have a storm chasser, because the car's view of the hatch family was away from the tower rather than the book. Dan Hutch and his friend walk around with the police officer on the way to the police station for safety. And giving books and both of his friends are 12 years old. Thats all I can think of Overall it was a good movie though it could be more accurate than the book. Did you know the book based on a true story of the tornado series in the small town of Nebraska in 1980?
