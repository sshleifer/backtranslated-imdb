This is a new and interesting Star Trek series launch. This is a "down to earth" - dark and low "plug-ins" synergraphy feeling. <br /> <br /> Character development requires more time but they have the potential. Fairly frustrating (really, with all the Star Trek series) is one of the topics that they show an equally picture of equality among men and women in the future, when they paint very positive pictures on everything else. (World War, famine, etc.) stop here <br /> <br /> Here are two female characters, Submandar Tipol who is the Valkan and Communications Officer Hashi who is the man Hoshi is quite a wimpy and T'Pol is a "vulcan babe". <br /> <br /> Some crew attitudes seem to be some American (as opposed to the TNG crew's more international sentiment) but also creates interesting mobility. <br /> <br /> For a very good series though a very good pilot.
