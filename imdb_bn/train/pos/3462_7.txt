This was the first television episode of the Colombo series (though it was featured later on "Death Lendes and Hand") and it is one of the most successful TV series in history. <br /> <br /> Jack Cassidy is a murderer in Syria three times, encouraging half-measuring memories, like Franklin, and self-confidence, half of a mysterious writing team who picks up a broad plot to beat his fellow Jim Ferrese Martin Milner. Those who have opened Franklin as a good preacher rather than professional writers, decided to destroy their professional relationship. <br /> <br /> The primary murder case is fantastic and the performance of Cassidy is a rewarding achievement which he was best remembered in Colombo Syria. <br /> <br /> Peter Faw has surprisingly split the role of Colombo and the distinctive characteristic and curiosity of the character, which seems to be smooth and missing psychologically stroked, especially the opposite of the cassidie, the most complete of the opposite character: one of their first scenes where Detection of kill-man hit-man by the unidentified expo-view of Franklin Jim Ferre The aim is to invent a purpose for killing. Franklin indicates this possible motive and Colombo (deliberately or unknowingly), to force Franklin to express his frustration in the manner of patronizing and compare comparisons with intelligence between books, Mrs. Melville. <br /> <24 Also, the 24-year-old Steven Spielberg's initial guidance contribution is significant. However, some initial additions to actors and actress films cameras, he adds some stylish and wide touches to maintain the general professionalism of hiking. After answering the phone to Fiori's disturbed wife, Franklin raised a glass in the background, just as it is almost dark in the return, the body of Jim Feris is a special picture. I'm not sure that working on a regular 10-14 day schedule, Spieberg's attempts should not be considered low. Unfortunately, the second murder case has been issued by a blackmailing scheme, which takes a steam from Franklin's friend (and its climate group called "Pallab" by Columbus) from the whole thing. The cutting edge of the plot has been compromised and the screen-time between Folk and Cassidia helps in capturing at least the script-writer (Stephen Buto) at the moment, because he can not develop the story alone except for single killings. <br /> <br /> Climax is the most frustrating aspect of this episode. The exchange of primary benters and words between Falk and Cassidia is firmly and effectively implemented, but it only reveals that it has happened in this theorem. The main constriction is with the form of seal (if it can be called a formula): Cassidy's character is so far removed from memory and ego by a form that does not really give little to convey its crime; And once it is mentioned, she capitulates a rather obsolete and uncharacteristic fashion. <br /> <br /> All, a bold opening of the series, which foretells that inevitably advertising and about Columbo, and contrast, such issues related to consciousness, ie maintain high standards and in particular, create a credible and appropriate intelligent ending .
