Often misunderstood Jaberski Point Antonioi's political film, American film of Antonio. Artistic, it follows suit after "blow-up", meaning that speed is faster than previous epic, though it is certainly less unreasonable. <br /> <br /> Originally a typical mistake portrays the generation of Hippies. Not so <br /> <br /> <br /> Two plays come from different environments. Mark from "rebel" youth, Daria from Estate Agency Corporation. But in true Antonio fashion, they both are separated, both try to escape around them. A meeting of Marx rebellious students and Black Panthers has been frustrated with the emptiness of the words, when Daria is walking uncomfortably on the road to her car. <br /> <br /> After confusing the rebel youth, the director of the film, and shallow, then came to the city. Corporations, billboard advertising, an environment involving nonsense, which must be spread in the same expansion of population, gain profit at the same time. This is an environment that escapes from two titles, although it seems to be mostly coincidental. <br /> <br /> In fact, when Daria stops in a small village on the outskirts of the desert, the environment is just as awful, and people's lost cases, the best example by the old boxing champions, now drop themselves in the shade, drinks, smokes and fools Made by sitting A stunning annoying sequence, with the addition of half-wild children living in the neighborhood, has even made it stronger, some have been brought "beneficial" but "destroyed an actual part of American history". In a vague symbolism, there is Antonio's opinion on Hippies. Only half a positive glimpse into human canvas canvas <br /> <br /> And then in the desert, using the landscape with devastating effects, pure and dreadful, vivid, wild and dead. The "joining" section by the "Flow" imagination reflects the same sequence in the "Red desert", where Guiliana tells a story to his son. This is a colorful insulation of a colorless landscape. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A catharsis, an exorcism <br /> <br /> Antionioni has two "international" films (British "Blow Up" and American "Zabriskie Point") less effort than previous masterpieces, but due to the fact that fast speed and inevitable settings (London Swinging, Flower Power America). But when it comes down, it is clear that he does not lose the edge.
