I saw this movie on the cable, it was really interesting, the prototype police chief statotype big boys, J Leno and Mr. From this good comedy about the parts of prototype cars from Magnificent Cart Kid Star. I compare this movie with "Russian Heroes" where a local police has to take part with an Asian police officer to solve a case. The heart of the farmers of the city of Detroit came back to the center of the city. Usable soundtracks, good scripts, I give it 10/10.
