Embarrassed, I saw this movie for the first time after 13 years of release. This is a story that can be related to a father or a brother ... a brother is a little 'wild,' another brother is usually a big kid. Craig Schaffer is very less infinite like the older brother, but Pitt is amazing, and Schert is perfectly cast as a father. Fishing scenes painted in Montana are absolutely breathtaking ... I did not know that fishing fish could be so attractive. The film follows closely with some amendments to make it more suitable for movie formats. In contrast to most books in film stories, this is a step. This is a perfect movie for someone who wants a quiet night with a strong and somewhat psychic movie.
