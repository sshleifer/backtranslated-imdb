Hmmm, yes this episode is very intrinsic. <br /> <br /> Although there are some bad texts and some parts have been played. I better win the worst bad. <br /> <br /> I love Oreal and Big Twist at the end. Michelle faces Tony when I absolutely love that scene. This is actually one of my favorite scenes of the 1st episode. <br /> <br /> For some reasons, people always hated the rehabilitation episodes, but I always liked them. They are not the best in terms of writing. But the theme is really interested in me, <br /> <br /> I'm going to give it a three star, but writing is a bit consistent if I want to give it four.
