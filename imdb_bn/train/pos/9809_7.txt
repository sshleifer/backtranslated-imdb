Randolph Scott is leading in Albuquerque to take a job with his uncle. However, there are stages in the way, on the way - although they do not carry a strong box. However, a wonderful woman on the board has kept 10,000 dollars secret for her and her brother's business ... and the robbers tell about it. <br /> <br /> Once Scott got his job in the city. However, he soon learned that these uncles have a quarrel - usually bad guy from Western. You know, the rich man just wants to become rich by fraud and theft and threats until he owns everything. And, it was just behind this shocking robbery. Scott claims that uncle gives money back and then Scott works with a nice woman and his brother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Once again, different types of tricks uncle tried to oppose it. One joke is to bring a nice lady friendly to Scott and his associates. She is a crack shot and it seems bad for Scott - she figures in figures as she comes to the city. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In his films, he is often the last person to suggest violence, but in this film he has advised the fast (screw the law, let's hang out) and later he can threaten the mama quickly. It's a surprise to see him as a hot head - though in most ways he hopes the same old Scott. <br /> <br /> As far as the film goes, there is nothing unusual in that. It's about Gabbi Hess played the role of a simple character, Scott is not a hero, Badie, and finally gets destroyed and Scott gets the girl. Despite this very common plot, it is all managed very well and as a result your time is good. <br /> <br /> However, there are two strange scenes in the film. First of all, boxing is going on in boxing, Scott and uncle's # 1 Henman, Lawn Chaney, Jr. That's what Chani smokes, as she did - which I had never seen before and I was admired how she could perform, she got her butt kick away. Second, get an understanding of the cart scene that runs with the whip - now that was an impossible feat!
