DV Cl√©ment and Ian La Frenes are so concerned about their TV work, as long as there are hard hit rates. However, their film work has been further verified (The Bank Job of 2008 was fine, for example, last year, completely weak around the world). <br /> <br /> Still thankfully, Crazy is a strong success. It's a great story, a wonderful performance, a lot of humor, fantastic music and everything else, the true heart. <br /> <br /> I enjoy the "moment", and there is one in this movie - all right when everything is going on in the form of animals during the Festival Renewal Festival ... <br /> <br /> Very enjoyable.
