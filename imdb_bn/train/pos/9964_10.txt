Just get it. The DVD is cheap and easy to come, the length is standard now and you've gone long enough without it. (When home video starts, parts were in the missing three versions ..) The truth about what you read is true. There is no defender, and no living without it. Look at the color red and wonderful, and production quality is quite good for a kinky epic on Saturday afternoon. But no question .. The whole Santa V. Satan has soaked the angle so much that it strikes the movie and when the home video actually moves, once it becomes a worship. How good / bad / weird / it? I just saw a small trailer and thought it was IT for almost 30 years. Moore raises the above voice. I told my older sister, and she did not believe me and told me that it could be Santa Vs. Saturn. A movie where Santa adds the thing like, like the role Mary blesses, Before closing on Christmas Eve, kids want to catch him and want to slay him ... and an international Kenny sweat shop ... and it's probably 60 In this, the kids are very close to nightmares. Here, like the others, I now see every holiday season. (My preferred version is mystery science theater version 3000). But if you like any old method, the film is an intelligent masterpiece and a total of course (along with Brianak ..). It fails to make me laugh. Well, I think, then Santa matches the class martins. Its parts can still make you crunching or just pulling you out. (How many parents do you go out for Christmas Eve cocktail? "If you get annoyed then go down and play the piano." Dancy ..) Fraca, annoying, annoying, funny, baby, weird ... What else do I want?
