A great example of how a film can be scary, without a movie showing a great movie and really a viewer. It is a set of four stories that roam around a charming old house and their various horrible and terrible fights tenants, the Scotland Yar Inspector is almost all bound together to find a missing horror movie star. It begins with the story of a mystery writer, whose main character has become very realistic, then two old romantic rival stories are covered with a wax figure in the museum, then a story of a sweet angel little child, and the absence of a story star Close with ?? And what he did inspector This is a fantastic print that lets you do the work of Director Duffel and what he really is capable of doing with a very small budget. Add Peter Cushing's acting talent, Christopher Lee, Danmahl Eliot, Josh Ackland, Ingrid Pitt and John Perty and you have a movie that can be enjoyed repeatedly. If someone of Stoker Real Estate offers a door in the English countryside's beautiful home, do not answer the phone ??
