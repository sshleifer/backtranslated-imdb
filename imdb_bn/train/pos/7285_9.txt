When I was in my childhood, I was afraid of my hand. It's a "citizen cain" but it's a moment. Hand pore scenes are good. The characters are not good, but the plot is good - acting can do anything. Put some top names in the role and then see what you get. It was a shoot, edited (what was a little bit) and a few months kind of distributed movies. It's a classic low-budget science-fai and it deserves just because of the reason. I rate it from other movies based on this genre and age 9.
