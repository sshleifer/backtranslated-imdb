I chose to film this film nationally in the opening day, as a personal way of reflecting on what happened in my previous year; Collection serves as purpose: It acts as an intellectual hommage, provokes a cyclone, thoughts and emotions, stooping cheap feelings or knee-jerk reactionism ever. <br /> <br /> There are many accusations that the film is anti-American: I can not speak for everyone on this issue, I am an American who found such statement totally untrue. The people of the Egyptian region make a lot of noise because of the fact that Palestine declares from the point of suicide bombing that civilians in democracy are "fair targets" because they choose a government that is trying to bomb, but it ignores much more. Pieces: There are different views, no one is convinced, and critics - even if they seem to be seen in pieces - the warmth and warm conversation that occurs between the director and the ghost of American dialogue, and the sadness of the director's acute sadness . <br /> <br /> Most of the pictures are beautiful, thoughtful and inspirational, especially the great work of Mahmalbuf, Tawiqi, Loch and Innerruta. Nayar, just like normal, effectively tells the true story of an injustice to Muslim families because of anti-Islamic violence - which has spread even now - and still have deleted them. I think of the media heterosexual critics in the face of terrorism a bit weirdly strong and straightforward, and the pieces of the pen were very printed and partially for my taste, although I wanted to like it. Borgnine is very good and brave it. Spirring Warning: The fall of the towers as a happy moment for a reviewer below is incorrect; Instead of reading, the towers are falling, because light floods in his house, the keys to the loss of his life, which he refuses to accept. Again, it is an imprinted piece of print, because we know that the towers were really blocked by the light of this person, but there was nothing except flood, smoke and smoke from its windows.
