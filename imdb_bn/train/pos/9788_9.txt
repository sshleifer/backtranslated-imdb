I was a writer on the same screen and I saw the movie. I am the author - Su Smith - very clearly thinking about what the film was briefly. However, the movie did not really need explanation. I was fairly clear on the theme, and inspirational. A movie that can dare to be brave, can scare - especially fear is filled with parental statistics - and it touches and embraces the possibility of living thus, it is a movie famous and intelligent. I've enjoyed much hyped 'Somersault' much more than that. I think Mandy62 Hugo Weaving was a bit stupid. As a block of its vintage, I should look so good! I agree that many Australian movies have recently become in need, but the 'pitch' products are supplied. I'm happy I saw it.
