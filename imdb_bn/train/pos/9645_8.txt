'Prysak Raiyan' is a story of two young boys falling in love by the summer beach. I do not want to say this plot because it is not the most important about this movie (but you can be sure it is interesting and original). The best part of this movie is cinematography. The visual side of 'Presque Rien' is worth the most notes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Even more interesting. I recommend this movie to all the people, for which the artistic aspects of films are very important and they will not be disappointed.
