I just read Tomarrenldes 2004's opinion and I think I have to jump over here. I understand he does not like the film, but his reasons are unclear. My feeling about this movie is that fear of loneliness, failure, frustration and sadness is not afraid to travel in the dark streets. Each of these two illustrations is bitter and angry, but there are many reasons for finding softness and comfort. Only great acting can be done without a mental quagmire, emotional and sad. Because of their strong performance because of their huge humanity, I am really interested in these people. I have all the reasons for disgusting Jane Phunda for my Vietnam-era activities, but without personal feelings, she is fictional in this role. Robert DeNiro is pretty much as a man who begins to fail his intelligence and godliness in a world indifferent towards his skill. This is the first time I've seen instead of selling a character using the amazing Denaro and I really like it. This film was a wonderful when I first saw it and looking forward to seeing it again.
