During the 1930s, when the radio grew up in England, the radio would not have been for 24 hours and 7 hours, so our batteries and depositors for electricity had a treatment for me. For this reason, the few programs that I heard have given a great impression on my young mind, and the 3 that I still think is "Toyota", about all animals in the zoo and --- Gray Oil, he knows that talking about animals, Which he called his "brothers". Recently I have only found out that Gray All is not a real "Indian", but Soux Chief's respected tribute seems to me "became intelligent." We could change the world as Arthur Gray Olay Belaney and dream all as beneficial. A new Gray owl can affect world leaders to clean the environment.
