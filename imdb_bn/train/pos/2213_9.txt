Wow was totally thrifty in this movie, I could not believe I was too late to wake up but it came in late ounce. I saw that I was not able to stop Cast members and even the whole cast member. Ruby de Forest Whittaker and James Earl Jones and many more famous actors and actresses were more than a glimpse of history. It was open to other parts of society that people do not know and may even feel embarrassed to talk. I have never heard of any book or movie about this before, and it is something that does not show only the black history addresses below because they were a secret and mixed race, I highly recommend this movie.
