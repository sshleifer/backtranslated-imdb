I think this movie works well and is realistic. I'm using you to watch Hollywood "Action" movies and use this movie as an ideal way to rate, you're bound to be frustrated. The film is closer to real life than 95% of Hollywood's produced, and it moves it to an average action movie. I do not have any experience with the Swedish army and therefore they do not point out any wrongdoing as to how they behave. But I saw an "made" extra, I'm sure there's been a lot to avoid any mistakes. This is a movie I recommend to visit others. High quality realistic stories and movies
