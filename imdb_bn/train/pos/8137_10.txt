If you prefer CB4, but if you have not seen this movie yet, then there is no idea what you are missing. This movie is crazy, and much more related to the hip hop art than any other parody movie ... it is unfortunate that the movie was not released on DVD because it was a movie I saw in love and wanted a copy. If you really want a good smile and you like hip hop and get acquainted with some old-school actors, definitley rent this movie. There are not enough places to rent videos that have their copy, but if you want to come together, you will not be disappointed.
