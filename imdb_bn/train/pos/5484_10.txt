This film was originally a documentary in the growing rising series of the April 10, 2002, to April 14, 2002 edition of the Venezuelan presidential palace in Canacas Venezuela. <br /> <br /> <br /> President Hugo Chavez feels the pain, sorrow and joy of the people living through this failed coup. <br /> <br /> No one came to see this image that Hugo Chavez is a really great historical figure. Hugo Chavez's personality alone formally brought the Venezuelan people to overthrow a 3-day old military establishment and rebuild Venezuela's democratically established government. <br /> <br /> This is clear from the footage of the film of George W. Venezuelan coup in cooperation with Bush The mainstream media that helped and did not surprise George W. Bush. <br /> <br /> How surprising it is that how many people have seen this image and how many people realize the total corruption of American media. <br /> <br /> It took only 20 years for Ronald Reagan to abolish Fairness Doctorain in 1986, to make the United States blind and harsh. <br /> <br /> Hugo Chavez can open the eyes of patriotic Americans for true and beauty of true American vision.
