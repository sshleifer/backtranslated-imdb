I first saw this video 15 years ago. I think it's nice then and I still do. I am a former teacher and English romantic poem lover of English (high school and college), so with me the rate of callerization is very high. Anything from the beauty or the power of the poem can be frustrating, I will not vote for my superiority. In this case, everything works well to engage visitors, especially high school students. The story is well-illustrated for television growing generations. In addition, Michael Redgrave's voice is authentic and adds a sense of authority to it. OK, so there was not a big budget for the project. So it was not Star Wars and there is no CGI in it. But as part of the presentation, who can cancel the painting of Gustav Drover? The above comment, which only discards the video as part of the trash on the four lines, is fairly unfair and obsolete. I'm a producer friend, but this is not my reason for comment. Rather, I'm protecting an Artist's work which I think has all levels of quality. It is appropriate to bring Coleridge's poem to the students in such a way that it awakens their perception and stimulates their sympathy towards the teachings of ancient Marina.
