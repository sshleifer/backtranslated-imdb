I do not understand why many IMDb users do not like this movie. Why they think it's too bad, etc. It's not worse than any other. Personally I think "Soliariar" is a great movie, much better than other similar movies. <br /> <br /> Because I like "soldier": Cart Russell, Connie Nelsen, Jason Scott Lee, Script (David Web People), Great Visual Effects, and Instructions (Paul Anderson). <br /> <br /> I also think this is the best work from director Paul Anderson, who has previously entertained "Martial Combat" and so much entertaining "Event Horizon".
