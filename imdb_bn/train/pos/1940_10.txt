I was really impressed with this film. The author was fantastic, and the letters were all rich, and easy. It is very easy to connect them all mentally. While making real life characters, the makers of this film hit the right of the nail on the right side of the head and properly show the audience in their world. In addition, the music is horrific. They randomize something to score, and employ some of the soundtracks, and they're an excellent job to add to the movies. If you have the opportunity to capture the movie in a small theater or a movie festival (as I've done), then I suggest you see it. Also, in a private note, Paget Brewster is beautiful in this film. That's enough reason to check it out.
