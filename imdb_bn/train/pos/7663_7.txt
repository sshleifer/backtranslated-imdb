As a rule, sign a warning to avoid a film of a full moon production logo. But I enjoyed Jeffrey combs in other pictures because I gave it a shot. <br /> <br /> It's not bad. Not great, but that's something else. This film involves a struggle with a mysterious (evil) "brother" who wants to dominate the world and the title character Dr. Morddin also has to deal with the people, and authorities around the world have to succeed successfully. <br /> <br /> Follow potential spoilers. <br /> <br /> Travel to the "levels" of the Jordi, and not to find a companion to protect a fortress; However, the guard has become blind. Her eyes are pits of destruction. So the wizard hands over the eyes of others, hello, Presto! His eyes have been restored! This healing healing works with apparently eyes. <br /> <br /> Afterwards, some creatures animating Skilton in a museum to fight for Madr√©d and his "brothers". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Morerdade's "human" events are OK, and combs play a solid role. <br /> <br /> I saw a lot worse.
