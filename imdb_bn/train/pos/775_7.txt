It's a weird, yet impressive story, about love. Personnaly, I run on stories such as a turning off in real life. However, I can do the image. <br /> <br /> This is a story that is committed to being "sick" from the title. But, after seeing this, I did not get this feeling of "sickness" that I must make sure of the rules of society. Something beautiful on this movie ... something fascinating ... which I can not contradict using a moral or social order. <br /> <br /> Movies focus mainly on the relationship between Kiki and Alex. You can see how this relationship can start, develop and eventually. At this moment when you love, first feeling, touch. You feel connected. And in no moment I am immoral though. Even you expect that it will not end ... it will not break ... it's not right. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , Shown * This relationship is only ill in forms, but not in content. You do not have total stories, but only pieces. When the movie started, the relationship between Kiki and Sandu was already there. So, there is no formula about the nature of the relationship. You feel only a tension between them ... to break the relationship between love and desire to fight. I think Kiki is calling this sandwich this line: "I want to stop ... and if you love me, I'll ask you." <br /> <br /> This image probably raises some questions that will be love and moral ... and where is the limit between them. I do not know the idea of ​​this movie "Love is all ... even social and moral values" or "love is beautiful ... no matter where or where". But in my opinion, this film is already a simple reason that it thinks you ...
