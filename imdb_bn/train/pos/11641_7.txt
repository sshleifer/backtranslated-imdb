I just realized an episode about Brad, who was addicted to crack street drug addiction, who was addicted to crack cocaine, quickly went away as soon as his bike racing career started. I would say that his biking career story was heart-breaking than drug addiction. Here the young man won the bicycle race left and right, and was invited to train with the Olympic training team for two weeks, and immediately after reaching out, he insulted Lance Armstrong, who was one of the greatest athletes of all time, and generally in general, helpless and immoral ordinary people. It is understood, that he is soon asked to leave. The program is mostly about its struggle with addiction and how he got his life back, but what I wanted to know was his first ass what was wrong to act like a donkey? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We saw him on the sidewalk and slept in gutter and sleep and even crack crack cocaine. I did not even know the legitimacy of this, but why would the camera crew follow him and follow the film? Do they expect that this person will turn his life away and give some material for a good TV show? <br /> <br /> Total control that they can control on the addiction and man's control. Sometimes it is hard to see because you see how badly the family and friends suffer in the face of addictive indifference, although I must admit that it is clear from the end. When the terrible things happen and the things go wrong, but still, and maybe I should be warned about the spoilers here, after feeling finally, everything is very little and I feel there is a very unusual event in real life. But still, it's a show trying to help other people, and you can not complain too much about something like that ??
