I watched this movie at the Taoos Film Festival last year, and it was simply abhorrent by it. It is a rich, warm novelist brought to the screen, acted nicely and managed. More than that, it reminds me of the ability to manage a complex story and to create powerful scenes that affect various levels of David Lin's films. The best movie I've seen in the year.
