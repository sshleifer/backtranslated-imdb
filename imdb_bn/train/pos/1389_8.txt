Williams family lives on a farm located in the middle of the remote desert. The place suddenly moved to a time filled place where they found themselves in great danger, where past, present and future have clashed with a wildly chaotic and unpredictable means. Director John "Bode" Cardos starts the film on a compulsory mysterious note and gradually makes the thing weird, crazy and more interesting, such as the Lupi story. Moreover, Cardgoan fills the screen with spectacular visuals and does a great job of creating the true concept of wonder and surprise. Gratefully appreciate the heartfelt acting of another game as a main plus: Jim Davis is the heartfelt parent Grant Williams, bringing his happy wife to Dorothy Malone, Christopher Mitchell to Richard, Mercy Lafront's lovely wife Beth, Natasha Ryan sweet little girl Jenny, and Scott C. Cruel Steve as Colden Funky special effects gnarly miniatures, Happy stop-motion animation monsters say an inspired combo (Animal animals a small spindly hairless guy, a large, molten, fanged animal, and a scrawny leased dude), and Nifty Matt Painting. Richard's bout encourages full-fledged orchestral scores to really hit the spot. John Arthur Morrill's crisp, sunny cinematography tactics alike. A fun flush.
