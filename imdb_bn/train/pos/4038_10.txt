It is the only film that actually came near to retain the unintended world film of American college experience in the late 60s in the early 1960's. Go ahead, give the name of a movie that even one can get: "Go straight"? "Rpm"? These are caricatures. "Return of the Secrets Seven" is at its moment, but it's a time of time between the time and place * and a much more confident person than a figure image. "Drive, he says" images - where it should be, instant and with quickships in shorts and in quick succession where it is the only way - anti-draft movements, ambiguity of big time college sports (especially when a war), sex revolution of the period, and the day General abnormality. Trust me, it was like that. <br /> <br /> There is a full cast complimentary appreciation (of course, as a director) but special praise should be reserved for Bruce Dern, the basketball coach and Karen Black. Hero is very unusual - without that time - love interest. William Tapter also limited the original goal of both the athletes of the time to perfect capture and actually play real college basketball in this film, both of them (remember "Anthony Parkinson" in Remember?)! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please, please go back to your Arnold movie). Why is this image not available from imdb?
