Carrier Grant is another example of unique talent. Oscar is a considerationable performance, rescued by the Academy again. In this wonderful comedy about a man who decided to go out of the big city, Mr Grant runs tenderly from the stupid. The loss of a home has been completely chronic, and the basis for the more modern Tom Hans car, "Money Pat" has become (short). <br /> <br /> If you like good old-fashioned comedy without curse and gratuitous sex, this movie must see a must.
