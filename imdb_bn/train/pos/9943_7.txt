The film does not claim to be very spectacular like many movies. Films props yourself as a fun and entertaining time And that was exactly what was. This is the Korean version of a male. It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> Another way to copy a carbon film. Instead, how the remaining 2 "canes" became men in their own right during the time of enjoyment. Therefore, the picture is fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Camera work, especially the Dolly Runs, was very well run. The script was a weaker, weak, this character was not 2 dimensional but enjoyable was enjoyable that they were full of life and longing. This image is not an Oscar, nor DVD blockbuster sale, but a fun watch and a fun experience will not win.
