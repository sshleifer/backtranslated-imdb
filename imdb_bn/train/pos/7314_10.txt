For the first time I saw this movie, I love it. The atmosphere was the first and foremost to catch my attention. I expected a gore festival, but instead got to see a pretty intelligent killer friction with my head of a cool soundtrack (it's actually my pigment right now: P). When he kills, he can not predict, and when he disappears, there was a big plus in my book. Bore me in a predictable horror movie. Now, I know the story was a bit isolated, but if you are like me, you will not pay attention to them for a long time after the movie and you are lying on the bed that you have just seen a wonderful composition of speed. Finally, as I mentioned, soundtrack is unreadable. This is my best-ever theater score, so I was very happy to hear Rob Jabbar hanging his remix. While talking about the rimak, I read a very comprehensive article about it and now I know that Mr. Jammu has honored John Carpenter, I have high hopes for this classic. This movie is thirsty for bites of your spine at any time, but it's perfect addition, opening, closing, you name it for an all-hallow's eve movie marathon. :)
