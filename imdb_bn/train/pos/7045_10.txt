This film definitely gets a thumbs up from me. It's a wonderful joke and even the Eastern-European people, most of its stereotypical and objectionable opinions have thrown me out of most of the film. Its plot is clever and 100% real and you will guess throughout the whole movie. I was most impressed with this film by Hilary Duff. It's easy to use and easy that he used to be a stepping-stone of the 'chick-flick' step by step. Her accent was excellent and her performance performance was amazingly crisp and well executed. The best performance I've seen from Hillary is that, and I've seen most of her films. His character, Jonikka Babiah, has been described as 'Britni Spears of Eastern Europe' and it's some of its methods and songs, 'I want to hit you ... ... ... up'. You're also sorry for her, because her performance really spoils you, Yonica is a complex and confusing character. Joan Cusack smiled me with a smiling smile throughout life, but the expression of her face and so on. John Cusack's malicious dialogue will probably make you chocolate across. I firmly recommend this film.
