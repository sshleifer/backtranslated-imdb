In the Kongwon-do ui film, he has given a relatively close view of the meaning of meaning (and general nonsense) in the lives of Koreans; Just looking for ways to fill oneself, enjoy nature's escapism. From the beginning to the end of the film we feel the different characters; We learn the overall complexity of catching up in their losses and their desires, human life (and yet the greatest simplicity of humanity). Although the film is moving slowly but it can be very thoughtful. It does not emphasize any ideas, but the ideas allow themselves to come, that gives the idea to express themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie ends and suddenly it starts and a real sense of loneliness, that love is often a work of selfishness, and we are wrong that many mistakes. It's a glance at daily life, very well and well done. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for an action or intense play, this is not a movie for you. However, if you enjoy honest, original and meaningful movies that are not forcibly and without glitches, then it's a great movie to watch.
