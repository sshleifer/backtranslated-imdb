Break the plot and Fred Astaire enjoys a duo with a hipple youngman Fontaine, enjoying a foggy day and many other dances. Here we see essentially "stage" dances with the grapes Rogers in comparison to his films, and learn to take full advantage of the film's potential. Best of all: We watched Barnes and Allen before the radio / TV comedian's carrier, they could dance like a dancer in Vadville and in the 30's they did not have the opportunity to work in the Paramount College film. (George was once a dance dancer coach). Their two numbers with Fred are high-quality movies and awaited. The first soft shoe triangle is a warm up for the "Chin Up" enjoyable carnival number, of which three can sing and dance through the streets and other attractions. It seems almost spontaneous. Fred Astaire and Barnes and Allen's fans find the value to carry under "the plot". I saw this 4 or 5 times, and the Fast forward button is helpful.
