(spoilers) <br /> <br /> I was blown away by this movie. I'm renting movielink for a bit, and decided to check out this movie. Boxing movies seem to overblow plenty of blood. In this picture, it shows in Amateur Level. Although I want him to probably get more attention in the progress of his grade. The film refers to problems faced by some families in connection with gender. <br /> <br /> I was a little worried at last. But the last was not frustrating. <br /> <br /> I think the title was pretty good that he would win. There was something unexpected that the two of them ended together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Love the score for some scenes. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> 10/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Entertainment: 10/10 <br /> <br /> Repeatable: 10/10
