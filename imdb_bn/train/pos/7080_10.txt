Terry Gilliam gives a great movie, which I totally enjoyed. Bruce Willis, Madeline Stove, Brad Pitt, and even the small appearance of Christa Plummer make the movie absolutely brilliant! This is the only Terry Gilliam movie I have seen and repeatedly the monkeys are my best 10. I think it's one of four best-known Bruce Willis films. And Brad Pitt is the best. Brad Pitt provides a perfect performance. Probably the ten best actors that I probably saw. He played his role very strongly (Geoffrey). The role of Bruce Willis (James Cole) was very convincing. Both Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt played exceptionally well. Brilliant story behind great performance! And that's back, Terry Gilliam's fantastic direction.
