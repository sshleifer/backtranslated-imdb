OK, Kelly does not have any Astaire but because of which no popcorn, Ditto but Alan Lerner hugely overrated and white Kelly's other 'big' 50 'musical Singin' in Rain (which is a weird duplication of light years before script) lyricists other lyricists Songs are written with integrated screenplaces and countless numbers are much more characteristic than Arthur Fried / Nassie Brown, Alana lararake not feel too frequently).
