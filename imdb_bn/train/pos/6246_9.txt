If you are not 100% sure to maintain your mental stability, then it is not a brilliant idea to see the Hundstage because it will not be strictly tested in this movie, whether you are a Sun or not. I have to say that Hendstage is an art film rather than an entertaining movie, so most of the viewers can not reach "maturity" in their delightful direction. Tarkovsky is kind of like film, but in a way different. I can not tell myself, I've had a lot of fun watching it. But it's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who tormented just by the clutch that offers the hollywood. Hundstage scratches your mind on a finger-right stick and all in your brain. You can not just sit behind and see it, you will be wondering whether or not the whole film will be opened open throughout the eyes. A film similar to that in the film Nachtastlatten, but it was quite good and way less violent. For example, it is not for a child who is mentally flexible or bad-bad. Most visitors probably can offer 10 or 1 in this movie. I can give it a 9 because I saw a multi-story-on-one-film event in another movie and it's even better. But this one is an outstanding piece of its own. Observers are ready to see something valuable, but annoying.
