The film "Freelity" is more than a psychic thriller than a horror film. It has a horror movie but it does not. "Fraternity" is a film to understand the difference between religion and correct and wrong. <br /> <br /> "Freelity", middle-aged father (Bill Paxton) and his two sons are God's work It proves that they are a trio of notorious serial killers who are known as "the hands of God". We kill our "giants" in a cruel manner when they believe in their son and themselves that they are doing God's work and that they are doing exactly what they are doing. He claimed that he received a message from an angel who gave specific instructions to eliminate the ghosts living here on earth. God gave him a list of names and instead of his "service"; He and his sons will be provided protection, which is basically police can not catch them. We see it open in front of us in a very annoying manner. But it is really boring, which affects his two sons, especially the oldest Adam Adam. Adam suspects himself of the existence of a Supreme, which causes him to change his father and one week after the house. He knows that his father must have lost his mind and certainly his younger brother Fenton is having similar things. Fenton, the other half of this puzzle, all accept the same as his own religion. He feels trapped between God and demons in his Father's earth. I think that's why he is very short and easy to print. But these three events are rather trustworthy than what has happened, really. <br /> <br /> The incident happening in this movie can be seen as a strange confusion with the experience of three main characters. I say this because they react to the different reactions of each situation and at one stage of the movie they all want to see God. Parents first saw the murder as their mission. His "mission" finally consumed him and soon turned into an obsession with the removal of the monster. In fact, his hallucinations are the primary one. List of names of his "orders" and the names he received are a part of this confusion. Check out the scene where I find an ax in the father's room to find out where I'm coming. The younger son is easily influenced by the conversation of Panton, Ghost and Destruction. Since he is so young, it is easy for him to fall in the trap of his father. Adam, on the other hand, very suspicious of his father's work. <br /> <br /> *** SPILILERS *** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> (I do not have to say under how or under what circumstances). But I would say it's not nice. After his death, it is fast forward to the present day. (The story is said by flashback, as is the oldest son of Adam) Indeed, it is said that the story of Fenton, is not basically believed as Adam. It is said that the story is understood through its actions and through its brother's work. Fenton has become insane and continues to do what his parents started by luring the FBI agent to trap him. <br /> <br /> Religion is a major theme because of this film, religion is also misinterpreted by religion by making it easy for people who do not have complete understanding of it. Before the father discovered his new mission, he had no clear understanding of religion and he did not believe in the best of all. His sons, Fenton and Adam, often sang the chorus of innocent little children, but there was no clear understanding of what it meant. After the publication of Father's new mission, they both had withdrawn from the other side - Adam was in the best position to remain in the position, Panton slowly slumped in his father's madness. <br /> <br /> A very good thriller that will pull out the hack from you, do not see it alone.
