I liked this movie very much. This is a beautiful dark story of Shakespeare's Macbeth - it's a curiosity, often funny and shocking modern twist. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker came with a different world of modern NYC and Macbeth. One in Scotland under the roof. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've seen it closed off and for the originality stands in the last few indies.
