I saw this movie in the first few weeks (I never remember.) I was right for Ben Stiller's film. This film is not for a person without a good sense of humor. Just like most of Ben Stiler's jokes, you have to think about them. Or I said you have a good sense of humor. I have seen from some people on this website that it is not good to say anything about it and it did not get a very good rating, but I could have given it a big one. Well and it should acquire a good rating. Maybe it's not a movie for you. I just give you another person's opinion.
