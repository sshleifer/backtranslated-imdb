Manhattan's American middle class Jim Blandings (Curie Grant) lives with his wife Muriel (Marina Loye) and two teenage girls in four bedrooms and one bathroom only in a rented apartment. In an advertisement by Jim, the company collects $ 15,000.00 a year and discomfort in his apartment due to lack of space. When he watches a large house ad for sale at Connecticut, at a affordable price, he drives with his wife and real estate agent and decides to purchase an old house without any technical advice. His best friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Mervyn Douglas) sent an inspector engineer to visit the house and the man says that he should throw the house and build another. Jim examined the information with other engineers and condemned them and as soon as he bought a "money bag" instead of a dream house. <br /> <br /> "Mr. Blindings builds his own house" with a wicked line and top notch screenplay, a very funny comedy. By the inspiration to fulfill America's Dream dreams, Keri Grant has become very delightful, who has got a large house ownership that likes to be bad, lose his touch in his work and feel the jealousy of his friend. In 1986, Tom Hendes worked in an interestingly inspired movie "The Money Pot" in a very interesting movie. My vote is eight <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Lara, May Turmento" ("Home, my pain")
