Boats, boats, buses, and buses are unexpected in boats. There is a way to waste time, then you will go back to Hollywood movies so that this part can be wrapped in the money shot. And in this way you go to the idle and cinematic Limbo, which does not actually show the reality of life. The long-distance travel sequences allow viewers to withstand the same frustration and 'waiting-in-line' letters. Frustrating? Yes Important? In fact This is the key to the 'toughness' of the Turkish family. Nice film with great acting. Sorry, but it's worth it.
