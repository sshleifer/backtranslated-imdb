Yes, this is a horror math movie and it was so funny! Because the film is clearly awkward, there was a light soul in some stories - and even sometimes there were some smiles. Sometimes horror films are not all these bad things as a bit stuffy and overly serious. Because of this reason and the four stories were quite good, this is one of the best movies I've seen in this style. <br /> <br /> Each story connects itself to the theme house itself. In four different stories, there are people involved who investigate the rental of the house or what happened to the tenants. <br /> <br /> In the first segment, Danel Eliot starred as author of a block block as a horror writer. So, for visual changes, they rented this house. Almost immediately the block of Eliot disappears and he works immediately in a story about the series killer. Surprisingly, soon after his block he began to see his fictional character! Again, the psychological killer appeared and then disappeared - it seems as if he lost his mind. This can be the best of the stories, just as a beautiful twist makes the last story alive. <br /> <br /> Secondly, although not bad, it is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing is a bachelor who has put a girl friend on bed, who died some time ago (though her picture seems to be a classic contemporary). She enters a chamber in the city's horrible vamoose museum, reminds her lost female that she sees a wax figure and she is fascinated and fearful by both. Later, a friend (Jose Ackland) visited and he also saw this image and entered it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of this segment is Li It seemed like, but ultimately you can understand its inconsistency. Although slowly, it is very well ended. <br /> <br /> The fourth segment was the silhouette and it was for the parody style. John Pertway (Dr. Doctor of the WHO Television series "Doctor") is a very tragic actor, which is known for Dracula's screenplay. However, according to him, there is nothing right about filming and firmly closed the set to find it better for this pampered film. It seems normal for Christopher Lee, because it is really interesting that he played this role, who played (or can take) Dracula or other vampires in a ballilan bar. When I enjoyed Pertwee's line, he originally said that Lee and others are Dracula's incarnations, compared to Lugosi! Perhaps Lee does not take part in this! Despite some very foolish moments, it was very entertaining and fun - maybe better or better than the first division. <br /> <br /> As the film started and ended in the end, it was difficult to have a nice acting and writing work. Do not like this image.
