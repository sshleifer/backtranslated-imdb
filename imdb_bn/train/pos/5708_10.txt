This is so exciting! This afternoon I saw "La Rouie", a short, light-hearted little movie, I consider it practical behavior! This is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures I saw this year. This is an amazing tweet because it is more amazing and puts some great pictures of 30 due to the innovative use of the film. It's just music and an adorable mood that's really passionate and on the bottom, line, it's filled with happiness to me! Obviously, finding a male ticket will not be so difficult to recover the ticket, but the speed is so fun and the movie is so entertaining that I do not even think twice. Comedy is a lot of fun and I think it's even better than Marx Brothers, perhaps the biggest curiosity of time. This is rather perfect.
