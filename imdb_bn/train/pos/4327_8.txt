I like this presentation - I've read Blake House and I know that it is very difficult to present the whole book as it should be, and others like Little Dorett also - I admit they made a very good show with the stadium Nicholas Nicholbi. I love Diana Rig and see Lady Dodlock's pain, even with the arrogance of democracy. I'm sorry, I think she's the best Lady Deluxe ... I'm not sure that Gerardis has done better, but I'm Mr. I'm fine with Elliott. It is not easy to present these long Dickens books - the Oliver Twist will be easy - it's long, and if you're not worried about all the legal situations it might be annoying or annoying. I think this presentation is not annoying enough to be entertaining. I just m Love Small Wives - It Can Be Recreational There is always a child - Joe will break your heart here ... I think we should give ourselves a chance to judge ... <br /> <br /> I want to say, I liked the show. Maybe I read the book again, as I usually see, after watching the movie, maybe I can be more critical. Already - I think it's a good presentation.
