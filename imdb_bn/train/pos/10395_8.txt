A fantastic Arab adventure. A former king, Ahmad and his best friend, Chor Abu (directed by Sabu of Black Narsisas), looked for Ahmad's love interest, who stole the new King Jafar (Conrad Vedat). There is a very few moments here. It is always invented new adventures for the heroes. Personally, I think Ahmad and his princess are a little annoying (no need to ask Ahmad actor John Justin why he is listed in the fourth place from the credit). Conrad Veidt, always a fun actor, creates a great villain, and makes a lot of fun as the prince of the sub thief, who at one point found a gene in a bottle. I like Miles Malson as the sultan of the princess's father. She collects amazing toys from around the world. Zafar bribe him for a mechanical flying horse for his daughter. This will probably be counted among the best children's films of all time, but special effects are now horribly rated. Abu and Jinn will be on screen together when kids must der derive superimposed images. And the scene with giant spider looks particularly frightening. Although most of the young generation probably think that King Kong looks bad at this time, the stop-motion animation of Willis O'Brien is a thousand times better than a strip that can not be seen remotely like a spider. 8/10.
