At the end of World War II, Powell and Pressbirders were asked to do something to try to improve the cyclone in the UK and the United States. There were plenty of comments on "overpaid, over sex," comments at that time. Somehow they came with this great composition. <br /> <br /> My favorite movie all the time. It has everything. Romance, poetry, passion, religion, drama and very quirky. <br /> <br /> Why can not I explain correctly, but it hits all right buttons and although I saw it hundreds of times (yes, really) I'm sure to be tears across many points yet. <br /> <br /> Was it a nice acting, wonderful set, inspired script? Who knows But * see it and you'll see what you understand.
