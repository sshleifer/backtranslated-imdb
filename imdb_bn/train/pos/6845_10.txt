"Dressed to Teal" is one of the most awesome horror / thriller movies ever made. It's sexually sticky, stylish, and highly suspicious mix of violence. The performance is very good, the Orchestra score is impossible by Pingo Donagio, and there is ample surprises for the thriller fans to curiosity. "Dressed to Teal" is a murder mystery that is a sexual disappointment housewife (Angel Dickinson), her teenage son (Keith Gordon), her psychologist (Michael Kainne) and high-cost call girl (Nancy Allen)). The murderer is a transsexual bubby who is one of Cain's patients. This picture is full of exciting moments: The notorious lift motif scene is very stylish and pretty fantastic. Highly recommended.
