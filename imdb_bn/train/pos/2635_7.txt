Take me: lion king as a fun, take a fun. Wonderfully amusing. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, "lion king 1 1/2" is actually another funny straight video, it is worth a therapeutic treatment. I do not see why Disney is released directly on this video and publishes theaters such as "Chicken Little" and "Return to Neville" theater. In the video shop ("new release" area) that the theaters look good instead of seeing their theater posters outside of the theater. <br /> <br /> This is just a fool of the first movie. The events of "Simba's Pride" are still not there, at the point of Timon (voice of Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Voice by Arni Sabella). We will see the fun of the event in their first movie. Matthew Broadrick, Cheylee Martin, Robert Gilmour, Cheyenne Martin and Robert Gileum returned to their voicing roles from the first film, the first film to return to their voicing roles, Julie Kawner and Jerry Stylar Teeman's mother and some ridiculous comedies as drunk uncle. <Br <br /> <br /> So this is not fun fun. Maybe not now, but see it for yourself. It makes it more enjoyable that its plot is not serious. It's like MST3000 with Timon and Pumbaa <br /> <br /> Video movie ratings: *** 5 out 1/2.
