This is undoubtedly one of the fun movies ever made. Amitabh as a crocodile in the country, Arjun Singh is ridiculous. The best thing is not to stop laughing. The plot is similar to the same old story where the child is separated from the mother, who dedicates everything to her duties - a happy reconciliation at the end. There are villains (Ranjit) and the brothers (Shashi Kapoor) and there are Vixen (Parvin Babi) and there are lovers (Smith Potili) and cast a blind brother and grandfather for good measurement. But this movie is about Amitabh and then everything you think is the end. <br /> <br /> Amitabh comes to the city to live a beautiful life and his conversation delivery and methods are ridiculous. He later became Aggeng Young Manager in the film, but he was famous, but humor continued. Memorable parts include her walking, talking and speaking English, songs (Pad Gunungru Ray Bhaand, My Chachi Thee) and her father. <br /> <br /> I was rolling laughing all over the movie. If you want 32 hours of entertainment with Amitabh, then its best. It will easily give it a 10/10.
