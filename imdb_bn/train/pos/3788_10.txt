This movie is gorgeous It's real and down-hearted, but at the same time the whole crazy. Characters fall easily with love, because they have many different minds, but each of us can at least mention it. In Canada, there are not many movies in our Eastern Europe, and I've seen a few, Lona's best. It's very funny, and magic. If you want to see something new and refreshing, look at the loungers.
