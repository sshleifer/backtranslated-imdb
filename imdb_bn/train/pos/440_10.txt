My favorite movie all the time Oscar-Qualification Camera works by everyone involved both front and back. The screenplay is perfect, and unlike the novel, Lady Caroline and George Briggs are completely satisfied with the relationship. Other leading characters that have been cared for have won Oscars for respecting screenwriter Peter Barnes and for intense visual beauty director Mike Nel and cinematographer Rex Medadament. It's the best work done by Jose Lawrence, and Joan has changed my opinion about Plathai. Seeing this movie at least 50 times, I can not find any flaws in it. The famous musician Richard Rodney Bennet's music is an amazing event.
