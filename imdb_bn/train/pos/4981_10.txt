I myself think this film is a rare treasure. This is not only the beginning of the career of the Shirali Temple, but a rare look that has changed our society. You have to understand, some of the things that we will see today as sex, then again will be considered innocent. For example, in order to see this film, many parents brought their children along with the children of the film as well as the children of the film, seeing this, the children imitate the adult. Most people do not think much about sexually transmitted children more than teenage girls. It was not sex to them. Internet, television, and so forth ... etc ... Most of the sexual crimes were not taken openly. Sometimes there will be a whisper about the child with "funny uncle" But that was all that often came to it. Yes very sad But today's day is very sad, because even I can see it as something other than what I wanted, innocent and funny. When I saw Shirli dance and said with the eyes of the boys, yes I am bored. I have to remind this time! These children do not know what sex was. Parents knew the film's children and those who saw it. Thoughts may not even enter their mind. Then, in front of the average adult's eyes, it was no longer sex when Charlie was at home. Even today, children will enter the beauty contest, many dressed very mature for three years old. But the child is just pose. I do not blame my child for wanting to work like an adult. Or this is the old movie that displays this In all the truth, our media thinks of many things as ill and wrong. This can sometimes be for the best. But I really believe this movie is not one of them. It gives an innocent mentality a rare look, we have long lost.
