I joined IMDB so that people know it's a great movie! It's a non-continuous film that is visible and visible in the movie but Humble Because I have read the plot, what I want to say is not to see it because you want to see the conflicts of cultural religious identity, because it can be read by common misconceptions, but it is simply grateful and understand that it is about a father and a journey boy their struggle Growing up to know each other through. Buy it and film 4 pass it before it gets round. It is one of the few films nominated for independent and foreign BAFTA. Its beauty is not directed to appeal to anyone, even if you do not see the subtitle or just use the Hollywood formula, it's a great story that can prevent you. The only thing that I want is that it will be longer and see what will happen
