South Africa, a long film about Stephen Baikou, a very important character. He was one of the blacks who had not survived racism, who died long before the actual normal period. Already old films do not show how important women are, what they really represented. His life and his teachings are a little less good, few witty comments. Since 1987, the film aims to impose South Africa on its arrow, which will release him. So, the film aims to show how unsightly the South African supporters of 1987 are showing. To show this, the film will have to look at Biko's death, so his speech will be centered in the afternoon, but a white liberal journalist and he is survived by his stupid system which is alive. He was forced to flee because of his prey, as well as his family, as well as his death, as well as the first book after his death, he would like to publish and it could also be in England. This picture shows a way to escape from South Africa, when racism is still standing and killed. So do not expect this way to be realistic and true. it can not be. But this film has grown quite because it does not show the distance made by South Africa's historic distant position, President Nelson Mandela's president, and those who apologize to those who ask for forgiveness speak and talk outside. The film is strong and emotional but it also weakens the historic limits today, especially since the movie does not refer to the third ethnic community, Indians. Panegyric books or films have all the flaws that are: They are only looking at the person that is supposed to portray the portrait from one point. It explains why this movie is so old, seems to be coming so long ago, as nothing has changed. A remix is ​​required. <br /> <br /> Jacques Collardou, University of Paris 1 Panthhan Surnay, University Varscious St. Quintin Ann Yewelines, CEGID
