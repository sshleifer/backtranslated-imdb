These effects are destroyed by extremely incredible finishes. <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this image 8 out of 10 but at the end it was thrown in 7 points because it seemed to have originally exited the movie for the first 75 minutes and it seemed quite strong. Finally the filmmakers are looking cute. <br /> <br /> This film was much better than movies with a big budget and with some extra resources it started portraying home movies. These were not so much on special effects, but it was very good for suspension.
