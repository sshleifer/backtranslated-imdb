I'll try to say english to romania. I want to tell about this movie that it will be my first number of all time. Have seen it at least 30 times above and can see it for many years now. It's all the little things I like in a movie, it lets me cry by touching it too. Love and reality and diverse love topics and many questions about real things that are important to different people. This is the most important thing for me, my love, the human soul, the inner being, and I see this thing in this film. Perhaps it's a lot more than a motion picture for me, it's a proof in my mind that it really can exist and you can make the best of the moment you live with your soul mate. It's a long way to sci-fi from reality, but .. what if. So will all capitalism disappear and the economy will be reduced? We all will be concerned about other things and I think, the big thing you remember in your bed of death, not the wealth, the adventure, the countries you go to and the people who do not remember you. But the real friend and your true love and hope that after your death, all God will be perfect and the people will be better and be more careful. Check out this movie and maybe it will guide me through your life :) Coming from Romania
