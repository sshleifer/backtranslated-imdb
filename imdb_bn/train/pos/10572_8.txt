I think that the Warning Bros. Depression-era music is going to be much more relevant in the next few years. Yes, we are in economic doldrums (or you have been living under a rock) and the time is silent. But we always have movies as a way to escape from our troubles. In the 30's, the economic crisis of the film was even very popular in the height of the crisis. "Football Parade (1933)" is a film that came to the audience. This Lloyd Bacon operated musical does not capture much of social problems like "Gold Diggers" in 1933 (1933), it is still a gifted exhibition. Waiting for the end of the movie will be the three centerpieces of Berkeley Berkeley extrovert, but boy, are they waiting for me? Yes, the little Ruby Keelar is a terrible singer and actress, and her tapping is so much, but the magician "By A Waterfall" has been shaken by her and hundreds of other chorus girls think that it is a dazzling water wonderland Of course, the number of buses can never be edited at one stage (they deny the gravity limits for one thing), and they are horrifyingly contrary to the reality of the harsh, intelligent, non-musical scenes. And "football" is also among James Cagney's one of his very few musical instruments (really, this man could not do). He even emphasized the leading person, Dan Nabal's clothing and sex shots, Shanghai Lil (who is a very small ruby ​​among girls of Chinese girl girls!). He is co-star with his favorite, Joan Blandel, who coggles Cagney to any other woman (until the final relay, that is). Blondel was obviously another woman who lived far away from his wife. And you can see mutual worship in each scene.
