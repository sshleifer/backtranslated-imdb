How strange people are! The center of this activity where the perceptions of reality are formed and preserved and anyone in the world works fine on the brain, it is the sensory and sensual nature of all the subtle and complex materials. And how much do we know about its depth or abilities? What is it in mind that lets us differentiate between reality and dream? Or can we? Perhaps our reality is not more than an impression of what we see, like showing an image of Monnet, in which the Vanilla sky of his view has become our reality. Filmmaker Cameron Crowe starred in his philosophical and cognition-changing film 'Vanilla Sky,' Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz. At the age of thirty, David Amus (cruise) inherited the empire of a publication leaving him by his father. Because of more than fifty percent interest control, he has been identified as the seven members of his board of directors and everyone considers himself to be better than the young lion's lucky young man. And to burn incitement, they think that David does not look at the job requirements. <br /> <br /> Of course, David likes to play; Yet, he is in control of the business and he fits what he sees, does not like the board (referred to as Seven Dervais), and no one dares to challenge him directly. But during his birthday birthday celebration, one of the corporate lawyers, Thomas Tip (Timothy Spaul) warned David that there are seven behind his back. At that time, this is the last word about David's mind; He has a casual relationship with a friend Julie Zayani (Cameron Diaz), but even when he meets a woman in his team, he can not get out of his mind. His name is Sofia (Penelope Cruz), and after knowing him for only one night, he has become an important part of his life - which will turn in the opposite direction, as he decides on his behalf in the morning, changes his life forever. And he's often going to learn that sometimes it can not be back. <br /> <br /> Director Cameron Crowe has distributed more than this movie with another film; Much more than a movie, 'Vanilla Sky' is realized in a vision. Starting with the first pictures on the screen, he presented a visible stunning experience that affects both the literal and the brain. This is the mystery of a mind-twist that will consume you and remove you; Psychologically, this is a storm - and it can tire you, because it requires some effort to stay with it. But it's worth it. Imagine 'Memento' with the vibrant attack of colors driving by a driving rock n 'roll soundtrack and an influential brush stroke. There is darkness and light, and until the word swells with your lungs in your brain in your brain and until your brain gets into the lungs. And swirling at the bottom that all vanilla stars played on a landscape of virtual reality stretched. Simply put, this one is a real trip; It's exciting - and it's a mind bender. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>> They have to think again in the light of his work here. Because David Anderson has given Cruise the best performance of his career, which must be examined by any doubt about his ability as an actor at the door. In the last few years, she has liked some interesting careers with 'Magnolia' and 'Eyes Wide Shot', she made warm-ups for the very real and complex character created here. And to take such a role, give him credit, which surpasses any terrible horror; This cruise does not meet you as before. 'Jerry Maguire' earned him an Oscar nomination, and this one, too - should compliment his coworkers and praise them. Cruz is not only good at this film, he's amazing. <br /> <br /> As well as David's dream woman Sofia, Penelope Cruz became outstanding as well as outstanding performance. He works well for his character and receives a lucrative innocence in a role that makes his upcoming and accessible, but he has no indication of the mystery that can add some extra 'extra' to the part. But Crow knows how to get the best of his actors, and he certainly worked with the cruise. <br /> <br /> He knew what he was doing with Cameron Diaz, who is absolutely vibrant in the role of Julie. She never looked good, and sizzles fairly on screen. But do not make any mistake, it's not a 'window-dressing' part, and Diaz offers a complete package with this character. The effectiveness, which makes its performance value, rather with limited screen time, can be measured. And it's the personality that he has so much to consolidate with his natural beauty that makes Julie so unforgettable. After all, Diaz is an awesome job. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes Kart Russell (Dr. McCabe), Jason Lee (Brian), Johnny Galaki (Peter), Armanand Slatz (Dr. Pomarrantz), Noah Taylor (ed), Mel Thompson (' L'Man), Jean Carroll (Women in New York) and John Fedvich (Silent Ed). Almost half way, this one you can understand your own reality; But rest assured, 'Vanilla Sky' will be released all at the end. It is a reality-bender, sure, and a wild one; But it is exciting entertainment which satisfies - and unique - experience, you have to believe. It is essential, and absolute, movie magic. 10/10. <br /> <br />
