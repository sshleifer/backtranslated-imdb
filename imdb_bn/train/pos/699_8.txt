I saw the nightmare of insomnia that for the first time not so long ago and I would have to say, I really thought it was quite good. If you are a fan of Dominic Monaghan you would like it. The movie of the hole takes his mind - is it? A little knife and shaky played from everyone else and some of the scenes may be cut but it eventually works out. Extra DVDs are as great as movies, if that's not much for the dom fans. It has quite a clear moment from a great interview with set, outtakes and directors. Anyone who has gone to create an independent film will try to stop this short trippie movie that will keep an eye on Tess (director), Dom and other small personal personal sets. It was quite enjoyable and I'm happy to have it in my collection.
