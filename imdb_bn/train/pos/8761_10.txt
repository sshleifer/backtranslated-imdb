I love Claire Dances, and Kate Buckinsale's role looks oddly wonderful. The film is only faulty because it seems that in two monasteries, it works like a beggar and works under discipline like almost martial arts. Acting with the permission of Thailand and painters and amazing colors are striking, but clear Dennis steals the whole film, and it is unexpectedly deep in learning to have a difficult lesson in life. Real world is unreasonable free and completely unexpected. Errors are minutes and I recommend the movie, which seems sadly tense to display rare TV. I want a movie for my collection - only "10" rating movie collection. See it, you will be very touched.
