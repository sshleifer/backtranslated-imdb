I found this movie lovely. I saw some of these kinds of movies in the movie disguised with other popular movies of that time. Try once If you've seen movies that fascinate this movie and you get laugh, then enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> I (and others who watched movies with me) felt the most fun part of the film. (It was not a spoiler because I did not really tell you what would happen) There was a scene with "flashing thing" from MIB. When they first discovered the device and did not know what it does ... and then again in the movie ... you will understand when you arrive there. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about the film was that I could not find it in DVD so that I could buy a copy.
