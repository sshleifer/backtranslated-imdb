A powerful surprise movie. Once you are involved in the story, you will remain firm in death. A successful dentist, Allan Johnson (Don Chadell), has lived in a life crisis to keep his career balance with his family. He gave a notice to his former college roommate Charlie Feynman (Adam Sandler) and wants to touch the base. Charlie, who has lost his wife and family in America's 9/11 attacks, is no longer with real contact ... He has found out to be involved in his mind about his favorite music from past and video games. Former roommates awaken their friendships and strengthen their former bonds. Johnson is trying to bring her friend Angela Oakhurts (Liv Tyler), who is psychologically, trying to treat her ... but Allan has succeeded in getting her friend to come out of her dark darkness. Jada Panket starred Smith Johnson's wife. Author and Director Mike Binder plays Charlie's attorney / guardian role. Also in Cast: Saffron Burrows, Donald Sutherland, Adele Modell and Robert Klein. Outstanding soundtracks like Bruce Springsteen, Graham Nash, Pierre Jum and The Pretender Note: I'm never a fan of Sandler; But I did not find him outstanding in this role. In some scenes, I shouted aloud ... singer / songwriter Bob Dylan was never contacted by him to play biology.
