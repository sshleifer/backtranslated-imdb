I love this movie a lot, but it's a fact, you do not understand it, unless you're from Eastern Yugoslavia. Most actors are now dead and they are the best-known actors of Ugoslavia. I am grateful that this movie is now in Devox and I can get it in my collection. Macedonia Serbia. Montenegro Bosnia and Herzegovina Croatia. Slovenia <br /> <br /> All these former Yugoslavia, the Balkan nation was a melting pot. It can be a land of dreams, if Sobbodan Milosvich, Franzo Tudzman and other nationalists do not poison the country's mind by their ill-sense.
