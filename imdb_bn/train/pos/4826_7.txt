This film is about the life of Queen Victoria and her first few years as the King of Great Britain during her youth. <br /> <br /> "The Young Victoria" has produced amazing production. Each scene is designed to be stupid detail and decorated. Unusual clothes, lots of places and beautifully decorated gardens make everyone "The Young Victoria" very impressive. I was most surprised by thoughtful cinematography. Every person related to how the background or foreground is placed is well thought out, each scene is well composed. The scene hit me the most while talking to Victoria Melbourne. Melbourne was in the middle of the Victoria angle between the door frame, Victoria was in its corner from the corner of Melbourne where Melbourne was located in his fingers on his fingers. <br /> <br /> According to the story, it would be followed by a person without much historical knowledge of Queen Victoria and much more compressed Queen. Many events are not explained or even through. I hope a huge view of the prince, and frustrating it lasts for a few seconds. <br /> <br /> Overall, "The Young Victoria" is a good film, and it will be even better if it gets better. , So that the incident can be interpreted correctly without pushing.
