First and foremost a chick flick, it's a romantic comedy. There is a fair balance between the two. There are some beautiful sweet battle scenes in this special movie, I do not think there is no cable used or if they do not have a flat outside the flat. This is not a complex complex film, it is easy on the brain, there is no need to analyze any deeper analysis, pretty easy, good chemistry between lids and a fun watch. I liked it when I highlighted the full potential of girls, it seems like once it might look great, but they kept it a less basic form throughout the film. I'll look at a girl again.
