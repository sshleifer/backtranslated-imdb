For the first time I saw this picture, I like it. It was different. <br /> <br /> I am a Christian (believe in the Bible). I do not go along with the crowd of right wing believers. I was dropped from that atmosphere. <br /> <br /> They are doing what I have done to our government. I call it Judas syndrome. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I also like that Jesus enjoyed the games and jokes with his disciples enjoying the simple pleasures. <br /> <br /> She was a very beautiful Jesus <br /> <br /> This is a watch over the movie. <br /> <br /> highly satisfying.
