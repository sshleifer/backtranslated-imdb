Truly true heroine, who turned around, was surprised by the ghibles and scared, wrestling with mattresses, running in closed doors ... only a few moments that blurred my memory in 'true' memory. I like what I liked about this show: Delicious Plat and some good supporter provided setting for the diamond display of the characters - as tea lennie, 'Nora Wild'; It's not surprising that Hollywood does not seem to know how to throw her away - cute, clownish, and amazing accidents-trends - how refreshing a actress can act. But where the oh-where is the DVD release? They are released (sleeping), it is incredible that this little jewel will continue to bury. (If someone is correct then correct me.)
