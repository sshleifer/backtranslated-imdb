Yes, I'm sitting here red, I reminded it almost two weeks ago that it was almost as guilty, when my wife wanted to look somewhat unexpected (relatively) "Mummy Direstic". <br /> <br /> How the appeal of "Batman and Robin" can be explained - I mean the only people who actually counted, Adam West and Bart Ward. It was a terrible show, with terrible plots and terrible acting - and, yes, it was awesome fun! And the same applies to the same "reunion" and "flashback" movies. Adam and Bart are invited to auction where the old Batmobile charity company is going to be sold. But it gets stolen, and our pals (like ourselves) drew their old character's personality (if not their clothes) and find out what has happened. They are reminded of the series, and we have seen how we came together in the flashbacks, Jack Bruyaar and Jason Merceden are playing with the TV series Adam Adams and Bart. It was quite interesting to get a little behind the scenes in the old series, and Adam and Birt just turned back to the character (although they were not actually characters - well, I want to see this to see you.) Julie Niemer and Frank Gorsin It was good <br /> <br /> If you are not a fan of the old series, you will hate this. If - heaven is forbidden - you really think Michael Keaton and George Clooney "Batmanas" are acceptable, but you'll hate even more. But if you grow up with Adam and Bart, and still accept that you did not miss a single episode - well, this is for you. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's true - 9/10
