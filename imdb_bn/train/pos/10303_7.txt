The story of Bruce Almighty Bruce Nolan, an average man who thinks God is hating his life. God confronts him and Bruce displays errors in his way. Of course, God's power might take a turn for the worse to give someone. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, like Jim Carey, always brings Morgan Freeman's first rate and plots to be correctly and correctly combined with God. Humor often targets, though sometimes they are a bit more beneficial to the facial expressions. I actually painted this picture to God, or even just as that black man. I think quite well, especially with the bright Freeman. There are some fun scenes, for example, the opening cookie scene, others miss the target a little but a good movie. 10/7 to 6/7
