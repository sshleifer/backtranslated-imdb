Excellent character development in a beautiful cooler milieu. Due to being a man, perhaps it did not fully understand, but they did a great job of establishing the forbidden Victorian environment from the beginning. It was not really as dark as it was and the treatment of women was probably even tougher. This is what is a wonderful chemistry between main characters. Each has their own "things" that they contend with. Once they come out of the rain and the spiders leave the web, they start communicating and gradually lose their sense of suspicion. What I've been enjoying about this movie is that it can not go comedy at a low cost. It does not try to pound a lesson in us. Those who feel stupid without intellect, are really nicely developed people who see light. I had very little trouble with the character of Alfred Molin, so epiphany was so fast, but this was to happen in this world. Some pretty well played well around all around the place of positive acceptance of people's lives.
