When I first appeared on television, I saw this version of "A Christmas Carol". I was actually notified when it was expected and it expected to see more movies than my expectations ranged up to. I am now buying DVDs and planning to watch it every year. Apart from "this is a wonderful life," I think this version of "Christmas Carol" is one of the best Christmas films ever made. George C Scott spanked and surrounded him with a fantastic cast led by Roger Reis! Scott again proves that he is one of the best actors of our time. Scott's artistic talent and abilities have no role to play and keep the character unique to himself. How can both Patan and Scugh be considered as? Scott makes it so easy. The instruction is a fine set, costume and music that gives the movie a special feeling of time, place and era. You just love this movie and keep it in your favorites to see in the holiday season.
