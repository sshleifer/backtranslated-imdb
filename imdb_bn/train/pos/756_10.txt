I have to tell, even though I despise such shock, shock horror, I am a girl, I think I have to express my opinion. I saw Dante Sanchez before seeing Jacques, and I'm going to cross Jacks for programming. Story lines and interviews are weaved creating a more interesting show. I saw a few minutes of Jacques film on the other night and I could not believe how bad it was gathered, everything was just a joke in a line of jokes with a relationship later. It should have been the fastest easy show ever to perform, occasionally amateur. While eating ponds, I do not care, as long as a significant entertainment goes out, Dunti Sanchez goes out of the Jacques league.
