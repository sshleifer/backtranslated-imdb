In the 1950s and 60's, the great biblical epics contained the size and the glory. But this is probably the first time that the Bible characters themselves make humans human. The best thing about it is that it does not diminish in viewers. This is a unique and compulsory balance that helps us to realize that even great people like David are defective people to find their faith and glory to face their flaws. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Hayward is his best in this film. At home here its pretty truthful but bigger than the acting style of life here at home She never seductress, but she plays the role in this way that you sympathize with her. <br /> <br /> Ramm Masses does a great job as Nathan Nabi. When I first saw the movie, Auntie seemed to think that she really talked to the Lord and had a great view. There is no doubt always the amazing music collected by the amazing Alfred Newman, who has succeeded in other Bible epics like "The Robbie" and "The Great Story Over Toll" and probably 100 other movies! Lyon Shamroo's film is well-received and is associated with size but the gestation of the movie Hillary King, who truly built herself like a film director, William Wyler, did not bury herself in the grave, she had gathered many generations of life, which never lost the story of love through a deep struggle with David and Bathsheba and David's beliefs. In God The journey to this movie could have been very haughty, but the king kept all kinds of real and interesting. Plus we can not lose the sense of mystery about trying to understand the will of God, just as David himself struggled at the same time. From the first scene where the soldier died trying to save the ship from death. David is not pleased with Nathan's answer, (in paragraph), no one can understand God's will. On this journey we start with the end of the powerful end where WW is finally faced with myself. <br /> <br /> Finally, this film is wonderful as King David who belong to Gregory Pack. His David is a man who can believe that you can rule a country in a foolish way, but he was once a trusted psalmist. This is one of his best performances. <br /> <br /> I can not see this movie on television, but when I see it, I will never fail. I think it still holds up very well
