This, and the "secret castle" to me is the most beloved curious. I do not miss out on a 10-millimeter, but it must be deserved, if there is anything. Although it was quite a long (mostly of Kurosawa), it has surrendered to its contemporaries, which makes me bother with most of the movies; The storyline is often very loose and gradually growing, without any real purpose describing the scenes or character, containing too unnecessary or just lenghtened scenes. Dodsocaden gave me a similar experience, for example "the secret fortress"; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the description of the character than the story, I have seen it as compared to any other Kurosawa-film. It puts a lot of pressure on dialogue, which he uses brilliantly (especially his story between father and son "new house" plans). <br /> <br /> The thing that still makes this an excellent composition is why it is so tragic that, at any time, it can be described humanly and sympathetically without any fingers at all. From the beginning to the end it tears the entire mental scale from perfect balance to smile.
