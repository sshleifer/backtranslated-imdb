I saw two days ago and today I saw two parts. Of course, two parts make the world different, so I have seen that I laugh a little. I thought about the inevitability of Che's death; For me, it's the whole movie cloud. I think that Soderberg wanted us to feel, gradually increasing inevitability of his death. Part two was relatively poor, again an inevitable, but it was positive in Cuba and it was very negative in Bolivia. The politics of movement in Bolivia appears only, but rarely is actually the face. Memorable scenes for me were at the end of the film: Conflicts with fishermen and light talk with Bolivian government officials, where government questions about the failure of farmers to support the revolution, Che. I did not consider national differences as being the role they played, Argentina vs Bolivian. I think Soderberg treated gratitude with the inevitable problems of supply in revolutionary struggle; How do you get food without opposition to farmers who do not suffice yourself. I thought how difficult it would be to try it by che. I guess it's all about time; There is enough anger against the government at the beginning of the movement; Not in Bolivia. At the beginning of the film, the letter written by Fidel to the Fidel realized the terrible corruption of the revolutionaries: if not now, 50 years from now. A very thought provoking and well-worked film; Make all efforts to see it.
