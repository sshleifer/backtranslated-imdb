One of the happiest collections of the Lugosi collections on recent occasions is to see colorful movies like invisible movies. Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi emerged on a film that spread to meteors and radiation, and the science is completely illogical (especially using camera strategy carlops, such as Johns Rook, to determine a particular meteorite site) and is quite ridiculous. The movie is thoroughly enjoyable because it does not care at lease. The effect is done well for the time, the acting is great, and the finish is particularly strong. It reminds me of the pop-sky comics and novels from 1940s and 50s, which are full of ray guns and ridiculous science. You will see this movie!
