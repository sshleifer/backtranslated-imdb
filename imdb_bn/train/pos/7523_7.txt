I saw this movie at the 2006 Palm Springs International Film Festival and it is not a movie, and it is not a film since it was clearly shot by Habee on her cable network in a short time later this year. This film presents a page as a slavery and discipline fetish pinup and B & D stag film actress, which had enough talent to become a real actress. The page was slightly more than that and had some other role models of model modeling, but the 50's pin icon was not enough to handle the carrier. This image is supposed to be based on Richard Foster's "The Real Betty Page" book. Black and white shot for the 1950's Nostalgia feeling I have a book called "Betty Page The Life of the Pinup Legend" which makes the career of the page a Chronic, and I must say that the film is reproduced in film with Grutchann Mole, many of these famous films are correct. Betty Page Matches itself with Black Wig and Brown Context Lenses. She does not just have the look of the Betty Page, but her personality smiles and features came in through the camera perfectly. And its body is as close to a replica of the page as possible. Awesome cast The story is thin and tabloidesque kind and certainly can be much better. But it's a pretty good tv movie. I'll rate it at 7.0's scale of 7.0 and recommend it when it comes to TV.
