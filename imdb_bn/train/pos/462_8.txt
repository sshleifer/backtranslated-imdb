"Luzin Defense", in the foreground, is a story of a bluish chess savant (Torrto) that has been created by flashbacks in the background, her childhood life and the army, which she has created. His love interest (Watson) and ex-"counselor" (Wilson) vary in good and bad cases and you have a fierce drama and Italian drama mixed with comedy and rich beautiful scenes mixed with cute and delicately humorous moments of high chess game intensity. This is an excellent film for the dramas for the time being, a hint of fine fineness behind the metaphor for the miraculous joy of sporting automobiles.
