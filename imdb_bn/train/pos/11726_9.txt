When my sister said that the movie would be good, I had a second thought but I saw it and it was actually fun. Basically this movie produces a strange girl, which goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and read her ants so that she can go. But all of that is not that easy. In this movie you will come across ridiculous humor, a witch, a book of spell / recopies, a mentally challenged uncle and a dog. Since you understand the meaning of the word fqq, I hope you run it properly and try to find out the old movie. I hope you like it fairly I'll give it 0 ... or I'm mixing it completely ill. 9 I hope you laugh, you scream and you're just bored. <br/> <br /> <br /> Love your love: Dakota, if you can email me at Dakota_ loves_it @ hot mail.com
