For those who engage in the mystery of their killing, it can be seen, because it is shining with striking and suspicious characters, most of them are the wealthy Long Island social kind. As a star detective, William Powell was alternately starky and inspired, sometimes as he and his case went to the cleaners and put them together. Mary Astor is very nice here. <br /> <br /> Powell has been playing out of the main character Filo Vance in a series of films made in a few studios for several years. Among these films, he occasionally became somewhat obnoxious with romantic lead, sometimes the gentleman wrote the gangster's role. Already middle-aged, this one came along when he was stuck somewhat in a career route. It was like a starter so early, it seemed that his time had passed and he was primarily good for depression-era films, but with the changing times he was probably very mature and painful to endure. The Kylel Murdere Case, the last of the "Old Pavels", directed by the criminally neglected Michael Cartridge, will be the Herald of the new thriller next year, whose success will be catapult to its leading players in the Hollywood Stratosphere. In Kenyay we can still watch movies in some harsh, ritualized pattern, because the camera is not running much, acting, presenting, moving towards the theater. There is no harm to this procedure, though, which is his charms. It gives the movie a baroque quality.
