Man, I really loved the new DVD that made Universal out. I have not seen this good look at SENTINEL, I had to keep up with crappy, grainy VHS tape for years. Unfortunately there is no additional beyond a trailer that looks quite bad for wear. And enjoy goodtime DVDs all the time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It keeps a portal and Vatican in hell to keep an eye on it and keep the old dungeon (John Carabin) to ensure that the Devil and the archives do not escape. Awa Gardner, Arthur Kennedy, Jos√© Ferrer, etc. This film has a complete role of old-time actors ... alongside the upcoming 80s star Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum (who was mysteriously overdubbed) and Tom Berenger And you do not even know Jerry Orbach from law and order. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the devil And there is a clear ending where the defamed people are attempting to rush Alison to commit suicide, so he can not secure the next portal. It seems that Allison's boring past makes him the main candidate to become the next Vatican candidate. <br /> <br /> Michael Winner's excellent, unclear 70 seconds will not miss the classic. I recommend for those who want something a bit fantastic beyond normal stupid teenager slashhers and horror comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
