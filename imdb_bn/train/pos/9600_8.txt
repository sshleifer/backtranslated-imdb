This movie is a sensitive story about an adventure by the 15-year-old Darius Weems. Darius's Disseni mascular disorder, still irregular disease, which took the life of her brother at the age of nineteen and the United States child number one killer. He and some close friends travel to the country to Los Angeles to customize his wheelchair at MTV's Pump My Ride. The journey started in Georgia, where Daria grew and never traveled. The gang head is a trip to the West that will not forget its participants. Darius went on a boat for the first time, traveling in a hot air balloon, swimming in the ocean and visiting the sights, he always wanted to look like the Grand Canyon and New Orleans. Here the film makers clearly have a mental connection to the material. They make no money from $ 20 DVD sales. $ 17 goes towards researching the disease and making more copies of $ 3. This movie has won more than 25 awards in festivals and I agree with the quote given by Variety, "Something specific to reducing the heart".
