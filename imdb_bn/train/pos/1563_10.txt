I like this episode. It's so big that all 5 groups have been raised and Lutherk closed orp and saved the world. I love this episode because Kyle Gallner (Bart Allen / Imps) and Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen / Green Arrow) are guests! I hope Clark joins the Justice League and we will follow this group of heroes around the world !! =) It was really exciting and the audience kept interested in what would happen next. I think that Charlotte will also have to join the Watchtower, which will be a good thing for the daily plane as well as it does not have super power. Also, I want to know what kind of things Lex is going to use for 33.1, I want to know what other people in the world are doing!
