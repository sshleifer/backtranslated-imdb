Another picture of this movie is yet to be found in the sweet boxer. I am not sure why this expression was to show the child mullah *** ion and g * y concepts to the Indian film audiences, but I was really somewhat disgusted in those scenes! What's new This is a nice piece with the designer, where he sees the story of an entertainment reporter managed by the famous film, Mr. and the leading lady of Mrs. Aae. What makes this movie different, it also adds to the story of those people that the reporter contacted him or with his friends, such as his room, his colleagues, movie star, model, rich person and others featured on the entertainment entertainment page <br /> < br /> Note: Mrs. Aire has another good performance. She could be targeted for this role. She plays the electoral role but shines among them. She is apparently outstanding and less beautiful in this movie. But then, entertainment journalists do not want to carry their covered people, do not they? Roy: Madhur came with another good movie, which brings neatly social problems. However, this movie has lost focus and is not sure what a director is trying to convey. <br /> <br /> Is he trying to show the glitzy and glamor of our rich people? Or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainer reporter and against the real crime reporter's life? Is he talking about our government and the rich people governing the press? Or he is trying to explain the problem with misuse of children and G * E. Other concepts have arisen, which will go to sleep with new female directors or co-stars, if they want to enter Bollywood, include ineffective rules. <br /> <br /> as well as flight supporters are sick and tired. After some time, they got married for a lot of jobs and for taking extreme measures. She told the rich families with disgruntled women and rich children. <br /> <br /> It was okay for me .. But maybe it's very difficult for average cinema-gear, who wants to eliminate some pressure from day to day work
