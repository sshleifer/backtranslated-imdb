Like all other critics, this film has been a constant in my mind after 30 years. I'm going to the library to study this story about what I can do. I wrote a PBS station for more information. Despite all this, I could find out that in the early 1900's it was printed on a newspaper. <br /> <br /> A few years after the ebay search in First, Weekly Week 2002 On the basis and there was a VHS copy of the movie. There was another bargain but I was determined to win this movie. The losing bargain requested me to make a copy which I gave him. Despite the ownership of a copy, I still search and search finally find a site that sells a DVD copy of the movie.
