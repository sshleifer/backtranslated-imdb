<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Excellent wonderful welding is incredible. Philip Camu Hoffman is putting an outstanding performance and he is electrifying everytime he is on the screen. Ethan Huq joins the scene for a scene, and Albert Finne just shakes the screen. Marisa Tomomi, however <br /> <br /> The script is excellent, the story line is non-linear but easy to follow is easy to follow. Sydney Lumeet, though not known for its blockbusters, has become a jewel with this one!
