Normally I do not like Ama Roberts, but after seeing the Nancy Drook my mind changed. The whole thing of the movie actor made exciting and fun. Most of the time when you see a mystery movie you can solve it in the middle of the show, but in this movie you are really like it. Finally, it is necessary to be consistently consistent until the burden of the whole crime. I still amazed to find it. The whole film was really cute and those who saw it with me also liked the movie. The clothes were my favorite parts of the movie, it was very tricky. I do not think this would be a movie more like sequel comes up. I do not think it's a good thing because the popular girls really did not seem to have exactly the part, but they still smile to me. It was really a great movie and a great mystery. I definitely recommend watching it
