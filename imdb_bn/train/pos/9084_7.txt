Yes, some people said that this movie was a waste of money, but I'm dying of such a hard dragon / world-end / Holy Craft action movie fan. <br /> <br /> But if you go from it to my stand this movie movie was something good was good point was good. But the kind of movie that was spreading right at the right time, or just when the evil happened, it could save them right now. Although there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie, which surprised me. <br /> <br /> 3D graphics were pretty good. I had great meaning for this kind of 3D effects !!!! Live up whatever the big fight movie that was shown in the trailer. In the end there was a fight between good and bad, I used to say that it could be a little better, it was still quite good. <br /> <br /> Now the parts I think could have been good. . The part that led to the big part started was pretty good at showing. I mean, if you do not want to see in theaters, but at least it is a DVD ... <br /> I like the movie as a whole, but the plot starts enjoying quickly. Just fit well tougher.
