Mixed reviews got this, I did not expect too much, and were pleasantly surprised. It is a very entertaining small criminal film with striking characters, excellent screenplay, not a glitch, and it's a good speed writing. It looks very good, a terrible way. Apparently people like this movie or just hate it and I like it.
