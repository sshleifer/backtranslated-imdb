Well, I think I'm going to go against this crop in this film. Having a self-admitted horror fan is smart enough to let me sit on this up. After 2 or 3 minutes I was actually afraid of myself (quite rare). The film is likely to have a small budget and sets around the charging cross station, but the story of lack of films is not deviated from the story. Yes the story has been brought a little bit and does not explain itself very well, but the cripple can slash and break anything that comes in its class. Message for girls !!! You have to close your eyes in some parts of the film or your legs will have to cross the lowest !! You will understand when you see it. <br /> <br /> All is a good film well and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that scares in fact
