Next film of Chech and Ching (1980), Chechen Marin and Tommy Chang were the other films to be played in a loving pair. Favorite smoker smokers are now roommates. They are looking for ways to score more smoke in a smelly building and just keep it all day long. But Cheech is "responsible" one. She has a job and a steady girlfriend. One day, Cheek wanted to get rid of him, so he tried to get out of the house. Another problem is that Cheich's brother "Red" (Chechen has another role) is in town and wants to hang with him. It seems that one stone could kill two birds, Cheech Cheng of and Red. What kind of events will happen in Chong and Red? Will Cheech get his freak? How long will smoke without smoke? Just check out the next film of Cheyech and Chang !! <br /> <br /> Conducting the governing regime for Tommy Chong Signal. He got some experience while doing some undesirable work in Smoki in UP. Funny but not as good as the first film. But Cheech and Chang fans will enjoy it. Followed by Nise Dreams. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
