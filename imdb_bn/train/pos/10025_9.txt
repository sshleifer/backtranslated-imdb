It has never been seen that two styles have to be a unique twists. Genie giant movie section with living mummy movie section. This unique blend makes for a unique and compelling story. Cast is outstanding, with Tom Basel as far as I know I have never been in horror movies before. The effect is impressive and a cool one of the giant mummy ideas filled with small mummies. My one complaint, I just saw more than the demon mummy, but the other because I think they did a great job. Dialogue, characters and stories were perfect. Acting was astonishing. It's got to be the best movie to get out of this impressive channel. You've heard, the best movie to come out of Science Finance. I out of 9 out of 9 out of the balls
