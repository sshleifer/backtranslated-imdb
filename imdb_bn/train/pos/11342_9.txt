I used to watch Pufnstuf watch every weekend at the age of 10. It was okay after Bay City Roller. I saw it coming to the family channel one day, and tapped it for my three-year old daughter. I will forget all that I liked as a child, magic sune, zoom broom, witchchip makeup. <br /> <br /> This show is the perfect low technology. The mayor is surely the example of Mayor McCase, and everyone is a stuff animal with annoying Google eyes. But kids love these things. They see a sock doll work rather than the way, rather than a guy sitting in front of high-tech computer animation. There are (slim) slapstick, but no adult theme as sex or people killed, and kids accept Jimmy's schemes. The children think they carry a bag of smoke and they will be healed to satisfy someone burnt to their home fire and I liked that when my daughter saw the jet stream in the sky, she thought that Wiechipu was flying. Music is old, but you really use it, and my girl really likes it. He used the song "Difficult, different solo" in the car. My daughter watched this event at least once for at least 5 months and it is still her darling <br /> <br /> I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 works. I really hope they will try to keep the old taste and computer-animating characters do not do anything else. I think the whole new generation will love Pfnff.
