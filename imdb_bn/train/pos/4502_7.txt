I have seen all the movies of Cynthia Rothrak, and this is the most interesting for me. It reminds me of the first Jackie Chan movie. Of course, M. Rothrakk can not be the greatest actress, but like a martial artist and very intelligent young girl, she is very good to see. This picture was probably the best but not the best of all of his films.
