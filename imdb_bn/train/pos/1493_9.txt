I think Mushfiq has written nicely. It's not just about entertainment. I think there are some fine messages that are trying to bring Yasmin. And yes, it might be a bit confusing to you (especially if you do not see SEPAT and / or GUBA for 76 times). <br /> <br /> I have seen how well they use the characters in the first two films? Its character really relates how intact is related. That's the prostitute that is a fool like a neighbor. And snooker pads become a future wife of religious and intellectual wife in the future. <br /> <br /> and I love the voice-over absolutely. Its owed still awakeningly fresh. It sounds like, when they took a shot from the Ramah Tampangan Gamin signboard, suddenly Mashusin's voice was saying 'Bismillahirammaniriram' (the scene when he was on top of the tree). <br /> <br /> It has captured Malaysian attitude (and some lightly, how sniggering it is kind in illustrations). For example, even the kids may even be really sharp-tongued (complete with shrill boring voice) and all the movies can be a long bad face ppl. And how you can be so busy and talk about people, when your own life is not sorted. <br /> <br /> I can say that if this movie does not go beyond my expectations, then my expectations are fully reached. <br /> <br /> This made me glue on the screen, even I could not even close my eyes. Do not even make movies out. Haha
