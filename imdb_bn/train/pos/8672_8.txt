The WWE's last PPV of 2006 was able to hit fans, but for one reason only the stairs were set against Paul and London and Brian Kendrick for William Rigal and Dave Taylor. But recently in December PPP December, WWE knew that fans had to do something to talk about again, after rendering MNM and Hardy Boyz in the mix, it became effective and declared that the match is going to be the stairs match <br /> <br /> The match was cruel and I was one of the best Sydney games, but Joey Mercury's face was pretty bad. Johnny Nietro did not even test his partner, he did it in a way that did not happen, and Taylor and Regal did nothing in the match without being hurt by some stairs. Finally, the London and the centerpiece titles were held. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, listening to Kann MVP in a fictitious Norfolk match while firing a fool's idol in the fire. Chris Benoit defeated Chevro Gere in a good match, defeating Gregory Hales to host Jimmy Wang Young to defeat the WWE Cruiserweight title. <br /> <br /> The main event was the total message, the grouping with King Booker Finley and the army of Batista. This action was frustrating and Bautista did not take any care of who chose for her mate. <br /> <br /> Overall results: Cain defeats MVP in a hell match. <br /> <br /> Tag Team Championship against Hardy Boyz, MNM and David Taylor and William Rigal in Paul London and Brian Kendreck WWE title matches. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gregory Hales defeated hostage hostage Wang Young to maintain the Cruiserweight Championship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Threw. <br /> <br /> Overall grade - B.
