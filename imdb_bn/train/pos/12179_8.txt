When I flipping the channel I saw this movie some days ago. My expectations were not too high but it was an interesting movie. In 'Ga Gay Thing', starring Jason Lee Paul, who is going to marry his boyfriend Karen (Selma Blair) directly and plays Seattle-based colleague Paul. Middle class is an unchallenging life of domestic. We first meet Paul at his Bachelor party, where he does not express his desire about any kind of normal bachelor party (surprisingly some) encourages friends, if he is a bit naughty and is upset with her soon to be in trouble. And the conflict Of course, Paul knows the next thing, in the morning after night he is lying on the bed with a nude dancer and his mother-in-law phone tells him that Karen is on his way. Oh, and hula dancer Karen's cousin Bakey (Julia Styles). <br /> <br /> This little root of a potential problem increases a strong oak of deadly suffering, just as Paul is trying to refrain from being mistreated, he is a durable, family-based person, who is extremely excited about his upcoming nuptials What happens when the look is kept up. Because of his effort to keep any knowledge of any possible wrongdoing on his behalf, his efforts have kept him closely surrounded by Paul in a fascinating loving Beqia and asked him whether he really wants his life to be mapped for him. . There is a real mix of movie comedy and romance. Of course a clock value.
