Ralph Bakhshi is another fantasy favorite! After watching it on YouTube. Set in the distant past after the Ice Age, it is a pre-historic sword-and-sorcery search in good and evil. The King of Icecream and his mother Quinn Juliana, Nikon, established their views on the conquest of the known world. When their Glascier destroys a village named Larna, he (Loron) pledges to take revenge of his people and kill the ice lord. Meanwhile, Neckner and the small erosion of the sub-continent of the Juliana region led to the capture of Prince Tigre, the pregnant daughter of King Jarol of Firipe; But he managed to escape, and finally meet Larne, who pledged to bring him back to the firequoids; If the sub-people find them first. <br /> <br /> This movie worked at a very small box office (mostly in Ralph Bakhshi's film), but it has become a classic classic, partly a collaboration between art, Ralph Bakhshi and famous fantasy artist Frank Fraser. Also, I have heard that the script written by Gary Conway and Roy Thomas was portrayed by Kannon comic book stories and background painters, including Dinerpiece novelist James Gurney; Although I did not read Canaan or Dunopopia. Artist Thomas Kinnakad is famous for the painting of The Bradford Exchange Company as well as the Magazine painting. And like the movie Bukshi's The Lord of the Rings and American Pop, this movie was RotScoped, but the film did better than the former movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this is the best animated fantasy films ever made, and extraordinary collaboration between two great minds - Ralph Bakhshi and Frank Frazzeta. With lots of imagination, sex inexperienced, and thrilling adventure
