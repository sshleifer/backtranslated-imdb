I can not see any point while burying a movie like a sulfuric quiz, when it is not intended to do anything more than a car for children to entertain and they are prepared for the next line to get mad. <BR> <br /> This is a fun movie. My kids sit quietly and choose every minute for the whole thing. Guessed, Villenea is a bit at the top with its ornate costume and mental sunny, but a lot more easy to take than the dark, depressed, and very morbid Pokemon 3. <br /> <br /> I have kids since Pok√©mon has been watching since they started and they are soon going to the age where they will "throw things away" and others will leave. I'm glad we enjoyed this together.
