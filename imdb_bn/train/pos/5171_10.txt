If I could go back, even as an adult and spent the summer camp in my summer camp ... I used to stay there very fast. The camp that I went to was not great either. They were in Texas, where actually the people of mosquitoes stopped, but our horses and fish were catching. The movie cinematography was wonderful, the characters are fun and credible, especially the Parkins, Pollack and Arkin. Sam Raimi's character and theorem was invaluable. So those who thought this movie was lam ... I have great sorrow because they can not postpone their mistrust as long as they can not imagine camp life as old or they never go like kids. The whole thing was that these people had an opportunity to come back and become young and so they worked on every opportunity. I think I can. It's funny, intelligent, well-written, brilliantly throwing and the artist takes me back, so I just want to watch over for the scene. Dances with Salta Wallace and Ladyhawk ... good movies but desert actors become as much character. Rent it, see it, buy it and watch it over over ... old. ; 0)
