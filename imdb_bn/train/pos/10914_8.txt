I saw the Thin Man series - Powell and Laure are definitely great, but in this storm some sweet about Powell and Arthur's chemistry. He saw Powell, Gene Arthur. There is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing among them. There is no sense of Thin Man series in this film, but it can be solved by creating a charm for it. I saw it, I'm sure Powell was taking off-screen relationship with Arthur. My friends are thinking the same This is a movie where I want to be able to go back on time (to prevent lips and to prevent lips)! The memories of his favorite players seem to have no end! The closest thing to Powell's character, Lawrence Bradford, perhaps the "perfect man". All right, this is a very sounding way, but I can not help myself.
