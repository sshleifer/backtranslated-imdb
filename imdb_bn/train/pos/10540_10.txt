I agree with TaxiMeter that it should be seen by a superb movie and a wider audience. Visual visualization, visual interpretation of scripts, humorous continuously surprising. Two Lead is great and really carries the film. My suggestion will not be seen in the trailer, just rent the movie and watch without expectations. I rent from Blockbuster, so it is easily available in Brisbane, not everyone will enjoy it, but I think most people will have opinions and it will always be good, until it was just 'stupid'. I like this picture, you just do not see the jewel like this every day. This should be a cult favorite. Try it, I can feel the same way about it.
