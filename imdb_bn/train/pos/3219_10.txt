This is a very nice movie. It's a captivating story, an awesome main character, very well played and killer action. It is mostly held in 2036, but shows scenes over the last few years to explain the stories. <br /> <br /> The story is done very well and there is no hole. Curt Russell Tod, a Soldar who was trained to be murdered from birth and did not live normal life like other soldiers. Finally the military introduced new, small, fast and powerful soldiers. Jason Scott Lee is one of them. As a result, older soldiers like Todd have no need for them. Rasel was wounded in the war, he thought he fought with his old soldiers and examined the new soldiers. The army rebukes his body and some others, and thinks they are all dead, but they do not understand that Russell is alive. <br /> <br /> Tod has found a camp filled with civilization that the military dumped him. For a while he lives there but can not adjust to normal life. He rarely said a word and he is sometimes very aggressive towards other people. When they think that he is dangerous for them, they send him into the desert. <br /> <br /> Just like Russell's new soldiers left this planet. To train army-forgotten soldiers, training was done as Tod and other old soldiers. So these new soldiers are faster and stronger than Tod's, Todd exposes them easily. The military started this perception and Todd killed one of their all men but was one. That's Jason Scott Lee and in the end you see a classic war scene between Russell and Scott Lee. Russell evidently came upstairs. <br /> <br /> It's one of the best action movies I've seen and I've seen a lot of things. You can ask for a film with some great lines that have all of this. The author also did not forget that Russell had never seen a woman before, even calling women "Sir". There is no hole in this film, there is a purpose every minute and it is very entertaining. <br /> <br /> A great action action film for fans of Rambo, Commando and Missing In Action This is highly recommended for fans of Kurt Russell fans and the action / sci-fi fans.
