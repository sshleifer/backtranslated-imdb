If you want to remember the MJ, it's a good place to start. This movie contains sweet melody, MJ Robot, and a crazy, messed up plot. I think, in many nights, this exquisite feature of college is coming out of the film and anyone who decided to take this ridiculous piece to green light, its grandparents <br /> <br /> <br /> There are so many songs. Dance a lot There are singing during dance. MJ slays you would expect when it comes to this element. But there is more to this movie. There is claymation. There are fat children (soil). There is an astronomy rabbit that Michael Jackson had to fight in a dance (probably Matio). There are Joe Peso (not made of clay) <br /> <br /> Rip- we love you Michael! This is a sad day for us.
