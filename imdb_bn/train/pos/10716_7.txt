I am seeing it in the Star World network abroad which has bought the Americas and Canadian series, which is the last one or two seasons that Zen Shaw has purchased. I think how much female lead comedy shows I'm really able to keep an eye on my own, there's Lucky, Boytchad, I'm a dream gene (one with Barbara Feldman), and then my mind can not think otherwise, the women are not to lead the role of all support . So for me, Jane is a pretty good company. One thing I just thought though though. I have seen a number of things in Canada, and hear anything in a regular TV series that I do not show snow! It's been made in summer height, LLL! This is a great place to live according to the climate in the summer, but you think, in the winter, Canada will show a little bit, since there are lifestyle partners in there. I mean, SCTV, it seems to laugh only, two comedy shows have been seen which have been prolonged in Canada and very few or none shoots with ice, even though they both make an outdoor shot. I am frustrated, but I have seen my views on Jane and his obviously liberal way of being accused of racism against his neighbor, and I like the dirty guy and his madness, I saw it in conformity with a UK series called I Think. Office Comedy with a female lead. In no way is the best comedy, but one person is not saying that he can see it alone, whatever he says. If I am with my wife, it can really enjoy because it enjoys things like sexual relations and things like that, which can be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 10 of 7
