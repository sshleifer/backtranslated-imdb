If you are a purist, do not waste your time - otherwise, hold on your hat and enjoy adventure. I liked the Stewart Ganger / Deborah Care version - I saw it several times, but this movie is completely different, very different. I do not know the difference details because it will ruin the film. Also, again delighted to see Alison Dougie (I'm a huge Indiana Jones fan), Patrick Swayze Quatermain as well, and supporting Cast Pretty. I found the quality of cast supporting the hallmark production trademarks and the film was no exception. Cinematography is fantastic and score perfect. If you are looking for entertainment, you will not be disappointed.
