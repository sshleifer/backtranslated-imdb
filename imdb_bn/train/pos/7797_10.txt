"Rudy in Paradise" is a beautiful story, a young story from Ravi Lee Lee Missing, who is going to protect herself from her roots roots. Although the title character is gorgeous by Ashley Jod - perhaps the role of his first film, though some may be proud - emphasizing "Someone" is not going to be the next Madonna (Jesus' mother or lurid, attention-hungry singer). <br /> <br /> It instead emphasizes the engagement of the following people and being somewhat introspective about them, is an ideal, adult self. Note: This is not an action movie !!! While writing it in his journal, sometimes using voice-over description (by Miss Zad) - oh, I saw I lost readers half readers here. But be patient with this beautiful movie, where we know that his happiness can be discovered - oh, I do not know, cut wood by carrying water. <br /> <br /> KnightLay, actor, co-star of Ruby Lee's extraordinary love interest in Todd Field, who played Nick, "Aye Wide Shot", who helped him to heal his ideas about the relationship related to young people Do it. <br /> <br /> But his character is not the answer to Ruby Lee: there is no external hero to be fired on him. The final message we are responsible for ourselves. Writer / director Victor Nunze, who wrote / directed "Ulei Gold", has done a great job by showing a young woman growing up in front of herself - facing the old challenge of running well. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I can hear the first few songs of that song, tears pouring in my eyes, Pavelovian and banned - if it is not sure whether it is music, or the silence of the film, the charming message of cruelty Continuous connection of the system. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended for any young person to try to find his way. For any woman of any age, it must be seen! Downward: It's not a DVD, except Spanish. (We know that creating a copy of the VHS version is valid, which is easily available online. My favorite husband found someone with VHS copy and got a DVD copy for me.) Even though it's a treasure movie occasionally popped up on the wind ?? An indie channel, usually ?? You can not rely on the world to put pressure on it when it might be most needed as a tonic. So buy a copy for yourself. <br /> <br /> This movie should again be a big release, and if I were a Hollywood queen. <br /> <br /> - Figgy Jones
