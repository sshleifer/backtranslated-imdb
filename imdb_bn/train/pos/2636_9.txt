The Lion King series is easily the main achievement in Disney Animation. The real lion king is the best skill in the cell animation. Lion King 2: Simba's Pride is BY FAR, the best direct-to-video seagull that Disney, or any other studio has created for an animated feature. It deserves release to a theater. This movie can be called the same. It's original cast, songs by Alton John, a ridiculous story, exciting action, and touching the moment of character. Everything you come to expect from this series. Not a new story, but Timon and Pumba and their stories filler and enhanced backgrounds. What influenced me most, is taken care of the animation. Always, Disney Shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts. But here, they dilute new animations with footage from the original film. The scene does not seem to find the place. Nathan Lane and Arnie Sabella are doing full swing as Timon and Pumba. Matthew Broderick, Robert Gillam and Mira Kelly rebuilt their role as Simba, Rafiqi and Nala respectively. We came back to Hyundai Goldberg and Chech Marin. There is a lot of laughter in this movie. So if you love lion king, you need this movie. The story is not complete without it.
