Elmer Fudd is lounging on his simple chair and comic book, his dog is sleeping in front of a fireplace. All peaceful until it comes to bouncing by a flea. (Shrimps are decorated in a farmer's style with a large Sambrarro, and it carries a group called "a fly"). He finds out his telescope and marks the dog. (We saw bigger shots of dog butt and sensational screaming, "T-bone!" Shouting, "There is food around the corner, there is food around the corner!") <br /> <br /> This poor dog pain is a tricky-but -Now flea story set-up Mutt ridiculous as he responds flea. <br /> <br /> Drawing his huge tooth, kissing on the right side of the shifting, the dog and the dog's cheeks laugh me a couple of times. This is a funny cartoon which I sometimes saw! Poor poop, threatened with dinners, as stupid flea responds when he causes pain. It's almost painful to use shrimp as a picax, jackhammer, and dog. He keeps the dog behind the crack It is cruel!
