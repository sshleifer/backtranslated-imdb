My father grew up as George Superman as Superman and when I was a young boy, I had a VHS episode and let me see this movie with them (if you want them in the family) and I like it. <Br /> <br /> Clarke Kent and Lois Lane have sent a small town, and mole people with oil mines and mines are radioactive and the city is considered to be deadly and it is considered to be suppressing the fights to stop the fights. <br /> <br /> It is very surprising and fun to see. Special effects and sound of the old style - crew pulled off such a beauty with such small technology. George Reeves When I was young, my hero was, and now 16 years old, it shows how timeless and classic these events are.
