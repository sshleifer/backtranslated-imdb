This movie is basically much better than the original versions. Trips can look pretty cool but their walking and death may have been better. The action scene was really cool. Walking ... Walking ... Walking ... Walking !!! O my God, please stop walking or I'm going to kill myself. The thunderstorm's baby scene was my favorite order because of the fact that a ship tipped the tips. Good movies I recommend it for people to read books. The music is remarkable and the director's cut looks pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Professional. Cool animosity trips and 99% good soundtracks of book management machines <br /> <br /> <br /> Some bad acting looks in London, Chess
