At the first 10 years of age, I watched the movie channel, Martin Day, and still remembered the impact on my life. If any other film touches me, touching me, and closing my eyes. <br /> <br /> I saw it for the first time, I can not find it anymore. I used to ask about it and nobody ever heard of this picture! I think it was one of the rare films that many people did not know, because nobody and I had no meaning, I knew what I was saying. I search and search throughout the year, scan the video store shelves and checking cable tv list, but always short up. Finally, in 1996 I found that I can order a special order, I did it, and probably it was at least 50 times - and it still sings to me. <br /> <br /> Martin Starkert, a man who is in prison (but in fact a good man), who is interested in bringing him back to the special lake where he grew up as a boy It was a special place, where he lived a life of nature, spent time with a dog and was alone to enjoy life. Soon he ran in the movie and started the way back to the lake. <br /> <br /> The police did not find it long ago, and Strict police took the child as a hostage to force the police to force. Close Soon Starkart and his hostage (Martin Martin II) became the best friends, and together there are many funny adventures - a toy truck from looting, high-jacking a train, on the way to this special lake. <br /> <br /> Throughout the film, Starkert has a very big flashback in the lake as a boy. <br /> <br /> I will not destroy for you, but I will tell you, this film must be seen. This is the best movie of my life ever! I am the biggest fan of this movie without any doubt! I found out the song that two singers sang across the entire movie ("I'm going back, where do I come from ... ...) I plan to travel to Canada even to see the lakes and cottages where Martin's day has dried" Crazy, I know - But that movie is so meaningful to me.
