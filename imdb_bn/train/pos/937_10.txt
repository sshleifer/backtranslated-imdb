When it was pre-circulated in 1984, my wife and I tapped it on our first VHS recorder. I still have that aging tapes, which I try to see annually This was my first child's birth year, and this avatar reminds you of the delightful memories from a Christmas carol - this image spends several hours playing in the background. I finally broke this year and gave a DVD order, which gave me some time to write this brief reaction at the moment. Charles Dickens' story is caught in outstanding fashion here. George C Scott is absolutely amazing and credible as Scrooge. Supporting cast is equal to spectacular. This, my mind, is a flawless production. Add a lot of joy to the little story Game "Similes" is a delicious item to play wife with the nephew of Scrooge and their party guests. (Since I've rebuilt my high school English students as a brief vacation from the class work!) Actually, I enjoyed the experience of having more than CBS production, but I can think of some ways of entertainment myself, which was originally done by IBM. Sponsor (Incidentally, it is interesting to see the old tape with the original IBM adverts ... which shows how advanced computers have been in 21 years. Surprising how things have changed!) The following line: A timeless story of a Christmas carol, and it's a timeless presentation Classic. Enjoy ... and God bless us, everyone!
