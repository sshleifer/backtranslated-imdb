I did not set too high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. The story is sometimes a little weird but overall I think it has an acceptable credibility. The action scene is rather beautiful and accompanying music used to awaken ordinary patriotic feelings in American films. It may not be the best movie sometimes but it is unusual for Sweden and I hope to see more similar topics in the future.
