This is a very unusual movie that does not show the top billing star half literally. Yet I was involved in the hook of the Phantom Lady. Although Curtis is capable of being a false accuser Scott Henderson, he may be sympathetic to him (maybe he could have his torch removed) and at the same time his behavior should be at least at the absolute level of his innocence. There was a problem with another commentator Francois Tonon, such as Jack Marlow, I think the character of the character is an impressive complex. She is no stock villain. Goodbye character actor Elisha Cook Jr. is again topped as "a little man with the top ambition". The musical numbers have added a welcome touch to its drumming eroticism. However, this film is managed by a very capable and laughable Ela Reyns because the dedicated Henderson will be the girlfriend of Carroll Richmond. She definitely has talent and her screen appearance is Lauren Bacall tradition. The first thing I met her and I'm definitely interested in seeing her other role. Supporters left the rest of the cast. All this is intended to make a very satisfied film noir mysteries which today when completely conveys the dark and complex urban world. Recommended, 8/10.
