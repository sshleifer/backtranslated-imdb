From the first scene, you are notified about what is going to happen here. It became more evident as the story rolls. Acting is great throughout and this actor touches your soul. Although I knew what was going to happen I was very confused by the motive. I'm still anonymous why he did Ben. We could see his face "second thought", but the final self-sacrifice began to go against his passion and feelings. It was a very interesting and sensitive story but it kept me confused. Perhaps that was the picture point. I liked the film and Will Smith wrack up another good film favorite. How does this person entertain the audience!
