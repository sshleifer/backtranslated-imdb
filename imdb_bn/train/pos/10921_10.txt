After reading good reviews about this movie I decided to take it for a spin (I bought it on DVD, so "spin" pun ... I'm a dark). What I expected was the beginning, a perfect set-up (with some quotes I heard on various U-Tan albums) should be a good movie. But the plot that I heard was so great, it was thought that. Every time I saw a character (except leased) I guess he had no poison. Plus, the only cool character in the middle of the film is killed. OK, so the plot was not very good but at least there was some good kungfu? Wrong The fight was very small and a few and far away. Different styles were all super cool but guess was more than fight. I hope to see Lusher Run and the walls are some crazy but it did not happen. I hope to see some intense instant scales of centipede but it never happened. I hope to see the film Scorpio for more than 7 minutes but it has never happened. In short, a lot will not happen. War is all the beautiful routines. Do not be fooled, this movie has a plot, it does not mean it's a good one.
