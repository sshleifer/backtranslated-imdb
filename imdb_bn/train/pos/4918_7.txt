After opening the picture, two beats make another mug. When the body is discovered and to be indecent, the doctor realizes that even though people were shot dead, he is suffering from pneumonic plague - a very bad and more serious version of the Bubonic plug! So, when people contact the deceased person and treat them immediately, finding a nation against it, otherwise a disaster may explode. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, I actually know a little about the pneumonic plug, as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history class. This film did not really work well for getting the right information about this event, because it was as short a person as a movie. The biggest problem is that this illness was incredibly surprising that it was not allowed to show it in 1950. Sure, high fever and cough (they have got this right) but bleed blood bleeding and explosive reverse-there is also a lot of lung dirt as you can with the bobonic plug - all pure and gross! I understand why they have not gone so far. Also, I'm sure the federal government was much more involved in the treatment and treatment of diseases - here it was directed at a very local level, and everyone was sick-ready and somewhat silent. Nobody found the doctors to believe !! As acting, the film had some nice actors here. Richard Wymark and Paul Douglas, public health doctors and police chief respectively. Well known actor but back in 1950 the actor is known. However, in his very first film, the very fatal Jack Palance (still going by his original moniker, 'Walter Jack Palance') is also going by relatively unknown (time) Zero Mostael. Palance was great - very scary and his own stunts are very physically adept. His first job in the motel - which was a sticky and cowardly kind of evil was a heavy feature. <br /> <br /> Despite the fact that the information is not well received and everything wrapped up very nicely, the film is very intense and has excellent acting - and good value to see.
