Well, after reading a few minutes to read comments about these moments, I use that which does not reflect my experience. To me, Amitabh was a better villain than most of his famous movies. He was a Moroccan villain, an apologetic villain. It was a new role to me that I could see that her velley was not arranged in some way. <br /> <br /> This cast was played with Arya, perhaps her baby was probably I think the director could do a good job. But, to be honest, the best part of this movie was the Charnaj Patel. She is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thesis who she is proposed for every role. But I must say that I appreciate his contribution to acting as Varendra Sahi's wife. He may have given up a little, but he does everything with total firmness. I'm sure he's been heading most of the audience. <br /> <br /> So if you are in the habit of sitting for Bollywood, you will not get much more from this movie. But if you continue to search for something more, it can give you something you lost.
