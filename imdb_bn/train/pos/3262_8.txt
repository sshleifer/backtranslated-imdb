I do not think I could enjoy more, though some things were annoying. If you do not see what I do not say ... you have to find out for yourself. At any rate, can the puppies of Robert Doni Junior have a movie lacking? In all, all, the plot was considerably enhanced. Nothing seems to be very much like this, there seems to be such a movie. Character was able like, and there was a lot of sunny scenes there. The idea is that the story is very well integrated, even if some aspects may be dissatisfied ... according to the opinion. But before I said, it's hard to like any movie with Robert Doni Jr..
