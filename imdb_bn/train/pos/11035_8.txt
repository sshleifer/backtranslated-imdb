Four prisoners share the single cell: The Domainy Transvestite, Marcus (Clovis Cornilac); Marcus' stupid sister, friend, trafficker (Dmitry Rataud), who can eat something with a pocket watch, cockroach and her younger sister; Lasalle (Philipp Ludenbach), the intelligent librarian who killed his wife; And Carré (Gerald Leroche), the newcomer who was caught in corporate fraud and now concentrates on fleeing. After breaking a brick from the wall of the cell, the men discovered a hidden magazine written by a 'fountain of youth' - a serial killer who had captured the cell in the 120's. Is this journal secret to their escape? Is there anything more sinful behind it? <br /> <br /> I was tired of coming to this film because I had another experience with Eric Waleat, a horrible Missed Call (2008), which I was in. I've never seen movies released at the worst theater I've ever seen. However, what was wrong with one missed call might be the reason for Clavane's horror scripts, because (I remember) that the wallet's side was not the worst part of the film (unless he had included the child). However, Maléphic was a good way to get my respect back. . . This is a French film (probably I like) and it is held in prison (which is my second favorite horror setting after the shelter). Even before the movie starts two points for him. Thankfully, the wallet was with me after the film ended. Malefic is a rather deep, rather complex, but compulsory story of emotion and frustration. . . The desire and the reality are needed to bring imagination. Although it is not a horror movie in the traditional sense, the oddity of its power makes it quite horrible. In Claymax and Conclusion, several times I have seen some of the best films and I would sincerely recommend it to someone who is looking for a somewhat cool cool man in a mental thriller thriller. <br /> <br />> Final ruling: 8.5 / 10. <br /> <br /> <br /> Paramount lifted the right to create an American remake (surprise surprise). It ended in 2009. I am not sure why I am honest, because it does not seem to be something which will be a big finance minister in the state. But, I was surprised earlier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 3 -
