Tis is a widely practiced Tom and Jerry short-a situation is designed, conflict arises and ensues the dirt. Character behavior in appropriate ways, natural tension between different characters leads to general chaos. The best (and interesting) part is when the peace treaty is effective and honorable - all kinds of strange wonders appear before your eyes. A word of warning- It's the most silly to allow Tom to help you perform your morning cleaning routines! Highly recommended.
