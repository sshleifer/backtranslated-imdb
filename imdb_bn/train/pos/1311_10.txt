This is one of the best movies there and it tells a lot about television. I really dvd it Was <br /> <br /> <br /> Helen Hunt gave such a raw material. He fired a rookie police thrown in the case of a fully serial killer. It was amazing when she fell apart because she killed another kid. She is so alone, so she gets her When she talks about her mother! WOW! <br /> <br /> Steven Weber's serial killer was so shocked! She really brought him to his dark world. It was Oscar worthy. When he speaks of killing children, scary! When he realizes who he really is! What a scene !! <br /> <br /> They do not really like them like this. It was a real thriller without pride.
