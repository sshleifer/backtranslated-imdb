It's one of the most perfect episodes in which the plot looked really like an excuse for fun. But, I've appreciated this light-hearted approach and it's actually one of the best times to look at the funny level. Think about it - the white rabbit from crew members and from Alice Wonderland, a bungalow tiger, a samurai warrior, a horse riding horse horse, and other unexpected events that do not have any knowledge until the very end. Despite all the dangers, you can not take everything seriously - it is very interesting and the whole episode seems to be very supernatural. So, on a purely aesthetic level, it's great thing.
