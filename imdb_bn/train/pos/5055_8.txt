I did not expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Peer Brojane is like Gray Aul? <br /> <br /> Ahh ... but then the story is going on, in beautiful pictures and pictures. I was surprised and glad at this (essentially) true story. I want to read more about this impressive character, which means the director has fulfilled his intention, and the movie was successful!
