I saw this movie Comedy Central a few times. This movie was quite good. This is an interesting adventure with Sunny Davis's life, which arranged for marrying the king of Oshtaa, so that the US Army could get a base base in order to maintain power in the Middle East. Some good jokes with "Sunnygit". I just loved the last theme. It gave me a great political spirit. I had a rating of ten for ten films.
