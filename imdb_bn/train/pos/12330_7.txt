I saw the paradigm of this great beautiful nature of Living Dead, and I must say that it was so awful and so nice that it was nice. This film originally included all antics and scenery shots, including graveyards, decorated abandoned houses, basements and front lunches. I especially love this movie which is ridiculous to the bread and bothers the bread of the enemies of the common family. Mom, we know that toaster, toaster ovens and zip-lock have done a dozen times and now we must call for help to lose the cooking bread. Along with the cheerful acting and voice-over, this short horror film is better than the death of my beloved favorite parody of the living dead, the death of 1990. <br /> <br /> How do I think how observer movies can use all the conversations from writers and directors from the original film and make bread around the bread, how the bread is rebuilt and prevents the avoids to avoid, because they are particularly dangerous. Another big reason for why I love this movie is that the bread is bad, no exception, badgers are evil and even communists are evil, which is displayed by a newscaster and a ridiculous view involving a rather moniton cleric. I think actors are performing sticky attacks especially by jokes (like car scenes). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Attack of the Evil, mutant, , Flesh Itang, Hellbond, Jamiefide Living Dead Part 2: The Skunking 2-D "Controversically another great parody, it is still recommended as a great horror parody, which seems to be a college filmmaker. I recommend this movie that the Night of the Living Dead Fun And still respect the filmmakers. I want to recommend this movie for the love of de-film and horror parody, it's just a wonderful little little horror movie that can be fun and learning.
