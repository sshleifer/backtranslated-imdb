After watching 'American tin', I saw this little Belgian wax for two days. Do not make any mistake about it, a roller coaster journey of a teenager, be it American or European. A story is a story about a 15-year-old girl (Polin Ackroyt, who is sometimes similar to a young Scarlett Johansson), 'Niceness des Pipers' (or known as 'Water Lilies'). The girl wants to go swimming in school, she is just close to another interesting girl (Adele Henel). It is clear that Mary Floriane is more than attracted. In all of this, instead of Mari, a thick, unreasonable friend, Anna, who loves her like any other girl of her age. Along the way, we are shown the dark pastimes the normal array (broken hearts, lifting the store, alcohol and / or drug use, casual sex, etc.). It's a cool little movie that takes time on your system (Michael Bay fans, take note: Pacing is SLO-WA, so clearly clear), but if you have any problems then water lilies are a charming one. No ratings here, but language, nudity, will pull hard "R" due to adult conditions.
