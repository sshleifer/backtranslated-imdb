After reading two or three negative reviews on IMDB's main page, for "Pushing Daisies", and literally ended the final episode a few minutes ago, I thought it was what I said about PD. <br /> <br> First of all, to address some of the people I saw with this show: "I hope I hope to give more realistic feedback to those awaken from the dead". Realist, this show? Daisies push, really, pure and extreme escapism. It's used in color palettes, conversations, situations, situations, music: all of it, just a turn from everyday life. A turn from human and annoying. Pushing daises have exquisitely exceeded where Pushing Daisies are not all for it: Most of the television viewers do not get "get", for some people it's just there and stupid. But for people like me, even in the first episode I saw it (Season 2 "Frescorts") and I just got blown by the show. Since then, I bought both box sets and they went out of my DVD player. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Private investigator works in collaboration with Emerson Code, Pie-hole owner and Waitress recruits Olive Snook. The main cast members are made to complete the auntts Lily and Vivian, who are not allowed to see Charlotte (Chalk). They live in the fabulous world where the dead are brought back to life, everything is shown with wonderful bright splash of color, and described by Jim Dell. <br /> <br /> In addition to the basics outline of the show. Really it can appreciate much more saying: just see it. Despite being frustrated by the America's Guild of America strikes, only 22 episodes have been created, it provides excellent plot twists, story lines, letters and situations and gives me a (a satisfying end) (yes, I could say it was the last move. Was done and rushed, but I was still happy with how I was leaving). It's creative or just provocative, for many people (I included) it has created the most addictive and wonderful scene, and I hope for the future of television that more shows like this have been made, so I'm left with only 22, it can be true entertainment 40 Minutes memory
