When I saw this picture in the 1950's, I still wanted to be a scientist. There was something magical and useful in science. I take along a girl-friend see it another time. I think he was not as I was! This film was still ridiculous, synthetic fiber was rather new. The text of this movie can be applied to today's GM exam related topics.
