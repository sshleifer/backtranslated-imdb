Remember, a movie (the only documentary) that believes in a truth, will create reverse and proportional discipline, for those who have no idea and the meaning of searching for truth is already meaningless, among those already unconscious psychology, filmmakers and graduates of the spirit, this film Feeling void, finally, you already know everything you know. Congratulations <br /> <br /> Among the minorities like us, I found "The Paradise Guide to Symia" for them .... Most of the bright and valuable for film, psychology and modern philosophy. <br /> <br /> Most of the films and specific scenes have been captured by "Little Comics", like Short Scott McCaunds, director Sophie Phoenix, Slavon Philosopher, psychologist, and social commentator Slavoz Jijke's inter-great rights. The cover is a picture from "The Bird" (carries a boat to create a jizz shot). <br /> <br /> Laxanian psycho-analysis does not shout impressively, very fun evening ... but it is! If you like movies ... have some knowledge of Lacanian psycho-analysis (symbolic, real and fantasy) conditions that are initially cast in a very short time, then the selection of GJK selection and analyzes apparently makes me always There was a very abstract subject. In fact, it is probably better to get acquainted with movies than the words they use, which makes the film even more evident. <br /> <br /> Why I love it, this is not the picture because it loves great movies for the great truths about Lacan, but it shows in a very practical and clever manner, where film and psychology (and by default philosophy) meet Is. <br /> <br /> Why is "Sound of Music" kindergarten fascist, why more than just classes and isolation "short cots" why birds "birds" attack, what to learn about mind from "Allian Reservations", "Solar" What does the planet do? Like, "Psycho" and "Marx Brothers" how to work with each other, and after the movie, David Lynch is going throughout the movie ... there are some ideas of good GJK. <br /> <br /> The voice of both of "Exorcist" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith" is probably the most powerful and most obvious moment for movies, when I started to think about getting feminine sex ... At one point, Her feelings acknowledge that the flowers are decorated in a decorated vagina, which they should hate and hide from children (fun, it seems ...). However, it is an impressive documentary, anyone who has ever seen a movie, and wanted to mean something more than literal words, should try to see it. <br /> <br /> and anyone interested in Slavjjjjak, it must of course be less dry than "reality of virtual reality", and "jijake!" More straightforward, "Two more direct pseudo-docs" about "LVs of other contemporary cultural criticism" Dabbed, in the English-speaking world. <br /> <br /> "The surrounding guide for film" is not about sex roles in the movie. Jijek claims that the film is a very distorted art, because it "does not want to do what it wants and wants to teach," and it is the only contemporary art form that allows to express this wish. It's not a film about finding reality in movies, it's about how to find the movie and how important it can be and exciting. It's hard to find, and a bit longer, but the problem is well, one of the most "provocative" movies I've ever seen.
