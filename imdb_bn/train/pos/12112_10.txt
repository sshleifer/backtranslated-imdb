About this anime series Premier Bread, based on a plot base of everything! I really smile. The main character has the power to produce a special bread that he gave birth and he went to Baking School. It does not matter if I found it on DVD, and it's subtitled or dubbed - it's good. Even theme songs are funny alone At one point in the theme song, African-Japanese man was a samurai sword with a horse-horse African-Japanese man, as a French baguet. This image does not have to be knowledgeable until you see anime. You will smile until your sides hit. I have definitely seen this far the most unique animation.
