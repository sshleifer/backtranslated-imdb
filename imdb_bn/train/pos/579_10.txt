My sincere opinion, the recognition of this movie was not recognized. Robert Redford lives here in my nearby Provo, Utah, Sundance. I enjoy most of her work and it is my favorite. I'm sorry that more people are not grateful to it. Before my grandmother came out on the big screen, she used to read and read the years of the book. After we have seen the movie together he gave it to read. The movie and book hit a mental spot in my heart, and I cry after a few days of watching the movie. Sometimes love is not enough to keep our loved ones from hitting ourselves. We see it in our own family relationships, yet our love and our family and their stories bear for the whole generation. The cinematography was perfect and exciting - I was terrified by its beauty and how well the book's author Norman McLinn did for the life of this term, "But when I was alone in the canyon half-light, all existence seems to be my soul, memory and memory, and Big Black Feet of the river, and the words of four people's war, and hope that a fish will emerge. Finally, all things are in one And a river has been cut by the massive flood of the world and it runs on the stone from the foundation of time, there is a continuous rain in some stones, the words and some words below the stones. "These words are taken from the book and spoken at the end of the film (Robert Those who describe Norman Norman as Redford), basically my opinion. Any possible flaws in the film are spread through the beauty and grace of stories and art. It was beautiful!
