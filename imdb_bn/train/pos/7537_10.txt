In contrast to those who hate antichrist, the 700 club gives real answers and encouragement. It provides reliable news, logical comments and different perspectives than ABC, CBS, NBC and PBS. Contrary to other programs, which provide social and trust-related comments, providing help for the needs of those who are behind the 700 club, such as feeding hungry people with operations blasting, providing medical support for patients living in anti-poverty communities and giving hope to those who need hope. It's not all hateful. If 700 clubs attack you, then I suggest you to reach the remote control and launch your TV set channel. I do the same thing on the CNN Headline News or about that, when I find it impulsive or objectionable. What I think is objectionable is that the ABC family disclaimer claims that 700 club views do not reflect the ABC family.
