I've just bought a movie revival version which I remember from childhood with so much affection and it is definitely made to entertain in the afternoon. Bedknobs definitely makes his entire form, deleted scenes (especially those with McDowall) link events makes quite nicely in the future. The way the scenes have been restored is a little disconcerting what. Clearly, the soundtrack of this footage has been lost or damaged, so some bright sparks in Disney decided to douse the new conversation scenes. Those who did not have it bigger than half the throw (it was better than others) did not have to do anything and the whole thing was rather lower quality. Somewhat poor for the lip compression, and David Tamlinson's voice is dubbed by a block, which is nothing like David Tamlinson (actually a hint of Germany). However, it sounds good to hear full versions of all songs (though 'step in the direction' is still missing) and the magic moments of this movie still stir up. And I did not want to challenge you when young Paul Angela Lancerby and Kos grew so innocent "But what did I have to do with my throat?"
