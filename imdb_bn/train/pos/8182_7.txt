Director Brian Eugner has done an impossible career in a series of horrors, created excellent compositions such as "Living Dead 3 Return of the Living Dead 3" or "Bride of Re-Animative", but at the same time he "fost: love" for Damned "or medieval" generation "She is probably better at the producer's seat where her stuart Gordon's film has become fantastic. <br /> <br />" The Dentis Art "is one of his small works, but the low profile has benefited him, due to the lack of film and love, it makes a very enjoyable experience. This is the story of Dale Allan Fistone (played nicely by Carbin Barneson), who is a successful dentist, who once discovered that His perfect life is not perfect, when he discovers that there is no equal to his beautiful wife (Linda Hoffman) There is a suprise with the boy. This incident disturbs his mind and puts him in the assassination because he takes revenge for making the earth so "dirty". <br /> <br /> It is well managed by the user, because he takes us on a journey Day of revenge on the Day of Feston. This movie mostly separates from slashhers that we do not have the victim's perspective, we follow Feinstone because he is the main character. One day we witnessed how he went from a respected professional to psycho killing. Yunny directs the movie to provide the right amount of sensation, but adds a good level of dark smile that really helps the movie. <br /> <br /> The success of a prince like most of the festoons He can sympathize and hate you at the same time and his humorous humor is another aspect which helps the film. The rest of the cast is not good, and I think their sub-atomic act is more pain than the film. A notable exception to Cain Four is that the detective is trying to capture Fiston. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's good to see that he usually does not go to top of it and I say Would like it to be a highlight highlight. This is the exact amount of Gore which is expected, nothing less and nothing. Yuzna hindered her ordinary excesses herself and the results are great. <br /> <br /> Although it is not one of the most popular films of the user, I would say that it is its best one. Of course, this is not the classic element as its superiority, but it is not a movie which gets entertaining and never tiring or annoying. This is a low budget general movie, but for that, I think it has diminished. 7/10
