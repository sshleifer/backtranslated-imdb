Personally, I enjoyed thouroughly cut. This is the first time I published Australia's slash talk in the theater. A genre is usually limited to mainstream Hollywood movies. <br /> <br /> As soon as all the normal cooking comedy and plays came out of Australia, I was able to see a horrified horror movie which was not tied in any way. I did not even have other movies really a spoof. It was a nightmare on Elm Street, a supernatural theme was horrific, no scream or I know what I did last summer and hence there was another suspension of disbelief. I think it has tried to get more out of the mainstream sections of Australian films. <br /> <br /> Cut was original, scary and finally something funny. I want to give ten to seven and do not think it's serious. It's what I expected to do, to be satisfied, entertained and scared me enough time. I enjoyed it.
