"Worlds Finest" is a unique project. This is a trailer for a Superman / Batman Crossover film that does not exist and will not remain at least in this form with characters, actors and plot lines. So the movie is a big tease, even more than the standard daily daily movie trailer. In the trailer you will hype all for nothing. In this regard, I really did not like this small project. While watching this trailer it makes you hungry and agitated and at the same time saddens - and you'll probably feel cheated later, when it shows that the full-length movie of this trailer will never exist. Sorting makes you wonder why this project is in the first place. Certainly he could show the skills of Andy Collora, but he could not even do it with a short film like his earlier film "Batman: Dead End". <br /> <br /> But when you have to judge this briefly, for it, it's a technological aspect of a movie, it's really a great one. This is probably great and the guide, which is probably more professional than you probably would expect. But people who have seen "Batman: Dead End" already have cardboard sets, cheap homemade costumes and third-rate actors The brief is not consistently impressive, and perhaps the budget is not sky-high, but in most parts it is very impressive, set, special effects, cinematography and light looking very impressive and professional. <br /> <br /> The short build up a good fast and generally up to the trailer, probably a lot of posing shots to find it very credible but it works well for the trailer style. It has some captivating shot but more than one stroke, mainly in the form of flying star Superman. It is clear that the man was standing in a moving car, the camera looked at him from the bottom corner. I even found a pretty funny thing to see it. But for really good and more spectacular moments it really gives compensation. <br /> <br /> Michael O'Hareon looks like a good Superman / Clark Kent, though he is probably not the greatest talent around the world. Clark Bartram again reprises the role of his Batman again and Cart Carley looked like a tremendous Lex Luthor. The rest of the cast also served its purpose in sufficient quantity. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < "Superman Returns". It is interesting to compare the style and character treatment of these movies with this. It's really awesome and funny how much Kardy "Superman Returns" plays like Lex Luther, like acting actress Kevin Spacy. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful and well-made and built trailer which makes you hungry for more though, although you will not know that more. Whatever Waner Bros plans to create a full length Superman / Batman movie whatever it is? I thought that development was going on for some years ago, but since then there was no news of it. Instead, two new separate Batman and Superman movies were made; "Batman Begins" and "Superman Returns". <br /> <br /> 7/10
