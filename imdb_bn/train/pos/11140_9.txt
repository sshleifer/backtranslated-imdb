John Schlesinger's 'Midnight Cowboy' is probably an extraordinary figure for the only X-rated film in Oscars history. I definitely knew about it, and to be completely honest, I really did not expect most of the pictures. It does not seem to be terrible to me, but the way I did not consider it a movie that I would enjoy to see. Should not you believe your own motivation on such behavior? An extraordinary mix of starring, ambitious instruction and a memorable soundtrack ("Everyone is talking to me, I can not hear what they say") makes this movie one of the greatest findings of life, despair and friendship. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ p> .

When they understand that they are both in the same situation, Night Joe gives Joe's place to stay and works together, they try to live for themselves in the cool, great metropolis in New York. <Br> <br /> Joe himself firmly believed that New York would be more than paying for women's sex; However, with his first business venture, he was mistakenly given twenty dollars to the woman (Silvia Miles). Though yourself may be considered a little intelligent, but Rosho Joe is very na√Øve as Night with his pain and hacking cough always assures himself that if he can travel for Miami's warming, everything will be fine. These confusing prospects will be so much better that it is very memorable to remember Georges of Lonnie and John Stenbeck's classic novel 'Off Meuse and Man'. <br /> <br /> Originally shot in the streets of New York, 'Midnight Cowboy' is actually an extreme realistic view of living.
