There was a few colleagues in style who fascinously fascinated Westerners from a director. Like other Anthony standard images, the remote country mixes warm stories with a powerful pot with powerful influential people. Honor, honesty, betrayal, and of course death, both of Mannan's Packaldillo! The story goes by fate hunter Jeff Wester {James Stewart} and Ben Tatam (Walter Brennan) traveled to the Oregon area with the beginning of the cow. Bloding is aware of the gold boom, they want to make a strong profit to sell cattle in the Clonic towns. While coming to Skagway, they were self-appointed judges. Gannon [John McIntyre] is ready to meet Webster's justice due to the breaking of the Webster's law, these are in favor of honesty for everyone. Gangan takes away the partners from them, but they steal behind them and go to Dawson across the Canadian border and take hot pursuit of Gannon and his men. Here are the beautiful women and a mood and lawless city will fulfill the fate of all those involved. <br /> <br /> Interested to start from the beginning, the remote country is a symbol of James Stewart's rebel anti-hero protagonist and the silick side of the tight Tord Borden Chase script. William H. Daniels' cinematography is the maximum, which does not require any of the current DVD prints, and the film has a few surprises and "does he do it?" Core hates viewers. Returns the dividends to hard-line fans, it still remains an essential watch for Anthony Mann and James Stewart's wonderful, yet dark, first timers in the Western world. 8/10
