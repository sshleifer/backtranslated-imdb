It has some fantastic stains but the length of the film can not keep the wafer thin plot intact. This is not as good as the 'On the Town', compared to the 'Follow the Fleet' of Astiar, another sailor in the holiday movie. <br /> <br /> Katrina Grayson is soft but Kelly and Cinattra work together. Their 'is ni sui' number is sunny because they can sing the song. I was begging with Sinatra, it was funny, he showed how he was hugging. Sintra's solo songs seem to be soft and inserted into the song as part of the story. Fortunately, a performance supporting actor like Grandi Sutton, Ragus Ragland, Carlos Ramirez, and Pamela Britton and unlikely but impossible Jos√© Iturir, who watched herself. <br /> <br /> Starring Kelly, though the third build and it is interesting to see interact with children, which Astaire has never done. Dean plays a child who wants to stay in Navy and Lacheau in Stockwell Cale. He visited a school, which gave him an imaginary story of his life in Pomeranian (!) Navy, which led to his amazing dancing with an animated Jerry Mouse. In another scene, he sees a funny Mexican hat dance with a little girl Sharon McManus, who is a lover of sweet and sweet. <br /> <br /> Very nice then a little longer. Come to a master of good musical instruments.
