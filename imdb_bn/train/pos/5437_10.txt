Pandora S. Berman was "production charge" but he made him the so-called line producer. But this epic did not portray Arizona, but in the Mahav desert of California, where the Swara has cluttered with all the remnants of the temple, Tigi hat, Muri, British tropatore village British camp etc. Small technical errors and forgiveness are required. The lack of an incomprehensible Oscar for outstanding music, although the Academy did not offer such a proposal at that time. A single theme is played in various tempos including waltz, march and sweet, mood setting. Bright! One of the playful aspects of production was the demand of widow, Kipling. An actor playing Caplane appears briefly before and after the war scene. His scenes were cut as early as Mrs Kipling's demands on early release. Later they were included and provided a "connection" of Kipling's immortal poem in Ben Hecht's screenplay. Interestingly, this very common and motivated British story was a great painter, who hated the British himself.
