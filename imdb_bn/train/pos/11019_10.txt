Clayfanger seems to be the last action film of Selveister Stallone before being an Undertaker. This is a mountain climbing affair that will help his hostage to be hostage by the hostages who want to find three suites by carrying more than $ 100 million in their money. This is a great action sequence in great action sequences, fun seats in your seats and movies.
