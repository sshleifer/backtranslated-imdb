If Claudia Black does not continue this I will give a full 10 votes to this otherwise awesome series! His inclusion as a 'valiant' is brought down in the series between my guesses. It was wrong to replace RDA regularly with Ben Browser as well as bring him at the same time. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we were just refrained from the loss of 'Jack' and this really did not need the great series, the series became a new episode of 'Farsk'. <br /> <br /> I was a great fan of the film "Stargate" and when the series was first announced, I had a reservation that it could be in the movie, but after seeing the first episode, I admitted that I was hooked. I have always looked at the new episode with great prospect
