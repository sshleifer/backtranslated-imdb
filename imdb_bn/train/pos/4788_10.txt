This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen: I glowed inside throughout the whole film. Something happened to the screen when music and cinematography were spotted. Speed ​​speed is set by travel mode (a riding lawn shower with a large trailer) and the background is spectacular and operated by the slow life of words and other characters. <br /> <br /> The story actually happened; Alvin Strait died in 1996 at the age of 76. There was no acting; Everything was completely real, as the actors have actually transformed into characters. Sissy Spass has played a harmful act as a somewhat inactive girl who suffered much trouble but masked forward, always wanted to do the right thing. Richard Farnsworth threw perfectly and he nicely became Alvin Strait, a frustrated but loving elderly who went to meet his shy brother Lail to travel across Iowa. Alvin had gained a lot of knowledge during his life and asked him to find the best person in the way he met him. <br /> <br /> This picture highlights the importance of family to this person and it is expected that everyone I sincerely meet again, and hope again. Directed by David Lynch, this movie proves its directory skills. Farnsworth was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor; At the age of 79, he was nominated for the first time ever for the award.
