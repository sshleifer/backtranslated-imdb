"The Des" is a small family drama that is slightly caught - you must properly attach the character's emotions properly for gratitude. <br /> <br /> [Those who are unfamiliar with the potential spy show for them] <br /> <br /> Story for all those who have seen this event, probably Cooper's day, family middle-class children He recorded his days with his family and one day he was hoping to become a wealthy and famous writer because of his criticism. His family consists of a mother, father, perfect sister and a mercenary-younger brother. The first episode, which is made by John Scott Shepard, makes this a bit stupid - both sisters and mothers become pregnant. The first situation that hits the authors. Then the father left his job in law form. The youngest boy gets a panic attack. The middle child gets a fight with sister's boyfriend. All this one day's work. <br /> <br /> [/ Spoilers] <br /> <br /> I appreciate this show. I do not know. It's a bit crappy but I like it. At first I thought the camera work was a ripop, but then I used it and started to like it. I like the calm conversations under a dark light. I like the intimate feelings of the show. I like low budget style. I like acting. I appreciate stories Then I'm seeking myself a second season of the day. After the ABC 6-episode rain fall, I gradually became a fan of it. This is a really good show and it's nothing like OC. There are nothing in common with two. So I hope fans will stop comparing them. <br /> <br /> And if you are related to Abbey, Jack, Natalie, Cooper or even the Nat, you would love this show. Many
