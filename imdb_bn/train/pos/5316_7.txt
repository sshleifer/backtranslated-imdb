I saw Ida Lupino's second image as director after 53's hit hayar. I had a good film then this one. This is a girl who is going to marry and afterwards she is sexually harassed and does not like to talk about everything and talk about her so she goes away and is accepted by a family. I think Leonard Maltin's review is just about 2 and 1/2 stars.
