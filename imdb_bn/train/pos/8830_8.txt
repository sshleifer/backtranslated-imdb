This is an excellent composition footage of B / W 35 mm film. The picture shows you a strange way to start at a bar at 7:35 and how many things can happen in 8 minutes. <br /> <br /> The little surprisingly little material you use in complex stories, and by step-by-step you realize that something is not perfect. It reveals much, your adrenaline makes it superior with a delicate story and it is incredibly understandable not only for movie critics. <br /> <br /> But I know how it sounds: European short, black and white and low budget. That's not afraid of you. Nobody really can see, not just the kind of experts. There is not much to say, <br /> <br /> Because this image is 8 minutes (right), and I do not want it to spoil. But I saw it online and I did not understand why someone did not spend a few minutes to comment on it. <br /> <br /> It's really valuable to see. 10/10.
