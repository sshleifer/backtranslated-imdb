Well it was quite sensitive sensitive numbers but I can not think that I saw it before. Another VCA in Potiari reminds me of the film, "The other day of Ruby Rai", named "Welcome to Doullhaus" and "Ratcatcher" and Lynne Ramsie's execution. Which they can not say is that they are not a nice reference ... only they think very modern and very fashionable ... which makes me feel that this work is closer to an original and authentic autur with ads (as a method in style and story) Come <br /> <br /> Cinematography is just perfect for my choice. Very coral filter (or charcoal) for my favorites ... very archive made of 12mm. So the whole impression has kept me a little bit - beware of the art, which makes it very easy! The French (they are a conservative band) though it seems to have bought it as a jury ... but the inferior cinematic selection is infamous conservative, although I think what has been happening in the past few years.
