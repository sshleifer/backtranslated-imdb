As a real fan, I'm stopping this picture like a plague when bad reviews are coming eight years ago, but I've finished watching this picture and it's really a wonderful surprise. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a restore to the original, you are not a big disappointment, but if you are a bit different, looking for something lusty and political, but it's a movie for you. <br /> <br /> Gregory now works as a 30-year-old and her old comprehensive school teacher, in which she is following a colleague teacher and is having sexual dreams about one of her students. When students get beaten up loudly to meet Gregory, rush out, breaks and enters, and includes all the types of unexpected twists and turns that I feel left out. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some original, then I highly recommend this film. I only published that more people will see it after it's published and see what it actually is.
