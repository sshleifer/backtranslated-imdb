Unfortunately, the DVD is not available yet, but running on TCM or VHS is valuable. A secretary believes that his boss has been accused of killing unjustly and bravely took many dangerous characters in the effort of establishing truth. A movie with many twists and dark alleyways, which I would not mention! The zoom band sequence where our heroine seeks information about the killings, one of the most beautiful scenes in Hollywood's history, in a very low budget, and despite the creation of black and white in WWII. Despite low budget - Long Island looks a bit ponytail - it's a genre of original style and outstanding scene. Ella Reyns, a great actress discovered by Hawkins, who knew a lot about these issues, Juan Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Baakal, Anne Sheridan - the most popular women of their era. Robert Sydmak was one of the German, Hungarian and Czech filmmakers - SAARC, WILDER, GINMAN, LUBITOS, Cartes, LANG, etc. - who had been transferred to Humeid and attracted a very real attention with them. Sadly, Ella Raines has not been given such a big portion, and finally the poorly produced West is finished.
