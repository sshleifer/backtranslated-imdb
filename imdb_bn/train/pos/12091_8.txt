A fantastic, surprisingly wonderful entry of Italian director Anthony Dawson, 'Castle of Blood' (Lawyer's Castle of Terror) This one set of fine black and white cinematography, flawless dubbing, gorgeous welding, fairly logical scripting, deliberate pacing and a surprise (though perfectly suited). Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Aveiro) occasionally beat hockey songs and invisible 'love at first sight' films otherwise, in astonishingly entertaining movies. <br /> <br /> During the visit to England, Adger Allan Bo sits in a pub, telling his intelligent story Blackwood count. To recognize the great writer, Allan, a young news reporter, requested an interview with Poe. During the conversation, Poe reveals that all his stories are true. Curious, Alan expressed his suspicion about life after his death. Count Black Blawn Allen gives a Â£ 100 bet that he can not survive this night at Blackwood Palace, one night after Halloween, Alan Bit can not afford, so he rivals his life for a 10 pound walk. <br /> <br /> Mario Bauer 'Black Sunday' (Uncle's 'Mask'), 'Castle of Blood' is fairly moderate, more than a few moments of violence is horrific, especially from a director, surprisingly, the 60-year-old terrible Italian Associated with space movies. <br /> <br /> This is the sad version of this movie only for me. Pan and scan versions (and recorded) are badly found worse. Nevertheless, with Elizabeth Cristina Richie or Jennifer Lew Hewitt, it is better to see it and it is crying for a modern reconstruction. Watch it and enjoy a movie that compares with Robert Weiss 'The Hunting'.
