For a long time I saw one of the most underground movies, Bill and Teddy's Bag's Journey Bill. Preston SEC's second ridiculous adventure. And Ted Theodor Logan, Lawyer Will Stalence There are two ways to watch this movie: First of all, you see the concept of idiocy dialogue, remote plot, kids. Or .. you see the fools who are brilliantly found themselves in a very big condition for their brain. Throw this to a Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger on this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie. Bill and Ted go to the story with the same sincerity, only it is Bill and Ted. This is a complex fence that maintains balance, but when you do not see the movie as a hawked sculble comedy, as an adventure, two people who do not have any adventure, it becomes more and more.
