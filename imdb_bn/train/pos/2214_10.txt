My family went back to New Orleans in the late 1700s in the late 1600s and I saw the movie. It was known that it was a history, my grandfather never talked, but we knew it existed. Cats should certainly have black African African Americans and others who can "pass" as white and can not choose. This is a difficult history for you to understand when it speaks about your family and is a part of that history. It wants to cry me and it wants to kick me 'donkey' of my grandfather, who was the owner of that farming and how my elder grandmother of African heritage lived under the oppressive and still unstable existence ... and at the same time I I was not going out, perhaps I could not be a successful woman successfully, which I have been living successfully in today's world. The acting actor was both nice and fair depending on the actor, but it is a movie which needs to be made. Anne Rice is incredible and I ask myself why he is 'symbolically' writing about my family and I am not. I recommend this movie to everyone. Leza
