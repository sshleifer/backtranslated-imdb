I try to look at it most of the time, and although I have seen it for the last 4 years, I have not seen every episode. <br /> <br /> News about the game for Danny Tanner who is watching. Due to a drunk driver's car accident, his wife died and he asked Jesse, with a motorcycle, there was an elvis panic and his hair passion. Joey, an adult child who plays a comedy, and the cartoon voice always does it to care for her three daughters, Donna Joe, her DJ, Stephanie's second and Michelle, the youngest. /> There is no one to help them all live on a roof. <br /> <br /> At the show, Jessie gets a girl friend and later she is married to him and has a pair, Nikki and Alex. (This starts to happen in this new season) This show is awesome, if you like Jack and Kodai's Sweet Life, Renan, Meet the Boy World and Designing Women, You Like It. (It starts to be better in the last season) See it, you like it!
