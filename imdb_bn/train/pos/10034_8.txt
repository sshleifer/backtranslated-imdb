I had some problems with this photo, and I've heard many criticism saying it is too much and overrated True, it's three hours more, but I'm surprised that it goes by too soon. I do not think it's all overrated, I think the IMDB rating is perfectly decent. The film looks lavish with gorgeous dress and excellent effect, and James Slim slips from Cameron's direction very rarely. Leonardo DiCaprio gave Jack a gift of his best performance like Jack and Kate Winslet is just as beautiful as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals each of his scenes. The story is very rich, and hot on the development of character, it is very clear with the story of love that it is very dynamic when it is needed. Although its first bit movie is a bit slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I must admit that I was on the edge of my seat, while sinking the Titanic. I would say that the last five minutes were very running. James Horna's music score was nice, though I was never a huge fan of my heart that will go on. The miniseries of 1996 was good, but was suffering from undesirable circumstances and some historic errors. Overall, I give a Titanic 8.5 / 10. Bethany Cox's Bazar
