It's a great Disney Fleet. The story of an elderly high school baseball trainer (Dennis Kaida), who once was on the way to big leagues, like Pachter, was caught by the end of his career. But Jimmy Morris (Quaid), through an event series, tried a big league team and even made roster. This is a great family movie. It's inspirational, but it's not too thick. It's fun and entertaining. These movies will be enjoyed as well as kids.it is based on a real story, but I am sure the filmmakers have achieved some independence for storytelling. Quiddies are exciting, very convincing, like this title character. If you can enjoy looking for a whole family for a movie, see 9/10
