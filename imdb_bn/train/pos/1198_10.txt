Like most other critics I saw this movie first (on TV, never on the big screen), when I was a teenager. My father has always honored this movie and recommended it to me and I must say that he is not just right, but this film was with me for the first time for more than two decades. I have seen it two or three times since then (just a few days ago I gave it another watch) and it has not lost anything of its effects over time. It's still a great and good price to watch the movie! The standard Pekingpah verdict was known as one of the first and western western sides, the verdict of Pikinpah was a realistic view of the East West, but very rarely known Hunt was clearly good film and even half a dozen years ago. In fact, it was probably three decades before its time, or maybe it is still ... <br /> <br /> Though I have seen difficult and 100% Western (I like this type) but I can not remember any Western Fade and depressed as one of these Two men hate together, partly hate others, and surrounded by the beautiful sultan pazets, a distraught old man and a young Yanian, who leads the lives of fate-killers until they become a part of the fate. <br /> <br /> Anyone who has never seen this movie and the last frame of this gem will be forgotten. When the camera moves away from Mr Taylor and the white herbal skin comes in front of the eyes (on the tree) and echoes come from the past, when all hatred starts, then it appears again. Mr. Taylor got his torch, but eventually he got the torch. In addition to the top performers involved in <br /> <br />, intelligent script and great dialogue, should also mention that the last moment has been photographed nicely, I have seldom seen the West that the good shot (along with Anthony's quality, which are written in all the excellent films) ), All the locations that have been glossy and even soundtracks fit the image very well. <br /> <br /> And director Brock's is really a great storyteller. Master Techiness! She has made a number of great films and has succeeded in almost every fantasy style, but even in such a wonderful career, the last moment still brightens as her best, if not her best. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
