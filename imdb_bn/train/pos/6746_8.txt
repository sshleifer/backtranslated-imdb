This is a great example of a remarkable film, which is very well-conducted - thanks to the excellent direction, along with Otto Premium, some lovely performance performances. Dan Andrews is not a star as a hot-head detective, who often uses his fist instead of his brain. Shortly after the film began, Andrew was blamed for it and warned that if it continues, that energy will be stopped. After a while, when he was investigating a crime he was attacked by a suspect and Andrew was forced to fight for himself to defend himself. During this time he did not use excessive force but the attacker was killed. Andrews Panics and believe that they will not trust him, so he is trying to cover up death - though instead a innocent person is held responsible for the crime. <br /> <br /> There is much more to this photo - a plot involving love interest for a thin villain (Gary Merrill) and Andrews (Gene Terni). Above all, one of the better examples of this genre - great sharp dialogue, fantastic lighting and an easy but very effective story. Thus was the meaning of being silent.
