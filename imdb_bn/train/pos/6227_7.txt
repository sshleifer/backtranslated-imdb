Definitely less Astaire / Rogers musicals. It's just too badly designed and paced. It runs only a few minutes more than swing time, for example, but it feels a hack for a long time. This is partly due to the second romance between Randolph Scott and Harriet Heiland. Scott is very rare ever interesting. I like Hilly. She is sweet, and I love her song at least one, "But where are you?" ("Satan before me", his other number, a weak remnant from the top hat, gratefully cut from that best composition). If there are at least three brilliant dance sequences between Astiar and Rogers, the Fleet will actually be a bad movie. Dance competition vies for the top spot in their numbers. Dancing is just fantastic. "I keep all my eggs in a basket" and repeat these two dances that they still have not done perfect. Its imperfections make it all more perfect. And "Let's the Music and Dance" is one of the best songs on Facebook. So the film is well worth watching for its great moments.
