I just wanted to see this photo name alone, so I taped this movie in AM's first hour. If you ever want to know how the mines had to go through in the first day and in fact, when the mine is growing on men, they see a dramatic scene. This film clearly wants to show that Germany and France can work together and be friends after the WWW and how Germanies come to the aid of French mines for the disbelief of French cities. The actors were an amazing scene, a horse with a horse and unusual scenes, who worked in the mines. While breaking the elevator, old old retired mines, who went down the mine with mine. If you are a real movie buff, it's a movie that you do not want to miss.
