Though it is politically incorrectly drunk by drunk, but this attraction of Dudley Moore's loving happiness screenplay, Arthur Boych can not help for this unique and amazing character. How can you be entertained by that smelly smile and quickly and captivating silliness. Although I'm not really the fan of Lisa Mineralie, she was really nice as Linda Marola and I could not figure anyone else in that role. Sir John Gilgood was the heart of this picture and his Oscar was worthy. Cast the rest of the rest is wonderful and that great tune "Arthur's theme", Wow. This is truly one of the best comedy of the 1980s. Great movies are better with each movie and it is related to "Arthur"
