Such a lovely movie! Very warm heart. Nobody can help to lose the love of Gigi's character. She is grown as a child and grew into a sensitive artist. The whole movie rolling around her. He lives in a wonderful world ?? Living all life ?? Curiosity, desire and expectations. There is such a big brother who tries to steal his glory but he remains in his shadow forever. Parents are very motherly and so mother. I wanted to come to my father and meet again with the last mom? And there are their tears and smile. I want to have something to release from the elder brother at least. His personality seems to have been completely trashed. Passion and ardor ?? The key to life is that. And looking through the camera ?? Focusing on small details and savoring the exquisite details of life.
