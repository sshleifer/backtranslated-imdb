I stopped for "Mr. Blindings to build his dream house", 10/10 due to an outlook that makes us somewhat annoying in the 21st century: a black person faithful slave (somewhat memorable of Stephen Fetchit). But more than that, the movie has been haunted. New York's New York couple Jim (Curie Grant) and Murray Blundings (Marina Loy) are trying to build a house in Connecticut, there's something for everyone on Flickr. <br /> <br /> Grant is not quite good as a natural wife, she is merely a fairytale flute. But the lawyer of Melvin Douglas Jim and Moore has added some real laughter to Bill Cole, who has more plans to clean it up. For the house ... For most of the movies, you would probably feel suspicious about whether you want to stay there. Builders, contractors, and others also give fate to their humor. <br /> <br /> All, a comedy classic. Lewis Beaver, Reginald Danny, Sharon Muffett, Connie Marshall and Jason Roberts are senior actors.
