When I first heard the title, I thought of 'The Simpsons' like many critics, but when I saw Cast, I was completely stunned that the actors would be so big! First of all, our Christopher Walken (Dir Hunter, Paul Fiction), who played the title character Macbayne. Some of his friends were rescued from the Vietnam Pau camp, including a Santos (Chique Weiner, Yankees), who split the Hundred Doller Bill with Macbayne (loaded with the Vietnam Army's cash) and told him he was <br /> < After 18 years, Santos and his sister Christina (Maria Kanchita Alonso, The Running Man, Predator 2), in favor of joining the rebels Please subject to can. In Colombia, their evil dictator, L.L. President (Victor Argo, taxi driver, king of New York) is trying to get rid of and when Santos fails in this mission, Christina goes to Macben for help. <br /> <br /> Macbayn asked her good ol 'friends in Vietnam to help him. Firstly, Steve James of "American Nenza", who played "The Extreminator" in the previous movie "Jeans Giachenhaus", played a tough black guy in the token, in Eastland, where the exiled name was Eastland, the coincidence? I do not think. , Among other references to the eliminator, many are mentioned, Macbayne himself is a welding face When Christina sees her for the first time, when she is doing a welding job at the top! <br /> <br /> The other boys in Vietnam-pack are: Rich people who can afford all kinds of equipment for the team, Frank Bruce (Michael) Iranside, Total Recall, Starship Trupper), and then Doc, Dalton (JJ Paterson, who does not look like a person with IMDB, and I do not see him I do not mean the film, who knows), and least but not least, the police, Gil was enough of his anger, he was played by Thomas G. oyaitasa, who among us can remember from some of the warriors and the Thing. <br /> <br /> And in other major roles we can not get a decent job as Luis Guzman (Boogie Knights, Carlito Way), a short-time drug-seller. Also, Dick Bocesalei hangs on a forehead by a Macbayne-gang as a kingpin of narcotics, almost the same way he jumped over John Eastland's meat-grinder. Remover Movie! Now, I have not seen Gicklehance's "Shackdown / Blue Gene Crop" yet, but I'm ready for almost a hundred billion bills that Boakeseli has broken into the film! <br /> <br /> Return to the plot of this film. They will go to Columbia and save the day, yes! But for any conspiracy, care is great, cast is superb, and action-scenes are done very well and you do not get annoyed if you see this movie! Very recommend all lovers of action!
