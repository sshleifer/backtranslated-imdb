I would say to love the movie completely. It was fun moments, some heartwarming parts, just around good. I personally, really love the movie because it is something that I can finally relate to my childhood. In my opinion, this film gives even more attention to the young gay population. It shows how a young gay boy will be treated when it's rising. All taunting, calling the name, and knowing I will always remember, like some other young girls, and now finally a movie that refers to how gay really should be bigger. So, I would definitely recommend watching this movie. Perhaps it will not really look up until a person is old and mature enough to understand it
