I was surprised by the spectacle of viewers at this low rating. I saw it late on TV a night and it hit the spot - I actually think it was first appeared in 1989. Yet I think it's pretty good, with an excellent twist or two and a striking ambiance on a venture farm. Michael Pollard looks very firmly for his role, which represents the first inevitability of his career, and everyone makes it straightforward. Though some themes, which seem to have looked a bit more in 1989, may seem shameful now, although I definitely recommend it as fare, contemporary "intensity" is often used as a necessary marketing tool, sort of like clamery get just the goal.
