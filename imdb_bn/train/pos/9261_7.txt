What do you think about the Iranian movie or Iranian football that the average person knows less / less? Interestingly, controversial Iranian filmmaker Zafar Panahir has topped the latest film titled 'Offside', a story that uses football or uses focus for a series of series for football access, and can do anything or go somewhere else. They and the rights of extended individuals who want courtesy when they want. Wicked thing is, the more you do not want to know about Iran's football or Iranian cinema, do not come away from the offside (unless it is an education of the controversial style of the Panhei), but you feel enlightened, at least Iran has a controversial issue like Iran. It was clearly still in a country and instead of using it, present it to international audiences The willing. <br /> <br /> I can remember the 2006 World Cup. I'm sure people can do a lot. After the first summer of the World Cup I was summer and after my first year's slogan, the summer of football in the World Cup worked as a good time tonic. Needless to say, I saw each game bar that they could see each other at the group stage at the same time in order to avoid events seen in Spain 82 when West Germany and Austria would see their differences between them both in Algeria's expenditure. <br /> <br /> Anyone who was watching the BBC broadcast of the BBC ?? Mexico Games, the first of both the countries' tournaments, may remember that at the top of the show, Anchorian Gary Lineer left a slide comment to present the match in BBC football. Something went like this: 'We have seen players from Germany, England, Argentina and Holland but now we see .... Mexico and Iran have fought.' The emphasis on the latter two to be inferior was obvious and perhaps it was probably a joke to see them. It's shameful because there are people and movies like offside, they're ready to play Iran in such a way that they risk their benefits to achieve it, and it is unfortunate that when people in power stand they think that <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > France returned to France in 1982 against France. Here is a movie about the World Cup game involving Iran, but where most Iranian filmmakers choose to present a story surrounding Iran's famous victory over the United States and what is meant to them, the director wants to see the foothills and the story goes from the standpoint How women are banned from football matches Countless game is a game of winning are not allowed to live with joy. You can describe Iran's victory in detail in detail, which can imagine a long film film designed to absorb as a longing promotion film, since it may not be expected in such a way that it defeats Western power or 'enemy' in a game. <br /> <br> Some of the films that sit in front of the unexpected disappointment of their own game are the 2001 Indian movie 'Lagan', where Indian farmers defeated British rulers in cricket. 2005's 'The Game of the Livies' Simillari, Americans defeated English in the football match at the moment in the 1950 World Cup. The differences between this movie and offside are infinite; Offside look at a situation behind a state's mentality and the courage to explore an essence of feminism as girls, their favorite Iran is round like Bahrain defeated and trying to qualify for the World Cup and a crude purgatory just kept them in the feet from a prohibited window that their game Will allow you to see. This argument will be male 'm' with fierce language, but can 'use' during the game. The film so disproves Iran that they can not remove the right to ban a person's oath and bad language, but should the women's rights be banned to play together? It is no surprise that the drinker's image is not banned in Iran. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However, as the first time, the Patahi thinks that the rules are so crazy that their female characters smoke cigarettes and using mobile phones, doctors and scientists think you're human body / mind Feels even more dangerous. Pahnahi gave special attention to the title of his film 'Offside', which itself is a ruler in football, when 'attacking' attempts to achieve sports facilities in the game. This progressive (right-handed person) person is trying to keep the opposition on the opposition parallel with the position of women in the film; <br /> <br /> I think offside off from the Middle East and the surrounding bay area is one of the best films. It is an intense but threatening film that does not carry any acting history according to IMDB, and thus, the role is neutral neo-realistic ura in addition to raw and original. Continuous oral battle between brave male soldiers and female wrong activists for immediate ending hunting and state defense is surprising. For the reasons I have mentioned, I think that for anyone who really wants to dislike the film, I also think that you work in Iran's government or do any other work.
