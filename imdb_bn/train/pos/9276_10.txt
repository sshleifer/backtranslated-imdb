The US State Department will not like to see us in this movie, because there is a beef with their Iranian government. However, it shows us how civilized Iran really is, despite the content of the film, has equal rights for equal rights to women's struggle: The ability to see a football game in the stadium is strictly limited to the audience alone. The film is funny, and itself is the proof of freedom of speech and expression in Iran. I enjoyed this movie intensely. Five girls tried to enter the police bay in a football match in a football match between Iran and Bahrain. Very interesting thing to describe the upcoming comedy, because of the intervention of the bus stadium to the stadium, police intervention and subsequent detention of the girls. Do not miss this classic film. It's a must see. Over the years, I have seen one of the best foreign films.
