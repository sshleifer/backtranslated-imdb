Miraz (1990) A very rare horror / rocker, published in the UK on the "New World Video" label since 1990. <br /> <br /> This is a desert-based horror movie about a group of young friends. Participation for the weekend, who will drive one deadly black truck by an unknown force only !!! There are some vague scenes in this movie, and some are here and there, but I have to say that the act was so long, even the low budget criteria! But the film was weirdly addicted and I like it and I can not sleep or stop it, which is always a good sign! I gave this picture around 6/10, but I saw steam with the path, there were some good moments of the cow and mystery, some had good nudity, and the female female roles were also in the role! I'll give it 7/10.
