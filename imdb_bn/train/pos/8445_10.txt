Homicide: The movie proves to be a good writing, well managed, and well-played series a good wrap-up. The final finishes were bound, which was not properly fixed until the end of the final season. The whole series, and especially the film, finds the life of Baltimore's life (and death), which is a culturally unique city with a very high killing rate. My attraction towards this series started long before moving to Baltimore, but once I felt myself living for myself here, I realized how real it was. And in the course of the movie to maintain that spirit. I will certainly miss the new original episodes of the series, but grateful to NBC and the producers and throwing us to a last glimpse of the extreme city darkness.
