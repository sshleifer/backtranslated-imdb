A few reasons make it easy for me to think that I still think this is the most important science fiction film ever made, despite the acting, old conversations. First, imagine the concept of Scale Kerala, the negative nation of this planet, now all dead, who are more than 1 million years better than the world and our technology, especially 8,000 cubic miles of machines. <br /> <br /> Second, there are music and sound effects, which are integral to each other. It creates a distraught, strange feeling against "2001", which was a traditional classical music. Third, its "monster" is not only the most powerful and deadly fantasy, it is a science based science and does not break the laws of physics and biology. Finally, and most importantly, the Forbidden Planet is the only movie that has ever tried and succeeded for more incredibly honest, intelligent and stupid. The logical statement of limitation or limitations of the development of humans (or any other biological entity), does not matter how long we live as a species. <br /> <br /> In other words, it predicts our inevitable fate.
