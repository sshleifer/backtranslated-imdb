This anime rocked my socks seriously. When I first opened an anime, I became very slow; The story was not fairly forward, and Shirie was quite impossible to lead the men. Once he learns more about tracing, and you learn more about Saber and Holly Grill, the story is pan out and you can see multiple aspects move together. It was nice. <br /> <br /> I also felt that the ways in which the real world can be developed in real life are really true. There was no stupid completely clear things going on; The development of Ilias and Rin was interesting, but I think it was interesting to keep an eye on how Shiruk and Sabar emerged in their specific personality. Some "wonderful" people have shown (Gilgamm?) Seems to be unique in another way from Caste, which means we do not have "Generic bid-ass at" Generic "Bad ass B" as soon as one died. <br /> <br /> Odd, I like the music, the opening song ended up suddenly and the theme at the end of the final episode ... seriously leads the theme to the last episode. Good job, type-money!
