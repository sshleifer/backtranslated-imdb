After all, I think the central concept of "infiltrators", at other stages of fragile self-nature, at different levels - mainly subconscious but sometimes more metaphor. In fact, infiltrators are sovereign across the globe: on the Swiss-French border where the Protagonist leads the isolated life; Its repeat daydream and nightmares; After the heart transplantation in his sick body .... the last half of the film, he became himself an infiltrator, in the past he returned to the old French colony in the hope of the past. <br /> <br /> The overall voice is unfortunate, but bitter, rather than suffering and sin, the feeling of failure is more or less dominant. This is a very complex image of an old age, apparently self-reliant but hopelessly ineffective and lonely. The director writes more images to express the passing sensation of anxiety and desires than a clear amount. Some of them are mild-tempered, though not without humor, only fools intelligent sports can imagine fantasy only.
