I'm not the big team methason fan but I have to admit I have to choose this picture. It was dark and in some scenes somewhat annoying was somewhat boring, I do not know that this film is a small SF and a bit awful slash thriller. I saw there was nothing more than 2.00 or more in this local channel so I decided to see it. If you do not see this movie ID, it's not really bad, the characters are quite interesting, but if they can make this picture better, their full potential is not really discovered. I do not know whether this movie went to the cinema, but it was made for the TV or it seems to have gone directly to the video, I would like to buy it if it is on DVD but it fits well with my type of film and has a connected X-FILES story There are small bits. Government institutions or uninterrupted corporations are involved in a disappointing shadow agreement. Above all, a good movie.
