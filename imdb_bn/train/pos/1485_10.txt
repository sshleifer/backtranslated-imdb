This movie has a personality that plays very well in their parts, I love the final, when no one knows what they will do for their life, but when you see and realize that the priest is okay then it is perfectly cool, jut for both, so there is another What are the people doing? The movie hugs you to be able to dream with new life, feelings, other people and reach those dreams. Also shows you life itself, it's hard to find. But gives you the option to choose what you want and choose what you need. Hope to work on this comment for you. The movie worked well for me. I bought the movie;) Take care.
