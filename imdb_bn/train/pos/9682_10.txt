I absolutely love this movie! It was very good! This movie is called parrot, polar point of view. Poly is given to kill a little girl, as a present. Poly helps Marie to talk and they become good friends. But when Pamili MARI wants to fly, it falls and the bird is sent away. That adventure starts. Poly goes a lot out of his way back to his Marie. This movie is so sweet, funny, touch, sad, and more. When I first saw this movie, I started crying. The birds dare and his time was always touched, so requested to go out of his mari. I must say that the finishing is very sweet and sad, but to find out how it goes. Finally, the crowd tried to help him after listening to his story. Did she find her long lost Mary? Find out when you see this sweet, heart warmth movie. It'll touch your heart. 10 Ratings:
