Never seen the 1971 film, and Walt was greatly enriched by this great production of Disney Studios and Great Animation Creations. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played a Democratic role as a girl, who took a witch course and was a professor who started flying a boomstick and was having a lot of problems. Eglantine discovered many techniques and was able to travel on the bed in many parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed his final test to become a final witch. Mr. Emerius Brown, (David Tomminson), a person who sold this course to Witch Egglin and he tried to help him find out his solution. England has made an intent of his insanity and it is to stop denying Nazir's England. Great family entertainment and we need more movies like this.
