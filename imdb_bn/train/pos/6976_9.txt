I did not see the BSG, I tried to see the middle of the show but could not enter it. However, I saw Mapica reborn yesterday, I lost a little, so I agreed to see the pilot today and of course I was happy. I think it was a promising ceremony and it was the only side effect on me that I now see BSG. <br /> <br /> But what I liked is not to be mine. BSG fan to understand what is happening in Crimea! From the net I read, they were trying to reach the female population, because the BSG had reached more people, and at least it worked for me. <br /> <br /> However, if I try to see the show, starting from the beginning with the pilot.
