While starting this movie, Hui (Billy Connolly), a road for the 70's band Strange fruit, said that God was more than 70 sick due to lightning in a rock festival to stop the set of strange fruit. In fact, it is popular to adopt the music era, and see the punk to welcome it. Although I agree there was excessive exhaustion (as well as harmful requests from it) and like punk, I still think of being a classic rock or glam rock, and this film about the long, strange reconciliation of Strange Fruit is a tender tribute to those days. <br /> <br /> One of the reasons for the movie is the people's care behind the scenes. Brian Gibson has indicated that it has love, about Tina Turner (when I was having problems with the dramatic parts of the film, the music was handled very well), author Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenice were co-authors of this association, and behind the music-based British TV The show is seen in Rainbow, and the lazy Friends songs are Mick Jones of foreign (Mick Junk Jones did not get confused), so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were saying about. Also, two cast members have their own rights as musicians (Bill Noya I do not know, although the film credits her through her own song, and she must be seen as the lead singer of that era, while Jimmy Nell was another British TV show that was based on music. I forgot the name, and he was in Ivitta), and others believe in it. And when I said, 70 bands, like weird fruits, have treated women badly, the film did not make the same mistake. (Except the woman following Timothy Spal); As the reunion manager, Juliet is quite well and fully plays the round character. <br /> <br /> <br /> Other actors are also good, especially Stephen Rey, who plays a more dramatic role without feeling. Plot points do some work that does not work, but overall it is quite enjoyable. Oh yeah, and the music is very good.
