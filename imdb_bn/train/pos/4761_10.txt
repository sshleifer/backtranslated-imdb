An excellent film with great performance from Jack and Lochley. Their displeasure (and mine) reached Garibaldi station. (All the proper honor in Jerry Doyle, but I have lost sympathy for the character between season 4 and 5.) Jack (who loves everyone at the show) and does not take long to start criticizing the charge. I can confirm that Zack has coped. Soulhunter is interesting in the plot, especially if you believe in heaven as Jack. Humor It is nicely supplement. 10/10
