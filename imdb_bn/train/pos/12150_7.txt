This film was one of the many "Kung Fu" action films made in the '70s in the late' 70s - early-80s, the cheap sound effects, the doubled dialogue and the rapid martial arts action of lightning. But unlike most of this type of movie, it has a decent plot and lots of comedy. When Manchu bullies forced workers of a dye factory to work from their jobs, they would hire a singer (Gordon Liu) to try to frighten them. When his efforts fail miserably, he really chose the path of the temple of Shaolin to fight. Instead of making him a Kung-Fu student, the master ordered the construction of a scaffold to cover the roof of 36 chambers. Well, it turns out that he is doing these manual tasks (stacking and bamboo poles), he is learning the skills of being a Kung Fu expert! It's kind of like karate kid when m Miguel does the routine work done to Daniel - "Wax on, Mom of Off" and teaches basic curtains through caterers. Gordon Liu, once faced with his Manchu torture, has a great comedy from start to finish. "This is not just the strategy at the moment - this is the real thing!" Liu declares, proudly throws her chest. If you like the classic Kung Fu movie then you will not miss it!
