I've enjoyed the film and will recommend someone just for a good time. Do not take the film seriously because it's Disney and it's rated. Although it is good fun fun, some parts may be recognized by adults but children can never be noticed, especially the "triangle" valet alonso in the crew, le pale and croiler loyalty. Glenn Close has made fantastic and really crew herself and her fearsome fearsome after being "cured" by the animal's loving way, she could scare the audiences with discipline to shake the theater of the audience. (I saw myself chasing me when he crawled as a cat-boyfriend). I see everyone in the theater again, I've enjoyed it myself.
