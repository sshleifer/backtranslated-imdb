Although we know how to finish the story, it's a fly-on-the-wall film of a mobile phone that can play almost like a political thriller. During the peace before the storm, we met with Hugo Chavez, a charitant who has an impossible connection with living, who has increased the 80% population, but previously shut down Venezuela's political process and its oil resources. He seems to them as dedicated to them. He toured the country at an acute pace, reached Campsino, addressed the huge crowd, embraced the common man and kissed him, received letters in paper scraps and was listening to the application for help. People are excited that their number has one office in the highest office. An electric feeling of hope and optimism that changes for better change is festering barrios. <br /> <br /> But not everyone is satisfied. The pure blood Castilian Spaniard is full of bitterness and annoyance who are small minorities who are elite but previously all resources are controlled. One of the most weird smiling moments in the film, when Anne Coulter's face was in the meeting of residents of the Gifted community, Mistijo complains, "There is no idea of ​​their struggle or sacrifice." A few minutes later, a speaker said in the meeting, "Beware of your domestic servants - they can be Chavez's supporter." Duh! Of course they are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is a sensitive, poetic person, although an indecent, even Clowns, comedians (as we have seen that he addressed the United Nations and Bush called the devil.) <br /> <br /> After collecting the storm, the coup organizers called for protesting the public and the last supporter Rapatira Palace cittakarsakabhabe their supporters used to change the road, because Chavez supporters surrounded him and the inevitable violence. <br /> <br /> Because of the dispersion on Chavez's supporters, another element is leaked, some of them being set on fire. The local equivalent of Fox News shows the fire of this return and claims that Chavez supporters are massacre of demonstrators. Then there is no protestor pulling back the camera - empty on the street! The protesters took a different route. The empty street pavement was suddenly performed by anti-Chavez private TV stations (who was mentally ill for Chavez and had been campaigning to correct sex with Fidel Castro.) Immediately after the coup, we see the enemies and media of their media became openly televised how they And for non-life supporters Icalita negligence was to control the situation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Chavez eventually surrendered to save bloodshed, but refused to step down and went on a sea island where an aircraft waited to take him - where? United States? How can the members of the remaining cabinet avoid and overcome this huge conspiracy of right-wing generals and how can the Bush overcome the highly-rich businessmen closely related to the administration? Watch the movie and find out! <br /> <br /> If you have the only knowledge of Hugo Chavez and Venezuela from the US media, then you do not know anything. He is not an "undisbursed savior" and "not ruled by decree" - he was popularly elected, and was elected more than 60% of the vote (some George Bush never earned junior) and re-elected with devotion. He was inspired by the general Venezuelan people and ultimately caused the failure of the coup. <br /> <br /> This is an extraordinary situation in which extraordinary people are extraordinary. The filmmakers' skill is unreasonable and the story is published in every story through Barao's Presidential Palace, astonishing scenes, chaos and confusion, in which each synchronized is fully evolved, which is intense and moving. Can not be missed!
