If the "Dr. Calgary Cabinet" is the father of all horror films (and German publisher movies), this former WWI film is Dada. The hungry prominent student in an empty cohort made an agreement with Satan - Satan gave him a free gold sack in return for "anything in this room". Satan loves reflection of his mirror students. He travels with the student's DoopelGenzar, for which the crime takes place, for which the student is held responsible. <br /> <br /> The film was seriously damaged by some restrictions arising from technically primitive state of filmmaking in 1913. The plot is shouting for the effect of the Churches, but the film's requirements, all the shots in the light of the galaxy. But the scene where the reflection comes out of the mirror, there is still a wall pack. <br /> <br /> Waiting for yourself is even more interesting for the tendencies, the Prague of Student is still suitable.
