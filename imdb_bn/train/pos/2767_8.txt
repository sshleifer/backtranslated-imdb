Gregory Peaks gives a brilliant performance in this film. The last 15 minutes (or there are) are awesome and an absolute pleasure to see the pickup. But the same thing can not be said for the rest of the film. It's not terrible and I'm sure it was made with good intentions, but the only real reason to see it (if I want to be honest) is the pack. Good for you to just stop reading the Old Testament for the rest.
