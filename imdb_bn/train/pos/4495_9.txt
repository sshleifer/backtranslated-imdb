The struggles of a different world and families outside the house are struggling to run the lines between the slave's authority and their expectations and dreams. <br /> <br /> This period is captured; Becklight light switch, Georgian florpans, photo rail, wall papers, small skirts, shiny ladders, mini van, shiny modern mangals .... <br /> <br /> location is caught; An air glacier crushed rocky landscape, the local stone, the community, hit the wall of freedom. <br /> <br /> But there is much more; Childhood, happiness, sense, pride, value, freedom, authority, rebellion, violence (in the deepest sense), love, struggle, young girl, morality, morality, faith, belief, deception, machismo, modesty, maturity, loss, poverty, self- There are horror, acceptance, revelation, trick and parental all. (And there are no special orders!). <br /> <br /> This picture is a fully stocked expression of family intensity, which is like today's expression. Some of these are not directly handled, it is the rules themselves in the attitude of the day, but all of them here have a sense of performance, story and direction. <br /> <br /> If something goes bad about this movie, these deeply latent and surprisingly effective tones have appeared very light in the end. Maybe I am misunderstood - if it encounters sadness and sadness felt by many teenagers, it disappears (**) - maybe the film is also trying to send that message - okay. <br /> <br /> Trying to say the film? Babies: Parents were too young, parents struggled very hard, everyone made mistakes, everyone learned, changed everything, and struggled happily. Dad, do not try hard! Keep in mind that your support is the key to their well-being. <br /> <br /> Do not think it is straightforward? Sometimes the film looks like this but it can only be seen how challenging and unexplained it is. <br /> <br /> The image is classic. <br /> <br /> (**) - No problem with them.
