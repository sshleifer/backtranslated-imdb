Among our families, we are a huge fan of Christmas Carroll and watch almost every version of Christmas, including the old 1938 Reginald Owe and the modern 1999 Patrick Stewart. Our overall favorite is the 1951 black and white classic, because Alastair SIM IS Ebenezer screws the ring and its truth. However, this 1984 genre has its own unique characteristics and it creates a beautiful and entertaining story, which is usually faithful in Dickens novels. (If interested please see my comment on adaptations of other movies) <br /> <br /> First of all, George C. Scott may feel nicely and does not create bad screws. I adore her sideburns, her long topcoat and hats. She cut many beautiful fashion pictures, and quite handsome gentleman. But sometimes it seems like Scott is enjoying his role like Scrooge and not taking it very seriously! <br /> <br /> This style is the best of the Christmas environment, optimistic and optimistic. Somehow you know that this story is going to be a happy ending. Painted in the city of England in the city of Scruzzar, it seems to be very British in any way. The film has a beautiful musical score, wonderful across all the appropriate parts of the story, vivid caroling music. Sometimes I can often sing Chestashut maize and copper pudding! <br /> <br /> Marily's painful ghost (with her amazing jaw drops) and three strong beliefs of all three spirits. A lovely ethereal lady in the Christmas past, presenting Christmas is amazing giant and emotional, Christmas still discharge and always come foreboding as usual. However, I screwed Frances Freud of Schr√ºg, very quietly silently and quietly silently, I did not see how to kiss. I like the wife of a nephew, whom she named Janet, with her lovely, clear-cut hairstyle. Instead of blind people's bluff, they have created a game known as sepailes, for the nectar's Christmas dinner party, which is a cute little touch, the soul of the screwdriver got the right. <br /> <br /> The Christmas dinners are well illustrated by Cratett and some of their fun (although much appreciated), Bob (David Warner) is well-sympathetic and with long tolerance in his square. Mrs. Crichit Susanhaa portrays Yucatan in York, who played with George C Scott in the wonderful 1970's adaptation of Aye. Above all, this version is undoubtedly the best smallest team, not just an adorable and kind little waf, but rather sick. Those dark circles with his eyes underneath, fragile firearm thing is unlikely to survive hour hours! <br /> <br /> It's a delightful and heartwarming version of the holiday classic. With the atmosphere of its festival, it is sure to be in the spirit of season.
