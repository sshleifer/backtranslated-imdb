I saw the movie when I restored from the bigger surgery. Although I knew it was just a "B" movie, a place in the West, I like it. It may lack a flash of high dollar outputs, it keeps my imagination less and provides great flexibility. Sadly there is so much available in our society, without a little effort, it is very easy. Likewise, I can enjoy the performance of a grade school in Shakespeare, I can appreciate many levels of achievement for the industrial sector. I got involved with a police member and retired LAPD. His hunting like a dream that I will be unable to be at the moment of crisis, I can respond to (or myself) to save the lives of others. When it was a romantic ending where the bad guy in Forensworth (predictable) was out, I needed a happy romance where good could be won. My world is really very folk.
