How can you tell that peaches, its complex descriptions deal with a lot of problems, "a small TV concept" out of me Besides, I can think of many films that have "small TV concept" in their plots. Your obvious dislike of the TV industry ("Su Smith failed to get up on his television background") is confusing. Especially you are having a "great time" such as working on TV. If we can all be as talented as Mr. Smith (no, I am not a friend or relative) - AFI prize is the winner of the Christ, the road from Correan, etc. All made for tv. To think about it, let's take a look at "Angestust the Wind", "Badlain", "The Decimal", "Scales of Justice", "Blue Murder", "Bridge on the Bridge" and other small minor concepts. I think Peaches is a good entertainer film that has made me interested, and most of my friends start from the beginning to the end. It's far from shameless yet I think it's been one of the best Australian movies I've seen in the last few years. Who knows, with some philosophies (there are a lot of things to think about), it can only be there with classics such as "The Year My Voice Break", "The Devils Playground". I really enjoyed this film more than "Somersault" and "Three Dollars". I think these moments have been dealt with their moments-spiritual, atmospheric, realistic and important contemporary issues, but Mr. And Mrs was the average film director and for me to have fun, not only boring, it was very common. Whenever I go to a movie, I am always aware of the response to viewers (film reactions in the movie and with a loud alot of conversations). Some come out of the pitch, blurts their head, make some negative criticisms, but many enjoy the experience.
