My zero interest in rap and veto culture, I like white and classic rock, however, did not stop me from praising this fantastic comedy. Most of its signals are the same movie, instead of simply rap or rock, in the sense of this spell tap. It's still fun. There are many fun tricks but some jokes that just do not flatten. Characters are all very funny and trustworthy. I've seen it because it's 3am It is ridiculed, and any film that can do at least one screening screen. One reason why this movie was so funny is that it makes fun of rap from a different one. Rap today is concerned with the wrong thing and get with the sound of the studio and the little talent. This movie comes from a time where roparis are more eligible for more credit. Overall, it is a fun comedy film about a lot of jokes about racism, sexual and musical culture. These are highly recommended for any fan in Spanish tap. They basically do the same movie, just different world, and yes, both of the same joke work in the movie.
