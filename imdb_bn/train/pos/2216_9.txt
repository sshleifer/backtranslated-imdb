Historical drama and the story of the age of old people involved in the New Orleans Colors of the Eastern Civil War is coming. It takes a slow start but steam up once you've learned about core characters and can start real action. This is not just the story of the exploitation of black women, because it was free people. They did not have all the rights of the white tribe, but they had more control over their destiny than their slaves. In this story, young men will have their own choices about how to live their life, give up the system's impurity or hopeful lives and contribute to their community. I enjoyed all the characters but my loved ones were Christophe, Ana Bella, and Marcel.
