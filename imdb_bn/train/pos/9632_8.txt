Chimney sweepers role This time the idea of ​​having Laurel & Hardy works wonderfully sunny. It guarantees some interesting situations and stupid antics, especially as usual from Stan Laurel. <br /> <br /> There is a sub-plot with a nutrition professor who works on a nutritious source of the film. It does not really sound like a logical mix of story lines and intrinsic but perfectly combining perfectly memorable end lines. It's still a bit weird but it's fun, so it works for the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie's throwing fan is astonishing. Sam Adams is fantastic and the Strategy Bottler and Lucian Littlefill go wildly as a soil professor. <br /> <br /> This movie is filled with a nice time and a sunny sequence, which is all predictable. Yet they are becoming ridiculous to thank everyone on the execution of the death penalty. It helps to create "dirty work" from all "Latin and Hardy shorts". <br /> <br /> 8/10
