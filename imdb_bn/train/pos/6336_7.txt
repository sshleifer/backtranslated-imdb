OK, so FX is not high budget. But this story is based on actual events. Some thrilled actors, even something thrown together to enrich !! Like most films based on books, there are some facts that just do not fit. Only a few people say that this film was based on real events, or most people believe that it is not frustrating! This movie is not related in any way Twitter! In addition to both movies, there is something else about the tornado. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have trouble with the science of film tornadoes and storms, some of them should remember ... The actual "Twist Night" was June 3, 1980. So this movie is released after 16 years of actual event. See the time that storm study has been improved. It happened in a big city; Grand Island, Nebraska is the third largest city in the state. Although the movie is called something else, and it is a small town.
