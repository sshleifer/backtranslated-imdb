I saw Dick Tracy at a very young age. I did not know if there was any actor, and I did not know the way the preview was going to be different from the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This time, Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) killed a very strong man and tried to take the city off with his girlfriend Brehless Mahoney (Madonna) , Whose tracy has her eyes. It gets worse because a new criminal is attacking and the worst part is: This criminal has no face. He is very unknown. Also, the famous villians returned from collection of comic books. <br /> <br /> I was very colorful and creative in this movie. It was especially entertaining and fun to see as a baby. Warren BT played Dick Tracy just like James Bond like the 1930s. <br /> <br /> A shoe of this photo includes: Charlie Courses mo, Glenn Headley, William Force, Dustin Hoffman, James Kane, Ed and Ross, Tommy Lee Jones, Mandy Pattinkin, Charles Darling. Plus more! <br /> <br /> Dick Tracy is a fun movie for all ages to be a movie and fun for a family. Take my word for it.
