I really enjoyed this episode. Seeing flash, cyborg, green arrow, and accident (although he did what he used to do swimming) my eyes widened. Most of the founders of Justice League are trying to bring down Lex Luther, which I am looking forward to. It seems to be a little bit of a matter, but by making a live action, the judicial league show must definitely see me taking a week's view of the week to reduce the amount of work done below the drain. I got this thrill from watching this episode. I hope they will make this episode a bit more, as it is two hours special, because I thought the Justice League was not enough for one hour. Before I bore you before (I already have with my rambling) I just want to say, Smallville is cool again. When focusing on the event, it lost its touch. But I'm sure the authors will go back to that loop hole. :( So enjoy this episode, who knows when another good one will emerge. Again, on Thursday, February 22th, if you miss the first wind.
