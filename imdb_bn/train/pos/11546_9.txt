First seen: July 21, 2008, <br /> <br /> Very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and time in this film. Now 40 years old, it lost any power. Neil Simon shows excellent insight into creating human genres and relationships as well as genuine comedy in unusual situations. Jack Lemon and Walter Might have performed well. Writing for the game based on this film was inspired by the real events in his own life. Uncredited, only 2 Academy Awards: nominated for "Best Adapted Screenplay" and "Best Film Editing". Hollywood rarely comrades' rewards, they are not created in any way.
