In Frank Sinatra's first three films, he was specially a special law: apparently playing himself, he only saw singing a song according to the sequence of nightclubs in another movie. In his fourth movie, very enjoyable 'High and Higher', young blue eyes transformed into acting acting by playing an actual role ... one thing becomes easy because he is playing himself in a fantasy story, which gives him a frustration. Few <br /> <br /> The senator entrance is quite funny. Michael Morgan heard a rope at the door, and asked those who are there. From the outside, 'Frank Sinatra' gives a hawknet-tone voice. Sure enough ... <br /> <br /> 'Higher and higher' open credits can distract some viewers, because the names of Rogers and Heart are specially displayed. In fact, they have contributed only one song to this musical instrument: 'Disgustes Rich', which is directed by this cast as an entirely different song, 'I am a debutante'. Interestingly, Rogers and Heart songs - their weakest one - probably the most enjoyable song in this film scene; Many animated up-tempo numbers, especially 'this is one of the most important things', 'When it comes to love, you're on yourself' and 'I saw you'. <br /> <br /> <br /> The senator is well in this film, but he will do good work elsewhere (and sing good material). The actual qualities of 'higher and higher' are rarely performed by the actors. Paul and Grace Hartman were the most popular husband and wife dancers, who played a number of Broadway revivals: In fact, interesting Bollywood dancers, they keep a lot of physical comedy in their dance stuff. (Here, Grace is a high kick that threw shoes from Paul's hand.) Grace Hartman died of cancer at the age of 48, almost no film worked, so it is a real pleasure that this film gives us a rare chance to see her close up , How to listen to the voice of her beautiful singer and her maid's uniform looks sexy After Grace Hartman's death, her husband had a long career as an actor, sometimes occasionally dancing. (Or cab berry as well as a memorable episode of 'Maybelie RFD'). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ /> <br /> <br /> Why does this talented girl do more movies? Perhaps he was very little with the personality of Betty Hatton. I enjoy Hutton's performance, but I like Mercy McGuire better. At the end of 'High and Higher', McGuire and Mary Wicks have an attractive bite of physical business as waitress, it is moving from a rotating table to the table. Little McGuire and Long Glavie are rising Sunny alternatives to Wikis! Sadly, although Leon Errol plays a big role in 'High and Higher', he is not given almost any comedy business: Once he dances on his famous rubber foot dance. Jack Haley, despite his prominent billing, has been lost. <br /> <br /> Dully Wilson is well represented here, certainly 'Casablanca' is remembered as Sam. Wilson used to sing his song in that film, but he used to call the effect of the keyboard of 'Ed Time Guy by'. (In real life, Wilson could not play piano.) 'High and Higher' here, he has been singing lovely songs and giving some interesting reactions to other players. The less enjoyable Mel is Melious, I mean Mel Torme. Victor Bourge has performed here in a rare film, his conversation has been glossy, but he has no keyboard comedy that he did not complete successfully on his stage later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />? Forget it There is no idea of ​​'superb' music, 'higher and higher', but it's a delightful delight, and I'll rate it 8 out of 10. Director Tim Vellan, who has worked in Britain and Hollywood, is very well-known and well-known.
