Heltholi was making a signal to Henry Flower when I first heard that I was excited (it was a personal favorite for many years now), and then when I heard that I had to do something with terrorism I was alerted. Although I saw it, I was surprised when working as a completely different film than Henry's flower. Both writing and direction died and the act was extraordinary ... special interest came back to Henry's son to complete the cast of Huntly, which was originally just four. Although I said, this movie is quite different from the beginning, but it works: I consolidated myself with the change of voice and content that had passed 10 years and the letters were found in very different situations in the first film. In this case, an unexpected adventure takes place ... and that's what I'll go ... I do not have to mention what I understand again to understand what's going on and who's double crossing. Although it was definitely one of the few good movies, it is suffering from many signals as it ends, it seems that Hartley is now planning the third and the film will release you hanging. Do not forget to buy my ticket for part 3 ('Henry Grim'?) In 2017.
