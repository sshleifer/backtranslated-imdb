Three girls (a female female activist, classmate Barbara Bachch, not less than one) should visit a small town under a festival, leaving the rented rooms at home and avoid them like plugs. Some of the unexpected dialogue scenes and a thin plot-line (which does not work secret secrets in secret) suffer from it. Especially an underlying theme is quite annoying (vintage shock-metal), and basically how the film flows. Performance and cinematography are very similar (much higher than most of the late 80/80 of the same 80's), but really suggest me that this movie is a fairly long final scene in the basement-setting. From the moment the character of "Keller Junior" was presented, my jaw drops were opened and its performance was not closed until the end of the film. The actor was very surprised to see Sidney Lashik (who "jumped on one Kakuro's nose", and now fully immersed in "Invisible") played a leading role.
