Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a great actor. This less known movie gives Cage one of its best performances. "Red Rock West" was a low budget, almost notorious film, but is always one of my favorite movies. I saw it walking on the Video Store Acule, and wanted to see Cage and Hooper (who is also the best in the film?) Together. Get one of these, and I'm sure you will not be disappointed.
