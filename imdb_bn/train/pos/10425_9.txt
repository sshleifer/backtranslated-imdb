Great Caruso was the biggest hit in the world in 1951 and broke the box office records in Radio City Music Hall in a year when most "Movergoers" are watching their new 7 "Motorola Television." Almost all recent box office statistics lie- because they failed to adjust to inflation Clearly today there are 10 films that can be captured. In 1951, it spent $ 90 to $ 1.60 in radio city; The 44c to 75c was first performed in Louis's Palace in Washington, DC, or how many can not count the number of responses from 35c to 50c, not the "media spin" of incompatible box office box office. The great carrier genius is that movie makers took most of the real life of Enrico Caruso (not really a great story), and instead, the focus of 90% movie was on the music. MGM is doing our best living opera singer Mario Lanza, the best historical singer, Enrico Carrose. The result was an extraordinary movie. Very bad Lanza will throw his life and career away on odds. The student prince plays very fat, Edmund Paramedum takes his place - with the voice of Lancer's voice, and in front of the picture with the beautiful and dirty langer. If you want to see Great Carousel, it's almost always $ 2.00 or less ebay. Do not close at a lower price, because it only reflects the simple availability of copies, not the quality of the movie.
