Well it was a wonderful surprise after all. His trailer did not predict a good movie, it was even a bit confusing. Especially Jeff Bridges's part is a positive surprise, good writing, simple and fun. Although less real, I do not think that the person he got will show such disagreement with all the things that are in favor of his current company. One suddenly all doubts never become a top case. The end of the movie was very close to Claus, and was quite frustrating while showing Dosle Vita. And of course, a man like Peg's character will not be like this in the first week of New York blight. I hope one day I will see a suitable role for megan fox, here she saw a poor actress playing bibo. And anyway, I do not see why that year's "sex symbol", I can see hot girls in almost every cover of every magazine.
