I rent this movie from Blockbuster ... I like Alan Arin and began to cover the cover ... I used to fall behind and knew that this is not the best or the worst movie ... I'm lucky .. I started from the beginning Ultimately laughing .. Alan Arkin brings a great character in this movie. I bought a used rental copy for my collection and always saw it. I revisited this movie to load the load of these people and they all enjoyed it as much as I did ... I see complaints about menus and DVDs function .. but it does not go away from the movie. The disc was written for Blockbuster Exclusively, So they did not allow you to exclude previews. As well as you should not be given the functions of the DVD deterr you from watching the fantastic movie.
