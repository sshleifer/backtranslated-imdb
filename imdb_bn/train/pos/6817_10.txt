I love the movie, it was a very interesting fantasy movie b / c's true meaning, the history of our country, the fun work in the movie. I see time @ 4 weeks of week and I love it! I hope to see Susan's father in the past and Susan does not have any telephone, computer, games or anything in the 21st century with her new sister. I hope everyone else will enjoy the movie as much as I thought you could say I was at the time of the big fanatic and I do not think so. Lil son Robert Lincoln Walker in the film was simply awesome, I wonder who he is and how old he is today. Does anyone know if someone has acted on movies or TV shows?
