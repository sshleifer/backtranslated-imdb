After reading the Diamond Books, I was a little disappointed in the series, but all of them, it is quite informative. To read other comments, it is comforting to know that 'fighters fighters' are hardworking, under attack every 'insanity' on Western civilization. <br /> <br /> Diamond is a little campaign? Of course. Many like academics, he saw his theory as the most important thing. He consistently uses the 'guns, germs, and steel' phrases in each opportunity during the series. After the first 10 minutes we get it. <br /> <br /> Is Diamond a little straight (series)? Of course. Spaniards' part in South America is particularly interesting, narrowing down a few long, complex history to 'shampoos, sword and horses', in nearly 15 minutes, covering the whole of South American conquest. But the point is considered valid - the reasons for the success of Spaniard's success against established cultures actually contribute to these things (but not completely defined). <br /> <br /> Is he campaigning against Western civilization? No Not a word. Not my ears He said that the fate has played a large part in the development of any culture more quickly, * not * that is the only reason for that fate. <br /> <br /> In the end, if you are looking for something that your own sense of greatness, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in all the reasons rather than influencing the success or failure of the society, then this series presents an effective interpretation of historical evidence.
