Let's face it: The final season (# 8) I was one of the worst seasons (most of the time I could not find the dried spell throughout the season). But if you judge this show in the last season, of course it is seen as worse. It is a totally unfair evaluation - because "that's the show of '70" was a brilliant and ridiculous sitcom about his days, a pre-era, and how people who lived here were not different than the modern times we were here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Playing their friends, Danny Mastersson (Hayd), Mila Kunis (Jackie), Wilmer Valderrama (Fez) and even Ashton Kutcher (Kelso) give fantastic performance in each episode. The best one is probably Fez, a foreign exchange student who mentally promiscuous as they get. What is he from the country? Try to think it! For another level of entertainment, Debra Joe Rupp and Kurtwood are elegant as Smith Eric's parents. Rupp, KT, both weak and sweet, as Mrs. Brady meets with Mary Baron, Smith's red is essentially available for everyone to be afraid of the pogis. Don Stark and Tania Roberts play very well against each other, Doan's parents, captivating but favorite Bob and aviator Midge. Tommy Chong, sometimes known as Leya, is a Stone who works as a father of Hyde. <br /> <br /> There are many frequently pop-up and sometimes top lessons (and that is the ultimate final season) that come in, "70 '" amazing writing, spot-on direction and feeling through every episode - a terrific VB with a good VB Show They're all right.
