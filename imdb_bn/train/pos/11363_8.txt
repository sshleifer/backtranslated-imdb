Imagine the frustration of a bureaucracy that a person spent eight years of life and tried to vitiate mentality that he himself was trying to solve the massacre! The murder strategy is clear, but a government unwilling to accept the truth destroys the life of the monster. When I think my job gets buried, I remember the real story behind this wonder. Respect for the duty of the main character was neutrally represented by Ray. The relationship between the comedy (and almost sad) and the character of Sutherland is one of my favorite films in the last 5 years. One of the most deadly mass murderers in history kept me at the edge of my seat. Although not nearly as being advertised and talked about as "the lamb silence", the plot was just suspenseful.
