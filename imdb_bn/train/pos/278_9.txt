I would say, Clive Barker's Anding is the most awesome game ever created. I played Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Evil Dead and Caslavania games, but none of them are taking this pure lane with which this game is dealing with its terrible elements. It is good that Barker has done what we do, which adds horrors to our world and clearly shows his hand everywhere in this game. Hack, even play as one of the original characters of his voice. As the full horror of terrifying visual and in adequate atmosphere, my book will be reduced to beat. I just wanted to make it a console system but nipped one of the buds that buds selling too bad.
