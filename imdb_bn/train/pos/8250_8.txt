This film was held in the 1950s. According to the deceased (called jumbo) live feed has been raised. However, when a company has developed a collar, zombies keep near the neck, makes them docile and perfect servants. Robinson's mother Helen (Kerry-Anne Moss), Father Bill (Dillon Baker) and son Timmie (K'sune Ray) hired a junkie because everyone in their block already has it. Team name became Jumby Fido (Billy Conny) and became friends with him. But his father hated him and lost control of Timmy Faido and something went wrong. <br /> <br /> You can see it - among a lot of things - stand for a shot of Lassie in the series of "Laassie" with fido. There was a reason to name it! Every single of the famous Lassie episode is spun here. Help fido stop before helping me send Timmy kicks when my favorite! It is also a mockery of the 1950s Douglas Sirac, where everything is bright and colorful - but dark secrets are different from people. The characters wear very bright 1950's (Muses are always in a dress) - furniture, settings and cars, especially in all bright colors in the 1950s. Even when the script is repeated, there is always something to look for. The script is good - but you can only have many lassie jokes. Melodramatics kind of stupid but cast pulls it off. Excellent and right on each goal here. Even Connolly does a good job as a passionate zombie. Moses is the best - playing each line for each of his pricing --- but never going to the overboard. <br /> <br /> It's not all (of course). Most people can lose satirism and the gotha ​​is pretty good. Gothi is so unexpectedly done and it is extremely difficult to play with happy music. So, for some people, this really will work. I give it 8.
