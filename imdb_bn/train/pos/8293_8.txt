As a 90 minute experience, it is not up to the value of 'Drive', because the actor is definitely 'Who am I?' They learned their business. Academy, when the order of action is usually better than the impressive Mark Dacascos who are above the MM. However, those who enjoyed 'Drive', (and I thought it was wonderful!), Would undoubtedly enjoy it too. You must not come back to the beginning and see it again, but you will definitely come back to the action scene for a while. <br /> <br /> While refreshing to see it in Hong Kong, the practice of human rights war dancing is still going on, and I want to see what people can do with budget, time and respect, like Yuen Woo-Ping and Corey Yuen Kuei. If you sit through the first half-hour and are not sent crazy by the oppressive dialogue, then you are for a treatment. Bosch is fantastic, and can really do a step bust with some fantastic acrobatics, kicks and easy work of courage. <br /> <br /> If you are lucky enough to have a copy in 500 miles, then track it down and watch it. It's not Shakespeare. Actually, this is not less clear than the 'China Strike Force' coolie, but you will be impressed by both the stunt team's exhibition and pain steps - (I'm sure you do not have a safe way of direct landing, or a wooden car with a fast car Will roof pet head be forced ??) <br /> <br />
