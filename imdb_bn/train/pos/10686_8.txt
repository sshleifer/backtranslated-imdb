And I'm a Nicole Kidman fanatic. I used to read and listen to the book in Moscow, which I know, he was working while speaking Russian in this movie. <br /> <br /> The four principals are nice, but the movie itself holds several good pictures and good scenes together. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br>> While watching a movie, one of these visitors asked too much. <br /> <br /> It was very fun (which is part of it) or quite terrible (which it was in a scene), but the director does not seem to go any way.
