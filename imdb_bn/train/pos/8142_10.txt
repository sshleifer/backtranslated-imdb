Chances are, you will see this movie incredibly stupid, incredible for the first time. But, if you see it second and third and fourth and fifth times by it (I'm now better in the century), you find yourself spitting a line from here and there and cracking yourself! My friends and I are really afraid of the fear of our Black Hat party, as they say, "down with the riots".
