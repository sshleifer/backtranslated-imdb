I am surprised to comment on the poster that Jane Powell has made similar films, Wing Durban. Although they were both young spirits, whose filmmakers were composed by Joe Passastak, if this movie gives any indication, they were almost opposite to the pole. <br /> <br /> Among the three smart girls, Durvan is an inspirational "Little Miss Focus", after some disappointments, her reunited father-mothers lead to her reconstruction, her 'semi-rebuilding, three daring daughters', Jane Pavel Her screen almost destroyed the marriage of mother Jeanette MacDonald and new rituals Jos√© Iturir when she refused to accept her and had a strong weapon Her younger siblings reject her, too much. I saw in Durbin and Powell movies, I would say these amazing qualities that surrounded the early films of this talented young actors. <br /> <br /> For the role of Durbine among the three smart girls, I find it a complete winner, and the most impressive. Although it is also evident from his sometimes intense and exaggerated line reading in some more energetic scenes that it is an early film based on a dinner, confident, intelligent, and naturally energized approach that he provides his line and performs overall, and he manages more serious scenes Low and humble approach, you never assume that it is a 14 year old girl Her first film role was in which the previous professional experience was almost exclusively for almost two years of voice instruction. <br /> <br /> This film and Baroque have publicly published itself as "The Public Opinion of the Public", but for any film of any age, production can be a difficult situation, but you do not know it easily from the Durbin display on screen and on screen. . Even before the camera, he is clearly developing his acting style and mentality (it was equally true to the early performances of more experienced contemporaries like Garland, Rooney, O'Connor and Jane Powell), his first film by Durbine Cameras, and his warmth in project film, even here , Even in his first film, he remains highly liked despite the rapid impulsiveness of his character. Run up, and although he is occasionally currents, he never for a second project, which is coy and Jane Powell arch qualities and achieving a lot of success with other young sopranasa followed later. <br /> <br /> In short, like all the great singers star, Durbin is just a "beautiful throat." On the other hand, Durbin's pure lyricist Saproon is really a great and magnificent instrument, the most wonderful thing to me, the slightest impact of the song project or the "grandes" can play its songs besides me. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The first-grade screwball professionals like Charles Winner, Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Ray Molland and Mischa Eau - La-Kreim The story is light and entertaining. True, it is rarely "realistic", but why would anyone expect it? If you want to: "Realistic" WRATH WRAP or Trip of WILL Rentals. On the other hand, if you look for a wonderful, sweet, fun and entertaining family comedy, this movie will not disappoint you, with a wonderful, vibrant and talented teenager "lead" and awesome supporters.
