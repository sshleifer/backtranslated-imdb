James Keyneren's "The Postman Always A Great Tip of Ring Tuvis", Lucino Wiskinti's first film, originally shot around Italy in an anti-war in Italy. The real negative was thought to be broken but Wiscunti preserved a print and thankfully we could see this primary neo-realistic work. Messimo Girota and Clara Kalamai (who recently released her breasts in La São Della Béphété) "(1941), starring her husband's assassin's conspiracy the sensational and unfortunate lover. The extraordinary end, though the crime is not paid, a person is not directly involved in the crime Such payouts provide excellent direction, script, performance and film screenplay. "Le Dare of France Near turinta "(1939) is not as good, but probably just the US version (1946)) lana Turner and John Garfield featuring major role. Highly recommended.
