Many people judge this as a fan service because the actor is a very talented star (Gatte, Hayd and Wang Lee home famous singer in Japan). But do not judge it before you watch, what I say. While making this film, Gack and Staff were very serious, and they worked so hard. It is a good film with a tougher story inside. Several scenes may be so much fun and others are very sad. They made it so well until I can stop it all seeing again <br /> <br /> The story is very well written, but I acknowledge that their work is frustrating. This is especially for the Haid, because his acting skills are different from the other and speaks strange words while speaking to other languages ​​other than (Japan). But, this is understandable because it's their first time to work in the movie. <br /> <br /> I think Gect is trying to show us how much our life can be so weak during losing the most important person. When Toshi died, when the show asked Keike to make an e-chake like her vampire because she would not let her die, when the sire brother died, who killed the perfect son, and passed the best and beautiful scene while passing the shaw. Even I said, Hayd's skill is still weird, but I gave him two thump of the scene <br /> <br /> There is a time where the plot goes very fast, because why could the boy join the local mafia and the enemy of sleep because they In the past, a good friend and son are a brother's brother. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I love this movie ~ (much more ^^). <br /> <br /> This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story.
