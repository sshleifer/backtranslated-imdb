I saw that movie a few days ago. This movie is so big that it thinks that if you want something bad that you've always dreamed about - you can get it. This shows a great desire to buy true happiness and sadness, hopelessness and failure. But if you are strong enough and your heart really has something to do with your love, then you can do something different and be happy.
