Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, "Scarface" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Casino) arrives in America for American Dream Montana then became the "king" in the drug world because he brutally carried out his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and it's unpleasant to see some scenes. The film has about 180+ F-words and it is about three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will not bored. You're happy for the drug lord, and in some scenes you find that Montana is not as bad as other criminals criminals. This is a wonderful composition and I recommend you see this. You do not have to be frustrated. 9/10
