I have seen all the football films, this is the best one. Having another fever pitch. But heroes can always be the greatest player of all time and then worldwide as Diego Maradona as the greatest player ever. This story is primarily centered around it, but from time to time, the other giants revolve around. <br /> <br /> Musical scores developer and images are strong. Described by Michael Caine aptly and calmly dramatic. This story is not about different games in the World Cup; Rather it is more about players' emotion and the beauty of the event. <br /> <br /> Exciting games like Brazil (in all the greatest games of all time) in France were covered with the same vein. The final Argentine vs. Way of Germany was the same vein. Highly recommended. World football is a classic See you again, if you're a Maradona fan then esp.
