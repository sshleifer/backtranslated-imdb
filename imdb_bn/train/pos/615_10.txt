The story of this story! Villain is completely mischievous and the heroes are refreshingly pure. Danes, Denro and Pofife are wonderful, as well as new actors who play the role of Tristan. Exceptional performance, delightful magic, funny and dramatic, and finished is a perfect fairy tale absolutely fabulous! I'm not sure that all content is suitable for small kids but for older listeners, there are lots of ridiculous subtleties! Preview this movie do justice! My mother tongue and I was quite suspicious but was so thrilled that we took an opportunity to do this movie that I can only try to assure anyone about this movie!
