No movie has grabbed my attention like this. You see, I wanted to see this movie again for 25 years. One and only time I saw it was a teenager, which was published in 1977. <br /> <br /> I think about this movie that it has touched deep emotional emotions so deeply that there is still a great desire to see it. This film ensures the human soul by touching the human element and searching through the search of the father / son. Why is this movie not brought out from the repository and at least a lot of other films have been shown, I do not know. <br /> <br /> PostScript: I received a copy of the movie and was happy to see it again. That held true in my memory. Ratings reflect movie content. To watch this movie in DVD, the 1977 production of VHS Tape used to be taken away from the overall quality.
