Why these days can not make more director such a horror movie like "burning"? There is a simple answer: Modern day director Stanley Kubrick is not. Once upon a time with this movie, he proved that he was one of the real greatest directors and filmmakers. <br /> <br /> So, the plot is fairly simple. A person named Jack Torrance (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) and his family moved to a big, exclusive hotel to supervise it for offspring. It is convicted that the hotel's former caretaker killed his wife and two daughters. How to follow can be easily compressed by the title of the movie, but I have to see it to see what you mean. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie to "push me". "It's messed up with some importance, but it's a great way." One of the things that adds scary factor is the amazing music. Music is a major part of Kubrick's movies (2001 : A Space Odesi and a Clockwork Orange, only for a couple naming) and he is definitely not frustrated with this one. Score sets the tone completely and Without the image, it will not be the same. <br /> <br /> Finally, I have to comment on Nicholson's legendary performance.Jack is terribly convincecing as a crazy killer. In fact, only his strong stolen few scenes in this movie. Which should be seen to believe. <br /> <br /> There will not be any scary movie that matches this one perfectly. RIP Stanley
