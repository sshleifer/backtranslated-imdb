A superb and engaging play in search of infamous Russian serial killer André Chicatillo. As a forensic scientist, Stephen Ray is responsible for investigating artificial performance, who has found the biggest obstacle in his progress, the Russian government, especially the members of the old communist party who want to maintain a closed society. <br /> <br /> The movie has an underlying theme about the collapse of a communist society and the progress of looking for the murderers is reflected in the progress of social and political changes in Russia, which are completely integrated. There are old ways and new ways of contradiction and these are represented by Ray's superior (played by Donald Sutherland) two views, and Ria himself. These are the first constant, looking at Sislerland's 'high' system, and watching the 'low' on the ground. However, there is a common reason for them ?? Catch the serial killer. The relationship between these two develops throughout the film, and the film rays and sutherland and rays and the last stage of Sutherland gradually become tense, the killer is caught, and the Glasnost symbolic comes. Nice script <br /> <br /> More credits go to Sadrland's performance, which is extraordinary and sympathetic, we hate as Jeffrey Demon as a killer, but we can not hate him and Max Van Saidō, who is the risk of his fame to help the faithful as a humble psychologist .
