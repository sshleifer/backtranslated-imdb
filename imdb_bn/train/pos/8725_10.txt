I like the trunk, but like "this bug life". Animation that is paying off this. I would definitely be getting this on DVD. However, this photo of Disney should be on a widescreen screen tape. (I speak squishing all the characters on the screen in the standard video format) The last credit that would give maximum consent was the funniest! I just saw two sets, but could not see the other!
