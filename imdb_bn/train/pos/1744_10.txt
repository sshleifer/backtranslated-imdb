A few years ago, many big studio serial films were broadcasted, which was featured in the movie theater on the news events of the current events, and in particular on Saturday afternoon with cartoons. (The parents loved most) "Moon's return" was the episode of 12 episodes, where Chandu (Bela Lugosi), "Mysterious Mr. Wang", travels on a magician and Lemuria island with 34 natural powers. Rescue the captive princess of Egypt, (Nadzi) Maria Alba, "Dr. Terrell's House of Horrors", 43 Princess Nadzi is captured in Ubasti's black magic religion, who believes that she is the resurrection of their long dead goddess Osana. These 12-episode serials bring you time again and are produced very well, considering we're talking about 1934!
