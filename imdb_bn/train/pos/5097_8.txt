This is a very rare film and probably at least known from Shirley Temple because it is not its collection. Perhaps because this is not a happy ending, unlike all its other films. Because it is not a musical instrument, though he has belt a song called 'The World Wishes the World.' This movie was created in 1934 and is mainly black and white, my version is in color and VHS, I would say they did a job. The color works as well as a realistic look, differently I'll call Lorele and Hardy's colorful movies which are awesome. I am surprised that the film is good for its age and not the date of the story. Some scenes of Gary Cooper and Carol Lomerdar seem to have pulled out, in some scenes, they seem to take fifty minutes, which they can say in 5. This image will not be closed because there are some really good moments in this film, especially when {Jerry} Cooper Cooper steals a necklace, and hides in Sherly's Teddy Bear. Increasing the tension and slow pace of his action, {as well as his daughter singing to the audience in another room} Very well guided. Gary and Carol are very good at eye exposure when they are kept under practice. This is a good film from the early 30's, taking for his age.
