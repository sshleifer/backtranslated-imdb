Sylvan Murphy and Rachel McAdam are the star / thriller star and Suspense Master, Wes Craven himself. A hotel in Miami, the whole movie starts with some problems at the Lux Atlantic. The problem is the hotel manager Lisa Riester. Then he goes to the airport, and all the problems are there. He does not like Jack Jackson to call Jack Jack the Ripper, if you know him and I mean. Then they are flat, and enough crazy boards, Rippner and Reisert sit beside each other. For the next half an hour, Lisa is scared by Terror, Trouble, and Rippner. I will not give anything away. Then we are going to pursue Lisa at Jack Airport. Then Lisa went to her house and found that her dad was okay and he got mad, Ripner is already there. There are about twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout the entire scene. At all, nearly 25 minutes of intense activity ends. <br /> <br /> Only the movie was not intense but it was a great plot. As I said, I can not give anything because it is so frustrating and exciting and a bit annoying / terrible. And played from every single character in the movie, in addition to any line, all pitch was perfect. It was incredible. Everything was awesome in this movie! Acting, music, influence, make-up, direction, editing, writing, everything was amazing! Wes Craven is definitely Suspense Master. Red Eye definitely must see a course and of course your money is worthless. You can see this movie over and over again and it will never be annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The original MPA rating: PG-13: some serious sequence of violence, and language <br /> <br /> My MPA rating : PG-13: Violence, and some extremely intense sequence of languages ​​<br /> <br /> My Canadian Rating: 14a: Violence, Horror Scene, Boring Content
