It is extraordinary to see a movie where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can think that the film is a little less interested in its presence, if there is, <br /> <br /> - Actually, there are so many scenes that are very fast And seems to have been shot unintentionally - a seemingly low budget, a strange plot about a man, who had a defrosted pastor and other week's points. Want, Pierre's presence <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />. She does not scream and applausees so those who think that she only drink three wine wine. In the next case, the dial in Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable. "Do you carry a man?" Asks Marndon, he hates himself for what he has done. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I think "Le Defroke" is a very strange film, but should be seen by the audience - if good things are compulsory, then it is a movie history Very rare jewelry. <br /> <br />
