The Perfect Sona is the story of two 30 brothers and sisters, who thinks "perfect" and others basically screw up, often landing themselves in the drug rehabilitation center. After the death of their father, two long absences and normal siblings were resurrected after the two were reunited. As long as "perfect" brother encourages AIDS that he has AIDS, an irresponsible younger brother eventually takes steps to get his life and takes some responsibilities. <br /> <br /> The film is an excellent job of "Returning" Chronicle of the younger brother, although it may sometimes seem a bit distant (drug addiction is not so easy to hit). The treatment of AIDS makes it more flexible, which is something that has become somewhat narrow in the movie over the last 5-10 years. And as well as developing a sweet relationship between the two ex-damned brothers is very credible and good work. Both of the two main actors were very capable, if they were not very charitative. <br /> <br /> Strong first attempts by director and writer Leonard Fergin, whose own brother died from AIDS. The end is done nicely. <br /> <br />
