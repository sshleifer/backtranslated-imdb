The brightness of this movie is quite terrific even a suitable dentist. It's the first concern of people to fear. This movie is waiting every night of the movie at night. Corbin Bernsen gives an amazingly unhealthy performance as a crazed dentist, which I think tries to kill people but he only works on his teeth so that it does not really work. Especially in the important scene, we have found so much actor actor, Earl Bowen that his teeth have been completely destroyed with drills and kittots, which I guess is that the worst thing you can do when you become a killer dentist is the worst. It is a general Brian Yuzna situation, not well written but there are grooms. The plot is frustrating and sometimes made in spots, but hey, it's a murderous dentist, we all thought about it but they did it first.
