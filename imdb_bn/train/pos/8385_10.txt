This picture seems to be bad criticism for some reason. Perhaps only by the population. However, this is actually a very interesting movie. The film is a modern budget movie which is really an interesting story and good scenery. <br /> <br /> This picture may not be for everyone though. If a Sci-Fi supporter reads it, but if you like good oral scientist fiction, I really recommend this movie. Pictures have crazy ideas. This setting includes nations fighting with gigantic machines that the entire nations invest in all its money! The world has been divided into regions. Anyone else can challenge others in battle or others as 'robot-duel'. The methods of war crimes are better than the nuclear war, because now everyone is wearing these breathless masks. Definetly is a movie that makes you think. Intelligent, good writing, and good impact for the minimum budget. <br /> <br /> I have a small budget and really like to work.
