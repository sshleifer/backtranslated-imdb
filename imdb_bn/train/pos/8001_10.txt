Of course I have seen several times the best movie one. Fine direction and flawless performance make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington is one of his most compelling and emotional role dates, and the rest played nicely. Although Christopher Walken must have been fantastic in his part, he did not like it. A story that is desperate temptation to offset against innocence and love. This is also a movie for action movie lovers because it has a fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a sense of seed and corruption that itself opens an eye. All in all, a truly gripping film from start to finish. Highly recommended!
