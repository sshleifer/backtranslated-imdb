Although before the target audience I always got a soft spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally energized by the return of Nancy Drew on screen. <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie. Central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in simple simple terms with the hazard dash for young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threat seriously, so young audience members will not be disturbed. <br /> <br /> What I really appreciated from this story was that the final result was rather serious and meaningful and Nancy was able to understand and grow from the experience. <br /> <br /> <br /> > <br /> <br /> Emma Roberts is great as Nancy Drew and we hope we can see another mystery again.
