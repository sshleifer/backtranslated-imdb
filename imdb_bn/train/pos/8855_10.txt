Sydney Lumet, though one of the old active managers, has still got the game! A few years ago he "proved to be a criminal", to everyone who can work with Win Diesel actually, if he is an opportunity and a right director. After this film, he retired (the real masterpiece in my eyes), nobody could blame him. But she is still strong, her next movie has been announced for 2009. <br /> <br /> But here we are with this movie. Cast list is incredible, top notch of their performance. The slightest idea of ​​their performance, "real" dialogue and / or the situation developed throughout the film is simply amazing. The time of the film (time), which keeps your toes full of time, mixes evenly on time, that the edit seems to be natural / faultless. Height increases by the story, even in a "normal" time frame, it was at least one good movie (theater / thriller). I can only highly recommend it, left you up! Hey)
