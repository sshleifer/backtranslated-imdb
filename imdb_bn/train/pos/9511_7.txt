A bloody gangster story committed in years of Great Depression. It tells us about our infamous Hit Man, Michael (Mike) Sallyan. Somehow, the story revolves around this time: Mike has struggled to save his life and his only remaining boy, because the rest of his family died due to his master's dirty play. He succeeded in his revenge and saved his son a respectable future, but eventually killed him. These stories will not last forever. <br /> <br /> Michael played the role of Slian's senior senior actor Tom Hans and Mr. Paul Newman was run by Rooney (Mafia boss). The film creates a great impression and we hear the well-known phrase "We loot banks". Although this image is still valuable, you can expect something bigger than Sam Mendes after American American beauty.
