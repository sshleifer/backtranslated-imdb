For example, see emerging scenes with remote villages in the mountains of Serbia, low-tech devices that protect the integrity and life of residents, Nostalgia for good days of communist rule and awakening young brat Soviet Ultrasound is seen by its nude teacher Kusturica not only tried to quit the tragedy of Serbia's history described in his previous movie, but the process itself created a whole world. <br /> <br /> This is not a political film or an obvious political film in any case. It's a fun film before all. Kusturica we create a set of caring characters. Music in these films plays an active role, like other active movies. His style is straight and surprising, what we now think of his character and we know he wants to feel like us.
