Steven Spielberg (24A) directed two amazing episodes of 1971 series "The Psychologist", starring Roy Thins. One episode was about a emotionally disturbed 12-year-old son and another about a vibrant young man (Cluj-Gulager his best performance) who was about to die of cancer. Both episodes are stunning, anything else on TV, and emotionally complex and unlike adults. Richard Levinson and William Link's creator of "psychologist" who created "Colombo" and created his first season. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Columbo", like Bernard Kowalski and Jack Smith, but in spell "The Psychoistist" <br /> <br /> In Spieberg's "Dewel" DVD, he said that he liked Steven Boucho's "Book of Mordad" script (based on Levinson / Link Stories), and he tried to see the product as millions of dollars features, even if It had very little meaning for working with him. <br /> <br /> This episode of "Colombo" is far more stylish and serial is always used for top managers, although the sound track is more than any other "Columbo" episode and Background music makes good use. Spielberg is very folk and cassidy managed to save too much from being able to add, but both actors still have fun Spielberg also gets a very supportive role from Martin Milner, Rosemary Forosoth and Barbara Colby, all the performances are a fresh and vivid about them. The only "Columbo" episode with the episode of "By Do's Arnite Lite" with Patrick McGough (directed by Harvey Heart) Was done. <br /> <br /> I think this episode of "two episodes of psychologist" and "Columbo", as Spielberg's director, advised not to technically develop, he was great since the beginning. "War!" starring Albert Salmy DVD commentator Robert Altman of a 1962 session guest said that this episode was never found as a director, probably the same Spielberg is true.
