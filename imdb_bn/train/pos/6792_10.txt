I remember this game. It was always looking alone, until one day I decided to try something new for change, and got this game. I'm surprised to see this as it was the first game of PS1, which was 4 disks owned by me. When I played it, I could not put down the controller seriously. <br /> <br /> The story of this game is very well-matched, it is as good as the final fantasy seventh story, and it is hard to do. When you play the game, you are so involved with characters that it is incredible that it is simply a PS1 game, it seems like a movie. And I believe it should be made in a movie. <br /> <br /> This game is very illusory game and just someone did not like it or liked it, because it's a game that sits on the end of the end, trying to sell it to 50% off the mark. Well, I'm one of those people who are always looking at the end, and try them out, and most of them are going to be really good. Hack, how I reached the final fantasy seventh place, I saw a catalog and found it. But it differs from the Final Fantasy. <br /> <br /> Legend of Dragon, the only game or RPG which is better than Square Enrico Games, surprisingly. I'm not surprised if it is made by Square Enix but it's not. I can play any game better than the final fantasy series, or the Dragon Quest series, but it's one. But the real bug is why it is not very familiar and appreciated why it should be. <br /> <br /> Graphics are good for the PS1 game, but what can you expect from it? It is a PS1 man made in 1999. The story I've already mentioned is amazing, almost the seventh. Characters are an amazing one, you are so involved with them and their actions <br /> <br /> One out of 10 is 10. Certainly more qualified to be appreciated and a well-done RPG by any other company except Square Enix
