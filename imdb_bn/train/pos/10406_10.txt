Abu, the title of Baghdad, helped King Ahmad get his kingdom back from his evil sorcerer. <br /> <br /> Europe's war is going on and important parts of the world are burning in the fire, Sir Alexander Cordon unveiled the London movies, this extraordinary palanquin rental from the legend of the Arabic Knights. Completed with swords and witchcraft, it gave short vacation listeners from the title in 1940. It is one of the subtle parts of filmmaking, which is well-regarded and featuring an intelligent script. <br /> <br /> Conrad Viett gets the top billing and he plays it legal, evil magical jafar. His saturnine face with his disguised eyes makes the count of macabre played with such taste during silent days. Here is an arched value for watching observers. Like an adult thief, Sabu has played this role, his third picture. Although the term is not a hero in general, its character must be heroic and condemnable in action. <br /> <br /> The rest cast works well. John Justin as a miracle king is both strong and sensitive, who can learn the realities of hard work; Sabu gets a significant portion of the action (when she is not transformed into a dog) but Justin is a suitable athlete when needed. The boyfriend plays the miserable Rajkumar, who is deceived by two very different men. The film appeared late, shaking things as a gin with an attitude of huge Rex Ing. <br /> <br /> <br /> Allan Jeays Storyteller uses his fine voice as well as the advantage.

His first four films (Elephant BOY-1937, The Drum-1938, Baghdad-1940, Jungle Book-1942 Thief) were his best and he came out of Hollywood after completing himself. After the prominent military service in World War II, he resumed his film career, but he continued to be a part of the black caste (1947) ethnic role in great small films. His final film, a Tiger Walsh of Walt Disney (1964), was an improvement, but it was too late. At the end of 1963, Sabu died of heart disease, only 39 years old.
