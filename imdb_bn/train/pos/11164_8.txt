A century ago, the competition between Chuck Connors and Steve Brody in Brooklyn and their rival Volunteer Fire Brigade goes to Brady's famous bet that he could jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. This is a story that will be known to many people since 1949 by Bugs Bunny Spuf, "Bouwary Bags". <br /> <br /> This is usually a very enjoyable movie that will probably be widely available if it is not a notorious and troubled scene involving some Chinese tenant residents - a time capsule of antiviral ethnicity, which in my view gave this film a major part of historical interest. .
