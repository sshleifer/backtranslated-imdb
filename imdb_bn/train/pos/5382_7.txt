After watching the Next Action Star Reality TV series, I was happy to see the winners directly. I was leery at such a showcase of new talents, but I was pleasantly surprised and thrilling. Billy Zen, of course, had his usual great self, but Corne and San was by his side beside him. Jamie and Jane (from the competition) were also nice to see in their cameo roles. The character of the rock, not the delivery, is the victim, and his frustration is well-known in discovering new rules in the game. Corinne walking well in tightrope between her character Sean's choice and only for money. I like how the game was in the last second game of the game. And then beyond! Not a great movie, but an entertaining way and a great showcase for the first time outside the door.
