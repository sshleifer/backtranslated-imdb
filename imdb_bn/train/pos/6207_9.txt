I saw this photo TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival). Hailey supporters will not be frustrated !! And if you do not familiar with this director's oveuvre ... no matter. This film can definitely stand all of its own. I have to go to the second screen ... it was amazing that I would see again - and fast !! <br /> <br /> This photo is very interesting. The conversation is very smart and the performance of Parker Possi is remarkable, because he played the title role of Faye Grim. The latest feature of World and Character Reconnaissance presented in the film Fai Grim Hall, Henry Flower (2000). Apparently, the most important stylistic feature utilizes the habitual use of the cante (or Dutch) angle, which is often seen in various scenes of hartal, found in possible films: Hal Hartley 1994-2004 collections, and Girl in Monday (2005). <br /> <br /> I saw this movie most appropriate on September 11th. In the syllabus, Fifteen Graeme's courage in this story has been backgroup against the changed world after September 11, 2001. Without going into the main corrupt, I see this work, and story-world rarely as a brave political and original portrait of physical politics, if ever, the mainstream fictional movie Post-1111 (cf. Syriana: as well as the note-mark cubean exek. Prod in both of these films ... the most interesting, at least to say). Finally, for those who are closely related to the characters of Henry Flower, Simone, Fe and Henry, this image is self-conscious and self-referential in the heart. It is said that the character of Faye Graeme has started in the film, where Henry's flower was over, but since the end of the film ... the details of the Fay's knowledge and experience have changed considerably and increased. Fay and silly family may be in store in the future ... ?? I can not wait for the third part of this story!
