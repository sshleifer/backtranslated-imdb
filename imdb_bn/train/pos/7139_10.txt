Inspector Morse Fame John Tha has played the old Tom Oklie in this movie. Tom lived in a small English village in 1939 and at the beginning of World War II. During World War I, he did not get some recovery from the death of his wife and son. If you are old and retired in Inspector Morsch, he is twice as much like a crotch as a policeman, then you have the character of Tom Oklie. <br /> <br /> Flint's heart is melting. The children of London are moving ahead of Blitz. The young William (Willie) beetle is billeted with the protester Tom. Willie is well-known by Nick Robinson. <br /> <br /> This boy is behind the school's capital city. Care is needed, still wetting the bed, and unable to read the smallest of its problems. He came from a horrific background in London, who can not bear a little with a mother. <br /> <br /> Slowly, slowly and gradually, men and boys are warm to each other. Tom again discovered his power of love and care. And the boys learn to take this love and care. Tom and Willie make a bomb shelter at the end of their garden. Seeing Willie's joy was perhaps cast by Tom's first birthday party. <br /> <br /> Not to give up at last, but Will was adopted by Tom after a lot of struggles, and this pair further enrich the new life. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is directed by Tha and Robinson for a long time, where people will meet the boy and bring mutual love. See late Dirk Bogaard and John Whiteley in the Spanish Gardens. Or "It has started in Nepal" by Clark Gabelle and Carlo Angel. Or "Captain Brave" Robert Ulrich and Kenny Vadas. Or Mel Gibson and Nick Stahl "A Manless Man" <br /> <br /> <br /> Two interest. This is Thu's only look that I know where he sings. New Jerusalem is just a song, new Jerusalem, but he sings Second, young Robinson also starred in the title "Tom's Midnight Garden" titled "Tom" in the second film. A classic children's novel.
