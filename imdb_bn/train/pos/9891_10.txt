I rent this picture many years ago, and was completely enthralled by it. Recently, feeling the strange need to repeat several movies I enjoyed most of my lifetime, I decided to give another look "Erndida". And I'm so happy, I soon discovered that even the time span did not destroy the brightness of this film at least. <br /> <br /> The story is a teenage girl (played by Ernadira, played a great deal) by Claudia Ohana - in some cases she is like Winona Ryder!) who accidentally burns her grandmother's palace, then damn it to damn grandfather by acting under the influence of Irene Papas. To compensate, forced a life of prostitution on the street. <br /> <br /> is absolutely captivating and engaging - though, despite the basic premises related to prostitution, transparent steamy sexual content is selfishly ineffective. The story revolves around the interaction between the girl and her grandmother and various other colorful characters, with whom they have come to contact their residences - that is, the strayed, rural and rough parts of rural Mexico. <Br /> <br /> This movie is very atmospheric, arrests with a dream-like quality. It sometimes borders the boundary of the border, but, a David Liberty film is not saying. The film is notable in the nature of the fairy tale, read comments from the following eastern viewers ... <br /> <br /> Often you hear a distinct accordion, calm and pity in the background, adding the right to the Mexican setting highlighting the right musical pronunciation. Most of the rural landscapes are in the desert, this is pretty cool. <br /> <br /> The image is very fast, not very fast, and after every scene I feel it is to bring my tape back and run it again because it wants you to do it. However, for me it is really mandatory. <br /> <br /> Hope you will see this movie in Spanish version with subtitles. I studied Spanish at high school as well as college, and I was happy to understand a lot of dialogue. For example: "El Mundo no span grand como pensba." ("The world was not as big" - that is, it's a small world.) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image is pushing me into the old bottle of Vintage wine dust. Although very satisfying, with some sadness you are feeling that there is no bottle like these bottles.
