Yes, the camera was in the right place at the right time. It is so interesting to see how world leaders (like Chavez) support poor people in his country, that may be held in the United States for such low respect. Her worst "sin", in my opinion, is taking care of those who are under barrel. What could that be so bad? I'm always fascinated by the US government + Fidel Castro's media response Initially, Castro was a good man (about 1959) when he supplied Batista. Soon, Castro began to introduce Cuban corporations to the needs of the poor rather than the fats. We are a decent country, but why is our media and government sharing problems with the poor? If these people are "dictators", then we can use more "dictatorship", especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.
