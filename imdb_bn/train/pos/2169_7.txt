Okay, first of all, ignore the last person's review. They fall asleep and do not understand what they are doing! Go as thriller / voice, this film is not very bad, it is certainly very watchable. From the right to the right you will get a general idea that is exactly the reason for the madness, and in the end you have proved to be clear by all. <br /> <br /> I've enjoyed it in movies, it was quite eerie at the time and the old films go to it was passable. Good late look! I give it 10 a generous 7.
