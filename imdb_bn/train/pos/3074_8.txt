I recently caught a film with cable this little gem. It makes me amazed, though, I should have expected this from the team involved with this movie. <br /> <br /> Henry Bromwell definitely guides this image, and it shows. One is always wondering about the secrets of the kill killers. One does not have to go too far to understand one's own neighbor, or social contact, even the friends; <br /> <br /> <br /> In this story, grandfather, a cruel character who does not hesitate to remove someone for the right price. To teach planting to his own son and even to his grandson he has no doubt! <br /> <br /> <br /> <Br> He knows what he has done in the past and suddenly it has come to understand the consequences of his actions. Someone will see him to help him find peace with him. Dr. He is trying to find helplessness in Parks, though he did not find it there. In contrast, when Alex is thinking of being killed later, this is a dramatic package. <br /> <br /> Alex, brilliantly William H. Messi portrays us, makes us Messers. Not only is he an extraordinary actor, but he believes us that he is that person. One of the best things in the movie is the late John Ritter. Dr. Parks, who unveils the mystery, is equally confident. <br /> <br /> Donald Sotherland, grandfather is such a perfect one. He is everything he is a natural actor. Neve Campbell was surprised by his important role in Sarah. She shows a power and range that is unbelievable. Tracy Ullman is a victim, suffering wife, and she does not do much. Also Barbara Bain, a rare look, grandmother from hell. David Dorfman, a pleasure in the film. He shows a maturity beyond his years. <br /> <br />
