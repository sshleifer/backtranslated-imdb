The movie was much better than other critics stated. This is a beautiful family movie. It has a fun fantastic outlook for some time travel. The story surrounds a 14-year-old girl who accidentally finds a way to return to the old elevator in her apartment building. Of course, nobody tries to believe in his invisible explanation. She makes friends with a girl about her age and makes friends and lets girls help in many ways of the family. He was able to help his own relationship with his father for a long time. It reminds me of a Hollywood movie so it gives a chance and decides for itself. It is targeted at children about 6-12 years (probably a bit older) and it is mostly rated PG or G. I am an adult who can appreciate a beautiful "family" movie - I guess other critics do not.
