It was a great movie with a good story. My kids (10, 7, 5, and 4) all like this movie, with me. The music was also fantastic. No, the horse is not talking, but instead, the story is told by the soul. And see if a fun story told by a fun point was fun to hear. <br /> <br /> I think the title says it all, "soul". This movie gives you a sense of family and home and friends. My 4-year-old son and a 5-year-old girl really touched through this movie, and even got it in, they smiled so much and finally they were happy for the soul. <br /> <br /> Enjoy the "soul" with your family and lift your heart with this heartwarming story. Your kids will like it. I think you too
