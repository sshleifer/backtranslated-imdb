This movie has everything Emotion, strength, affection, stereo rudeau's nude beach dancing ... it shows real internal contact and external communication needs in a relationship. Because Siderik and Matthew are a gay who is going to be gay, does not mean that there is not enough useful insight for anyone. I'll probably classify as a homosexual movie, but it can be appreciated and liked by discriminatory gay and lesbian and bisexual people. The absence of Matthew reveals the way to manage his emotions, our society does not encourage us to do any other work, and this proves the contradiction between him and the other. This must be a must see course !!!!
