Wonderful film that should be boring, in theory, but always distributed through the strange and extraordinary acting that I have ever been looking for. Based on clich√©s and overly dramatic moment the plot unfolds through a series of incredible realistic moments. The lead letters are not perfect, and so easy to relate to them you can find. The film does not laugh, does not push the audience to the ideals, but only in the event of the possibility of real love. <br /> <br /> I am waiting for a weekend so I can see the seagull. A moving, thought-provoking, funny look that I think should be a complete romantic classic with Tiffany with Casablanca and breakfast. Even the hardest heart will be soft.
