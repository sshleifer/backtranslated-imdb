This picture is stunning beautiful. Goldsworthy's art is really benefited with the medium of film because you can see the industry as its most beautiful, moving and moving and flowering. I firmly recommend this movie to everyone. I can not think of anything else to say about it. This is only the film you want to watch, because it is visually appealing and refreshed me very much while leaving the theater.
