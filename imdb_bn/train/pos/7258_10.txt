I was lucky enough to get a DVD copy of this movie recently and now it has been seen for the second time. Twenty years ago in Australia at night for the first time on TV, but I could never forget this strange and silent film. Many people do not like this picture because it is so incomplete - no conversation dialogue can be said about this step - we can only hear the characters' thoughts - it's just an incomplete viewpoint. To find a copy of this movie, I discovered that the producer was dead, the main actor died, it was not kept in a British TV or movie archives, it was not released from the video or DVD, which was released in the 80's. After the copyright has expired, televised networks worldwide have been trashed. When it was first seen on TV in Australia, there was no recordable device for consumers. <br /> <br /> I recently saw in the second vision why it was unforgettable. Occasionally it is very annoying and helpless clustrophobic. Harold Pinter is like a stage game. <br /> <br /> Again, if anyone wants a copy of a DVD, please email me and I am sure that we can do some work outside Adam (whiteflokati@hotmail.com)
