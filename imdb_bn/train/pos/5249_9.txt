The choice to create this SNL Skit in a movie is a lot better than other recent ones. Humor associated with the character is not a boring humor, and a character that is enough to stretch for an hour or two. <br /> <br /> It seems strange that sexual content may be avoided, but it may be because I did not expect this because of live television restrictions. I think I was thinking more than the "Laser Suit Larry" Raiku than the producers ... <br /> <br /> Certainly a PG-13 movie, which could not possibly reach the height of its successful predecessors <br / > <br /> I like it, but I suspect it will be a destructive hit ... (which is unfortunate, as the team does not have mid-letters). That mostly bothers me with other SNL ex-students of frequency)
