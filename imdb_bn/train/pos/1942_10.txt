I consider myself a huge movie buff. I was ill on the couch and popped in this picture. From the right to the end I was scared of these great actors, I have never seen, say great words. The filming was beautiful. It was exactly what I needed. I hope this message has been heard on some bad comments written by others. The director has a heart and beats with his actor throughout it. Thanks for making a film like this. Just surprisingly awkward, beautiful kind of characters who are defective and satisfied at once. Just great I can not submit it without 10 lines, so I would just say that I want more from this director, more from all the actors and writers of this movie. I do not want to end it. The end
