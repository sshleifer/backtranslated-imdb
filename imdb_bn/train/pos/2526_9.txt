It's awesome! In story mode, your punk is going from Pro. You must meet the goals involved in skating, driving, and walking. You create your scatter and give it a name and you can see it stupid or realistic. You get your betrays until you have with your friend Eric and you get kicked off the skateboard team (you can choose a party) and you then start your own team! Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has many levels like New Jersey, Manhattan and even School II (not part of the story mode). You can unlock secret managers of Iron Man, Gene Simmons and other skaters. You can create your own goals such as SKATE characters, combo characters, trickerts, gaps and more. You can create the target pedestrians and what they can talk about. If you are bored of that work, you can target Premard Park premade. The only thing I did not like about this game was that sometimes it was difficult to drive. 9/10
