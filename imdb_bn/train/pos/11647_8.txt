I can give four reasons to see this picture: <br /> <br /> 1. The best four movie makers of contemporary Mexican movies. <br /> <br /> 2. Four good stories, related to a big project. <br /> <br /> 3 A wonderful cast <br /> <br /> 4. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Authorities regularly practice extortion against people and are still expected to be appreciated by its efforts. However, Antonio Cerno inherited the story of Italian nostalgia with the dramatic drama "Peter and the Wolver" in the second piece. <br /> <br /> In the third story, even in this context, even this series seems to be more independent, Carlos Carrell tells us a person's story in the wrong place at the wrong moment. But after the recent version of Tuhhuh and the traditional version of this terrible thing in the Mexico State, this story can not be further updated. <br /> <br /> Finally, Fernando Sharina goes back to the dark smile "Grand Finale", which she keeps together most of the characters in the previous sequences together into better comedy portraits. Reviving the central scene from its previous movie "Todo El Padar", giving the final text of the whole theme. And anyway, give us a scene that stole the movie by creating a short striptease with Ana Siewcherte. <br /> <br /> Once the movie is over, you see a good movie (and maybe it's a very painful subject). They said that people laughed at Mexico in their own shame and this is the best example. How this movie has learned how to live through criminal conditions (and perhaps it has been acknowledged) in the two fire: A testimony of the so-called authorities of the criminals and so-called corruption. Even this movie is a deliberate thought because almost all the good people have been victims of crime and they do not get this disease. If you had an attack without a scratch then you are lucky. Meanwhile, do not lose sight of watching this movie, highly recommended. <br /> <br /> And this is a beautiful life in Mexico ...
