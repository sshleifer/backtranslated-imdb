A great story about a great story about doing something about them when following your dreams and when the strikes are actually. It was not easy for Maurice - his family, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, mortgages etc. were not that he could fix what he was doing and could play AAA ball for 4 months at Gearhound. It took silence. I'm glad they showed their irrationality, often getting older people. <br /> <br /> I feel like a pitch against Red Sox (I think ...), it was a great story. Although Morris actually looks more than John Crook or Mills Watson than the quad-OK. <br /> <br /> Very good work by playing a man, teacher, trainer and 'old rookie' in practice. .... If the age of the same age is the same age, I can certainly ID with its plight. You are not very child, which you have dreamed as a kid, but it is there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, <br /> It's good to see life, it's a pleasure. <br /> <br /> *** Out **** ... Who thought Tampa Devil Ray was such a good thing at the beginning of the movie?
