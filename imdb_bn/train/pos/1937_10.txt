I had the pleasure of screening "Big Bad Swim" in the 2006 New London Film Festival. The festival has presented some of the best independent and non-mainstream films since last year. I thought that "Big Bad Swim" was selected for screening at this festival because it was shot locally inside the Eastern Connecticut and locally. However, when starting the credits roll, I can compare with the "Big Bad Swim" enjoyment, compared to others during the festival. As far as it is at the top of my list, "The Cathedral Chair", "Kurt Electric Car" and "Transmemerica" ​​followed. <br /> <br /> "Big Bad Swim" is a compelling, truthful and often-older adult learning student and their choice is a ridiculous look at the still boring trainer, which I have not seen in the depth several times on the screen. Interviewing character development and plot lines stimulate some of the unreasonable as adult-swimming texts, which work in fine and rugged way. On the head of the plot you do not beat with one direction; Rather organize it with a speed that it was spot and build up. I was not bothered. I never cringed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Actually acting from a group of unknown actors was believable and their dialogue seemed to be ever weird or arising. Clearly, because of not being multi-million produced, the camera shot is not all terrible and clear, but it works well enough for the budget. Because of the more realistic approach than the same theme view found in "Closer", lighting and filming techniques were particularly interesting for the scenes illustrated in the Strip Club setting. I got a dry shot from the waist down to the bottom of the water that seems to be a portrait of the character as a shoulder shot. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it has been told from many of the independent film industry, but I would like to say: "Big Bid Swim" I would be very disappointed if it was not taken for distribution. Need to see "Big Bad Swim" If you have the opportunity to see this picture, see it! Frustration is impossible!
