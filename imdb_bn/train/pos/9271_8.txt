<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, what is the future of hope in "Germany"? <br /> <br /> This is one of my most unforgettable cinematic experiences - in spite of strange cinematography and plot, light over-acting (though I like Cast - they are loving and looking forward to good amateurs). The ridiculous situation is better captured I can feel deep frustration in a game (being female and a football fan) and I can not think of how to disguise a traitor. I wonder why there is no women's section in which it can be protected from dirty language and bad behavior - can cause defective reasons to lose. <br /> <br /> The film is very cleverly created - Exciting title realistic game, spontaneity and different ways of adding viewers to the viewer's shoes during filming - this game is so important but unused (not shown), lucrative light and delightful words from the stadium , Prison vans, and those outside when connecting with the emerging crowd, it is vain. I can feel the comfort of drinking radio, drinking and food, and of course, from every character to the kindness and consideration of others. During the last achievement, I am glad that no character is named - he is just a "soldier" and he only "girl" or "sister"
