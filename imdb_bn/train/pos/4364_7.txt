I never heard about Robert Roy McGregor before leaving "Rob Roy", but the film is clearly worth watching. Playing the title character, the role played by Liam Niison Oskar Scandler brings with the same spirit and Jessica Lanzao also works well as his wife Mary. Archival Cunningham (Team Roth) is a person who can crawl your skin. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is seen as "Bravo" (probably better). When I was about to release two movies with a mobile phone in Hollywood, I thought it was. very good. Also starring John Hart, Erie Stoltz, Brian Cox and Jason Flaming.
