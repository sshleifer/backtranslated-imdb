The moon is one of the more symbolic movies I saw. What I really like about it is the image of immorality / death, and obstruction and guidance through life. The film shows a great deal of capabilities with the capabilities of immorality and its benefits. Whether they have miraculous power or eternal life, what are they usually for humans? The moon shows the pain and disadvantage of immortality, because the feelings of loss often affect all the characters, especially the main character show and who. The meaning of the title 'Moon Children' reveals that this film comes to an end, where it clearly shows that all the lights which illuminate the path of other people, give direction. I like the personality that moral cinema is pretty illustrated. The film's weaknesses are in some parts of acting and special effects because it makes the film less authentic. If the character Tosi dies, the scene may have become more powerful and realistic if the more pure emotion of acting is inserted into it. Some scenes with special effects, such as gun shots, may prove more like this without considering much like the action video game. The sparks out of the gun became very nasty and I think it can be removed or fixed. However, I think moon children should be a movie and everyone should consider seeing them. The cinematic concepts and images that will be taken will be easily accepted by everyone and many viewers may have an interest. It's quite a thoughtful film and entertaining for watching.
