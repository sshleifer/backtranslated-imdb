Here the whole family will enjoy ... even those who feel old for fairy stories. Style Duvall Outdid yourself with this unique, fantastic acceptance of all the popular fairy tales about childhood. We grew up in scripts old stories and they present some big stars in each episode. "Cinderella" is not an exception to Duval's criteria, and in my opinion it's titled Genieffer Bells (the top five in Syria - remembering from "FlashDance" and making a movie here and there in Hollywood today), Gene Stapleton as the Fairy Godmother, the South Accent and Eve As an evil figure of Ardennes with false worship. Eddie McCullurg ("Day of the Fairy of the Fellows") and Jane Allen made a sunny twist as the Pillars. Prince Henry of honor of Matthew Broderick. You will keep coming back for all this one!
