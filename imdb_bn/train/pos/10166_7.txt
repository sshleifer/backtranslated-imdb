I've seen this 8-hour flight and I've probably found it silently (emphasizing "light" emphasis) (probably due to pressure and height). <br /> <br /> The original ideas behind the photo were bright: a woman dies, her fianc√© falls in love with someone else, she is sure that they do not stay together, but eventually she lets them do it. Unfortunately the actual movie was not good. OK, there were a few smiles and the actor did all the good work. But from the beginning the plot was in my flight destination. I think the whole gay-but-gay-gay friend of the story could have done a lot of good work. Talking parrot was a wonderful idea but to be honest: it was not really fun. <br /> <br /> The essence of the film was more interesting than roaming in front of me in the summary, but it was closed call.
