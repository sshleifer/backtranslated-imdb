I like this movie. I knew it would be chocked full of camps and silliness like the original series. I got very warm heart to see Adam West, Bart Ward, Frank Guersin and Julie Nimeer together again. The 60-year-old Batman, who liked the series, was able to return to Butchev. You can say that you have played a lot to play this film, particularly Adam West. And I'll leave that he's back to his Batman attire, so that the script forced him to do this. I told a few friends about this film who could not see it ... now they wanted them. My VHS has a truly 120 episodes. Now this movie will join my collection. Thank you for reconciliation of Adam and Birt.
