Awesome film with a little slow start - give it a chance to cook. The story creates interest and complexity. The characters and stories line all expectations at the right moment and the cliche crashes. Excellent New York City Locations - Excellent, real - "Gender in the City" is a great antidote to the commercial requirements - in fact, the entire film is New York City, HBO / Hollywood antidote to sexual relations and relationships. This is a rare movie that deals with its character so honestly and sympathetic. Love! Great cast with significant performance by Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, and his love interest (forgot his name!).
