Saturday June 3, 6:30 pm Neptune <br /> <br /> Nunchun on June 5, 4:30 pm <br /> <br /> Some celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity have been successfully successful as a bright explanation of Carlos Solar 'Masterpiece Iberia Suite' In its centenary, the Spanish side of the solar campaign led an unprecedented gifted wealth from the art community to create this great love song in their home country. The twelve "Impressions" of the suite were presented without the description around the star, which caused every performance explosion in front of the solar camera. Creative use of large flats and mirrors, movements across screens, shadows, combinations with fire, rain and rear projection, add glorious dramatic effects to different selections of songs, dance and instrumental performance. Photographs of Albeniz re-emerge throughout the program by linking the emotion of the music of his life. Saura makes her spinier than beautiful beauties from the elderly Flamenco dancers to dance with their trainers nicely in traditional costumes on her stage.
