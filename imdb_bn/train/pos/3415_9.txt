This picture was amazing. It's an inspirational piece of movies. These characters are completely developed through the truth, which brings to the director Lucy Walker. I recommend this for anyone to show humanity in the state of this special film. Look at the beauty of Lucy Wlaker landscape. This film is a true example of nature versus ID and sometimes people versus people. Internal turmoil and win are remarkable in its issues. Tibetans show blindness as a symbol of monsters, its subject is attractive. This image does not reveal in the light of a particular culture that has never been seen. Lucy Walker gave Eric Weihnmeyer a voice when he could not hear normally. Thank you Lucy to be true to your visa as a film maker.
