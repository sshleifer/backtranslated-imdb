I caught this at a screening of the Sundance Film Festival and was awe on the absolute power of this film. This is a test of psychological impact on our brave soldiers who hopefully join the armed forces to give respect and protection to our country and as well as take care of our government. The film details about the psychological changes in the boot camp because the soldiers become "murderers" for their country and they return to their country after war and afterwards. It depicts the impact that people kill on mental. It shows respect to the soldiers and never criticizes the soldiers against other movies, instead criticizes the system that is ready and does not care for all the physical and emotional needs of the returning veto. <br /> <br /> This image is powerful, moving, emotional and provocative. It stands as an arms call only by purchasing stickers and by going to parades but by actually listening to them and helping them to care for their health and wellness after their killing and death. <br /> <br /> Best Picture of this Festival, **** / ****
