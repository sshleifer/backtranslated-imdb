A good impression of what is expected from the series in the first phase! Solve the mystery and wait a lot of many good plays! I reveal that they reveal the story related to growing characters! Just enough to be excited! Of course there are some errors in this show! There are some characters in the first two series that do not show in the third season for some reason! Many characters have sent off a decent but some of them are not right! Rose and her husband like! Where are they hell? What happened to them? Maybe they will come back later! But it's a bit consistent! That said "lost" each episode (especially the first two seasons) managed to thrill! This is a very difficult task! I notice that in the third season, the focus of the program can be focused on the mystery of the program! It's not bad! It's even annoying to save some episode! An amazing character in the elements of this show can be considered! You will love this character! Good or bad! But finally I want to solve some mystery and want to get a closure! Dangers of "Lost" due to falling ratings are near! And that would be destructive!
