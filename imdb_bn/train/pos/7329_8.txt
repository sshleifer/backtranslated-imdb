I liked this movie very much. The humor was somewhat missing, but I enjoyed how the story was transmitted in dramatic and serious stories throughout life. This is the only second film where I watched Vardon acting (the other was 'San Santo Belo'), and I can see why the Italians feel tired, but it seems that he played a good role as a loving father. I was annoyed with this movie that I knew it happened in Italy - somewhere in the center or south, I think, but I felt that there was no presentation anywhere. This movie can be held in New York, Boston, Melbourne, New Delhi ... I always think that viewers are important to have a place for movies to do something related. (Maybe I missed something?) :) If you like Italian movies, I think you will enjoy it. This is not a Fellini or Roseline - it is not realism or neo-realism. This is a playful story which is a serious moment that any of us can happen.
