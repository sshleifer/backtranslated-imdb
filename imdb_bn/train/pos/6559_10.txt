Rose gang "Every rose has its thorns." <br /> <br /> The mixture of old western and hip hop, perfectly combined. Clothing style, scenery, and plot all the conveniences what was appropriate. Plot - In five years they looted 27 banks and then disappeared without trace. Now, a small western city is being blocked, and one of the first victims is Rachel's sister. Rose gang ready to ride again. And this time it's personal. <br /> <br /> Five years later, Rachel (Michael Calhoun), Shatty (Lil 'Kim), Maria (Lysarae), Jang Lee (Mari Matiko) and Kim (Stasi Dash), split five gunmen together after five years. When Rachel's sister is killed, she wanders with her friend again and follows the revenge route. <br /> <br /> A good, Western version is muck around. (If you have seen bad girls, this is better by the way of these female characters.) <br /> <br /> I gave it because the characters, the plot and the scenery made it for me.
