The year is 1964. Ernesto "Che" Guevara, who was a citizen of Cuba for the last five years, disappeared from the face of the world and Fidel Castro was probably announced to announce the dead, in fact, he left Cuba to move a recognized identity bus to Bolivia. While La Paz, Guevara thought of overthrowing the corrupt, bourgeoisie government. Again, Steven Soderberg leaves 'Che: Part One' (this time is only good). Much more on the pacing goal, the acting work is so great (a sick look Bencio del Toro, with a turn as Che Guevara). Not saying, if you are looking at both films, perhaps the true story of Guevara and how he was a man (perhaps the rare window open to see both screening of a screen ---- talk about a long wave!). Like the 'Che-Part 1: The Argentine', this movie does not have an MPA rating, but there is enough amount of language and violence to snap an 'Aria' easily.
