I found it in July and even Christmas themes, it's been touched and found to be sensitive. It is not for anybody with realism because it's imaginative and lovely moments that sometimes do not understand. William Ras has done a great job as Hanc. I just saw him in Long, Hot Summer Remake, where he played a weak character. But this one, his view of life, as well as what Hank had considered with him, was surprising and flexible. Valerie Bertinelli was nice and lovely as this role is very credible and fair. And as the supreme Peter Fawk was fantastic and always brought a smile when he saw an important scene. There were many special scenes there, where Hanke realized that Max was actually who he was in his life. This is not for everyone ... especially those who do not have 'feel-good' movies and this is definitely one! If you want to be perfect and knowledge of everything, avoid this one. But I think it's re-precious, so I taped it. (Yes, we still have some VCR.)
