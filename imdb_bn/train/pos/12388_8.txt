I read the book and I must say that the film is true. I think Psycho is at the beginning of the same style psychologist thriller. Cristina Rains gives an excellent performance as leadership, and Burgess Meridith gives excellent supporters as a neighbor to the next end. I saw this movie at least twice and I think I'm going to buy books and movies for my collection. The mystery just keeps building the end of the climate, the twist will not see you coming. If you like movies like Sains and The Village, Sentinel will be a classic begun. Also, what movie actors are interesting-if you do not read credits, you can not recognize them. Delicious Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblom is as great as the photographer. There are also Beverly D'Angelo, who is underlying but great.
