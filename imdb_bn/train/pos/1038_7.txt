Love movie I even like most of the actors. However, for me Mrs. Davis makes a very weak effort to utter a word, and her harsh acting really makes it very difficult to watch otherwise compulsory movies. Seriously, if any other modern actress played a similar role with the same style like Mrs. Davis, they would smile from the screen. <br /> <br /> I really think he 'called it' Now if Mirna Laoy or Ingrid Bergman plays a part of his wife, I would have enjoyed a lot more. <br /> <br /> I think I can not get Bate Davis. I have always considered him as an actor that he plays a role in himself, he does not play any role. The potential difference is now Wiagare. <br /> <br /> I am sure many other critics will explain clearly (and I hope civilians) in detail how I am wrong about this issue. But, I will look at the movies I put in because I like the stories / writing / supporting castings, however, I will always think of different actors, which can do a good job.
