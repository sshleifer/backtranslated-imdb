This movie is only worth watching for Jared Herrn's John Lennon's extraordinary screenplay. It does not matter that similar to Harris Lennon; His behavior, expression, gesture, pronunciation and attitude are pure Lenin. Best Scenes: Leonon is verbally engaged in whether Paul McCartney verbally in a local cafe and Wings' "Silly Love song" deserves the # 1 status of America.
