I watched this movie, when I was traveling to Brazil. Brazilian culture and society were really hard to understand, because there are many regional and class differences. It was a revelation to see the movie in SÃ£o Paulo. It shows something like many Brazilian everyday life. On the other hand, it is sometimes a little dramatic a little bit. And this is the only negative comment I have in this picture. Sometimes too much sex, excessive sex, many killings and excessive frenzy for one movie. The director can make some things even more subtle, making the film more effective. I still like the movie after the <br /> <br /> and how the story itself expresses. Characters complex, and real life are many like humans. Most of the cosmetics are not American actresses and actresses, but at the same time, who can be ugly and beautiful. The story that makes realistic, even when the story is not reliable.
