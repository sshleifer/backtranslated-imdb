It starts the pilgrimage between Edgar Allen Bo and a journalist ... Po bit that man can not spend all night in a strange palace. Well, of course he could, but will he be stuck? It's hard to talk to these weird people, who do not roam around the ice with Barracara steel. This is a fairly weird movie that is both French and English, and it lags several times. Perhaps this work is done because the bit of dialogue is lost? It is rather dark and clustrophobic, because it does not see much beyond a small circle that produces candles and these, and always have a lot of horror and imminent anger. This version (Synapse) has also been censored and I wonder, despite the censor of the movie since 1964, I have seen visible scenes, I guess it might be that. Overall this is quite good and dark black and white. Barbara Steel certainly makes the movie too. 10 out 8
