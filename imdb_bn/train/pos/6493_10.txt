I think it looks like a child in the UK, the story and Lawrence Olivier have become funny. We will talk about nothing else at school next day. I imagine the first to show the rating was huge. This is simply the most comprehensive documentary series, with the exception of cutting out the story of the captured bone. Interestingly, war in Britain and North Africa was the main, but it was widely known by America. This series is contested between Mountbatten and the American generals, German soldiers in the Eastern Front, torture Japanese prisoners of war by American troops. Holocaust statues made me a Jewish European, found guilty of treating the Jewish people forever. I do not know why this is not the first number in the IMDB ranking. Perhaps they are showing their bias against the documentary. Spoiler - We Win
