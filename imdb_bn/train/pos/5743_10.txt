I like this movie! While watching it I could not tear down the tears, but it's really a lot of lift. I was hit by the performance of Ray Loyotter, but in particular the talent of Tom Hulce's illustration of Revenue Twin brother is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood incident. Although Tom's character is heartwarming, yet no self-sorrow and full of hope and life. This is a great movie, do not miss it !!
