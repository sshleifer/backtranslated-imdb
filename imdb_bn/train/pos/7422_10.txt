For a long time as Barbara fan, any post like this would be preferential. On one hand, this film places as a classic. Its flaws (emphasis on other posts), but a time (in the late 70s) a glimpse that never will be there again and it is interesting to see the screen unveiled. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie made its own. I do not think he's ever satisfied. But it gives its fans a new Barbara (for the time) with Live Gyeong, a young new look, and some very heavy-acting acting. <br /> <br /> The story is rough, but exciting, and keeps your interest everywhere. The extended one frame "Finel" is hard to sit for most non-Barbara fans, but its talent tells those who appreciate it's volume. <br /> <br />
