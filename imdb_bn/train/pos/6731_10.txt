Why do I rate 10 out of 10? <br /> <br /> * It provides some insight that I can hardly understand - the surfers surf because they get what they want to do; Nothing else seems as much a thing as surfing them; No, it's a temporary thing - it's a great history of bored surfing in this movie for lifetime * people; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and many have seen. * The movie was edited very well by someone who taught me what I had taught in this movie. It flows well. The interview was outstanding * from the beginning to finish it <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw that it is a documentary as well, so I have to rate according to that condition. So 10/10
