Thankfully, for us, Real McCoy fans (probably the end of the 50s and 60s, all the baby boomers grew), when three adult actors / actresses made a reunion show in 2000. Both Tony Martinez and Richard Krenna have died. Then soon after Luke, Sugar-Bebe and Pepino were enjoyable together again, was the mysterious about the complete absence of any reference to Lydia Reid and Michael Winkleman? Little Lick died in 1999, but I'm not sure. There is no information about smiling on the internet which I can find. They are not even mentioned why they are too curious? It was so clear that their absence from the reunion show, I suspect that the family of Michael and Lydia family (if still alive) was also, 1) requested to leave the request and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) TNM Michael Lydia (like all of us) could not find any traces of it, they seem to have disappeared. Therefore, it is the safest policy to get them out of the conversation together. No, the past visits to Walter Barnen are nicely done. They did not create any bones about it ... it was Dada, who made this event a success. I remember, as a child, grandparents are walking on foot and my parents are laughing (I'm sure one million other children are back then). An annoying person who bothered me a bit, had the tendency to dominate Richard Karen's discussion ... sometimes preventing Tony and Catholin from interrupting the point. In fact, although Tony Martinez was fully capable of contributing to the conversation, he could not talk much at the time of the reunion ceremony and say much. Unfortunately, I wanted to listen to three equally. Above all, the reunion show was a real behavior for me. I have watched the DVD several times and enjoyed it every time. <br /> <br /> Dooddood
