With the thrill of stunning cinematography and Kafsakek, this movie got me from an easy but impressive opening scene. The film plays a lot like a dream, and I think people hate or love it. Characters are superficially painted and the story itself is slightly and probably a little dull. But this movie fails but is conscious choice. The film's work is not trying to act as a history, but a reconstruction of the 1940s war movies. <br /> <br /> I had difficulty in the debate that the movie had many original elements, but the film is a cinematic wonder that I am completely moving away. It is sometimes one of the most beautifully illustrated movies, and its style has a wild imagination. I understand why people will hate it, but I can give it 9/10.
