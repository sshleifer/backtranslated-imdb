"Hitler: The Rise of Evil" was sometimes debated before being publicized and the debate could blur the film's success. <br /> <br /> Those who criticized the film did not see what they did, because of good intentions, based on confusing thought that it would be sympathetic to Hitler. However, they misunderstood the point: it is not sympathetic to the evil Hitler to make it human. It is even more annoying to realize that one of the greatest villains in history is an unreasonable act done by humans. A sick, sick crazy, to be sure, but a man, however. It is necessary to know how Hitler was able to power in order to prevent it from occurring suddenly. <br /> <br /> "Rise of Evil" is a brilliant, highlighted by Robert Carlyle's best performance, who creates people without freeing Hitler from any means. Carllele Nazi has taken the leader's look and methods shamelessly, when the camouflage does not become cartoon or we do not distance ourselves. (Anthony Hopkins has not been able to accomplish anything while portraying Hitler in "The Banker", another very well-made television movie). While retracted by Hitler's brutality and fatal anti-semitism, Karlill could have a certain magnetism and the power of true Adolf Hitler. Finally, another nation will follow it? <br /> <br /> Among the various concubines, the most tragic feature is Matthew Modin's reporter Frytz Gehlik, who lived his life to get real attention. Hitler and Nazim's. Although the performance of Medina is slightly shorter in part 1, it seems to be divided into two parts, the character gives a real-life hero in our film full of villains. Peter Stormer and Lou Schreeble also gave strong support. <br /> <br /> Part of the small part of these two parts, 1, saw Hitler's childhood, which suffered a slight bit of damage, which only lasted the opening period. No credit available. And part 2, the details of Hitler's relationship are less successful than the central plot of his nephew and his concubine, Eva Brun, but to serve us more insight into his mental and emotional state. Finally, he could not understand a movie about Hitler. The average person, thanksgiving, is unable to understand a person who tries to eliminate the whole nation. "Hitler: The Rise of Evil" makes less effort to understand Hitler, and helps understand more about how he came to power. This is an important story that must be said and it is impossible for someone who has seen the movie to believe that it is better to do something better without any good purpose. <br /> <br /> 10 out 9 *** 1/2
