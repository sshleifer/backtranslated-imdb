Above this amazing average slasher, that is enjoyable and well made, with some decent grace! All the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus Molly Ringwald played extremely well annoying bitch. I bought it for $ 1 for a fifteen store, and it was surprisingly valuable and special effects were very good for the budget, plus I liked to kill the killer because it was actually a bit unclear. The final was great, how I loved it by defeating the assassination and at the end it was very interesting, and all the characters except RINGWALD were surprisingly wonderful! It was readily written and written, and I sometimes had it quite creative and original, as well as some death scenes were very impressive. This killer is not nearly dastardly, and I like it, and Slashar's fans (like me) really have to enjoy this movie, plus the opening was really mischievous, drawing the movie with them! It's an amazingly top slasher on top, that's enjoyable, and something good, made with beautiful Giri, and I value it to look good! Directions are good. Kimble Rendall does a good job! Working here with solid camera work, using a blurring setting, good corners and holding the movie at a fast pace. Hard acting! Molly Ringwell played a very good baby, and felt sad for her, after that she could be a heroine, she got better at the end, but not much, I'm surprised she decided to make this picture. , Yet he did a great job! Fantastic as Frank Roberts killer, he was deadly, vague and had one hell of a mask, and this man was not surrounded, he was fantastic! Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. Jessica is beautiful as Napier and other heroine. The rest of the cast is fine. Overall the clock value is good! 5 out ***
