They are not publicizing the humorous girl Friday journalist Corrie Grant and Rosalind Russell and Thin Man from the detective Detective William Powell and Sassy Ladie Marina Laure, but surprisingly charming like Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson Schup's amateur cats. Their scurble returns are more postmodern than post-depression, Allen's writings are filled with terrible spontaneity and old New York angels. Old shadows of old knowledge rarely occur, such as when Sid, the great Splendey sorcerer responded to his background: "I was born in Hebrew inspiration, but when I grow up, I become transformed into atrocity." Allen's match point as a bad girl, Johnson could be a better one here, sometimes the obscure journalism student is caught in the murder mystery of London: Serial killer. This plot is recycling its recent London-based thriller match point, the right-wing sin of sin and the "American tragedy" / sunbatting "accident" place. The fact is, the names of Alan Manhattan Marade Mysteries and the Violet Rose of Cairo are just a few other examples. I do not care if I do not rebuild; I want to make the new element equal to at least the roots, and, yes, it's just a reflection of her little glory. <br /> <br /> Allen can not hide his love as director and actor, he was not in favor of Dean Keaton and so took a jittery comedy in an appropriate place under Allen Canon, it is not great but funny, sometimes brilliant : Suspect high-class murderer, Sid (Allen), "I would be very surprised if he killed a man." This is the alcohol allen humor. Like most of his films, there is only a brilliant literary expression, he looks at screw with music from Grig, Taekovsky and Strauss, so that he learns that Woodman did not lose his class's touch.
