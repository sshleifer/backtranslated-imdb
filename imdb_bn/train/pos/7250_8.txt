I read the first book, when I was a little boy, I was late in one night. About a year ago I checked it on IMDB and no copies were found. I then got hit on the web and found a site by offering War Films, so I was happy that I gave a copy of the order and was sitting back and I could confirm why I wanted to see it again. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, to really enjoy the picture, I used to read a copy of the book and then see the movie. The book is no longer printed, but I tracked a copy through e-bay, during the Second World War author Alan White was a commando / parametrap and his first book was. It is someone who knows who wrote and this is true I believe in book and film authentication. Due to the nature of the film, I did not give it ten, it is not as good as the book. There are several separate plot lines from the book, which is larger than the book, because the book is not about big warfare but about the person of war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. My book has a copy of the book for reading, and then the film lets me see it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can track the book and film it is definitely valuable and I was only able to read and see one of my best war movies!
