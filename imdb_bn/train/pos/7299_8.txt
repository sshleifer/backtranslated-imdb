Throwing badly, full horror scripts in the hole, eating hot blonde alive, bad scientist has a serious nasty difficulty, a man takes a platoon of a trained gun and comes victorious, terrible special effects, they just stop the monster of problems by blowing the heads ... wonderful. The only thing missing was one unnecessary graphic sexual scene. Haha Good gored-filled fun predictable twists and ridiculous one-liners. I've highly enjoyed this movie, but make sure that you're a good laugh before you see it. I recommend this movie to people who watch movies and do not make it so deadly. I do not think this film was made to take people seriously. However, if you can see it and just sit back and enjoy only, I really hope you enjoy this movie to enjoy it. Very easy So get some popcorn and a couple beer and have some friends and a fun night with this movie. It brought some joy to my life.
