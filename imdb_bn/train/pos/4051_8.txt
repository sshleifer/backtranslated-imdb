"Lady and Duque" by Eric Romar. Can use a good translation for the title. "English women and dukes" may be more correct, perhaps. Although it is clear that this movie is not for everyone, it is valuable to be judged by comments on this forum, because despite the complex pattern of the story, Mr. Roham has created a movie that can be seen as an art exhibition. Museum Mixed technology used in the movie, finally works well. <br /> <br /> A brilliant story by Grace Elliott, a meritorious King of England and French Dook De Arlins, caters to our attention. Paris was established in the days following the French Revolution. The country was frustrating and the power was in the hands of the people, who could not care less for the elite. The images show that after the Geilotine tour, the movement of the famous people roamed around the head. <br /> <br /> Grace's relationship with Duchesis ended, but for the great man in danger, he really loved himself, losing his own head. Grace powered through all the voices around him without being able to escape. Like a dog, he has an enemy in his own house, and he will not hesitate to deny him at least in tense. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Rather than confusing the digitalization process, we found it in many ways to improve the film. <br /> <br /> Lucy Russell, like Grace Elliott, did a good job to illustrate this life, who has seen many of her lifetime. His French looks fantastic, as it seems to be important in him. As Dook D'Orleans, a fantastic contribution to the June Cloud Dreyfus believes that he is a nobleman without any effort himself. The supporting cast was also great. As an adjoining part, Mr. Rohh gets good performance around. <br/> <br/> "The Lady and the Duke" will be an interesting movie for lovers of history to watch Eric Rohar's outlook.
