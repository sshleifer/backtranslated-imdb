How nice! What - a - movie !!!!!!!!!! I'm not in a fan of contemporary Italian directors. Usually I do not like the drama. I'm not the super fan of Will Smith that he is a very good actor ...... but this movie! It's such a great script and a great movie with so much good looks and so good acting ... Wow ... this is great. This movie occupies my attention for minutes minutes and even I do not like the "pursuit of happiness" (probably because I do not like the will of the son of the will, which is very bad actors and children generally think of normal-born actor, I saw last night "the world is still Stood up "and I made sure that I could not work. I do not want to write spoilers and so I do not talk about the story but I can say that this movie is about love, death and other feelings about which I do not want to see movies .... This movie is such a great great movie. If you have at least the heart, then do not be sorry to see it
