"Jabersky Point" (1970): Was it particularly interesting in my personal life, since it happened in my own life with the same colleagues in the same situation? Counter culture movement at the end of the 70's / 70's by the end of the 70's on campus and outside. We follow two related young people in a different story, who are gradually united. A young man from Los Angeles, in his classroom on the campus and all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jab in the lunch room, and another young woman drive to Phoenix to see his father and employer and "establishment" work. Our Italian director (Michellejo Antonio) is full of America's visual notation and the self-righteous confused of the era, full of psychedelics, "We all know it, we'll change everything better" Youth. Who is the only "revolutionary"? What does that really mean? March around you dress and chanting like one? Do you "fly under the radar" but notify your arrival advance? Do you keep your plans with yourself and go for a change business without any need for group approval? "Jabriscki Point" is definitely a "piece of piece" - a blurred, uniform, moments of a few guest movies (lastly, it's a movie that gave us the amazing "Blow Up" of 1966) and the works of the era, but it's also more. It presents an alternative to cultural revolution, and is going through AntonioNi (who seems to support it), very spontaneous to see what youths need for fundamentalist success. For this reason, this is a powerful, horror film that is applicable at any time, anywhere, anywhere.
