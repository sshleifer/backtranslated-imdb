Fascist chief Miss Tougher (Mary Warren, who specializes in expert photographer Dean Kundi, feels ten feet tall) plans to launch her high level class. Curiosity is a delightful Rock'Annolla Reef Randel (PJ Souls which lit the screen - it also got a warm bond), which is an unsuitable fan of the pink band Ramones. Pal Kate Ramboo (Day Young, whose big rimmed glasses and Nerdy's role can not hide its stunning beauty) is the favorite mission of Tafar, which helps in ending the supposed crisis of murder of Rock'lon. /> <br /> Vincent van Patten has played a sunny role like Tom Roberts, which is all about success. Crazy about Kate Tom ... Only she could squeeze her head out and see it. Clint Howard stole almost the image (in fact, who could steal away from this movie from Soul?) As eaglebauer, "suppliers" which almost everyone could get. The boy was sitting in his office! Paul Burter as a musician who is a partner with Riffon when he is a partner with Reef. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > It's just someone to say, "Let's have fun for 1Â½ hours." The film is really anarchy. A plot-less chaos is lovingly enjoying Ramnies with his heart (even if they are terrible actors, they have the opportunity to get a new audience with this film). <br /> <br /> Most movies have finished the whole film. Reef and his classmates are taking to high schools and a large party is being started. To be honest, I do not want the party to end! Whatever the conventional whatever, let this film be just an insane exposure. With a great rock soundtrack featuring some of Rammance's best songs, this movie allows the viewer to accept life time when the headline does not dominate and people only spend a good time. Those, I guess was the day.
