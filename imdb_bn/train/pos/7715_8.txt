First off, consider this photo about fifty years old! Yet, it still stands as one of the best movies of all time. I wonder how much celluloid production will talk about 2050? <br /> <br /> The story is simple, still difficult enough and the effects are not uncommon for the day. I still saw this for the first time, as a child, when the protection of the ship's ship enters the safety of the ship and you see its layout for the first (and only) time. If I'm afraid of fear, I can tell you. Today shows date, but still useful enough. <br /> <br /> The tiger scene now shows their age. You can see the outline of the tiger that has entered the shots with the lattice, but they are visible only. <br /> <br /> Similarly, the creature melts its way through the door of Crackle, and the effect is surprisingly complete. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nilsen (remembering well for aircraft and nude gun movies) is amazing, but still mature people. At the age of 30, when this image comes out! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <
