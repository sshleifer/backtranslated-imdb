I really liked this movie because I have a husband like a man in my photo. This movie is about Lindsay, if not in the baseball season, in the middle of the winter, see Ben. He falls in love but when spring comes he gets the shock of his life when he is kept down one step in his pain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why so many women can be related to Lindsay in real life. He also sits in the baseball game as well as the man. <br /> <br /> This is a fun movie and if you rent it, then you will not strike.
