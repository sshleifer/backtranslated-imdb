The movie was very moving. It was flexible, and at the same time was fun. The scenery was absolutely beautiful! Peter Falk and Paul Reier gave the prize giving ceremony. Olympia Dukakis were great. I realized through the story line that its part should be short, but I could see more than that - it's a real pro. You will be able to withdraw your life experiences, hopefully after watching this movie positively. After watching, we were fortunate to see Paul Reiser at the Q & A. She is a wonderful man, cute, eloquent and a "real person". It was really an enjoyable night! It would be a must see the movie. You will be so grateful to have gone
