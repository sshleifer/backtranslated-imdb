After being addicted to six feet below completely, I never think this show will be another show that will come as close as well. Well, I was wrong! The lost is spellbinding !! I absolutely love this show and can not stop it. Character enhancement, intricacies of plot, beautiful setting is all amazing. I hooked up completely and completely. I do not know how the makers work, but each character touches me very deeply. I feel their joy, their pain, everything, right down to my core !!! I have hired the Netflix series so I do not have cable. When I keep it, I look at all the episodes at once and feel sad when it ends. I can not wait to reach my house in the next room. This is probably the best tv show I have ever seen !!!
