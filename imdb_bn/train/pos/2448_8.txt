Yes, it's at the top, yes it's a little bit cluttered and yes, Constance Marie is a total child and it's worth watching! Some of the curiosity and gags may be old and repeat later but the show is still fun to see. As it is a family event, so the humor has been reduced and the authors include Gag's family values ​​and ideals. <br /> <br /> George Lopez is funny Take him seriously and do not win the show. I'm sure he does not think his character is serious or virtuous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said , I hate the character ... so that the TV is silent at any time for more than 30 minutes, so I do not want to hear it. There is nothing interesting about his dialogue or his joke. As a mother, she must be the worst and I'm very surprised and surprised that George, as a character, will stand up to such a helpless man for so long. <br /> <br /> I even feel like seeing Ben at any time, I think he feels better than watching the Bill Engwale show. Now there's a bad sitcom ...
