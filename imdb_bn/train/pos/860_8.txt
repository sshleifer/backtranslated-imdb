Audiard made a very interesting movie here. It starts with a deaf young man, as a secretary, describing his working universe; He is ignored, disappointed, rejected ... appointing an appointment as an assistant seems to be the way to find someone in his life: but the man is just coming from jail. Their continued reunion is being rejected by both of them. The description of the character is prominent, detailed ... both of them start helping each other; Because he can read the lips, which expresses himself very beneficial for him ... he will progress progressively, which he was from the beginning. <br /> <br /> It is beautifully illustrated; The whole is very convincing, even in the end it becomes a film noir. Gesture is specifically audiard filming. Emmanuel Devos should be nominated for Best Actress Cesar Award for his magistrate's play. At the end of the film, the move makes it easier than "Etude de Murar". It's surprisingly amazing: 8/10.
