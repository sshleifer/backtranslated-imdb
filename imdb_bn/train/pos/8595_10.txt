I can admit that the screenplay is not very good and it has some slow part, but critics of this movie have to learn some interesting things. First of all, performance is great (Michael Douglas, Kim Basinghe, Kifa Catherland and Eva Longghoria.) Michael Douglas has proven that he's still got it, and Kim Basing has a very interesting character as the cheating spouse, both Kifar Sucreland and Eve Logoria, play Dynamic Tide. Adds incredible talent to the pot and secondly, this movie is a classic of Theodore Yeka most interesting to me in the year. It is easy and simple, and a lot of fun if you want to go to cinema sentinels.
