I saw "mystery man" on my birthday in 1999 when I went on vacation. When I returned home, I went to meet again. Remember, I was twelve, but at that time it was the best movie ever. I've collected a lot of rare jobs (besides the bowler, I've found all of them, which is hard to find, they've created Mr. Furies, The Soveller, The Blue King, The Splin and Captain Amazing, in case of despair, a William H. Macy employment exists. !). I have seen it many times over the years and it is still my favorite, because most of the childhood favorite for memories. This is not a perfect movie, but it certainly must be of another appearance and possibly a culture. <br /> <br /> Story: A bunch of lower level superheroes saves the day. This medieval, direct-to-video "specials" was executed again. But the other side of this spectrum: big budget (huge budget, I think about $ 100 million) studio comedy. Yes, the impact is overblown and a little more considering the huge set and wonderful design design plot. But do not think it's a stupid, special effect- Superhero movie - it's a parody. They fight with a villain named Casanova Frankenstein. He is a psychofrakulator, that is, whatever (it's a doomsday device, he will take the world, Yada Yada.) And the resident superhero Captain Amazing (a Zapp Brannigan-esque Greg Kinnear, with a commercial-product-logo on his clothes, excellent Touch) is kidnapped. Time for Men of Mystery: Mr. Furyius (Ben Stiler, goes crazy), The Soveller (William H. Messi, Pushing Man With Blister), The Blue King (Han Azeri, British, Fours Force), Bowler (Zenne Garfolo, Bowling ), The Invisible Boy (guess what he does), The Splin (The Great Paul, the Furts), and the Spinx (Wes Stoody, has taken half the gun in his mind No, I'm not fun). Jeffrey Rush as Casanova among the other character actors of character actors, Lane Olin has made extensive edits as the bride of Casanova, and edited one and only Tom Wet as a crazy arms businessman. So ... four Oscar-nominated (and one winner) and Tom Fricken 'waites with Messi, Buyer, Olin and Rush! It's not perfect though. It has overwhelming and gushes some of the corniness here and there (full of Shoveller's) here. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The conversation is clearly a highlight, the spinq's Chakrobarty Ringlis, Mr. Furias's mixed metaphor etc. This is a funny movie, it's almost impossible, it will remind you that it is a film that smashmouth's "All Star" is out in the world.) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the film did not do the same with critics and audiences. A signal was originally planned (the film is actually based on a comic book and "Flaming Cow" comics character. I believe that Flaming Cow was planned for Siegel) but it did not do well at the box office. It could be a hard sell, with a superhero comedy who has "something about Mary" with the guy. It was released on the same day as "six senses" - that ended as the biggest hit for August - as well as "Thomas Crown Affair." Two other misunderstandings were released in the same horrific weekend classic, curiously - "Dick" and "The Iron Giant". Critical MM gave passable reviews, but it quickly forgot. Sadly, Jeffrey Ross of Comedy Central's Rooster of Jerry Steeler commented on Ben Stiler, "I've seen 'mystery male' and I shot my agent." Then Ben was seen to face these words, "I should." Do not listen to him Give me a chance to "mystery man"
