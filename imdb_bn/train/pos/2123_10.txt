In the three rebuildings of this plot, I like them all, I have three VHSs, as well as a copy of it in the DVD. All three are entertaining and have enough levels of re-viewing scripts. Which of these stars has been rebuilt three stars in any of these films? Of course this is one of the great stars, but supporter actors are also fantastic. I especially like Willy Tracy. She was the scene of the scene that I searched for other films to search. He was present among many, but most are not available. As with the other opinions, I say - buy this one.
