The only sound that sums up this movie is quirky. It's a light-hearted romance through an existent idea. Bouncy (more than one way) and a little brown. I will not say absolutely grand and unforgettable movies and it does not seem to be as memorable as the director's first movie "Cube", but it is a good haul of fluffs to watch on Sunday morning. From boring time to acting, but I believe how it was written. Perhaps working as a serious movie could be great or could be stepped into a state of a pretension very well. Fill a "head" like "matrix" and fill the "human nature". <br /> <br /> Of the ten, 6.8
