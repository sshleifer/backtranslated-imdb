The movie begins to start acting as a wizard with Vincent Price. However, through the very successful show mid-way, the police come and close him. It seems that his old master cheated him out of the tricks he had made - even he made his own time at home. As a result, the price killed the innocent people fairly. The problem is that why the viewers were valuable and probably it seems to be a good thing, because the price was somewhat crazy, he could not agree with one (like eating leo's potato chips). <br /> <br /> The image was full of very creative and spectacular magic techniques (including a huge round rock and a tomb for the ensembles), great plot twists as well as exciting actions. One thing that you can not tell about this movie is that it is lazy. Although it is far from fine, it is fun to live forever and a look good. <br /> <br /> If I never see the version of Vinceant's Voice of OX, I probably liked Mad Magic. And it's an 8 or 9 Scores because it is a wonderful movie on Mad Magic, before it (the house of WAX) is very memorable. The bottom line is that the WAX ​​House was so successful, the follow-up pale formula was again reshared. Both were made in 3D, both are a plot that has the right to kill each of the pricing but once he is committed for the first time he can not stop and both are looking forward to see. The biggest difference is, and there are some, the color of the WAX ​​was color and a horror film and Mad Magistrians certainly had a mystery more. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to see this image and the house of WAX (only the price version). They are both horrifying horror films of the 1950s.
