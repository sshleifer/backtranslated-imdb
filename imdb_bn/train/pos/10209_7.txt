"Happeststasts" is a New York-inspired Paris movie from "I'm a stranger in a cottage" <br /> <br /> Last year a movie has received Audrey Tatou, "Amelie", for its attention, its French title is more appropriate: "Le Battement d'ailes du Papillon (The Batting of Wings of the Battery of B)" As a brief chaos theory as a restrictive element of life. <br /> <br /> Tatou's gamine-ness is less boring because she occasionally flashes that dazzling smile among her unexpected events, and because she is part of a large, multi-ethnic group, so big that it's time for me to sort Some of the characters, especially the intelligent boys and the elderly women saw me the same, and some characters imagined what they should have done that I'm not sure they Whether or not it's done <br /> <br /> I love how urban phenomena were, hanging around the cafe to travel around the home from the immigrants to the sideways. <br /> <br /> Subtitles have been quite annoyingly given both parts of a conversation once. <br /> <br /> (originally written 12/8/2001)
