(Warning: minor spoilers) <br /> <br /> I ran to this part and saw what was there or what the plot was. It certainly held my attention; Eventually I did not know that it was based on the real story! The man who did that dirty thing came out like a very nice man who was surrounded by a terrible girl. I have illustrated how to accurately reflect that life. Anyone who kills a husband and wife can not be just beautiful. Yet, I was sympathetic to him, as he established and took advantage of it; <br /> <br /> My main complaint is over (here the biggest spoiler comes! If you do not want to learn it, skip this paragraph). A few minutes before it's finished, no way to find true discovery was found. The way it was discovered was "sting" operation, but my question is, how did the police agree to accompany him? The film did not show us, and it was very easy to explain how they agreed to do it. <br /> <br /> I think the way they were handled was for dramatic purposes, as there was an irreverent event to look at the strong perspective in omitting the explanation that was otherwise not there (we knew what was apparently And what was going on with Brad). <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a beautiful picture; I give it 7/10. It makes me think. Now I'm curious about the real facts. <br /> <br /> Another thing: the movie was completed in 1996. Here are some reviews it seems to be working as a recent movie. <br /> <br /> PS Meadow Sisto is beautiful. I have not seen him before. He can do very little work (always a plus of his line of work, LOL).
