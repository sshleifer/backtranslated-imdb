Uggh! Although I was not really impressed by this film, I must admit it made technically well. It gets a 7 for very high production quality, but as the value of entertainment, it is rather poor. In fact, I consider this one of the 50s most overrated film. It won an Oscar for Best Picture, but the film is so annoying, dancing and boring while dancing. Because it is such a song that is like a reasonable number of songs with extraordinary stories and acting (such as MEET MEET in ST ST LOUIS), this movie is almost all sung and dancing. Actually, this film is about the longest song and dance number in history and if you are not in it, then the film will be raised to you quickly. Give me more stories! As a result, with production numbers and weak tales, this film is like a permanent diet of Marieu - it just does not satisfy the long run. <br /> <br /> To think ... this image has found "a street called designer" and "a place for the sun" for the best picture! And, to make matters even worse, "African Queen" and "Sce in Hole" were not even nominated in this category! More amazing to me is that for the best writing "Es in Hole", this movie has been lost for screenplay - although "an American in Paris" was rarely a story and most of the dance and song was operated.
