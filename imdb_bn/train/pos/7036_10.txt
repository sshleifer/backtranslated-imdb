Being able to be one of the best political entities I've ever seen with excellent performance for Cusack, Tomi, and all supporting actors. <br /> <br /> Excellent plot, very good and very good at the end of the unexpected end. The action scenes were well-decorated and dancers. Very funny <br /> <br /> I gave this picture a big deformity to everyone. This is very critical of US military intervention in the Middle East, and as a result it can get bad reviews from political people who do not share the same political views, or who are not very politically unaware of the humor of dark and drunken people. Indeed, in places, the comedy was so close to the truth that it was a bizarre and funeral.
