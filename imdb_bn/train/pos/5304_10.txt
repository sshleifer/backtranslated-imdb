The packer is a sunny sunny picture about a small town in Baltimore, which is broken by daily, hamidrum routine packers, a young photographer who takes "real things" photos. No beautiful model, no gorgeous men, just hard living. This wonderful movie pokes fun at the plasticness of urban art chains. The homeless woman in the packer's mother's Treft shop shop shows a specific view of buying the same exact quote like Whitney Art Junky for 25 cents instead of $ 500. It shows you that you do not have any kind of money, you will not always get the taste. Yet John Waters again sends you into a spiral of the end of the sunny and the raw facts. With special effects and mountainous mountains, you can have mainstream Hollywood movies, but give me "Titanic" or "Godzilla" any day, "Pecker" or "Hairspray" (another wonderful John Waters movie).
