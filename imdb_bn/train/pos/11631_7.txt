Red Eye started in Texas where the hotel receptionist Lisa Reissert (Rachel McAdam) went back to Miami and worked where the last 'red eye flight' was going to catch up. While waiting on his plane, Lisa met with handsome and charming Jackson Ripner (Silian Murphy) and they both seem to stop it, so when they manage the plane, they discover that they are sitting next to each other. When the plane is closed and they are in the air, Jackson tells who he really is and is unlikely to match their chance, Jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to kill Homeland Security Secretary Charles Keef (Jack Skalia). And he has to change his room in the hotel in Miami. Jackson tells Lisa to call the hotel and it will happen or her father will die ... <br /> <br /> Wesworth Cranven, who is probably headed to The Last House on the Left (House) 1972, Atm Street A Nightmare ( 1984), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1989), The People Under the Seaars (1991), and Scrum Trilogy of Tin Slashers, a small, fifty-short, short story thriller seems like a typical Red E Person makes a big exit. Curl Elsworth's script was created for a surprisingly exciting thriller that I really enjoyed, it's just a quick 85-minute length of time, it's a very fast, money-rich and straight-film film, which is often more than a tight subplot, rather than placing it in different directions rather than plots. Some people might like this opinion when I'm not from another, but I think it brings you to more steps until it reduces speed without fast filming and gives you a chance to relax. I really like the idea of ​​the Red Eye, sure that such a film will always be in one or two suspicious moments in the case of platoon, but this is what it is for a entertaining movie and what is it for me? I really like two central characters, Jason Ripner (a clear game in the name of the notorious Victorian series killer Jack the Ripper). Simply type 'mentality' I'm just doing my job '. Another plus point is that I do not think anyone behaved extra frogs here, everyone really looks like a man and movies play in a relatively complimentary fashion. I really liked it and it was one of Crayven's best recent movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> He must not be frustrated and once he does not start action and tension, he will never leave, the most effective part of the movie Lisa holds hostage on the plane and the movie goes to Miami and Lisa's grandfather once the room becomes a bit more routine, but it's still good. The special reference to Rachel McAdam is that it's pretty fantastic, I can probably see red eye again because it's in it and it looks like the dead are stunning. Seeing the name of Wesley Crayven in relation to Red Eye, who expect horror movies, they will have to think again because there is no fear (despite the fact that the IMDB list is 'Redirected to the Red Eye'). I'm not sure at all, on one side, Willand was against the traditional prospect that was nice to live for change, but Lisa was more satisfying than how she wanted to kill him. <br /> <br /> DreamWorks clearly gave a Red $ 44 million initial budget, but it decreased by $ 25 million even though it is still a very well-made movie with shiny production prices. In fact California shot in Los Angeles and Florida. The film was written for Lead with husband and wife San Pen and Robin Wright Pane, but finally the creators chose little leads. I have already said that Rachel McAdam is pure eye candy and it is worth seeing to see the total child and this movie for herself. Oh, and he also keeps a decent performance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm glad I decided to visit it. This definitely gets a recommendation from me and Rachel McAdams is really this hot thing ...
