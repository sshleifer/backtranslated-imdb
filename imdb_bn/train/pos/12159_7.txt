After their son was sentenced to imprisonment, Adele (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Sheryli Winkers) began making phone calls in the face of danger because some of them easily drop their boys. In order to promote this trial, and to start a new life, it decided to go to California California. They started a dance school soon enough to start. One of the students is a wealthy unmarried father with whom Adele quickly falls in love. Meanwhile, Helen is busy raising rabbits and being too much infatuated with a missionary on the radio. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, anyone who spent anti rou?, also played Shell Winters. There is nothing left for Helen to return to the film, which was limited to the film's rendition of Anti Ru. It can take a good deal of the film's running time, but once he laughs, Helen is a bad Mad Muth. You do not want to mess with him. Winterers are so glad that it was impossible for me to enjoy my performance. I'm not going to waste the film, but Helen is absolutely top of the issues. <br /> <br /> - Good to Winter, Reynolds is completely ridiculous in his role as Son - Docking Tap Dancer. I think he thought that he was in a movie that he would nominate for some rewards. Why this citizen! Leave so much serious acting. Hey, Debbie, you do not understand that the main purpose is to be a victim of Winters's craze. <br /> <br /> - I'm just this ex-lady-star-evening-their career horror movie. What is the matter with Helen? It's fun as any.
