I saw this photo at Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away. The formation and implementation of the film was extraordinary ... I do not know it will be, but it is actually worthy of the Oscars. Cal and Andrei were phenomenal as two disturbed classmates. Yes, this film is very controversial and I see many people with it, because it is related to school shooting and especially you identify with the killers. However, despite its stringent and humorous issues, Zero Day is worth watching the observer. I'm waiting to come to the video so I can buy it - it's very good. Very strong and intense ... The last shooting sequence will leave you stupid because it's almost too realistic. Their uncertainty, "recording", students' footage and panic, completely undefined. I really hope it gets attention attention. This is done in the same format as the Blair Witch project handheld camera, which is shown as a true home video documentary type movie - but God is also better. Very impressive, everyone hats closed in the hat. If you've got the chance you really will see it.
