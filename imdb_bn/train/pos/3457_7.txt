This is the Colombo which was directed by Steven Spielberg at the beginning of his career. It's nothing exciting, but some great things for Spielberg can be seen in this movie. Most of Spielberg's movies and TVs of 70's are basically in the same style. So this means that some characters show some curiosity and I'm not talking about Colombo character only. The 1975 Spielberg film "Jaws" is perhaps one of the best-known comedy tricks. But in addition to some small indications of the initial Spielberg ingredients, you can not name this movie- and the excellent example of growing director stars. It's not bad, of course it's not, as I said earlier, it's not too exciting. <br /> <br /> This movie is really good and very committed, but after opening it well, which has always happened, the film was able to look slowly and slowly. The details are because it is essentially a Colombian film that does not have a real memorable moment in it, it is not silent because it is a boring movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The murder itself was quite impressive and the concept of concept was a crime story writer who showed some great and interesting potential to kill his author's partner. The story did not actually explore all its possibilities. At least this movie has gone with me. <br /> <br /> This picture was still good, thanks to the character of Jack Cassidy, who thinks he is more skilled than Colombo, his experience of writing due to his mystery / crime, and trying to give himself the most prominent possible hints. Of course, Colombo knows well, and for the first time his number is suspected, but he naturally plays the game. <br /> <br /> This film has the overall overall style and uses some good camera location. Edit This is mostly compatible with Spielberg's work, especially some of the camera-corners. It was quite interesting to see. <br /> <br /> Do not add a delicate and perfectly viewable Colombo movie but the name of Spielberg it is highly anticipated for you. <br /> <br /> 7/10
