After the release of Delanz in 1837, Olavar Twist had its debate and success as well as his success. His life in the urban gates was frustrating and new, and the novels of the novel were another innovation created by criminals. <Br> <br /> One day he was walking in London and kept a young man next to him, he was friendly. He said hello, but he was rather tough with her. He does not understand this. After a few days they met again, and he asked what he had done to disturb him. "Well, if you need to know, I did not like your last novel." "Really, everyone else thinks it." He was surprised: "What's wrong with that?" "Oh, Charles," he said, "I'm Jewish, how can you make such a fagin?" He did not expect this: "Well ... you know that last year Aiki Solomon's theft trainer, thief trainer, he was Fagin's model and the Jew." <br /> <br /> Dickens found out that things were not right. "Yes," he replied, "he got what he deserved, but Charles did not call him" Jewish Solomon, "just as you called Phagin" Jew ", Nor did Solomon plan for the murder, Dickens was admitted that he might He took care of what he said. <br /> <br /> The Oliver Twist was published in several editions. Dickens developed a bit of Fagin Then he got an idea that he reviewed the chapter called "Fagins Last Night Alive", in which he faced fears in the face of violence, and he added some extra details. <br /> <br /> He told his friend Fagin Let's know about his solution to change. One day or the next day he came to a friend's house. "What do you want to change?" He asked. "Charles, what changed - he is still a chaotic villain named" Jewish "!" He replied, "Yes, I had to keep them, but you did not see that He was imprisoned in prison? "The young woman noticed it, but it seemed that she was so fearful that she was worthy of such fear. "Oh ... then I was right about him ... and have you added my short story?", He asked. "What details?", He answered. "When you first see Fagin, he's cooking himself dinner ... you read it?" Dickens looked forward to his recognition. Instead the lady looked confused. "I read that he was in the fireplace, but I must have gone the way." Sunny Dickens, although she is brilliant, "She cooks a pork sausage for her dinner." "What the hell!" He said. "She's eaten pork, my favorite ... see - she's not a good Jew!" His friend looked at him, shook his head, and his frustration left their friend's house. He did not talk to him for several years. <br /> <br /> Dickens never took his own opinion, but the situation made partial efforts to correct the final novel. Our little friend (1865), his minor character, Mr. Royah, used by a helpless landlord to earn high rent from poor tenants. It is known that Mr. Rayha has been convicted because he is a Jew. <br /> <br /> But Mr. Raih is a good man. He is a very good man. He is a very, very, very, very good man - so good to be incredible. If Fagin sees Rai's action, then perhaps he will push him back with a stick. <br /> <br /> Today, Fagin's anti-Semitic picture is linking. It crosses it into a measurement novel of Dickens's talent as a writer. However, presenting a story in the film still creates a problem for playwrights and managers: After Holocaust, how can a film adaptation of a worthy novel without the introduction of a mock? David Lynn shows how Alex Gasinius faces a crowd in one or two scenes by showing the human body and ending with true dignity. In the novel's musical version, Sir Carroll Red made it even better due to the rewrite of the original song script. <br /> <br /> Wolver was hit by the West End musical in the mid-1960's and then took to Broadway where it hit again. A remarkable score of "Lonel Bert" with Lionel Burt's "wonderful food", "I am reviewing the situation", "consider yourself", "boy sale", "who will buy", "as long as he needs me" . Reid plays the role of Oliver Reid Cykes, Ron Moody, Fagin, Mark Lester Oliver, Jack Wild Doser, like Shane Wallis Nancy, and Harry Sokomby played with Mr Bumble. For a decade, Hollywood had no major musical success - the last song to win the best picture Oscar was done in 1958 by the GIGI. In 1968 Oliver won it. <br /> <br /> and Fagin - how to handle the trick of eternity? Well the musical Fagin is not captured, is tried and executed for that is executed. After all, even Lean showed that Fagin tried to control his staff in his staff. But here Fagin understood that he was getting too old to rely on such a chancellor's life. Although he had lost his wealth (he kept stealing things because he knew their value and appreciated their beauty), he can decide that he can reform. He is allowed to do so, by his faithful acolyte, Artful Dodger. I do not think Dickens appreciated the change (she might have a female friend), but the modern audience must take it as appropriate.
