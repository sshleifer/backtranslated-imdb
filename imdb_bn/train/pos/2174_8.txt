I really think love this film. "Prix de Beauty" was originally a silent film but later in 1930 the French language was dubbed. Despite the other's voice being dubbed on it, it remains a stunning tour forces for Louis Brooks. Legendary Edith Piyaf's dubbing of his song helps dampen our sacredness about Dabbing fraud. <br /> <br /> This is the story of Lulu and we first saw him at the resort with his head's lover, Andrea (Georges Charlie) and their friend Antonin (Augusto Bandini). Lulu goes to the frame as a pair of legs: we see him inside the car changing between his bath costume. Lulu is very free with his body showing up and does not sit well with this boring Andrea. While applying for the title 'Miss Europe', we know that Lulu will not end happy at the end of Easy Street. <br /> <br /> This picture attracts a lot of attention to shining handsome women. We look pretty at the beauty of the bath and look at them and see the men's reaction. But its center has green louis brooks. <br /> <br /> If you do not watch movies of the past, check it out. Lewis Brooks is not a name that can easily tell buff movies, but as soon as you see him you will become gentle and you want to know more. If you find it, then find him from the 'Pandora Box'. <br /> <br /> Be careful about DVD releases in the US. I do not know whether their projection speed is accurate. The scenes are shown at a much faster rate. This may be the way they have been shot. I do not know. But since this is the only way to watch this movie, it is a small bitter pill that can be swallowed.
