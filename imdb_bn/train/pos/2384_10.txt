It is a well known fact that when Gene Rodenbery entered the first Star Trek NBC, the original pilot episode The Cage was rejected for "too much brain". Another opportunity was given in the series, Rodenberbery thought it would be interesting to set up discarded episodes as Canon, and this was done by writing this Manjeri, which was a unique difference in the continuity of what was then. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now due to an accident, terribly isolated and paralyzed. Pike joins his successor in the Starships, where there is unexpected surprises: Spoke, who worked under a pike, effectively hijacked the ship, and established a course for Tolus IV, which is outside the range of a planet (death penalty) 13 years ago, last inspection of pike and spoke . Naturally, as a logical creature, the speaker turns himself and arranges a court-martial so that he can achieve his work justify. <br /> <br /> There is no need to say anything more about this plot, the rest will also play Part 2. How to draw is Rodenberger coming up with a special flashback, the connection between the cage and the rest of the star track universe (more to say more) ) To see what could be the track, the NBC did not close the original project, which allows screen and off-to-everyone. In particular, Jeffrey Hunter (who was unable to return to The Manjeri) looked as a more serious captain than Peake's kick, and at the first days of speculation like Speak, who is more serious than his personality was not fully established: The only time in the series is that everyone's favorite Volcano spontaneously grins. <br /> <br /> Short, not just a great "mystery" episode, but also a treatment for those who may be annoyed to track this cage. In its original form (it is available as part of Season 3 box set).
