While studying a potential independent film, Morgan Freeman (who plays himself), meets a Spanish girl named Scarlet (Paz Weg), a great, fun, sweet film and a small shop. I was somewhat suspicious about the film for the first ten minutes, but as soon as I was in the store, I really enjoyed watching the film. It shows how a positive attitude can change something. It does not have any complicated plots and it is easy to follow but you can laugh all without the need of minor clutch romance, highlighting the worst symptoms of moods. There are several scenes in which you can touch your face with a smile. A very rare masterpiece!
