One of the few movies I consider filming the presentation of the original book. The story is clear, accessible, fun and interesting and the number of musical numbers is without exception. I imitated the compilation of 'Old House Watchman' and the impressive 'Portobale Road', which is a great combination of first animation + real-life action strategies, although it does not cease to be a piece of junk. The background of World War II worked well and the way the movie is playing is not omitted, which often happens in the stories of 'Eve'. <br /> <br /> Often very few undated movies, it does not end up being enjoyed for people of all ages. Performance from the actor is done extraordinary and the whole text is nicely tied together and well-designed. Make sure to make a smile on your face!
