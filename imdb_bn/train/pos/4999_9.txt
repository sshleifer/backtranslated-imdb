This event is delayed - believe it is the third and final episode, when the first one saw it - and it was blown up by a social commentary that was not seen in American TV from 'All In The Family'. <br /> <br /> It is astonishing that CBS will run it in the first place. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The most controversial decision that they would like to deal with today is to monitor KT Korea. <br /> <br /> If you really want to create a bunch of folks then really crazy - discover them as true about themselves. And if you want to drag their strings, call and remove one of the artworks - they can discover the truth after hearing their own words spoken from their own mouth. <br /> <br /> Armdom is always ahead of the curve forward. And this show is no different. Through CBS's Corporate / Social / Political / Sensor Radar, it did not have any CDS (it did not see until the 'Big Brass' was ever finished), but once it was spread to 'Old Middle' to hear Marcia. I saw myself - well, the message or messenger farm will not last long. <br /> <br /> Now, if only 'missing episodes' can find their way in Eugeneet or Bit; torrent ;-) <br /> <br /> Thank you BC Kelly Tallahassee Flow
