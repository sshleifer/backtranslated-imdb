Although the style of this movie is not vague and realistic, a word version might be it, but it is still a very good movie. In fact, it was seen as the best movie as its best picture, it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar (to lose WINGS). I still consider Wings to be a superior film, but this one, despite the slight bit of Emacting by Leader is excellent. <br /> <br /> Janez Czarist is a commoner from Russia who is living on his final day in the 1980s, a Hollywood extra, earning several thousand dollars. During the revolution, his fate seems to have changed in order to fight an imperial Russian General War against the Communists. Naturally, this is not an extended part of acting, but it can get old people to think about the old days and the revolution. <br /> <br /> I'll go to you if it's okay, but it's a pretty good film - especially at the end. However, look for William Powell as the Russian director. Despite being made in 1928, she did not see much less than her in several subsequent films with makeup.
