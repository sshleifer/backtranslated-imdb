First of all, I've heard something great about this movie, at least in retro / vintage scenes and lovers of stockings who do not like the bay page and were not frustrated. For the main scene, color is very clear with black and white paint, the film is an early life and Betty gives a documentary feel to the career of the page. <br /> <br /> Many things I do not know about the page. First of all, there was a gang rape, after that the development of acting career and then the first attempt at Glamor's photo was first, the men who met with the camera club did not get enough, and later Claus, Palla and Irving, who, despite taking slavery and fetish photos, Come across as a very joyful and friendly man. If only this is the type of modern pornography producer, perhaps the best pornographic results will be! In most cases, the film is not an attempt to showcase the environment of the environment in order to produce images of women and nude images in the 1950s, not against the evil of pornography. This environment was very suppressive, perhaps in a good way, because it meant that we have any 'saturation' effect today, when it comes to pornography. It appeared to be very less harsh. The page comes as someone who enjoys his work and it will not appear depressed. In most of his films, he is looking strong (and trying to catch up with the conversation), trimming the whip with a cauliflower, the photographer took his picture and 'Initiation Style' saw the girls' bond movies which are quite different. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away, even when she is bound and disgusted, she insists He said that he was given a 'gift' to 'make this thing'. Seeing this picture, I know more about the page and the fear about his humility, faith and lack. He compared today with Identity-Kit Clone Blones, and can really say that 'there is life after porn'.
