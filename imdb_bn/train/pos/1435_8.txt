I appreciate movies like this: smart and orderly, recreational, exploitation, good work and nicely managed. No one - even casinos - visible chewing *, trying to stand; One of the most effective moments in the film (Ally's reaching the ramp to her fall) is frustrating due to her sanity. <br /> <br /> Okay, quiz show, City Hall is similar clothes: Attaching minds, eyes, ears, and minds. <br /> <br /> * You know, casinos make it chew in a special scene, but just because it is needed. Great scene, too much.
