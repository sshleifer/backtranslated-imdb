I just saw "The Last Wave" at the fine arts library of my school. It's a stimulant like all of Peter Weier's stuff, but I'm not like the attention that I always like. I was fascinated by the ideas I had left on myself (because they were very well directed by film director Wey) but at the same time I was not excited enough by them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a severe weather Begin with sequence and have some extraordinary mood effects throughout life (mostly curious, "belling" sound design) and strong guidelines; But like Waier's next films, it did not entertain me. I may again need to see it again. <br /> <br /> Good movies about passion and mystery. Because, ultimately, the mystery that exists between white and indigenous peoples gives a very serious consequence. <br /> <br /> God bless Peter Weyer. This image is valuable for him alone ... very organic director. An Australian reaction like McCick! I want to give it a 7 because there is a great idea to overcome its annoying moments.
