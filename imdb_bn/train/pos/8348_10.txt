In about 1986, I saw this movie being seen on TV in one night. I was 6 years old. This is not to see in 1987 that I have an amazing view of horror. I went to Venice on a holiday the following year, in silent terror, hope that my parents will not find me I saw it! <br /> <br /> What do I think if my parents knew I saw Les Values ​​in my childhood? I probably want my parents to avoid this issue even nowadays, and my mom is probably irrelevant in the next life. They do not know how they want to see it. In the first scene, to prevent and stop a woman from a flat block, entering the mountain road with glazed satitated eyes, I am not sure that this film is an insensitive part of the trash that ignores sexual revolution or if you can see the sexy freedom fighter movie that you never Can not be offensive to yourself <br /> <br /> This must be violent. It has a violent view of gender, in fact no recognition of love. Even mutating a greedy child is a greedy sexual behavior mutating. But the scene is very loving and (God is so british I so much). They suck her breast for her own? That is the exploitation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, I do not know. This is the end of a real horrible suicide. I am my friend jb Nelson was described, who had received Cancoulal Holocaust-Hat, and he went to Urugurg! There is no drunk love for this movie, quite the opposite. Where the boys started, the obstacles They shot the girl on foot? Why does he come back to them? What is the punishment of women so that they can know something right from men? <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of two movies, one of which I have never seen, the other one wants me to do it so strict world! Missing / Madonna does not count a heap of madness, it is never too annoying that a woman convicted of being a woman becomes a man's slave, and it is probably the madrasa saying that everyone honors people, so I can not use harmful! Once you have your time / Leon in America, why do the noodles do this? We have destroyed the way of happiness we follow him throughout his life. Finally find love with Deborah. Now they are both destroyed. Why Sergio? Why? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very honest, no title. No imagination shags, no perfect Hollywood moves smoothly. Jokes, yes. But here there is a lot of dark and jealousy and trick to say a sex comedy. Do not forget to carry a shooting in a wolf hairstyle, she will come back and you will get her along with her son's vengeance son and know how she will learn from her. <br /> <br /> I can not stand two things in rape films and prison movies. Les Valseuses do not have a rape movie! God does not want anyone to see it now! This is a brilliant movie!
