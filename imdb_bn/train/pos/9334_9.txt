Sensuousness Nurse (1975) was an Italian sex comedy that once played Bond's daughter Ursula Andres. The man was warm in this movie. It was stacked and made * like # brick brick house. Ursula was smoking hot in this film. I have not seen a nurse's outfit that's filled before. <br /> <br /> They are a nurses appointed to care for a wealthy elderly person. Even one in the house seems to be knocking even boots. One night, the nurses take the grandson's temperature and some necessary T.L.C. Decide to give. To his ancient client. The old man brings his nurse and the rest of the collector's family What kind of work does his family rent? Will Geezer fall for his car provider? How can he deal with the octogenarian crone and the rest of the family? To find out you need to find a copy of the senses nerve !! Italian but badly dubbed in English <br /> <br /> Highly recommend.
