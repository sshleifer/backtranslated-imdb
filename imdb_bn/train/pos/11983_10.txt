This show has a great story! It is very credible! A man's wife dies and he can not take care of his children alone, so he calls his brother his best friend and others come to the show later. For example, Rebecca Donaldson, Loving, Strong Dog Comet, Nicky and Alex you can find out for yourself (I do not want to waste it for you) and with the help of Kami Gibler! (DJ sidekick) but kids are very surprising. This is Mary Kate and Ashley first off! And you know Cameras Cameron Burrow from Century Punky Buster show and so beef! Jodi loves the sweet stiff left of a loving middle child. This is really a very good show!
