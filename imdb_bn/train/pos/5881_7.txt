This movie was a fantastic comedy. Akshay Kumar, Rajpal Yadav, Paresh Rawal and John Abraham have played many comedians in it. <br /> <br /> Remyak Sen was good to play Akshay Kumar's wife and thus there were all air hostels. Mr. Hot is a fashion photographer who likes the same girl Maggi (Neha Dupiya) as Mac Hat (Akshay Kumar) and Sam (John Abraham). When John Abraham betrayed his job, he became senior of Akshay Kumar and Akshay Kumar was really jealous because his flat would be given to John Abraham and Neha Dupiya would start to like him more. Akshay Kumar wants to be better than John Abraham, he has found a flat and he is taking three different girls (Humpty Chandra, Nargis Bagheri, Daisy Boppana).
