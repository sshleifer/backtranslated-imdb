I do not say that this movie is better than the real, but it is very good in its own right. The comedy is just as good as the original, and there are so many scenes that only make me laugh about them. <br /> <br /> This picture story is even more bizarre than the original, but that makes so great. Peter Hewitt did a great job to manage this film with a great job. The original cast from the original movie returns to their characters in this movie and performs great work on their roles. Nobody is saying, I congratulate Keonu Reeves! I enjoyed Ted's screenplay in these two films, just like the Alex Winter Bill. I'm very happy to be back in the role of George Carlin Rufus, very cool! Hall London Jr., who took part in Ted Logan's father, did a really good job. Ted where his father was a body and Hall of Fame in London was a great scene, where Ted started acting like Ted, and he pulls it off impressively well. I can not forget to mention the death of William Saddler, he totally made a movie for me. The rest of the cast is pretty good. <br /> <br /> If you like Bill and Ted's first installment, I hope you like this movie too. However, do not expect it as real as well. I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading. <br /> - Chorus
