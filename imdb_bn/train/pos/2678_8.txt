Hey, now I can not claim Jessie (Jesus) to show all of Franco's films, and sure enough that many of them can be seen, but this is a great deal (and weather) for me. I would have probably said that he was behind his head at the end of the 70's / early seventeenth century and some of the recent things were strange to me, and I have a lot to say about it. However, it is like a big dream where its various aspects appear to be true in different places. This woman is an actress or something that takes place in some theaters in Berlin, where the credit of "counterfeit" abuse is performed for the respected audience (?!) And that seems to be a problem with that dream. The real thing is to catch and what is not present in this movie, the real things are clearly not sharp focus and dream elements. He seems to exist in a state of deja vu. I say this does not make a whole lot of knowledge but it is quite wild and weird and entertaining. The Berlin shot considers this to be an uninterrupted and strange space, which adds to the atmosphere. Although the end is extremely casual, the film is over and the tape is black, I think you do not have to tell it at that moment. My copy was from Anchor Bay Euro-Trash Collection, and I say, give me more Euro-trash, I can not get enough crap. But it's a good shit.
