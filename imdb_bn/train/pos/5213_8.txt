The first review I wrote for IMDB was very reckless with me, but I grabbed this flashlight on HBO and I was sure that I saw it. Richard Gere is the great actress / detective in this movie who compels Roy to get the job. I think the story is great, and there is no humorous view that can slow down the film's speed. Part of the film, which is to work with ovarian sexual abuse, is quite frustrating, but if you've ever seen an crime movie like Se7en, you will be able to stomach the scenes properly. <br /> <br /> So everyone, if you are looking for a good detective / suspense movie, ignore the low ratings in this movie's IMDB and of course see it.
