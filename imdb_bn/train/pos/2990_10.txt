I think Ebert gave four stellos in four stars, but more than that, I have never read the positive reviews of this sad error drama about class classes, love and sacrifice (three themes are the most romantic stories or movies in general) <br /> <br /> Here is the main theme category section. Stella America is a story of depression era. That said, it was translated into the screen so that this reconciliation in this memorable fashion (if you asked the Stanwac fan or two) was not well appreciated. The original fans did not give it a chance. In addition, this version of Stella was created in the 1990s, in America (such as sadness) was not a very good financial problem. <br /> <br /> Now the time to remove pink eyeglasses. Through the new era of America's recession and poverty, and see that this powerful story still appears to be true, sometimes relevant to its updated format, timely and relevant. <br /> <br /> Yes, the main theme here is classified. Stella is working with a little dream of a poor, single, but little hope to realize the dreams. She works a bar, does not have much money, lived in a crummy apartment. You get drift In the morning, she really does not want to get to bed. On his wall, the pictures of the pictures are images of the images. <br /> <br /> A man saw his dance in the bar. He is rich, educated, high-class families, with whom Stella has nothing in common with. His main concern for participation in Ivy League College is how to rent, how to be happy. They have an affair. They like each other. Stella pregnant ends up. Stella told the guy. His reaction? "How about an abortion?" He replied, "I just wanted a room full of balloons." He offers balloons and proposals, but he sees that his heart is not in it, and his acceptability is very proud. She sent him packing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stella, alone and unexpected, and does not want her daughter to be unhappy for her one day, sacrificing a lot. She knew of any love and happiness to ensure the happiness of her daughter, and perhaps with optimism and hope, knew that at least at least for her daughter could survive. <br /> <br /> Now, for the movie. Everything is right about it Beautiful scores, artistic cinematography, great set design (contrast between two lifestyles; dirty apt and decorated palaces), wonderful and hearty performances by whole cast, especially Oscar worthy. <br /> This is a movie that is more important and orderly than your faith.
