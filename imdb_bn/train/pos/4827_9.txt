That's why historians / biographies are so important to all of us, and when they are done well, it's like that! <br /> <br /> I saw "The Young Victoria", I knew something Queen Victoria, but eventually I got a lot of knowledge about it. <br /> <br /> Emily Blunt is as great as Victoria! (Who would guess it!) And maybe Oscar will get this year's nomination. Personally, I'm glad for him ... <br /> <br /> For technical issues, I said that it was a very successful production, excellent art direction / set decoration and, of course, it could be a horrible time dress design! <br /> <br /> One drawback is that I want to see more and want to know more about this interesting queen, but the foremost, incredible woman and mother! <br /> <br /> Bravo 9 out of 10!
