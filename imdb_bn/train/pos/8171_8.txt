I understand that this review will inspire me with the expert film critics guaranteed by this site, but I will protect this movie. <br /> <br /> Dentist is a really good movie. Acting is not always the top notch, but Thrill is good and the story is good. Plus you see Linda Hoffman's boobies. I'm an expert in this field, but the direction seems good and the plot makes sense. Corbin makes a great opiate dentist. It's a storm that sharks do to the teeth ... there are. Perhaps it was a fairly limited budget, but they did well with what they could and well able to make the letters better. (<br /> <br />) Finish.
