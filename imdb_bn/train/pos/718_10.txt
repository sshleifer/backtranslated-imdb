Rock 'n' Roll High School was one of the best movies ever made! I think the only reason that was so terrible that Ramones! You could not make the same movie and could not do anything like sex pistols or ramose, it was not the same. DJ Youth, Clint Howard, Vincent Van Patin, Mary Warren, Paul Bertell, and Hall Mintrs, have been added to this movie. The whole film is about Ramon ... especially Joey! So everyone shows rock 'n' roll high school if you have a huge fan of real pond. Sissy is not a new shit ... but high, and quick kind. Only Ramones can do the kind of R.I.P (Peace Rest) Joey Ramone 1951-2001. Dei de Ramon 1952-2002!
