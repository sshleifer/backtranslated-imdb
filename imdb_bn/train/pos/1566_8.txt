Leslie Charters's novels, which appeared in the late 1930s as Templars, were brought to the screen with George Sander, in the novels of the little shadowy Simon Templar ("The Saint"). This was a warning - Sanders would occasionally play villains with "excellent role" (FIFAIT in the foreign competition, title hero of Ashleigh Harry Storm's Case, "best friend" made by Robert Montgomer in Heaven's Reggae). His "heavy personality" is slightly fits in order to maintain his laws and break a law, while his good-looking and satisfying behavior, the "Michael Mato" of Chester Morris's "Boston Blackie" and (somewhat) Peter Lor's "Mr. Mato". <br /> <br /> Movies are not the best series of movie mystery cereals - but they are beneficial. Similar to Rothban's Holles Series or Olds Chan series, the show often plays role-playing or playing new games (here in the movie starring opposite actress Wendy Bari, who will star in the second film). This, and a little known movie set, creates a comfortable experience for the viewers who listen to the sensation of this conversation (always shows the sense of keeping one step ahead of the bad move of the Sanders), notifying the plot's obvious flaws. There is a defect due to these mysteries because the best writers of this genre can not repeatedly repeat the old ideas. <br /> <br /> At the moment when it happened, one of the cast was filling her affection for Barrie, which she was long aware of. Shortly after trying to protect him from the police. But the film confronts the identity of a criminal mastermind, it has become clear that this person has been very little developed to treat such a mysterious mastermind (that is, the script probably being considered as suspected of suspected suspect). <br /> <br /> Bari is made by real culprits in a robbery gang after this proof that his father (died in prison). There are a number of people who help him in the way of William Gargon - and he takes advice from Mastermind that they are the ultimate stolen plan that can not be pinned on them. Photos His father is convicted (Jerome Kouan) Bery and determined to get her gang Jonathan Hale, who is giving shades to Sanders but is reluctantly working with him, is the only detective who can get the opportunity to solve the case only. <br /> <br /> The script has some nice moments of casting - Hell (currently a special diet), tempting to eat a rich lobster dinner prepared for Willie Best's sanders. As a result, he got a serious disaster by enabling Sanders and Bari to flee from Sanders Apartments. Sanders have to remind him to be the best (when he feels better) to head for a position he told to go for a certain time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Play - The death of a bogart is a memorable character in the film. <br /> <br /> The whole film made well for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939. It will entertain you even if you do not have it in your memory.
