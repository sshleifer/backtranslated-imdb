I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branag's version of Shakespeare classics, because he always does a very good job, but in this movie, the whole movie that is lifted is "always-great-actress" Lawrence Fishbarn. . Certainly he liked something poor in the film, even though he is an outstanding actor, but in this case we have indeed given Othello truly: passion, intensity of sincerity, because it became stronger with Fisher's well illustrated paranoia. , We're finally giving a black othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they can choose Othello better. Someone else sympathize / obstacles, love / hate and do not forget that, the eyes ...? Branagh is not always as good, but its peak is not fairly good, but it's a bit slowly, but it's a lot, Iren Jacob's Desdemona really leads it and makes it a very interesting and enjoyable movie. See it.
