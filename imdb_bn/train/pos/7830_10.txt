In "Die Nabulungen: Sigfraud", Siegfried was betrayed. Now, Kremlin wants revenge. He married Hagen and was involved in a very rigorous (but appropriate) step through several events. <br /> <br /> One of the things to watch today's movie is that we can be sure that the filming Attilune (known as Atel in film) is seen as a strange person, perhaps a signature in the Soviet Union. Obviously, Frott Lang's fault was not that Hitler used "The Nebulaulungleid" for the German national pride of Third Reich, but one can see what Fuhrer's story liked. Still, it's a totally weak movie.
