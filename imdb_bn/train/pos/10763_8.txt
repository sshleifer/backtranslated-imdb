I must admit that I was very suspicious about this documentary. I hope this is all the American campaign that we dislike here in Europe. I was roasted. This is not a campaign, it is rarely political. <br /> <br /> It shows the events of 9/11 with the eyes of the firefighters immediately after the plane crash. This is an amazing coin that was pictured at all in this documentary! This film was initially picturized as an anonymous pharmacist for becoming "a man". We can only thank filmmakers that they have continued their work in front of them in a terrible accident. <br /> <br /> A great part of the job. Absolutely stunning stuff. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Wishes,
