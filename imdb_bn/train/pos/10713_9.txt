The grandfather of an angry son who lost his parents sadly saw him. Together, they found the common ground in the folk tales that turned from breed to generation generations of generation. Although tragic episodes, such as the hyland clearance, storytelling, surprising amounts and ridiculous amounts of them. It is all imprinted in Skye, so there is a double dose of beauty. The mountain scenery is breathtaking, and it is a rare opportunity to hear the Gaelic talk of Scotland. I was in English, so I had to read the subtitles, but the words of the spoken language are wonderful. Performance is only what you expect from carefully selected non-actors - in other words, you are seeing the real thing - those who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history. The Gaelic people, especially Sky, did a number of small miracles to create the film. Anyone who is interested in geeks, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, many cultural or social justice, will see and watch this movie.
