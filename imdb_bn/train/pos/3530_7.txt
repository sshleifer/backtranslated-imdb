I can safely enter (as an IMDB gaay) that the 'Phantom Lady' does not ever crack in my film Noar 20. It may not even sneak into the top fifty. But instead of disrespecting the film for not being as good as many other classics of the movie Nir, it should be noted that 'Phantom Lady' has a strong and lasting picture that is enough for a suitable view. What the audience needs from is the ability to overcome horrible slow startups. <br /> <br /> The movie 'Kansas' (Ella Rains) tries not to cook until it tries to try it alone. His boss is innocent, Scott Anderson (Allan Curtis), who was convicted of murder. Anderson's secretary and 'night detective detective' at night in 'Kansas' The bride sleuth she works quite well for herself while working on night street in New York. Little little he started putting a piece together with a murder mystery puzzle. To be honest, the film is associated with Reyns and it only works because of its presence. In any case, he is able to breathe life into a condemned person who is not least interesting. I'm not sure that this split dynamic actor or director of a charismatic leading man is blamed, but clearly it is a bit wrong with this picture. <br /> <br /> As a rainy catchy young detective, things really accelerate to another secret gear when visiting the last night of a scary drummer (Eliish Cook, Jr.) to search for some information to help his scandalous boss 'Kansas' Do it. While he and the drummer visit the jazz club "all night", the city has a new kind of red color. If you try to describe this scene, the scene will be proven or worse an injustice, it can destroy all the scenes together. You will find the scene after the last impressive crash ends. If you are lucky enough to have this movie on DVD, you are more likely to see this scene again and again. As well as the rain, this view makes this image significant. This is basically in this scenario, because of which I gave 'Phantom Lady' a 7 instead of 6. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> In most cases, . This is a 'drum / sex scene' that distinguishes this movie from any other person. <br /> <br /> And it's been said like film "Do not make a mistake with vanilla", I'd love to add "vanilla", that would be a safe fall when someone decides to behave in a taste Can not <br /> <br /> 7/10.
