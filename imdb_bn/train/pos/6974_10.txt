I recently watched Mapica and thought that I could come and write a review! I saw this right after the series of Baltal Galactic series (I'm seeing that I'm going to the universe because I'm a big dorling fan boy) so I do not know what I can expect ... but I do. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But a dramatic event that points to the story's suggestion, but I suggest you look at it. <br /> <br /> Certainly ... Morley is just an actor who dragged a young Joseph Adama. .. (Admiral's father in Batlester galactic) I found his acting spot and I can believe that he is the father of William Adama from the BSG ... <br /> <br /> Eri Stoltz fits his role appropriately. ..! The polio walker was specially noticed outside of Rome! Do not sit and see the MapCa with its expectations like the Blaster Galactic, because the story line is very straightforward and nobody can see it. Even if you can not see the BSG! <br /> <br /> This show is a good writing drama for those who like to play with a bit of a sci-fi kick!
