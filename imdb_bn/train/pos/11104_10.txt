The Godfather Sea was a mafia scene from the executive suite, this series is a complex story of Mafia from a worker's perspective. If you have never seen this show, then you are in for an extended behavior. Yes, there is violence and nudity, but it is never ineffective and the thinking person needs gangster Tony Soprano against the reality of his life, and in spite of this, it is not known how many associates have ended. Tony Soprano can discuss his tie-up with his therapist, then he kills a man with a frying pan in anger, and when his nephew is separated and disposed of the body, watch the TV while taking a break, sit and eat sugar. Give advice to the nephew from Zarry, butter and his upcoming wedding as they finished the Sunday afternoon watching NFL football. Even when his wife Karmelau gave an opportunity to go out, she realized that she loved life with Tony and her perfection and was looking at another way of life with her own will. If you follow the whole thing, you know how it ends. If you do not, believe me that you have never seen the end of a TV show.
