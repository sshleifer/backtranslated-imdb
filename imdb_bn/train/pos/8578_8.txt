This image is one of the best American B-movies of the 90's. If you are looking for a serious film, look somewhere else. However, if you are looking for some steps, many shimmers and gangsters fight to cheeks on a tongue of tongues, looking at the value of this good observer. Everyone shouts a little bit visible, but the film is really what it is, and everyone is absolutely fun. Donald Sutherland and John Lathgo also have a great chemistry and want to do another film together.
