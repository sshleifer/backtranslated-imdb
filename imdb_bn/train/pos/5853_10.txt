The look of the arena, the screen and overall appearance were interesting for me only for some reason because I really like this Summerslam. However, this might be the best of the summer if the lefts have not been lugged in the main event against the Yokozuna in WWF, now it is okay to make a huge fat man strong for the time, but I have been happy to change times. It's a terrible major event just as every match luger is terrible. Other matches on the card include Razzor Ramon vs. Ted Davies, Steiner Brothers vs. Havnely Agency, Shaun Michaels vs. Kart Henning, this show where Shawn takes his bodyguard's big giant diesel, IRS vs. 1-2-3 Kid, Bret Hart firstly to Donny and Harts and Staff were always very attractive with Lollar, when Ludwig Bargha destroyed Marty Genety, Undertaker had another Take giant ganajalejake anaka matches, smoking and hedasasinkarsa gunasa and took bigeloke tatanka left Left, and this saved the world title match against lugarera iyokojuna Lex was boring and it's a terrible end. But it deserves 8/10
