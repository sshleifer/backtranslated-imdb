If anyone wants to know if the film is an art form then you can do something worse than ordering them in this movie. <br /> <br /> It is simply the perfect combination of stories, scripts, actors and films committed for celluloid. <br /> <br /> During the Second World War, English fog played a destructive bomb pilot missile missed by his celestial conductor, and his next brush played on the heavenly authority (or on his head). David Nevan and Kim Hunter are pinned with pan ache and incredibly touched - especially in the opening scenes when the devastating pilot (Niven) Ground Radio operator (Hunter) describes his disaster. <br /> <br /> The intelligence of other barbarism is superior to Jack Cardiff's photography and incredible production designs. <br /> <br /> The maximum touch extended to the visible shots in the black and white scenes presented in the technicolor and on Earth's scenes - it's even literal conductor (a fantastic Marius Goring) <br /> <br /> is not only a height in the British movie, but the film A higher point.
