I'm not usually a musical boyfriend, but if I like it then my favorite image must be Oliver. This film is very well-formed, characters are well-depicted, dresses are good and the songs are very good, my favorite is 'Reviewing the Citizen', Ron Moody, who gave Fagin a brilliant screenplay. I was not old enough to see Oliver when it was released at the end of the 60's but my sister was there, so at the end of the week I forced them to sing bloody songs, usually it was 'buy my wonderful rose'. I knew all the songs before watching the movie. It's a timeless musical you definitely can not reproduce it, it stands on its own. This book is not correct and I do not think that if it works very well then I do not think so. I do not think Charles Dickens will be frustrated, because he wrote how to portray poverty in the city of Oliver, orphanage, work room and how poor the poor had to take shelter, and the film is very good. Another great reason to watch this movie is the Old Bull Terrier Bullets in Old Style, notice its long slender stomach, which was produced from breeding many years ago, they found high and low prey to find a sample. She, and she just met an English Bull Terrier Victorian Bar. There are also scars in her face (which probably makeup), Bill Sykes has probably been using him for dog fighting or rats. A Victorian Bull Terrier was killed in a record quantity in a rat rat. He was a beautiful dog in any way, and he aimed to disobey the Bill Sykes after killing Nancy, he probably did not have his values. It is a great musical to see if you like musical instruments, and if you do not like musical instruments, try any way, this film has something for everyone.
