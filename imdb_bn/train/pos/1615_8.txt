An Italian romantic comedy drama about an Italian widow who is planning to marry a man (Danny Iselo) who is comfortable with a man, reads his head, angry brother (Nicholas Cage). The script is sharp with lots of lines, extraordinary sounds, accents (I'm told), characters are perfect and cinematography is beautiful. New York does not look so good on the screen. Initially for Chair and Olympia Doubakis, they must be seen - they both are superb and uniquely able to get Oscar. A beautiful, funny picture. A must see!
