I saw PBS this 25 years ago. It was very hard to see. Very real It was hearty Ranjan to see this little family struggle in winter. There is no time for the door: Fate has thrown us together and we keep our shoulders in the grindstone and it works. It was based on the woman's actual diary, which I read many years later. He said in his diary that his parents had died when he was young and all his sisters and sisters had to do farm work to feed themselves. She did not like the lady in which she learned dirty. He was afraid that any prince would not want to impress the impressive woman with sun-brown, corrupt hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to make seeds and he was happy to do it. Both were widows and they worked together to build a new house. It was very sad when the child died. Of course, if they had it today, I was sure it would be fine. That makes only tragic extra sad. I had to cry very hard. But then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. Spring is its way, and life goes on. In his diary, he had two more sons and they lived, and they lived there.
