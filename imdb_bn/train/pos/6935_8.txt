James Stewart, the Westchester Rifle star, retaliated with a western Western story related to the fate of the film. Stewart is excellent saying the nice to add some cold-hard obsession to the cowboy back to his back. After winning the contest by our hero and following the fate of Weissherster Rifle and his owners, the story is stolen by the huntsman. <br /> <br /> We meet a selection of gamblers, gun fighters, Indian businessmen, and as bank robbers we follow the path of rifles through Indian wars, bank heists etc. All with hard stands standing as a live wire gunfighter with live gun guns with a finger trigger finger with supportive thrown by Dan Durable. Also seen as an Indian citizen, Rock Hudson is very quick to see. <br /> <br /> The last showdown is a classic tanning rifle fight and a long way round around a rocky outcry. Throw in some good old western activities, make it for boxing, shootout, and chasing the horseback, for the western courage. 8/10
