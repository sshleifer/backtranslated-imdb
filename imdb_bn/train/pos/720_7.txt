Just imagine what the school was like at a school like this: The kids are a big gang with a really good taste in the music and united against bad titles and teachers. "Rock 'n' Roll High School" is taking place in the world. It's like life coming from a Ramones record. Characters are stupid, innocent and charming like Ramones' song, and the music itself is fantastic High school jokes have changed completely, if you compare a movie like "American Pie" with this classic 70's classic, where no shameless sexual jokes are made. As a remix is ​​apparently visible, it can probably be expected that the original joke will be lost on the road and Bill Hicks will be replaced by the virtual, semi-funny dick jock used to call them. However, the main problem is that the ramones can not be replaced. They are the perfect band of this movie and someone else may come around taking their place. So, the best thing is to leave the original, like Quikki and the charming. Gabba-gabba hey!
