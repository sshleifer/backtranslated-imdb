Michelle Rodriguez is the acting actress who may be the charging force for other actors. In her career, she has an oddity (and closing it) to play the role of a tough girl who is very quick to see, which is a achievement that should be recognized. Although his subsequent films played him the same role, this film was made for his debacle. <br /> <br /> His character is a romantic student / warrior / lover who is struggling to overcome his unknown existence in the project, which is a little more in the picture ... but not the girl. This view of this movie is not very original, but the story grows deeper when it comes to hot relationships with this girl that gets warm and her initial rage goes away. <br /> <br /> I'm not the actor yet to see the aggressive attitude of making movies, and I'm glad he turned the original bust out of Hollywood. This movie got me 7, because the average story of the young people of the Jews, but it is such a great actress who rarely seen in the lowest budget movie. Great job
