Yes it can be vague and does not seem as fun as many high budget comedies, but if you really see it, this movie is really fun. Tim Meadows has always hit me as the Saturday Night Live show closed fun. Whenever he plays this character, I laugh. So I saw it was going to play in Comedy Central one day, I decided to test it. I was very much impressed with this movie because it did not mean to win an Oscar or to be a comedy of the year, but it gives entertainment to Saturday Night Live fans who love the character of Ladies Man This film has been packed with several quotes that can be read for several years.
