My favorite Jackie Chan movie "Dracula Master" (1978), followed by 1985, followed by "Police Story". In between, Chan is a Hong Kong Super-Police who has made an infamous criminal lord and his gang brutal and then assigned him the responsibility of protecting Man's girlfriend (Braggate Lynn) so that he can launch state proofs. The story continues, gangster sends his knees to send lin, but Chan receives his own fists and legs on the subject, putting girlfriend Maggie Cheng in the Gulf area. Like "drunk master", most of the "police story" has signature stunts and top martial arts / action choreography, which became popular in the chain and has become famous for the royal hiking of the battle in a crowded shopping mall. His role as the director, Chan exceeded excellence, accentuates performance to provide a charismatic and fun performance. In the light of "The Police Story" heart "drunk master", in the light of the overall skeptic humor, a police story, a fantasy cop-thriller that will be copied in the coming years. <br /> <br /> 10/10
