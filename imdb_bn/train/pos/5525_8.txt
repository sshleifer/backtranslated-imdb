Many people seem to have problems with this film that they think that the story was more entertaining (based on an ignored real story) or annoying against a movie that praises Che (which is not really that). This image is very close to the impressive Bio of John Anderson's Chain and feels the story right. Che's Bolivian adventure that has a wonderful job to set the mood for the stimulating frustration is Soderburgh. You really get the idea of ​​Bolivian peasant's total intensity and ridicule about Che's revolutionary ideas or the problems faced by people in his hunger and terrain. Sorry, there was a challenge to the movie fan challenge but that's how it happened. So Rambo did not go to the movie in hopes of firing, it is a real story!
