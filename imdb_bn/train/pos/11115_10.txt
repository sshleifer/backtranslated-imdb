I believe that spirits are a great display due to its supplementary characters. I have bought every video so far and are waiting for the rest. So far the best of 42 episodes is the episode # 3, denial, anger, acceptance. This episode is related to my most favorite character in Sopronso. His name was Brendan Filon. He was killed to hijack the wrong truck and accidentally kill the truck driver. Brendon was terrible because he was actually one of the few characters standing in front of Tony and his gang. In the end, he ended up getting a shot through his eyes while bathing, and this is my favorite favorite in the history of Sapransos. Brendan Filone for me # 1. And my # 2 favorite character was Matthew Bevilak, who died after trying to kill Christopher Maltissanti. After Tony and the car caught him, he shot him in the park in Hakkalburne. My # 3 favorite character Shian Gishomont, who died after shooting Christopher. And finally, one of the # 4 most favorite characters of Chaky Sainor, Hennen of Single Junior. He was killed in a boat by Tony. All the horrible characters are dead. That's just the bad thing about Sopranos. All cool boys always kill. What about the change in the sopranans? They must have a whole episode where they will see all dead fans in hell and they are trying to torture Chris, Tony, Uncle Jr., Silvio and Poli, because they have to be revenge. Brendan Filone strike back !!!!!!!!! 1
