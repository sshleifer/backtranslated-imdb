I like this movie for two reasons: 1) Jeff Combs is absolutely surprising. Rudder plays the role of the modern wizard. (And absolutely comfortable.) 2) The film has helped to inspire a role-playing game that I fully enjoy, a matter of consciousness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The plot is fast and attracted to simplicity, special effects are so good for budgets and scripts, but not very starred, and Chess in all the right places. A good way to spend an evening.
