Spinners have tested the comedy series today or at the same time with the idea of ​​insufficient freedom. In an early part of the cartoon "Family Guy" cartoon, the Griffin family said that their home was an independent nation for America's United States and the story progressed from there. On the way back to 1949, Yelling Studios created a wonderful little movie with the same concept. <br /> <br /> After the child's surprise, Pimilico residents discover a small fortune in riches. It became evident in the search that a small area of ​​the long lost kingdom of Burgundy was small. From London and from the rest of Britain, small street residents enjoy problems with joy and experienced state. <br /> <br /> This story was brilliantly and equally inspired when Rashan was running. Stanley Holley, Betty Warren, Philippe Steinton and a young Charlotte Hauterai's performance are well-versed with the best actors of their generation. This actor is also an excellent little scripts along with some cracking lines as well as helpful. Despite being more than 50 years old, it seems fresh immediately, the story does not seem weird and always keeps the audience entertained. <br /> <br /> Elig Studio is one of the best British films of all time. Why it's not difficult to see with "Passport to Pimicon" movies. Fun from the beginning, the story is always fun and always worth watching.
