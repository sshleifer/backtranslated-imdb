It is not as bad as a movie as some critics, and as a summary of the IMDB page for this movie. Why? The first is that in 1984, filmmakers were brave enough for the disaster, as one of the plot components, the issue of domestic violence - so critics who complained about this plot, sadly missed one of the main points! Secondly, the musical measurements will not work in addition to elements of the relationship with Prince's abusive father - so the critics say that only music is good, yet one of the points has missed - especially, why it is so good ... because all the music in this movie is a plot element Backdrop that makes music more effective. Third, give this movie a break! Film producer and director for the first time, it's not just bad! There are so many bad movies there in the movie done !! And to the end, critics say that the song "good" also missed the point - see the effectiveness of stylistic musical treatments, variety, music, and prince stage - a genre, musically, where there was no one else in the 1980s and other artists (clothes and movement: No supplementary ingredients come first, a style that can be seen by Michael Jackson or Prince's work In front of Prince's eyes in this movie, long before Quintin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction") As a sum of its parts, all at a bad movie.
