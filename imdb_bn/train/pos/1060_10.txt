Dark Angel Huxley's brave New World and Persis Luv in the Rhyoes portrays both distant future in the worst sense of the word as a cross-instability and annoying mixture of sequences. Once someone can bring modern golf with "Pauls", it provides a recreational landscape to look for personality and relationships between two individual characters - Max (Dark Angel / Cycle Messenger). Logan (rich rebel). It is unfinished, perhaps the result of several authors, but holds energetic, beautiful and charming Jessica Alba together, who think both firm and neutral but both weak and sensitive. I think Fox has done it again.
