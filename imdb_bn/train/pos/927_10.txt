"The Father of the Pride" Unfortunately, one of the best folks who do not have very long life. And it's very sad, especially if you think that the worst shows are still in the air (think of "simple life") I admire the similarity with this show and "Simpsons", but despite the similarity, the show has its own qualifications . Animation is not enough, not incredible, but good. Best characters All the animals were very likable and funny, and even had their moments of sigfried and judgment. The song was good, I liked many songs. <br /> <br /> Even if the show is not very real, I think it has a lot of potential. A show like "Mission Hill" which is not very famous but I liked so much, this gratitude that it was not deserved. What a shame
