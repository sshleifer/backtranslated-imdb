I read such a messy post about MacPay in this game, when I first played it, I think it's a Mac Pen style (not just bullets) -time). So when I played it for a few hours I realized how fun! And unlike "Mac Payne", yes the bullet time is slightly similar, but I think it fits differently in the game-style. This game is a non-stop action - a mix up between a shoot up and a fight-up, a lot of fun, as a big fan of Max Payne, I must say that the DTR story is not close to Max's greatness, the graphics are a little average and some levels are the same Look, but if you want a bit more "bullet time", you should certainly own this game.
