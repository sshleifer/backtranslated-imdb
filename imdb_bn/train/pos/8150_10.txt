Me, Cousin Lemons is certainly a fair looking woman. This movie is a deadly "musical" of the lost gem, the 90's hip hop scene, when MC Hammer started to return from that good night. We follow three members of NW because they start their journey of wealth and fame. And like Nicholas Nicholini, they started their journey to the end where they did not start, but at least a little wise and a lot less naive. It's not one of the best movies that nobody ever heard of, but it's like a lot like "company man" about movies that you love or hate. I respect this movie like New York's Upstate 1000 Island: It's a nice little secret that you want to keep yourself with.
