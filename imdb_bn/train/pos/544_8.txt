I like this movie. Instead of killing only the woman, the first one (the cabin by the lake) was the same, he also killed the men. And the scenes are even more interesting, the first two of my favorite scenes, when Stanley and Allison are in the dance club and he's describing Camberley's last moments before throwing in the water and secondly, when Stanley Allison is visiting the basement, just before they set down, he When kissing Those scenes for me were very intense and riveting. I gave the movie a rating of 8/10, because the movie was not bad, but the picture was bad because, I mean that there was a time when you could not see any flaws, like a movie shot shot, you can "live" The camera will not see shooting, but then, too small, you will notice the mistake of filming. What was wrong
