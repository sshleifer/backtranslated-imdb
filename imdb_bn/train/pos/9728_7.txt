I am a great fan of Simon Peg and have seen so many of his movies so far and some of them forced me to laugh. How to lose friends and isolated people <br /> <br /> This movie is a good one about a person to stop pissing people. However, there is a neutral set of ethics that prevents him from doing something that can make him famous. But in the end he finished his work, the culture of living. <br /> <br /> This movie looks good with humor, romance, good acting and a lap dance. This is a movie where you can only be happy when it ends.
