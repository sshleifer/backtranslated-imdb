The horrific equation is a beautiful episode with some errors. The first issue of this episode is that it happens near the South-Western Idaho Mountain Home Air Force Base. The season's one's 'Deep Throat' came around Ellen Air Base, also performed in south-western Idaho. I'm surprised if the air force bases are one and the same, but they decided to use the real name of terrific prosperity. Mulder and Scully have some good dialogs, always a plus. Zoo keeper Ed Mitchell reminded me of cranky, old school teachers. They liked the kids at one time, you just can not imagine. Just as he would take more care for animals at one stage. I like the concept of this episode, but I think it was some contradiction. If Alien kidnaps people and is so fit to return safely, why can not they bring the animal back to the right place? And alien now, is the problem of animals coming back now? I can not buy Mulladar's theory of space-time continuation. If that is as an expert that he is. I thought the performance of Gel Atkinson was not as good as Will Ambrose. Apart from that naptop, I still enjoyed this episode because the inspiring idea of ​​the alien creatures DNA and human DNA collections.
