This movie is entirely in Swiss bilingual, perhaps it is quite difficult to follow most of the German-speaking film. I was not from Switzerland, but used to work there for a few years, so my colly lord of this sensation realized this great fool. I have seen a lot of such movies (such as scary movies, cc spoofs etc.) but this is the best, I have seen so far. I can give 9 out of 10. The only reason I can not give 10 is because there are a few short details which could work well and because there is no subtitle in any language in the DVD, so there is almost no chance to understand the non-Swiss.
