When I was in Central TV broadcast in December 1989, I first saw this movie in the UK. I still have video tapes, though tired (many friends and family members have borrowed it for many years and it's too cold!). However, I remember coming home that night, grab Christmas Tipol, switch lights, and see what is being said as 'Christmas Ghost Story'. Even now I remember in some scenes that I still stand on my neck ... <br /> <br /> I saw some comments on the movie which is not saying it is not it ... It seems that Friday 13th and wings, stalks And Slash Rommel, who is sunny. This is a 'traditional' ghost story; There is no big budget action or special effect ... no oath, no blood, no unwanted sex scene, no chainsaws or guns etc ... So how to refresh !!!! It's atmospheric. If you like cool intimidation, well written, well played and with a truly awesome atmosphere, it's a movie for you. I like the main scare; Only last night I saw the original hunting and it's a fantastic movie. Very atmospheric again - and so women in black. Separated with the last book of the movie, but still very good. I recommend it Try it ... if you like traditional ghost stories but you like it ... so ... turn off the lights, turn on the fire, close the doors, drink and enjoy ...:)
