I've seen a bunch of scenes later in the premiere (especially now it follows the Amazing Race), but it's one of the best examples of writing and acting from Brackhammer's room. Especially the small officers' spot and spripte and editing, soundtrack, and the performance made this episode with Tour de Ball. If I was a producer, then I would submit this episode for the AMDC. The 48-minute episode was made by coup and Jimmy; It's making the best talented people the best. Hopefully this episode has a warning to repeat because I'm sure that I do not notice about the first time that many of that.
