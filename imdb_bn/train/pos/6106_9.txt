When it comes with eroticism, I am not fortunate enough to see the plot in the first 20 minutes or looking for something else to see. This movie is different Julie Davis (I Pray You You Do Touch Me), this adventurous thriller Kira Red and Doug Jeffery played two very strong leadership. Who believes as a sweet innocent romance novelist "Kim", which has been caught on the web of Dougher Jeffrey's "The Man", a handsome neonator found on the web. What gives her the role of obstacles and actresses in the role and only one other and can provide a depth and credibility. I still believe its to be the best performance. And the direction of Julie Davis is a great gift to Ertika.
