Many Americans will say ... what ??? My opening remarks. Yes I know that my comparison is not without disrespect to Master Akira Kurosawa's fans, but if you analyze this movie then my comments are correct. We have a farmer in the city to search for help against the grassroots people who want to steal the village crops. The great difference is the way that takes the story. Our surfers, essentially a band of circus performers, are a very complex mix of personality but ultimately the need for the village is in Herod's need. Please see this incredible movie again (perhaps seven Samurai) and find another movie that stole the story and try to get the same magic effect from Akir Kurussa's masterpiece. With a 13th Warrior Antonio Banderas, Michael Crickton copied the story of his best seller, but he could not find the third party of the cat.
