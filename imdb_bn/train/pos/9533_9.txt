This could not have been better. Strong restraint on Mike Sullivan's expressions could not be portrayed in any other way. Tom Hanks delivered his career best performance. Young Tyler Hochlin drives a mental wheel; Playing the original character for the story. And veteran Paul Newman gave a long acting performance of his best character. <br /> <br /> This image is based on Max Alan Collins and Richard Paire Runner's bold graphic novel. This is the story of a father / son that principally recruits both candidates for the role. Mike Sullivan had no children, so John Rooney took him away. Although a liberal man, Mr. Rooney was involved in the organized crime. Therefore, Sullivan's debt was paid only for business involvement. Now, Sullivan has a wife and two children and is trying to keep her children safe, but at the same time return her boss. Following events will test the loyalty of Sullivan and embrace the fate of his family. <br /> <br /> The dialogue with David Adopt a great adaptation rarely comes, but still very honest. This story covers a dark rain (ground snow) outpost in a beautiful setting of 1930 (Richard L. Johnson and Nancy Hyhe's Brilliant Art Directions). Driving the story, Thomas Newman's wonderful Irish scores only lasted when needed. <br /> <br /> However, Konrad L. is the most important technical component of the movie. Beautiful photography of the hall. This is some of the best cinematography I've seen; And I watch many movies. In the scene when Mike and Michael are in the car, Chicago writes quite impressive. The shot starts in front of the car at the start, reveals Mike (hongs) through the windshield. Subsequently, Michael (Whochlin) woke up and passed by the side of the car to get out of the window next to it. As it continues, it displays a superb look at the truck and the dolly completely around the car and in Chicago in 1930. <br /> <br /> With a great cast and crew, the original man creates wildly amazing movies. I'm talking about Sam Mendes, who made his film debut in 1999 with American beauty. (He won several awards) before the American beauty, Mendes worked as the director of the plays of the British Theater, but decided he was not saying anything new for him in the theater. With only two films, Sam Mendes has himself identified himself as a great director (in the list of forty-five). <br /> <br /> This image has enlightened a great style which is its hit and miss and brilliantly reveals the true theme. Photography, acting and stories incidentally I'm still waiting for New York gangs in Scotland, but for now, I say that this is the "Best Movie of the Year". Considering its competition (marks, insomnia, minority reports) is a strong statement.
