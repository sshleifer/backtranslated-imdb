First of all, the adaptation is not as good as a book, especially when you are working with Master Writer like tokens. This expression, surprisingly, synthesizes Token's universe with the cycledia, aesthetic and liberal culture of the 1970s. Yes - animation and background painting are sometimes "rough" in its technological execution, but it is not visible that it is not visible and it is rarely encouraging to give a unique "place idea" for each scene. Imagery played absolutely outstanding voice outside of absolute uniqueness - the newest acting action movie that is best from acting. And while cell animation may not be the most "technically efficient" animation, it nicely captures the performer's physical and facial gestures in order to make it look great and dull. Background images are completely different from traditional "fantasy" motifs, but transformation from abstract settings always inspires and greatly contributes to the theme of the movie. If you are a person who wants to do great computer rendering in the film then everything is imagined for you but I can see how you would not like this movie, but if you enjoy higher acting, extraordinary imagery and JRR Tolkien, then this film must be seen .
