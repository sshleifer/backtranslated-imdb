I saw this important intense film tonight. The most important and best works of Richard Gere and Claire Dane As a sex offender registrar administrator, a retired person has the ability to receive Oscar for his forced posting for retirement. Claire Dance is writing a female as a cemetery handpiece for her replacement - A woman is trying to test what she can do while investigating a final case, in which the character of the character has been confirmed that one of her surveillance is to keep a young girl hostage. May It is frustrating, sex offenders and those who monitor them, but this movie will not be forgotten soon. I know that I will be scared for a long time. A screen painting is horrific due to Anthony Hopkins's serial killer's screenplay and so can prevent me. Do not miss opening credits so the film opens with a glaring statistic. Intense and memorable Richard Gere's best role can prove to humans. Dances are good and both of them can work exceptionally well in these often challenging movies. <br /> <br /> This is a great film and cube has a multi-layered deep-felt performance. Just give him an Oscar ... he deserves it!
