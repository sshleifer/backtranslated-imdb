For what it is, it's a pretty good movie. I like John Stamos ("Full House") and Stockwell both ("Christine", "Top Song"). They give both strong performance. Love interest is okay, but it is more than a movie of a movie than a good date movie. I love Harleys, and I hate seeing their old army olive drawab with "14 coats of hand-covered bodies". Here is a short story lesson that plays a key role in WWII on the Harley-Davidson motorcycles. I do not know what training was like this training! The film directs my interests to all directions without slowing down, with good riding action sequences. I love watching votes on the history population - an 18-year-old man gave the movie 10 (the true bike lover, guess). I can not give it 10, but I gave it 8. I do not weigh with the same scale on each scale. There are movies which were in big budget, with big actors, you expect to be good so that they fail to fail if they fail. (Star Wars - mountains are my best example) I like the first three SW films, but I did not compare the episodes I was weak. So from this movie it gets a low rating from me. I hope more from George Lucas.
