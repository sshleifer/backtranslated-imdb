Although I live in Minnesota, I recently studied in France and came across a scary gem of a film. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, at least say. A creative and unique film, different interpretations of separate love for light is different from Dr. The first trend is to try to fit each of these short stories into the overall story, which can actually be done with the love of 2003. This effort, however, makes the magic of each separate segment obsolete. When taken towards the face value, each individual is taken as a separate picture, the love story is a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The movie is sometimes intertwined - often confusing - and it may be difficult to follow each individual segment. Yet, a surveillance that gave close attention to each division, after a short time the short plot lines became clear. Confusion is almost intriguing; It will have to wait for what keeps on the edge of your seat next. It surprises the audience "really it happened?" Yet it satisfies them that it actually happened. This is a movie where visitors can not decide when they leave the theater, they actually do not like it or they hate it. The initial reaction is to go back and see it again, only to see this film mixing this personal life together with artificial composition. <br /> <br /> The decision to make the film's multilingual interesting is something to be interesting people. Can relate. It adds more to the reality of the movie - here, American tourists can speak English, Parisians French, etc. The number of people in the film led to understanding the international language of love. <br /> <br /> The mysteries of illness, the love of parents and the love of parents, the basis of this film is the romantic story. In its beautiful and quirky way, each unique event is falling in a place to tell any story: all types, sizes, nationalities, and love size.
