This movie is intelligent. That is, it crosses the general index at least compared to other movies - fools probably will not appreciate it. The story relies heavily on dialogue. There are some parallels in the Lost in the translation, although before sunrise many brilliant, less intense, and much better. <br /> <br /> The script, characters, and even a little too much atmosphere feel completely realistic. Actors absolutely brilliantly play. Very rarely I saw a movie where the script and the role matched it perfectly. <br /> <br /> The dialogue with the risk of becoming the top spot is very personal. Although, it is almost always on the right side, although I feel a little painful and embarrassed in a few moments. These fine line balances claim to shocking actors. Sometimes, it generates great results, and overall this movie is awesome! Not only is it very rarely portrayed in the movie "Love", which I believe is trustworthy and realistic. Each time that is achieved, the results are fantastic. I think the stunning and visible timeless beauty of the female lead actress has helped this honor quite a bit. Even after 12 years he is looking stunning in this picture. <br /> <br /> This is simply a gem of a movie that you can not miss Since 1990, one of the best movies!
