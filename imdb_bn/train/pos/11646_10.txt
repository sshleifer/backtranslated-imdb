Although this movie is one of the most favorite of Mexican producer producers: the ultimate life in our cities, this is a fun way to keep on screen. More important than the last time, the Mexican director has reached the history of four different literary ways, because it can be frustrating or ridiculous, which gives us a film with an open expression. The issue in our country, but in a very different way, which gives him a fresh voice. <br /> <br /> A little familiarity with actors, but their papers explain in a wonderful way, reflecting the idea that every story of the director has been identified anywhere in the world, that pain and laughter ability are sad to celebrate. Perhaps this picture was not enough for many people in our country, but I think people from other countries can find interesting and share Mexican supremacism.
