In New York, family funeral consultant Allan Johnson (Don Chadle) met his ex-roommate and friend Charlie Feynman (Adam Sandler) on the street. On September 11th, after sadly damaging his wife and three daughters, Charlie became lonely and humiliated, having problems with Allen about his intimate feelings with his wife. Alan has had a friendship with Charlie and they have been close to each other. Alan has tried to fix Charlie's life, sent him psychologist Angela Wakhrst (Liv Tyler), but there is an aggressive reaction to Charry's treatment and sent to court. <br /> <br /> "Do me reign" drama about good harm, friendship, family and loneliness. On 11th September the plot is irrelevant. It is a car accident, a fire or any other tragedy, as well as Donna Rima's sexual harassment, which can play Allen by the supernatural Saffron Burrows. But family drama works, supported by great performances by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Liv Tyler is impossible to be recognized, I do not know whether he is using too much makeup to look at the old look, but his face is weird My vote is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Rain Sobber Mim" ("Reign Me")
