An axellent second installment that is operated as well as the first. <br /> <br /> Again, the welding is just wonderful. I want to see how there is nothing in common with the first and second episode intelligence and cleverness. <br /> <br /> The second episode is very funny, very stupid and very enjoyable. This is the first Christmas episode, after a woman was tortured by a serial killer wearing Santa costum after killing her own husband. Just like the first episode; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous scenario is related to the murder of her husband and her phone, first of all, scared her until her fear is filled.
