I'll be honest with you ... I liked this picture. It's a wonderful zombie flick packed by action, original ideas, good acting, but it's also packed with the effects of bad zombie. Part IV, the title "After Death" is also good. I would recommend this photo to the fearful fans everywhere. <br /> <br /> 10 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of this type of movie should find puppet master, skid alive, slam party genocide, camping in the sleep, and Other full moon photo flicks For other recommendations, check the other comments I have sent by clicking on my name above this comment section.
