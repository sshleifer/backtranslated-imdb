An entertaining B movie with Gary Busi running Plato. This is a fairly unknown movie, so I saw it on a car booth that I think it looks like I was right. Gary has played Plato Smith in a solid tenant who is ready for the murder. Plato now has enough time to prove his innocence with the help of friends powered by the powerful Cuban criminal Steve Bauer (Squareface) and action star Jeff Spaksman (Specialist). What I liked about Plato's run is that the film can never be boring, it can be done before, but it was still good to see that the act was fun and the action was quite fun, especially Climax Gary Bushi is a good hero since he is usually a bad guy The game and Steve Bowler are also good as Plato's Sidekick, so Jeff Spaxman performs well and plays the plate The score in the end he can not work well. This is an enjoyable effort from non-image films and I can give 7 out of 10 movies
