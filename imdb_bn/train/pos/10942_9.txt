Fast and quick to look at the "racism" of the show and jokes, yet laughably sexist, dry headache is too quick to say "good, duo, these other things make this joke very good because at least they have hot women." It is very annoying. Abortion trick is great because, really, since it takes abortion seriously? At least I am not a * bore * son. I've heard that Reba McInntire and Sarah Silverman are gathering together for a movie about a road trip together. Talk about a movie of the year!
