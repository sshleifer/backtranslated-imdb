Overcooking beautiful movie! Robert Kulap was very good in the film and was perfect for the part! It is hard to believe that it is a true story but what can you do? When I saw it, I thought why they had to do everything. That's not right, but they have learned their text when they take the wrong person! However, if you've ever seen this movie on TV, it's a good one!
