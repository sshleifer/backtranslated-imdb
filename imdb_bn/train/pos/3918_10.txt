Float, dramatic, riveting as Flamenco itself, the film is simply amazing. It is set to immortal budget music. The original song is written and performed by the largest classical guitarists, in the modern Flamenco style Paco de Lucia, who plays a musician with the same name. The legendary Flamenco dancer and dancer Antonio Godus wrote this script and recorded the fabulous version of the famous Georges budget / Prosper Marami novel / opera. He is also a prominent character Antonio, a famous dancer / dancer who works to restore the story of the Flamenco-style Carmen, combines dance with singing and lithic hand clapping, and has high speed dynamism that makes visitors much more appealing. /> <br /> Brilliant and compelling Cristina Hoyos whose technical superiority shines the role of supporting her dancer's elegant artistry. Hayes was the company's first dancer for the twentieth century (1968-1988) and he was the heroine of three films, Carlos Soura Gods's three wonderful shows: "Bodas de Sangre" (1978), "Carmen" 1983) and "El Amro Brugo" (1985) ). Gorgeous Laura del Sol Carmen, a young dancer, among whom was one of the most influential novels written by French Carmen, who wrote in 1846, the author of Prospermrima's immortality, which inspired the world famous opera-comic of George Bazet. Version since 1875. <br /> <br /> Like the opera and the novel, the comedy of the solar film is fun and deadly, one of the best women's fattles that will be free from anything else. He can not tolerate the tyrannical love of any person and loves death for submission. 50 movie adaptations of the story and the opera on the screen, and as far as is different, there is only one possible tragic end among them. The Solar / Gods film is all truly unique as Spanish and Spanish. It was the first time I saw it for the first time since the twentieth century and it was very special and beautiful as before. Highly recommended.
