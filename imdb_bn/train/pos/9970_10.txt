Highly used technicolor illustrates the optimistic final images of the current Christmas show. Visible elements of the scene (Santa and Pedro's society behaved over Pyarring through telescopes) were unique (and apparently stolen this theme in his photo "Peerot le-Fou", although Jean-Luc Godard, though he was fine). Highly recommended!
