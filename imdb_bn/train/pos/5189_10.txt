<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Woo - RULEZ forever (without some Hollywood moments ...). John Woo - The Greater Director of the Century. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the big director is not much intellectual ... but he is the mathematical and spiritual figure of all free mind! <br /> <br /> Like her movie poetry! Woo movie Shakespeare! One movie madam! WoW bladetz mosset !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
