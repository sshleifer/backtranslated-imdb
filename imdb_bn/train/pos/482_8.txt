Photographs with a poem, amazing presentations and sensitive artists in this film. It captures perfectly the atmosphere of time and place. (Lake District of Italy of the twentieth century.) It is a love story with a twist. Characters are unique and trustworthy The settings are delicious exotic. Some scenes --- fog funeral boats - long narrow shots of chess table in a complexly patterned tile floor center --- beautiful pictures. And instead of compulsory happy completion, this story is a bitter sweet. If the film is an art, it is near an excellent composition <br /> <br />
