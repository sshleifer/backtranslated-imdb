Cliffhanger director Renee Harlin has done a modest act of criminal mischief, which seems to be commendable for his film expert Claimer, who has himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals to investigate the case of a cash-stolen one. Rocky mountain Especially in action / war sequences, Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gebe Walker's Expert Claire, but some of them must be bound to the boundaries of the Unreality line. Although for the film I was willing to suspend my unbelief. John Lithgow, Michael Rumer, Jenin Turner, Rex Lynn, Caroline Goodal and Leon are honored as supporting characters in the film. The action / war sequence is well executed but the matter is not very realistic as mentioned earlier, no matter how difficult you are. However, the climbing sequences have been done very well because instead of doing the whole movie in the studio, the places they chose have seemed very real and the Ariel scenes of the mountain ranges unbelievably add the touch of reality to the movie. When the death is invented, others are expected. Villains are strong but it was great, if they attract more central attention instead of many of them. The movie pacing was a bit slow but the good was worse than the worse. If you are a fan bigger than Harlins or Stallone, you will also enjoy it. Overall, Clifaner has character development with good performance, drama, some mystery, excitement, thrills and custom performance, which are valuable to watch during this movie.
