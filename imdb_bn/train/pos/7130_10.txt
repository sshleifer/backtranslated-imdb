Well, when I saw this picture, I was not really sure it would be my cup of tea ... how wrong I was! I thought it was one of the best movies I've seen for a long time, a real family classic. The story of a young evacuee and his new 'Foster' dad, ticks all the boxes in this picture. I did not read the book (perhaps it's a good thing and I mean the meaning of the movie), but I can not really remember any bad points with the story, so it's 10 out of 10 (and I rarely) sometimes warrants some top marks Think!). William declares 'I can drive my bike, DAD!' I was sobbing my heart (anyone would understand that it would be seen, I'm sure). Really heartwarming, and definitely recommend.
