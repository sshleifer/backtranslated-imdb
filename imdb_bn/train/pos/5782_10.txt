Internet database is listed as a TV show. And yes, it was a series that was shown before "The Head" and "Ioan Flux" in the "MDV" program on "Curiosity" program, if I think correctly. But in this version I have seen this time a VHS tape that is played together in all the episodes together without annoying credit or waiting for the next fifteen minutes for a week in a movie. <br /> <br /> Your story has Max, Julie Winters, Sarah and Mr. Mass. Maxx is a super hero or a left, Julie is a social worker or a leopard queen, Sarah is a daughter who can hear Smiths less and keep a man who keeps her head. And then there are other weird creatures ... <br /> <br /> I use "or" with Maxx and Julie because the funny part is trying to find out which part of the story is real and which is the dream. Maybe they are all real or dreamed. Maybe one of the characters does not exist. Maybe only one exists and dreams of others. You have to wait and find out. <br /> <br /> I had my comic book before the show, and it was my darling. The artwork was spectacular and the story was original - you can find anything between Superman or Batman. This will bend your mind, and it will be in a strong adult overture, rather than obscene or objectionable. And the show is basically using the same exact artwork (just moving it now) and the same story ... The beauty found in comics must be reproduced faithfully. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Keeping this simple, they sealed the film in gold and they were ruthlessly freed as a result of continued failure.
