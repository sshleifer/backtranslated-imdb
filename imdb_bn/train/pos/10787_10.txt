So when I was young, I got this movie as a gift and my sister and I liked it. We will always see it. When our friends came to us we could have slept and we would like to see the big rock cliffs and grandfather's magical toys. I am 21 years old and I still love this movie, some old friends and I recently got together and saw it, we knew all the songs and we talked to the dancing and when we were young we hated the professor. A friend really bought this movie and grandmother sorcerer for this 22-year-old girl because she wants to overcome our love for this movie. This is really a movie that you can see to your kids and feel safe, no violence, no bad language, lots of great songs and important lessons.
