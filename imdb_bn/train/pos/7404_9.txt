Shawwar [exhaust] Australia premiere at the Sydney Film Festival The program notes it was - a perfect joy-mostly made, touching, funny, dramatic and poignantly meaningful. I could not agree more. I hope the rest of the festival movies are coming to this standard of entertainment and I look forward to showing more Chinese movies in Sydney for the next few months.
