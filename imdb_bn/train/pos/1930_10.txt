This picture is ridiculous, original, and well-executed. I have become a Big Bidi Swim Group, whenever I am and watch movie festivals. I have seen it now almost half a dozen times, and every time, my feeling of enthusiastic audience has ensured that it is one of the best movies to come in years. It has been shown in almost every festival, it has been sold, or won the audience's favorite prize. It is clear that people love this movie and why they even make it clear. Cinematography is fantastic, characterized and played brilliant, end-gorgeous, and full of compassion, knowledge and perfect time-filled aspects of the industry. Ishaey Seatan's first film is difficult to believe. Hope this will be released soon so that everyone can see it.
