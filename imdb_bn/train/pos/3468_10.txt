I absolutely love this picture! I was hesitant to see it at first because I thought it would be very painful. I remember how hard it was when John was shot. However, even though "seeing two of us", he took me back to a happy state alive and had hope and possibility. I think the author has done a great job that illustrated "Maybe." Aden was adorable as Queen Paul and met the challenge head. I was impressed with his pronunciation and approach. Jared Harris was very talented and quite credible as John. My favorite part was the park and the rooftop scene - which was very furious. The film gave me sadness and satisfaction, which I think both seem appropriate.
