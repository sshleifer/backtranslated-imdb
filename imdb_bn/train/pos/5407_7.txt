I've always enjoyed pokemon movies. Yes, I know that all of them are very specific, in certain areas and sure, even though they are targeting some young people in some cases that they will be able to protect them with the statement, "Hey, light up, it's a children's movie," But all that aside, are they still good pieces of entertainment? In my opinion, they are so and I enjoy them. This one is the same as the previous three, and of course cuter as enjoyable. Loving it because it has some really sweet and touching moments, the introduction of the fresh Pokemon Celebi. This is not the best Pok√©mon movie, but I enjoy it compared to the third, but the third is not bad, but the whole series is not only entertaining, innocent, poppy, family fun and nothing should be considered, nothing less. This film has some high marks of intensity and interest, especially at Claymax / end, all installments and letters, as it was a little less than the previous three, I thought it was still a favorite and ridiculous. These movies have criticized the minimum ratings and four feature length adaptations and are not worth it.
