A critical and financial collapse during the first publication, critics have turned around and said that this movie is the director's best. Like La Laddie, the children of Ben Grass, John Ritter and Blain Novak, fast-growing, fall in love and fall in love (Audrey Hepburn), Cologne Camp, Dorothy Straaten And Patty Hansen). Most of the scripts were released or rewritten on the day of the shooting, which meant the film was frustrating. Ben Gajra is excellent as well as leaving Head Detective Audrey Hepburn to singer Colin Camp as well as the cab driver Patti Hansen. John Ritter follows in unknown stranger Dorothy Straat and immediately falls in love with her. Blaine Novak has several daughters (including Jose Hessar and Elizabeth Pena). This image has some great performance by a golden cast. Standouts are Audrey Hepburn (he does not have a line in the first half of the film). Ben Gaza was never good (and inspiring choice for romantic leadership) and Colin Camp Manic Country playback singer Chris Miller played his best role. He is a delight to see as he rides a rat-a-Tat-tat delivery off his line. Highly recommended! ********* big!
