I was not a real "incredible journey" since I was a child, so I can not really compare two versions. This version tells the story of three creatures, two dogs and a cat, whose family leaves the family in their family when the family father will take a new job in San Francisco. Pets believe that they have been abandoned, have escaped and have come out of the road from a long homework journey. <br /> <br /> This story is best illustrated as a cartoon, but both versions are actually live-action animals using action films. One major difference is that in the next version the animal speaks in the human voice, giving its own individual personality, which is not completed in the original film. (Similar devices for talking animals are used in other recent children's films such as "Racing Stripes"). Some critics are skeptical of using this device, but my own point of view is that animals help their independent personalities to strengthen the film rather than weaken them. The big stars star Don Amche, Michael J. Animals of Fox and Sally Fields died. <br /> <br /> Both dog males and their friendship are equal in many people between friendships. Shadow, a golden guard, is wise, experienced old dog; The small one possibility is brash, cocky and impulsive. Chance looks like a boxer on British eyes, but it is actually an American bulldog, apparently a different breed of her British cousin. Sassy cat is a woman with a rather elementary and accurate personality. She is very proud of her status as a cat, which makes her very strong in her eyes from a mere dog. ("The rule of cats, the dogs are duel!") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many errors in the film from an adult perspective; It may be affecting, some facts (such as an animal that guides a mountain lion in the river) are very incredible and completely forgotten human characters. This, though, is a movie that originally targeted children, and I suspect they will enjoy it. Of course, any animal-loving child will do so. (Some professional critics, such as James Bernardinell, have commented that the voice of animals reduces the "greatness" of the film, only to serve my firm conviction that professional critics are not always the best guide for children's movies. I doubt if there are so many playground conversations about "Homework Embankment "centered on his supposed magnificence). <br /> <br /> One thing will be gratuitous for adult California's Sierra Nevada mountain photography. Outside pats, they may appreciate the combination of comedians and excitement because of facing dangerous animals like Beer, Mountain Lion and Porcupine in the desert. This is a very enjoyable family film. 7/10
