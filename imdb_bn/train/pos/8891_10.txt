I agree with other comments that a huge amount of history was not discussed in the film, but it was not a documentary! It was for entertainment and I think it did a very good job on it. <br /> <br /> I agree with the black family. The scene with them looks out of place. Suddenly it will be thrown, but later I looked at the connection between the stories and the families and it was very good. Despite this, it was not reviewed. In the 60's, it was enlightened in a decade's big and important landmark era. I found my very entertaining and worth while watching it.
