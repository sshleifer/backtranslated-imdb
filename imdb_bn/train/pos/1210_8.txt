And my children love it now! Please, now I can see it and realize that the animation was not that cool, and that plot was titite. Well, if every villian introduces himself by saying "I ammmmm DAAARRRKK HEEEEAAARRT", I think they could laugh, but for young children it is an ethical story with interesting music. <br /> <br /> Music is so interesting, remember, even after 20 years I can not see this picture, but I remember these words. I would definitely recommend this one for young children.
