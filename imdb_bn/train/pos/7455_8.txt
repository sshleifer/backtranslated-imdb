GoldenEye will always go down to you as one of the most legendary games in VG history. There is no doubt about them. But although this game is quite different, it may be its modern day bond champion. <br /> <br /> This was not a bond game based on any other media elements. It was a completely new; Script play. There was even his own theme song! (Without this the bond will not be, oh!) The gameplay was fantastic, and if you are like bond games or films, then you will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Opponents of fantasy creation to play against some / most games, Cast members represent their characters themselves. Which gives more sense to the movie. With a very 'bond' capable story, you feel as you lost in a movie as you think in the game. <br /> <br /> Starting from the beginning, all aspects are enjoyable. Even after defeating the game, there is still much work to do. In addition to achieving ranking systems and unlockbacks, its multi-player missions, it is a stand-out game Despite the fact that video games are now quite old in the years. It's still a good game that you can pick and play when you need to get more bonds in your life. Even now thinking about it, I got stuck on my head in the theme song. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Which can only be named as extraordinary, completely extraordinary. <br /> <br /> I'm going to throw this game now. If you do not play it yet, you are missing!
