I love to play football and I think this movie was great because it has a lot of football. It was a good Hollywood / Bollywood film and I'm glad it won 17 awards. Paraminder Nagra and Kira were goodnight and so was Archi Panjabi. Jonathan Reyes was very good at playing the coach. Jazz (Parimindra Nagra) loves playing football, but his parents want to learn the cooking he wants to marry. When Jazz secretly started playing for the football team, he met Juliet (Kira Knightley) and Joe (Jonathan Rice's daughter) as their coach. When his parents were in trouble, his father allowed him to play big matches in his sister Pinky (Archi Panjabi) marriage. Finally, his parents realized how much he loved football and allowed him to play abroad.
