"Tintin and I" first hit me as an excellent composer documentary. Photography and editing are actually breathing (almost anti-Dogma). <br /> <br /> We follow Tintin Drawer Hargie's life since 1971 with an open interview. The tintin series was painted in the background in the great ideological fights of the twentieth century. He has to fight against his own ghosts in this Harge, and most of his drawing works seem to be trying to prevent them and flee to the perfection world. <br /> <br /> Although spectacular photographer has some reproduction and lesson curriculum from the Panorama and Album from the Tintin album, Herage's story is never fully met through interviews and archiving and rebuilding. <br /> <br /> Harg's life was a fair, suffering artist. But the real wondrous world of his imagination will surprise the reader again and again.
