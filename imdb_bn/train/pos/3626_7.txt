This effort is based on Jim Morris, a true story of high school science teacher / baseball coach, who is motivated by his players to try for professionals and fulfill dreams of dreaming of grandiose goals. Any unfamiliar person in sports, Dennis Quad Morris, played with a firm belief in part-time work, and the producers did a credible job to resurrect real world events, which summarized Morris as a relief vessel for the harmful Temp Bay Devil Races. . In the first half of the film, high school baseball players are dealing with their rug tag bunch (all of which appear to be really old-looking ones in high school) and less likely to be a bit longer. Overall the film has some pacing problems and a few additional concubines we could possibly do without. However, it is still a fairly involved film with an inspirational theme which again proves that the baseball is a national psyche. Grade: B-
