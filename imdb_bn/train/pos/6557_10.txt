I am a 53 year old college professor. I went with my wife and 12 year old girl. We all enjoyed the movies. The film is original, malicious, expressive and completely charming. The plot was easy enough to follow the 10-year-old, but was busy enough to keep adult interest. I think Emma Roberts did a fantastic job and the rest was just fine. My only criticism was that the Los Angeles set was not as interesting as they should be. They were functioning, but nothing stood out. On the other hand, make-up, costume, lighting, cinematography, editing and guidance were excellent. Together, I had it completely enjoyable experience. I am disappointed that professional critics (almost all adult men) attack the film. Apparently, there are some of them against their strong, intelligent and independent films depicted in young women. Their writings reveal more about their sexuality than these wonderful family films. I recommend it to every child and every parent firmly.
