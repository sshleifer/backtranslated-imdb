I did not see films before (and Matt Damon could not stand), I was reluctant to go to Bourne Ultimatum when it was asked to watch for AS film studies. <br /> <br /> However, I was glad that even with a suppression a movie can be enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Quick battle scenes, crazy motorbike wheels and bigger explosions will put you out of your seat in TBU. Cia and Borne keep your toes on the toes and entertain hilariously. <br /> <br /> However, several things really fry my cheese. <br /> <br /> First, the film was actually a series of Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA, Bourne, CIA. This sequence was repetitive and eventually got dull. Although Damon kept us entertained and CIA was one step ahead, I was getting annoyed with Berne's continuing survival. He crashed a car and he was tapped out of it or something! Very unreal <br /> <br /> and secondly (inevitably) - hobby cameras. It was so embarrassing that it was completely targetable and made me and all those who went to see it in my class (even the tutors). We told the teachers that if we use that in a class made in class then it will be automatically wrong and we will be asked to use a tripod. If Greengrass wants to see it like this, it will be good enough, we have kept a conversation with Damons and Styles, but of course we do not push our heads violently! <br /> <br /> But there is an enjoyable movie and a clock price on all TBEs. But I do not think it was the best movie of the year, though it was a part of the entertaining part of the movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
