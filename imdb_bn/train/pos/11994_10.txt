Many people here are not able to help me but like Cast and Crooke who praised Tilespin and others who developed my Tiledhound, like all those who commented here, it enjoyed the quality of the story, not just the animation, but the lines and the characters. <br /> <br /> This art of art can not do justice to Teplepine in the category as "cartoon", in fact it is an insult to classify as a "cartoon", and an animation is nothing more, it's obviously the best work of the genius produced in Disney Disney "dragged" from the air, then they realized what they did and I am sure that they were tortured due to the oppression of their souls. Did <<br /> <br /> I'll take a moment to explain, from the dachetles to the end that I think the drucking dock, due to political accuracy, has been severely hit due to Disney's failure and the quantum leap is behind, they are more than the quality I do not mention the full room for the monkey, now I do not see my children's worst "cartoon", they now fear I would not have been able to do this because I would like to have Homer Simpson sometime from Homer Simpson in the future and I will have 50% blame to see them, because I have all the shows of the mid-90s 90s, so one day my kids "cartoon whip" Can not be corrupted by. Today and I have the last piece of childhood and I hold and I owe all of me to the tailspin. <br /> <br /> To me, Talespin has created the best animation in the world without any doubt. It is a lack of depth, skin, prudence, feeling and lack of real bad values ​​and story lines, which you see today's content is "Ed, Ed. And you can think of any other thing about Eddie or any other? A Picasso description of garbage produced today can be compared with some 3-year-old undecipherable hyroglyph. <br /> <br /> The next time Apon See an episod of the Tulsopin; Watch the timber structure of a wooden object or wooden object such as the Hyer for Hire, and be animated on the quality of effort and effort in this animation, even one-shot backgrounds are also used repeatedly as they use it over and over again. Art Deco movement has been shown to be authentic, which was popular during illustration, even vehicles   লিও জীবনের সত্য। ঠিক আছে, সমস্ত পর্বগুলি অ্যানিমেশনে অসাধারণ ছিল না তবে নীচের গ্রেডের দৃশ্যগুলি উচ্চতর দৃশ্যগুলির দ্বারা আবৃত ছিল তাই সব এটি পর্বের শেষ নাগাদ সব শেষ হয়ে গেছে এবং সম্ভবত আপনি কখনই লক্ষ্য করবেন না যতক্ষণ না আপনি মনোযোগ দেন এবং বিস্তারিত মনোযোগ দেন। <br /> <br /> What I like is that I am Each episode is called "deliberate mistakes" or "deliberate mistakes" and there are some of them, for example, in the depth of the vestry screen where Rebecca says that "you are in some sand" and Balu answers "Who, I'm! I'm innocent as a schoolboy" Rebecca To take a look in the eyes, I won 'the rest of the balders, but kept the eye on the next time. <br /> <br /> Everybody is stressing on the comments and 100% correct, there is nothing else to add here, Disney, Walk Up and the smell of coffee, you have been sleeping for a decade, stop garbage production and multiplication of animations Bring back and stop the production of "cartoon", we've got evidence of what we can do and we want it back as soon as possible.
