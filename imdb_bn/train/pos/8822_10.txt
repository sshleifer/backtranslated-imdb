Extraordinary movie that shows an unusual mix of just eight minutes: mystery, thriller, musical instruments. In short, we have been told to tell about this story: A girl comes to European Cafeteria and then ... a soft transit from the argument from the nonsense mystery At any time, despite the doubt of Viglondo and / budget (thank you), B / W was not happy at all. <br /> <br /> The film reaches a short poem intensity (almost a haiku) due to time-space unity. Spain, B / W Quick Poetry Land (Â¿First Boonil remembers?) <br /> <br /> To assure our belief in young movies outside of the US, of course must be seen.
