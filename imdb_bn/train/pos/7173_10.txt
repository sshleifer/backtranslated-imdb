I only saw the documentary "Fog City Mavericks" on Starz Cable TV network. Without a doubt it is one of my most enjoyable viewing experiences ever! It is responsible for some of the best films produced by the San Francisco Bay area artist and creative genius. In addition to the well-known artists listed, Irvine Korsner, Caleb Dancel and Pixar Animation Studios include a segment of them. I hope it will be released in DVD - it is a must for any collection related to movie history and brilliant film making. If you are interested in movies and even those made by them, you will not be disappointed.
