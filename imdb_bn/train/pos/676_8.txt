Much more than the parts of 'The Last Wave'. This is not just a catastrophic film, it is not just a search for Australian indigenous spiritualism, and of course more than a simple court drama. Writer / director Peter Weier has directed two years ago to create a truly effective and thoughtful film with the same ruthless atmosphere given to Picnic A Hanging Rock, to move these elements to the next level, which you will remember a few years later. <br /> <br /> When the lawyer David Burton (Chamberlain) is called to protect Chris Lee (Gulpilil) at Abiriginal's death, after which He may or may not be directly responsible, only to find himself, he can not fight. The truth from Lee, but he makes sense to hear what he comes when he comes. There are two worlds with indigenous beliefs - In everyday and dream time, the truth is fully contained on two different levels, the imagination was far more imaginative than Burmah. <br /> <br /> No doubt why it is good to remember 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' because its permanent mystery. We headed along the same path but were forced to find out the answers for themselves. 'The Last Wave', we can cut everything together at the end of the film. However, with all the information, we must choose how much we want to believe, because the film has crossed our natural reality borders. <br /> <br /> At the production edge, Weir built a sense of destruction, growing from the good use of the word, from its great impact budget, soft light, heavy rain. Adult music disobedient, never try to be grandiose. Richard Chamberlain tries to expose this mystery, causing the audience to feel annoyed to feel uncomfortable. David Gulpilely portrays a person stuck in two worlds, want to do the right thing, but is scared because he already knows the end. <br /> <br /> Keep all these things together, and your best example is David Kie Weir named in the movie for thirty years. Strongly recommend
