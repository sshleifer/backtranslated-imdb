I've seen it several times passed, since I had some stupid, sad, dated romantic comedy in it. Well, this is a romantic comedy, and probably a little date. However, it is not sensitive to themes related to office politics, fornication, and loneliness, it is not sensitive. You think that you know exactly where you are going, but there is an element of unpredictability that keeps you interested and hopes for everything that you expect. However, the most intelligent cynic touch has enough intelligence and charm. If you meet someone who does not like this movie, consider seriously how well you want them to know.
