Personally, I disrespect the show in The Jerry Springer, however, I saw this year as the "ringmaster" funniest movie. Jerry Springer's "ultimately" guest celeb smiles throughout the movie that started at the beginning. Although Jerry Springer made a poor effort to justify his existence, despite a brief overview, I definitely recommend this movie for mere entertainment pricing.
