This would be an American movie I'd rate it 7: We've seen this before. This is an Argentine film, and myself as Argentina, I want to give it 10, because it's the quality I'm hoping for - waiting for the expectation. This fantastic quality is wonderful, all the restrictions imposed by the 3rd world have been given ... <br /> <br /> When I do not forget this scene, Diaz will force Silverstein to accept the drunk - if you know what I mean movie I think the main moment of the movie, not surprising, is still the original. When real action begins <br /> <br /> I always try to collect some previous information before watching a movie. This is a mainstream, satirical, commercial one, I press "Play" and postpone the reality and logic, I will talk about the best mind to enjoy such movies. It is impossible to discuss the possibilities of the whole plot, but it is credible in a certain way. For me, I can not stop smiling at every single trick and commentary - "Sole mello" ("you mean") ... the biggest in diaz's mouth. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of seeing Peretti "planned" movies. I know he's a great actor, but sometimes I think his role is inappropriate in nature, in this case the role of Lewis Luke. I do not love Argentine television very much, so I did not see much work from Luke, but it is quite clear that he is an excellent actor. Her physical role, her stares, her content attitudes to this movie made me fall in love with her performance. I think his role will need to be upgraded somewhat, to show how big he can be to us <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . I know that he can not follow these rules if "the second part is not good", so if he made it, I would definitely see it. And I hope, in the future, the prospects of the peacock's opponents have the possibility of having the same chances of developing their roles. <br /> <br /> Great movie, great performance and a lot of smiles!
