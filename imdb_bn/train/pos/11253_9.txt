This is a very long film, which means that you can become very bored before it becomes interesting, but its length allows its characters to find a permanent attachment in your sympathy. <br /> <br /> If you are removed by crime of cruelty you will find it especially heart-twisting, because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak. If you love a monster, then you will cry for Magnus Pim, the spying person - especially his country, his friends and family - a man who has been manipulating and transforming from same childhood to infancy. There is no real characterless character in the whole story, not sympathetic to a loyal, moral 'personality. But seeing the whole thing with the help of tissue will be great. <br /> <br /> I finally enjoyed it. It's good for those who love provocative movies about people's basic character.
