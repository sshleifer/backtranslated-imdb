This slick and lively film is distributed consistently. It's one of Frankenheimer's best and most intimate movies, and it's easy to adapt to the best Elmonaine Leonard's adaptation date (and if you're scratching in your head, "I'd love the shot," you have to face it). In my opinion, no one has "felt" for Leonard's characters, then John Glover made 52 better in the 52-pak-yu. The story of Detroit (novel) transferring the story of Hollywood (film) was highlighted at an amazing height. Be a man, have a few beers and see this movie. My favorite Leonard books for reference are: Swag, Room Punch, Cat Cheer, City Primer, and 52 Pick-Up. In my favorite Frankenheimer movies, there are seconds and Manchester conditions. I have a special place in the heart of my Did Bang and Black Sunday, in the heart of the movie.
