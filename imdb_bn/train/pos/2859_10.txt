I know the strange coming coming from someone born after about 15 years of airing off this show, but I love this show. I do not know why, but I enjoy watching it. I love Adam. The only disappointment is that in Germany the only place to buy the season was in Germany, and it was only the first two seasons. That's frustrating, but that's OK. I will keep looking for online. If there is any advice on buying a second place in the 14th season, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. I already own the first one. The only downside is that DVDs coming from Germany, they only play on my portable DVD player and on my computer. Well good I still own it!
