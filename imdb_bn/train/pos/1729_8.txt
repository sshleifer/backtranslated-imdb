In 1943, a group of RAF officers, along with Eric Williams, decided to run away from a POW camp using a gymnastic vaulting horse in the park. In 1950, it was decided to draw his account, and it started the story of an extraordinary British film genre - The Military Prison Camp, which reached the upgrade in the Danger Index (1959). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wooden Horse is one of the coolest movies I've ever seen. There is no dramatic moment, but a steady story finally creates a climax which creates a lot of excitement because the story does not give way to the unlikely drama, jump or jack up (some are going to happen!) Music It fully works its time and neatly. <br /> <br /> Leo Glenn, Anthony Stele and David Tomlins have done extra strangely low original cast and (I suspect) non-actors. Without exception, all continually mono-tonal and calm. They keep emotions out of their roles. Long ago, until the former service, I suspected that they revitalized their wartime roles as 'Officers and Gentlemen'. <br /> <br /> This inaccessible method does not stop any dramatic tension. On the contrary, in contrast to most wartime films, the story does not end with a curved cable: and that really keeps me glued to the end.
