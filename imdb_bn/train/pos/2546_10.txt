It's almost like 'black cat' in the same league, although I'd like to give it a 9 instead of 9+. It is commendable for a movie that it's so amazing that it's awesome! <br /> <br /> The 'Invisible verdict' part is awful, part plays and part of the course. For a film created in 1936, scientists had a good deal of ingredients before their time. The mix of horror, drama, and science is a perfect combination, while acting in the part of logosi and carloaf can not be better. <br /> <br /> There are many elements of director Lambert Hiller who are so often James Vell. What I'm saying is this picture is great and good shot. Outside of the Lagosi Rooms, Garrell's view is a perfect example of mood. This is a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly absent among today's movies. <br /> <br /> As 'black cat' and 'island of lost islands', I can not understand why this film is still released on DVD. If you are considering something that junk has already been transferred to the DVD, it's much more confusing. <br /> <br /> However, if you see this film you get the chance. When it is released from the DVD, it quickly occupies and puts it in an honorable place in your DVD library.
