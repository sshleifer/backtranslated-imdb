I must admit that I've lost more than the first half hour of this movie or even more. There was some mild humorous humor, but the general idea of ​​BestBone Plot and Sustainability reminded me that I was wasting my time. Then - for a clear reason - I suddenly realized that I was enjoying it. There was no dark moment to realize and suddenly the dramatic scene captured me. Actually nothing very exciting happens in the whole movie. As I suddenly realized that the film was originally considered to be in vain - and it was very vague, its attraction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman, who played as an anonymous actor, "little project" jumpstart his career. He is going to play a supermarket manager, and spend an outdoor supermarket day to study the role. There he met Scarlett and played by Paz Vega - a cashier who wanted more than life. He helped him prepare for a job interview as he auditioned to play a role, even though he presented him in real life. It's really fun to see "funny" (how credit is credited to the character for it). They will be disappointed by the visitors of the local target shop. <br /> <br /> Freeman and Vega together together were remarkable, mixed romantic credentials but father-daughter chemistry. If you feel lost at the beginning, stick with this. At the end, it turns out to be a delightful charming movie. 7/10
