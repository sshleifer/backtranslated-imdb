A couple (Janet and Richard) go camping out in the woods near a giant swimming. After enjoying camping and nature, couples feel as if they have a abandoned farm house Soon, a pair of criminals escaped and, after the inevitable late delay, they raped Janet and Richard Lock in a bird. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is more than 70 severely sick and cyclone. Moreover, I found it to be quite interesting and beautiful in the opposite tone of it. I love CAGED TERROR The music obviously helps to sharpen the personality trajectory of the film. I think this picture is quite amazing. <br /> <br /> This film is essentially done with the film's pensing, which says that the film is gradually running slowly. I did not think of pensing due to the beauty and mystery of the film, although I think it will be the majority of people. Acting is not very good nor dialogue, at least early view This image is slightly more patient than usual, and it's not really for everyone. <br /> <br /> Small, this was a good movie. The greatest horror movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly a lot of fun. It's not the easiest film to find. It is possible to find it in the USED section of many stores if you see it hard enough. This is not for everyone, but if you're a fan of trash movies, it must be verifiable.
