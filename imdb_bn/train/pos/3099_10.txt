Along with "Brothers and Bones", "Six Degrees" was one of my favorite new plays of Fall 2006. <br /> <br /> The best spread around, but the Campbell skate really enjoyed the work (upcoming photos) and Hope Davis (recent widow of Iraq journalist). <br /> <br /> Except acting, the writing was fresh and the acting was fantastic. The show is also NYC, real city, Warner Bros. Or other studio's backlit, is added to a second level or reality. <br /> <br /> I think people are more interested in the last "survival" and other ridders of the people. Too bad it does not end.
