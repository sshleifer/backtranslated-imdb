A unique film ... the best one of all time. Acting, script, quincy jones score, cinematography, editing, etc. - just superb. Most of the viewers know that this film is based on the truman capote's book on the famous murder of the Kansas Farm family (Clutter) by some young people during a confusing robbery. I did not see a movie that brilliantly turned a real story into a form of writing. <br /> <br /> Actors are firm throughout the board, but the focus of the killer, Dick and Perry, and their follow-up law enforcement team. Scott Wilson, Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and sympathetic regardless of whether he comes across so impressive, oily and spacious. Robert Blake as Perry Smith as extraordinary - solo, and once the bloody and cold-blooded. Who can this feature fold in one person and buy it from us? She, and it's brilliant! One of the main points of the book is how it spreads to the disguise of these two very different socio-political people to create critical masses for such a stupid and serious crime, and these two actors work nicely. Both had their momentum in their next career, but this performance has high water mark, and that stands for the acting time. <br /> <br /> Police also wondered. John Forcith led the investigation, but the other three detectives are great. Compared to contemporary movies where the producers seem to think of introducing police with supernatural resources or foibles, this is a strong flatfeet, working in the case with consistency and efficiency. They think so real. I have never seen police so powerful on their authenticity; And I've seen classics going back to Classics are the most classic. Really this is a kind of respect. <br /> <br /> The party's spiraling is coming (the uniqueness of this movie that you already know what happened, but I'm careful for the record). <br /> <br /> Of course, the best criminal shows and movies are examined in the best scenes - intellectual fences match between the police and the hunks, believe them. This movie shows you the best-known scenes in the movie. See Dick and Perry try to unlock their path and slowly discover, the police know about their products. But the police will have to make extremists ready to break their blanks and express their optimism. This will show you some of the best performances. Glengarry glen juice without showboating. <br /> <br /> To help translate the tragic and horrific connotation of this true story, the photographs were taken at the actual cluster house of the ICB, and I heard that Clutter's films were played to give students their true feelings. It works. It looks like this decent, ordinary guy. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. <br /> <br /> I'll stop here. This is not an emotional movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it is compulsory for every movie.
