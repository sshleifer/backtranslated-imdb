In 1978 an event started. Because of the "Halloween" release of John Carpenter, people around the block were witness to Michael Meyers evil. Critics liked it, the world loved it, it was imitated, and goes as one of the greatest movies in the history of film. <br /> <br /> The plot: After the murder of 15 years, four friends (all women) Halloween night babysitting (and having it with their boyfriend). After escaping from the hospital earlier in the night, Michael Maera returned to her home to call this man. He killed them 3 silently and subtlety. He does not speak. He walks slowly. He is hiding .... <br /> <br /> Only one friend escapes after being saved by Doctor Loomis (Michael's follower and doctor) <br /> <br /> One reason why Halloween works so well is that. . Simplicity We do not know where Michael is, we do not know why he is killed, and he is afraid of us. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He creates unbearable tension across the story, and fears such a degree, Sometimes we can not see it. And Claymax is really amazing. <br /> <br /> As horror, it is essential. It's awesome and well-played. It's mysterious. Michael is a power, not a man. There is a power that can not be denied. <br /> <br /> Focusing too much near Michael and his "history". This movie focuses on unknown fears. Perhaps why this thing is a wonderful composition
