It is shown that between 2000 and 2020, 68 million people will die prematurely due to AIDS. Sub-Saharan Africa's predicted toll is the best where 55 million additional deaths may be expected. We rarely hear personal stories except for deadly statistics. As part of a series related to the problems faced by young people, Christophen Hounger describes the most current one in the French to make a movie close to Leo. Although fictional, it is unfortunately very common - related to a situation - it is the effect of the diagnosis of HIV with a loving close family. <br /> <br /> When the 21-year-old Leo (Pierre Minerad) is said to have lost his parents and two teenage brothers, Tristan (Rodolf Paylie) and Pierot (Jeremy Leipman) who has his AIDS, the family is destroyed. Expressing concern for his youth, he agreed to stop the information from his younger brother, 12-year-old Marcel (Yannice Llestet), but he left the conversation and began to mistakenly and acted incorrectly. When Leo went to Paris to get treatment, he took Marcel with him, but the younger boy attacked Leo and wanted to know the truth. Leo tells him that he is sick and Marcel is sad but acceptable. When he brought Marcel to meet some ex-gay friends, the tension spread among them and set the stage for an exciting conclusion in him. <br /> <br /> Although I was uncomfortable with the physical scene in bed with my wife, I think Leo's close ties and the lasper and Mingard's brilliant performance are more than their side scale. The film showing the events that emerged from the viewpoint of the young boy gives the truth, which reminds me of the Quixesis film Leono and Trufault, The The 400 Bloos. Unlike some American films dancing around the painful of AIDS, Leo has a harsh reality near, but it does so in such a way that it is flexible and amazing.
