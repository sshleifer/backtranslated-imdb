When I first heard about this series on antivitavee, I said that from all the shows I saw, it was all gone. I had to watch this show, and that's what I really do. When I got the first volume of this show, it was the best. I really liked the animation, and all the war scenes were awesome. I want to say, my favorite characters in the show were Saber and Archer, and of course I like El Ella. And of course, all the episodes on volume were interesting, and very cool. Another thing about the series is to say Michael McConnohy (famous for transformers and others) Berserker's voice She has a cool character. And I even saw all series before watching the final volume of the last series. So if you see something good, then watch this show, it's good.
