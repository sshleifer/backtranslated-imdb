What does the Marquis de Sade have with the worship of Egyptian archeology and mermaid worship? Tube Hooper tries to answer that question in a strange little picture. <br /> <br /> Johnny is a small dog who visits his neutral archeology father in Alexandria in Egypt. Genie gets caught with a mysterious hooker (and blatant lesbian) who is serving parents next door. Daddy is sent back to the site, where he uncovers a tomb that seems like a mermaid with it. Jenny meets Marquis D. Sad's descendants and reads violent Egyptians (for the hottest scenes in the film). Finally, Jenny said that she could be a sacrifice and going on chronic and bloody climax. The story surrounding the story is the Jail Marcis de Sade footage, like Jenny talking to the figure. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its acting ability has always been sidewiped by its makeup requirements, so he is here It is allowed to shine. Her best performance is still in the "Killer Tongue", if you do not see it yet. <br /> <br /> Most of the other young fiction is beautiful and average. But the script is problematic. You will quickly learn that Marquez's view is completely unnecessary, in addition to the filmmakers' access to the cold set. In the end, Jenny preserves that knowledge of the bacteria makes no sense. The mermaid is never interpreted, and her link to Christianity (which is broadcast throughout the film) is nothing. The film is very anti Christian, because the archaeologist loves to bind a Bible priest, but to be bound by local prostitution. There are plenty of views of inexperience and violence, but Hooper probably did not have a slight idea what screenliners were trying to say. I do not know if I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Why am I suggesting this photo? It's unusual. Have an extended sex scene. For women, Fierce Egyptian rides a nude completely naked. Albion is wonderful. Do you like snakes? This photo is full of them. It's like a Roger order with a big budget. Instead of knowing Hooper, what "crocodile" came with, rather it is tragic. "Night Terrorism" is not perfect, but certainly a wonderful, vague appearance. <br /> <br /> It is rated for physical violence (R), some sexual violence, rust, prejudice, female nudity, male nudity, sex content, sexual references, and drug abuse. <br /> <br />
