One of his best screen performances was the performance of Errol Flin, the excellent Warner Bros effort. It is often referred to as its best, and I can not really judge fully until I saw her "Dawn Patrol". However, his work "they have died with their boots" seems deadly. I'm a big fan fan (he's my favorite actor after James Mason) - it also helps as an Australian) and I think he's just awesome, a great screen presence and a great actor. He is the center of "Gentleman Jim", considered a legendary boxer with a fistful medal, but he has backed up with an educated, warm and funny script and Raul Walsh's instructions. The Walsh film I've seen never lost any loss of its speed, it was a truly born filmmaker. Walsh manages ring scenes well, as he saw the ultimate final scene with the lighter moment and between Word Bord and Flin. Add that great production value ("gay nineties" did not look good!) And a lovely supporting cast and it's quite quite a perfect recreation. Alan Hale generally played Flint's Sidekick, but here's his father, and it still works. Alexis Smith Flin's love interest. The pair is head over the love heels with one another fighting with each other.
