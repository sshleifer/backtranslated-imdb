This movie has great war scenes. Now it's true that acting is a little rough. But I wanted to watch a movie based on the skills of acting, but I would watch a Chess movie like American beauty. But if you want to see a movie with True Martial Arts in it and without using the cable, you can throw air like so many movie-like films with flying stunts and flying flying flying. Then see this. Now it is seen that two main stars of the show where the child shows the power ranger and other counter-members of the show are some partners in this film. But enough to make pants of O fight fighters jet lp **. Stunts are enough for Jackie Chan to get into bed and praise.
