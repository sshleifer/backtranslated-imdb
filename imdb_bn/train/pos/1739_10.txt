I am fascinating to the movies, from such a NASCAR classical scene. Since 1983 you can see many race cars. Even harder, racing scenes are not very realistic. But I must admit, I did not see any nation before 1995, because before that time they did not show any NASCAR race in Germany) <br /> <br /> Like a Bart Reynolds fan, I'm going to see the movie originally from Reynolds in the 80's: except Fast behind the wheel of the wheel, in his bandit movies <br /> <br /> If you love NASA and Bart Reynolds, this movie must be seen in a must. If you only like one of these two things, then I recommend viewing it. If you like Nassar or Bart Reynolds, you have to give it a chance, but remember, this movie was far away from winning Oscar Academy Awards. <br /> <br /> This is 80's common humor. If you like movies like Canonball Cinemas and Police Academy, you also like it.
