M. M. This adaptation of James Short Story 'A View from a Hill' was first shown on British television in the BBC's 4th Digital Channel Channel BBC4. I found it to be repeated again on BBC4 and it reminded the adaptations of another BBC junkie in the 1970s, "Weasel and I Hole Claw You You My Ladd" and "Signalman". Although not as good as in the same category, 'A view of a hill' is still enjoyable and sometimes suspicious plays. <br /> <br /> A historian came to look for a collection in a small rural village. Recently deceased collectors of antique artwork. He saw an Abbey outside the countryside when he was in ruins for hundreds of years. But is it an old pair of telescopes and lazily related to a terrible legend called Galois Hill? And what about the state of Brooke Country Square and its servants? In any way, I did not enjoy this little product, and the running time was more than 40 minutes, it can be a really great adaptation. As such, it all feel a little slow and welcome a bit more exposure to setting the mood. <br /> <br /> I can give 7 out of 10.
