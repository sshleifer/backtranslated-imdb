I do not completely agree with the other reviews. All are basically negative. I took a chance in this movie and I'm glad I did it. Glad actually. I could not find any errors with this. There is no time. The script is original. Actors are all favorite and trustworthy. Smart Smart reminds me of Mercy Brady from Brady Baach. But this girl can really work. The Australian outback setting is perfect. Incredible scenery Cool soundtrack i.e. Paul Kelly God bless Paul Kelly. Cranberries are also here I saw this movie twice in less than 24 hours. I'll probably see it again. This is very interesting. It creates a thought. It's probably better than the nine months of Hollywood blockbusters. That time was during this time. Bound of baked is a likable.Well photo film. I can not find anything wrong Check it out! My first review!
