Sports movies have not been my thing, but a small fist of them work for me. The best are those who are lesser in sports and Ferguson gives more attention to characters like Baul, Wrestler, and Girlfriends. It's a great director for Carin Kusmah and an outstanding first performance for Michele Rodriguez. Girlfight seems to be both realistic and involved, it's so enough to make a memorable film. <br /> <br /> The plot significantly ahead. Diana Guzman, her fourth year in high school, but due to her picking fight at the Hallway, she was close to the expulsion. As a possible way of expressing his anger, he signed up for the club boxing lessons where his brother is training (where the father wishes). <br /> <br /> In the ninety minutes, we see something amazing in viewers. Diana almost literally changed a woman to a girl. We see this in his behavior as well as his body, especially when one of the boys in the club looks at him and he gets in it. There is no bad scene or long / acting moment in the film. The mistake I say that can be corrected is that one of the concubines seems like an incomplete note. Without that, Girlfight is a great movie.
