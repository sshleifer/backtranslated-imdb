Tessa's voice was awesome !! Trasa played the role of female singer, and Richard was at the club. When he came out on the first stage, and started to rush his staff, my soul shook. Her voice is platinum. She has to do a CD. She is more fond of then she understands. I loved to stop the performance of his heart five heart bits, which he played with Leon when he was younger. How a small girl could be so big a voice. She's really amazing. Good voice is good well Well good voice voice voice voice Excellent voice Excellent voice, back vibration, cry, bed, take back you to the voice of the day. Tressa, when you read this committee, accept my advice and start recording a CD. Not only for singing, but for your fans. I really believe you can do it. Look at this one other single hit singer studio singer, lol.
