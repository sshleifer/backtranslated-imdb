This court seems to be stupid, but since it does not take the character of morphy seriously, it facilitates the mix of audience's mysticism and abduction of modern day hard kids. Excellent cast, especially Charles Dons and Charlotte Levi√©s, and Murphy's final height of 80's comedy / action. Here are some cool F / X, a very real dream sequence and a fairly original plot. Often Murphy Flix's Pantheon is neglected, but it's a look.
