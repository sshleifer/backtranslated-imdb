I watched this movie when I was young. It blew me away. It was before television days, so a movie of this measurement could send a small child to orbit. It affected me so much that I went to show this movie twelve times. The special effects used at this time were far ahead of its time. Sabu was a real pleasure, as was the Rain Ingram Genie. A few months after leaving the film, I saw myself singing "I want to be a sailor". I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I forgot to mention conrad videot, a characterless character who would ever meet Also, Jun Duprez was not much better than this movie was. The color was outstanding. Give this movie an AAA!
