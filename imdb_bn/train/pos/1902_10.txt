Let's start with the theme song music by Christopher Cross. The song "If you are caught in the moon and New York City." After all these years it's also a great theme and songs, it's not tiring. This is really a great song about New York City. However, the great Dudley Moore is a poorly lit millionaire involved in the character of Jill Eckenby of the CBE film. Jill will then star on LA law. However, he served by his wonderful British Butler Sir John Gilgood OM, who won the Academy Award for Best Performance in Film as a Best Actor. Ledger was in love with Arnold's character in Mineralel, who was perfect in the film, in his cabinet, in addition to his role in Oscar winning role. No, Liza can not sing. He plays a diner waitress. Nevertheless, I love Geraldine Fitzgerald as the mother tongue of the family to determine the fate of the family. However, he should have got the Academy Award nomination for the fabulous and best Academy Actress. Bern Martin Liza's father, known as the father of Senifeld's father, plays. She is very great. The film was well written, played and distributed to the audience who wanted more than this.
