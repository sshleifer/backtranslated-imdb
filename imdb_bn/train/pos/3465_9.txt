I'm looking forward to seeing this movie a lot of awesome and little hope. I do not think this film will be able to communicate with its content. But it did absolutely, and then something. First of all, I must say that Jared Harris did great work as John Lennon. Occasionally it seemed that Harris was channeling Lenin. The likeness was often weird, and he clearly studied Lenin's behavior and vocal inflections. Iden Quinn was as good as McCartney, he also had an interesting similarity to Mac, although sometimes he traveled to his Scouse accent. <br /> <br /> This story was well written and directed. It was certainly pure imagination, but sometimes I felt like a voyeur peeking through a keyhole in this reconciliation. The rooftop scene was particularly moving, as McCartney said to Lennon that he never heard like a child - he is worthy and important, and it can not be blamed on him that he was abandoned by his parents. I also enjoyed the park scenes where their two pairs of reggae have been abandoned with the band! <br /> <br /> One such complaint would be this: I'm not sure that John was filming the film at this stage of his life as a custodian. He settled very well in his domestic situation, and when contacted, he was known to be quite friendly. A few years later, he was very happy when he was killed for his suicide on his first assassination day. <br /> <br /> In most cases this image can revive those feelings again. John lived longer than a bit. I'm sure the beetles would come back together at some stage. And I'm sure Lennon and McCartney will still be friends. <br /> <br /> OK, VH1. I will see it again and again. <br /> <br />
