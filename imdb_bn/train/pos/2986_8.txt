I am surprised that we have taken a glance at the criticism of this old film. We usually do not get good opera movies, and here's a true grand opera conversion. It is understood, the visual is not great. It's date. But as an opera it can not be blamed; And I'm an opera buff. I can not even detect a lip sync; If I did not know Tbiladi in the audio then there would be nothing Sofia Lorraine. He does everything with flash! Her dark makeup is fine; And he brought the role of gorgeous life! The rest of the cast is wonderful, that is the stunning ballet troupe. Most actors are excellent; Loren is really amazing. His opponent Amneris is also awesome Anyone who does not care about this 1953 job is a shameful remiss. Will enjoy it! Naturally, the engine behind the Renaata film on Idea as Ida. I love this old movie!
