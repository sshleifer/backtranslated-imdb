In this ridicule of commercialization and 'cruelty' of war, John Cusack starred in the role of a killer, Brand Houser, who sent 'Turqisan' to take Omar Sharif, who is doing some oil business that talks about the troubles for the former Vice President. United States own companies. Along with this, there will be a trade show producer of the House, pop princess Yonika (Hillary Duff), and a dirty Liberal journalist, Natalie (Marisa Tomi), to have her nude position for a wedding. <br /> <br /> Technical aspects: <br /> <br /> - Acting (at least the original characters) was good, as expected. Some of John Cusack's conversations were probably not written for him because he often said uncomfortable. . . Perhaps irrational more accurate The young man is a great, and often ridiculous, declared performance. Marisa Tomomi, I'm never her big fan, was good for the role and did the best thing. Hillary Duff, though, was quite awesome. They were in an interesting Middle Eastern (or Russian, or that was supposed to be pronunciation) pop star. Unfortunately, they went with the number 0 for 3. <br /> <br /> - As I said above, there was a little bit of writing and hesitation, especially John Cusack's dialogue. It's not so much, but some of the minds. The story has become somewhat ridiculous in points, which is fine for satire on the point, but it has taken a whole new level here. Fortunately, Cusackos and Tomomi maintain relatively cool, quiet ambiguity, and it also creates an excellent mix of film freneties and actors' level handouts. <br /> <br /> - The actual credits of his name as Seppaul, who was earlier, did a fine job with a drought, a rather broad spectrum film. He managed a small amount of ($ 10 million) budget very well, expanding it to think it more. Seftel managed to nicely mix funny stories. . . Including the painful and strict surveillance parts of the real war (including the killing of civilians etc). <br /> <br /> - As far as general satirism goes, its exaggerated appearance on commercialization of war is a very good job, especially the 'Golden Palace Poker' advertisement in US tanks. At point, it gets a little over, but ultimately, it still illustrates what's going on for a correct 'mail Brooks' type. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film made good for a very good budget and it is definitely a look worthy of. It will not be down as one of the great entities in movies, but it is certainly not the worst. <br /> <br /> 7/10.
