I hate inexperienced over-chatting French films, but my favorite movie is the longest and most fun of French film. I saw it twice in the middle of the 70's, and then it disappears. But finally I found it again in 1999, I fell in love again. What is most remarkable is that it seems every bit as fresh as 25 years ago today. If you have not seen it, do not miss your chance!
