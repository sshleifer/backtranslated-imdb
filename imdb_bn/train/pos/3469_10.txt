This is one of the few movies I leave about a "what happens" kind of situation. It was amazing to hear each other talking, and did not remember the wonderful (and very surprising) things in them. I actually think there is a very good chance that this incident happened like a movie, and they actually made peace with each other. Those who have good memories for hanging over every fan, and ask them what actually happened in them will be selfish. This is what a wonderful movie was. The comic aspects of the movie were surprising. It seems that they were together to spit things into them so that they thought of comforting thoughts for someone who had the opportunity to clean the air with someone. To see John so caring, the character behind the character was refreshing by listening to all the trash that was said about him ...
