Cinderella is a beautiful movie with beautiful songs. Actually, it was one of the best films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> I think all the characters are portrayed amazingly. You can see the cruelty of Cinderella's grandmother and her teammate, Cinderella's sweetness. The mouse is funny and sweet too. <br /> <br /> I think they changed the story a bit, but I think it's the best. This is a nice movie, and I do not think anyone can prevent it deeply. <br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10. I do not think it's the best Disney film. But it sure is a true classic.
