Many posters comment on the dissatisfied conclusion. Always a problem with this long, complex drama. The crime is largely inoperative, so pay-offs are always anti-climatic, while details detail detracts from human drama. The author used several clever devices to try this round, but not completely successful. The exact answers to what happened and why it could be provided, but if so, they would bury well. The visitors felt a little cheating inevitably. <br /> <br /> But in a sense it is unimportant. This play was never about crime, even the investigation was not involved, it was about the effects of the events of the life of the perpetrators; Family, investigator, witness, press. And as it was gripping it. There was a significant cut of writing on the match for the prime-time play, and the performances were fairly good. In a magical piece, it was aroused to focus on people, but Penelope Wilton was a special reference to the extraordinary touring forces like the mother-wife-daughter, and the cracking form of Gen. Mactiier's rigid-cat old police was form. <Br /> <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is race handling, since the house is ready to mention that there is no elephant in the room. Fine, strong element.
