This movie is such a moving, amazing piece of work. I saw it in the theater when it came out, but I was only 13 years old and really "did not get it" ... I saw it again at the age of 20 (of course in the video and I own it now) and just flew away. Steven Spielberg has created a wonderful movie that covers you from the beginning. I read the book, but there is something about the movie that really made it alive. Welding, acting, music, costuming, scenery, everything, it's just wonderful. You smile, you cry, you are glad ... it finds every passion imaginable. It's one of the best pieces of his job and should not be missed!
