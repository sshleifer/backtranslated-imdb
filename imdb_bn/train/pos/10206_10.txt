In my years of joining film festivals, I have seen so many small films that do not get dramatic breaks and they end up at $ 3 points in Walmart. I just found Yank Tank's DVD, a great friend, but it's so sad to be ending up like the end of a nightmare. I love this picture, hopefully I found it in movies that I liked everything that New York films directly translated the title. It's good for Americans to stretch a little. If the title of the film helps the US audience explore random chaos, then it is all good. Imitate movie life and visas in contrast. <br /> <br /> I also ridiculed that subtitles keep prices at a dollar. Come on! Finding euro is not hard to find, gringo viewers do the math. Seeing a movie, especially a shot in Paris, the audience should be reminded that it is not watching a movie and they translate the euro into dollars for me. <br /> <br /> Look forward to seeing more of these actors from writers and directors.
