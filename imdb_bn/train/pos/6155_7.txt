"Bednobs and Bromstics" is a Disney museum, a magical adventure movie with a great grave. It usually includes a good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and beautiful visibility of England. <br /> <br /> it combines with very good live-action and animation. Animation itself, of course, quite well. Animation is much more similar to the 1973 animated film "Robin Hood" and it can be said about animated characters: Barisal, Elephant, Hippo, Lion, Crocodile and many other wild animals like "Robin Hood". As well, King (Singh) seems to be mixed with Prince John and King Richard, it can not be mentioned that the beer is like a Little Man. <br /> <br /> This movie is often called "Mary Poppins" for a reason. Combine live action and animations with both the same artwork. Both have similar settings in London. Both have their own magic and a magical woman. Children (Kerry, Charlie and cute little Paul) Some children like the bank Both films are directed by Robert Stevenson and both acting David Tomlinson. However, instead of a serious person like George Banks, David Tamlinson is an actor and magician figure - Professor Emilius Brown. Through his magic, this film has little but noteworthy references to Harry Potter's stories. <br /> <br /> Most songs are good. "The Age of Buying" and "The Billy Brittany Sea" are very good. "Portbola Road" is very nice. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury, Believing age Â»a boy) and Roy Snort as the younger brother Paul. <<br /> I like black cats. It's pretty cool. It looks like something like Selim, Sabrina from the TV series, the teenager witch "black cat" looks like. Whenever a white rabbit turns into a movie character, I look beautiful. Rabbit is really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. I just love them! Even Professor Emilius Brown is transformed into a white rabbit, which is also funny, because when he is transformed again, he blows his nose like a rabbit. It's really sunny, combined with its ridiculous images and that hardships. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a good movie, but its end is quite bad. The first minute of the movie is not something special, but it makes much progress. Finish, but weak The reason for my main criticism about it, especially the animated knights, is very much for me and because of the feeling of war.
