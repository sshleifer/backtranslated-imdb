Marjari, a young girl who works at the museum and takes two ladies roommates, Pat and Terry. One night he comes to the car and attacks a masked man with a knife. His plan is to rape him, but he is managed to escape, the man has his purse. Actually rape has not happened, police can not help him. One day, when Marjorie's roommate works, his attacker comes there. His name is Joe. This man is the beginning of a long fight. But she is driven to spray the eyes and mouth with insect bites, the stuff that will not kill him soon, will kill him. She closes her and tells Joke about the same physical and mental attack. Used before The Extremitas (1986) Robert M. Managed by Young. It is based on the controversial Offroad Broadway game by William Marmoshimon in 1982. Farah Fawcett, who sadly had lost his battle with cancer last year, was a brilliant James Rousseau who was also an attacker in the play, he Believed as Alfred Woodward and Daya. Not as great as Scarwid Pat and Terry. James Avery is seen as security guard. He got a Golden Globe nomination. This is not a movie which is supposed to entertain you. A question is asked revenge is justified. This is not a perfect movie, but I recommend it.
