When I was 10 or 11 years old, I saw this picture alone on Saturday night in my parent's basement Saturday night. It is shown in "Theater Theater", a regular horrible feature that I saw as a young man religiously. Now, I've seen many old horror films, thanks to Chile's theater, but no one has ever stuck with me like "Dance MacBook", "KLL Blood". I am 51 years old now, and last year I was fortunate enough to identify the latest, quality DVD version of this wonderful communal-tempted supernatural classic, I thought I would not manage to see it again. I saw it four more times, and I could not get tired of it. <br /> <br /> They just do not make such a movie of spook Spooky coincidence and foggy graves do not work in color even on black and white day. However, this Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steel, delicious galaxies, cobweb-wrapped spectacular castle sets, restless souls rebuild their death ... and the end of a mock mockery. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
