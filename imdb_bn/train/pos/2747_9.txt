Although it was released in 1967, Sold Blawood still remained in the benchmark, through which all true-crime films were mixed. Lady Writer / Director Richard Brooks (Elmer Gantry) has transformed the non-fiction book of Truman Capetto into Chiling Docdruma, which still remains boring power twenty-five years later. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the tips, which breaks into two former cons, Herbert Clauter's Kansas home, protects the wall ten thousand dollars safely. But no safe was found, and instead of the two Mr. Clutter, his wife and their two children were killed, only one radio, a pair of telescopes and a small forty dollars went away. When two months of unharmed "vacation" in North Mexico ended in Las Vegas, police caught them in a stolen vehicle. But in the end it came, after the silly grilling of Kansas law enforcement officials, these two men committed serious crime in Holcom. Four convicted of trial and trial in the murder case, they were imprisoned for five years in the appeals and denials, until both of them were hanged on April 14, 1965. <br /> <br /> <br /> The two convicted killers do not show any remorse for what they have done, but are concerned about being caught. A good turn as John Forcit's chief detective Alvin Davy, investigating the criminal investigation as Gerald S. O'Laughlin as his assistant. Strategically on behalf of both the faithful and strategic gambit in favor of Capote's books, Brooks does not show murders at the beginning; Instead, he sees that two killers reach the Clutter House, the last light comes out, and then falls into the horrific discovery of dead bodies in the morning and later. Only when returning to Kansas, when Blake is questioned by Forosith and describes the story, we see the horror of the truth of that night. We are not losing many blood in these scenes, but we do not need it. Shotgun explosions and Clutter's face in the face of a horrific face, they know about the death, they are more than enough annoying, so there is no need to resort to bloody slash-film violence explicitly. <br /> <br /> <br /> Cute black, black and white white color is dry bloody, and results are excellent thanks to Conrad Hall. The cool jazz score capper by Quincy Jones is the capper. The end result is one of the kind of illogical films of any kind, it is devastating in its low-end fashion. This is a 134-minute crime study which reduces to a whole state and indeed a whole nation and should be seen, though the viewer's consideration is advised; 'R' ratings are for a reason.
