This comedy has all the common characters in this show: good guy, fool, perverted, rich girl ... but it's set of 70s. This is the only difference with other TV comedies. I do not know how you can do this program. His humorous compassionate! I mean, jokes are so direct ... A common conversation is: "Fez: Oh, Jackie, I want sex with you." (Audience laughs) Jackie: Fez is a distorted (laughing audience) Fez: Oh yeah. Audience cheers and applauds) "It's not funny. I think that if it does not smile (I do not know how to call you in English, but sorry) you do not laugh. This is not an intelligent comedy, it's an insult to the public. I like most American comedy, but this is not good. I would give it 10 out of 10. (I'm sorry for my poor English again.)
