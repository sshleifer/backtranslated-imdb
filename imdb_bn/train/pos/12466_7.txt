The first movie of "Jean Renoir", "Vividly Volukul", will take us to the rural areas, to find the living of the peasants, which he will continue to discover, the second film seems to be related to him in most cases. Rich and privileged, upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way above. Keep the letters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of the cool "Grand Illusion" and "Games of Games".

By doing this, under this view, and we wonder if violence will run out - this and on The spicy image of the lazy rich laughing aid gives the film to its depth. <br /> <br /> is completely embarrassed for its greatest achievement, and "virtual to look" for me, it is still the best value for those who are still interested in Renoir fans or silent movies.
