Every country in which there is a film industry, some barbarians (and maybe some insane) artists who make movies, when you are fully part of this country you can fully understand. I think Hundstage is such a movie. <br /> <br /> You are the lowest level of Austria society, dirty, angry, weird, hateful. But they still have enough money so that they can afford toed cars and big houses. And they are doing a lot of strange things here that might seem to be 'normal' for them because they are doing it through their whole life. From the perspective of the normal person, you can now easily follow the movie and be scared or fascinated and can see the fine parts of Austrian art films. <br /> <br /> But if you are here and you know that people see you characters Hundstaj as a community tumor A society that is more insane than usual, making its own rules that no one else understands, caves the social system from inside. And you see people Standing in the opposite corner of the park, queuing in the same line, sitting in the park. Maybe you can fill a bar or a disco you can visit. Maybe you work with them in their jobs or they are next to your house. Why do you begin to hate them without knowing exactly. You'll try to get away - but you can not. Maybe you will end up like them. But it seems to be 'normal' for you because you are now doing it all through your life ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It has beautiful people ... but some ugly. Many hard-working people are trying their best ... but there is something that is behind the others and the people of Austria have destroyed so far. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating movie.
