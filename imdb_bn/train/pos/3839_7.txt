Most people know Paul Vereovan as the director of a very good (and bad) science-film director in Hollywood. But long ago he threw generic thrillers in his own country. The story is a basic femme fatale premiere, nothing new or enthralling. Verhoyen believes that he can make it better by adding a series of dreams sequences, which instead of just defining our main character and its situation, is used only as a way to advance the expected conspiracy. The screenplay was strong, dialogue that helps influence the effect of the dialogue pad. Truly at least the good movie movie had some awesome acting. As a "torture artist", Zero Crab was very amazing and supporters were very good. Also, John de Bont's cinematography adds at least some lives to the film, helping the director see Vernovan as the least capable. <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> * 1/2 / * * * *
