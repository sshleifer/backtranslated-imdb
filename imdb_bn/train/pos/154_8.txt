Based on the novel "El Mar" and Blue Boanette's novel, directed by Catalonian director Auguste Villarner, a glimpse of Spanish history is seen by the bellicographer, which highlighted the civil war in that country to the audience. The film focuses on three friends and follows them on the first day of the beginning of the war in Morocco, after a few years later, when these two friends remain in the Santorum, they are again lost in the village. <Br /> <br /> We first play three boys happy. Do not think everything. One of them's sad death indicates cruelty for performing evil. The boys forbade a young woman to take part in their games, about their age, their age. <br /> <br /> When we meet again in Ramallo's adult, he will go to a SantoTom. He seems to be suffering from skin. As soon as he was surprised, one of his boyfriend's friends is being treated with Manuel Turo, and the young man who was not welcomed to participate in his game is now one of his health care nuns. It is clear that Tura is watching Ramallo in such a way that it means she is in love with a serious fault. Their relationship will be destructive. <br /> <br /> Roger Cassamoos did a good job with the image of the old Ramolas. Bruno Bergenzino makes an impression as a weak young boy. Antonia Torrens firmly sours Francisca drama. Angela Molina, looks like the wife of the company's caretaker Carmen. Perfect like Simon Andr√© Alcantara <br /> <br /> "El MAR" is a dark film that shows the genre of Augusti Villarona, for the audience to see the novel alive.
