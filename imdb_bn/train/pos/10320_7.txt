*** Potential spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie with my 11-year-old son and he was happy to see that he laughs in the right place and was thrilled by the order of action. Ron Eli is right as Doc Quiet, calm, almost always control (and with a temporary Twinkle in his eyes). What else can you ask for? I have never read the book Doc Sages, so I do not know if it is faithful for the source but I have enjoyed the voice and great work of light. Many people compared this movie with Lloyd Arak's riders, which I think is fair. Budget difference is surprising (attackers must have at least 10 budgets). Doc Savage has a wide range of jobs that are radar. Special effects come at a minimum but humans, the story is just a lot of fun and humor. Sosa song is interesting (love song theme - every time I see the movie, I finish the theme hamming for a day). The best way to reach this movie is to simply enjoy and enjoy it. The highlights include exciting opening sequences where the fantastic five and Indian sniper and retreat in Dock New York and following the trend of fun fighting between Doc and Captain Saas. Villains who sleep as well as a Pirates (Really!). Overall a rainy day is a great movie to watch. I gave 7 out of 10. <br /> <br /> Doc Savage, Doc Savage ... Thanks to the Lord here!
