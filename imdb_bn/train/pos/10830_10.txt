I've enjoyed crazy more than any film over the years. A successful band of 70 decided to try it another one. They start playing some gigs in some seedy European venues with delightful results. The music is superb, scripts and acting awesome. The character spot, especially the lead singer with high heavy metal voice, makeup and personality problems. At the end the concert was unreal. Go and see it in a movie with a good sound system, especially :)
