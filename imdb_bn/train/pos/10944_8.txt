Sarah Silverman Program ... is better than another show. No smile track, no painful joke, just a program. Sarah Silverman Program. If you're like me, and you love comedy, it's probably a show for you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This program is not something that You want to start relatively, as you can see how to do absolutely nothing (other shows).
