Write Jude Law as a journalist / photographer to kill yourself for the opportunity to collect dead brain photos in order to kill yourself. Beautifully drawing pictures of drama in 30 years of life. Sometimes the speed bogs down, but then continued the story of a crack in graphic violence.

Other notable cast members are: Dylan Baker, Stanley Tucci, Daniel Craig and Jennifer Jason Lie. Hanks again proved to be a very memorable movie. Please wait for some Oscars!
