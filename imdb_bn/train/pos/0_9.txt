Bromwell High is a cartoon comedy. It was directed at the same time as some other program like school teacher, such as "teacher". My 35-year education profession has been believed that Brawell High's mockery is much closer than the reality of "teachers". Hypocrisy for living financially, insightful students who are able to see their rogue teachers properly through pope, mitigate the whole situation, remind me of the school and their students. When I saw an episode where a student repeatedly tried to burn the school, I immediately remembered ...... .......... Hi. A classic line: Inspector: I'm dismissive of your teachers here. Students: Welcome to Bromwell High I hope many adults of my age think that Bromwell is very far away. It is not sad!
