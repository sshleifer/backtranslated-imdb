I do not understand why other comments focus on MacConagyye. She has never been a very attractive film actor. <br /> <br /> The best part of this movie is writing and wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGauge have created an unusual comic pair, certainly not the type of stock. Although no one can say that their characters have developed well, they are not less fun. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was in the HDNET and was a subtitle for Spanish conversations, so it was certainly not the problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. <br /> <br /> A very underground movie, IMDB members have done unusually low scores. I thought it was fun and interesting and at least a 7 price. To make big money in many sticky cinemas and box offices with high scores is much less interesting.
