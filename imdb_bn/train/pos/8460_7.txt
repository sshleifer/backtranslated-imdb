Gundam Wing is a fun show. I'm generally grateful to bring me the bully and anime. However, after seeing the predecessors as Mobile Suite Gundam, Zeta Gundam and even Jeet Gundam, I see wing being a bulky light. <br /> <br /> Characters: An aspect held by the guts is pressed into the difficulty of having their character and grow into maturity. This wing is not happening. Top dog at the beginning of the heroes, and ultimately he is the top dog. Personality does not change, growth is not achieved. The best character Zechs, who are for a hero across most of the series of all purpose and purpose. But suddenly the series betrayed him and returned him to a villain for some reason. <br /> <br /> There is a great design of wing. Thugs are very beautiful, Epiion is my favorite. I even consider having some of the classic Zion lawsuits in OZ suite designs. But sweet suit designs do not store the series mostly from annoying characters. Conclusion: Finally, Wing's repetitive animation, but there is a strong battle scene with shallow plot and character development. Enjoyable, but not moving like the previous Gundam outings.
