I'm a very big Jim Carey fan. I stopped my SS during Leaar Leer and S. Ventura. I liked him for his serious movie, especially truman shows. This is a very interesting side, and a cross between its serious side. He must have very funny, but very serious parts in this movie, and they are very easy to stop. He is truly a multi-acting actor. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the cast, I was happy with the performance of Jennifer Aniston. I'm just a couple of nice tits and great ass. Morgan Freeman makes a very quiet god. For Steven Carroll, his limited scenery is very funny, especially in anchor scenes. <br /> <br /> Overall, I have to rate it 9. Like acting, funny scripts and some serious situations this is a very good film.
