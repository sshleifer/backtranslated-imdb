I saw this movie in 1976, my first year of living in New York. I have been there for the next 26 years, but like this little TV movie, I have never seen anything aesthetic and beautiful. I think this is part of a PBS series, and I have not forgotten it. <br /> <br /> There is no sex scene, just touching the perfect moments of fine, moving, unusual tension and tension, all conservatives, Boston (I think), in World War 1 environment where women played husband's role, waiting for husband to return Wife's role, and did not find a career and financial independence. Francis Lee McCain was fantastic about the career photographer's role, and I could not find it in the next 30 strange years for any benefit in his rich challenging roles. <br /> <br /> Is there a video in this movie? It sure of DVD sure but at least one video?
