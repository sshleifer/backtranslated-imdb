I did not dance flamenco before, but in any way I think this movie was perfect. The colors, how much the dance, the gypsy and the rival had made a movie together, which soon ended. I have seen other Carlos solar films and I agree that this film can be its best product. I think the best features of its past films have been combined and linked to the creation of Iberia. I appreciate using the publishing mirror activity of the camera going on behind. Seeing this movie, I felt I was sitting in a small restaurant in Madrid, easily dancers jumped into a wooden ribbon on a delicious fruit cocktail. For me, this movie fit like a glove. I do not know how I can get a copy of this movie in the next few years. I suggest this movie to anyone who is attracted to the living of other cultures. It's safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorite list.
