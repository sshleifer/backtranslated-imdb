The big problem will start, this movie requires your attention for the next two hours and you will not miss a few minutes to get a coke because it is a danger you can not follow. But there's a break button well. In 1996, Bruce Willis must travel between Timemachine to find out some antivirus for animal-governing virus around the world. Thanks for the first time in World War I and some mistakes of the way it was all objectionable. Like, Terry Gilliam comes up with what ever will be one of the most intelligent script. This former Monty Faitan man has to tell exactly how the character's SF-stories, and his cast choices might not be good, crazy Brad Pitt (remembering his performance in the shelter) and a fantastic Bruce Willis who proved that he was more than some horsergegener. This is a movie that you can see repeatedly because the scripts are so weird and complex (and still you can follow) that each view gives you other surprises. One of my big favorites
