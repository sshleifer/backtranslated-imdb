This movie is bufuniri! And I like it! "The Dragon Lord" (Jackie Chan) and his friend, "Cowboy", made the movie fun, meaningful, and simply simple fool. The film is a good versus battle of evil and a rare blend (in any way) that are growing and fun that are growing. Long Shaw Ya takes the audience with the daily activities of "Dragon Lord" (which is named because he is a wealthy family) and "Cowboy", among which the whole family, including the skilled, effective way of avoiding the study. , Instead of achieving the fondness of local football, compete with kids (and catching up on interesting), "football" (what do you think i ) And move on to the list. Because they find themselves through an invoice of valuable elders and fighting to save the lives of different people. <br /> <br /> This movie has serious moments. But they are not depressed, but rather inspire. In this exchange the boys can not be played, but actually work against the temple. What I really loved about this movie is that it ends. Not a common contradiction (which was great in itself), but better, you'll see. I just say that it represents the real movie soul. <br /> <br /> Foolish, malicious, meaningful, and nostalgic. Awesome movies.
