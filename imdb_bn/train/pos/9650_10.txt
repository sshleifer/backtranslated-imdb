I found this movie for the first time when I was searching for some works of Styphon Rideau, yet amazingly amazingly beautiful «Less pink saves» (Portuguese, Juncos Sylvestres) is an extraordinary tragedy of under-techin. I come to the age line, searching for similar movies. I then saw «the press Reiyan», a movie where the director Sebastian Lifescht surprisingly surprised us, was nominated by the Kana festival in 2000. The story is about two, such as «the boy next door», Matthew (Jeremy Elkheim) and Sidric (Stephen Rideau), who meet during the summer holidays. Far away from where he lives, Matthew spends his sister on the sea beach. He combines Cedric with a local man, with whom he began the relationship of this genius and expression, his characters, Stephen Rueday (6-year-old "Les Goulds Suuces», he still preserves) sweet masked secrecy, witch experience matures here). Immortal, among the interim and confidential details that a boy first faces his (still confused) sexuality and great love Instructions, for example, first love, exacerbation of its horrific progression: The best movie is the best of France: warm passion, warm and excited rationality, brown beauty, easy and natural recognition by family, although not surprising and without the first anger. Beach, brightness, summer lightness and simplicity, air quality, waves of waves, and intimate alchemy Dynamic eyes (dysfunctional, hurt, confused, passionate). Sex is not avoided or absorbed, it is regarded as an exhibitionist with intent, from the pure genius, it is a work of extraordinary quality drama, without any consolation, no ordinary Like the personality, showing the real picture of two gay men in their youth, even though social fear of disbelief and shame. It is well-received, especially those who worship French movies (although the DVD front cover is very faux, with ten stars in two stars, Grease with brillianten). A movie witch, my opinion, an 8-9 qualification!
