There are many people in our lives that we can meet only once in our lives, but for some reason or for others we remember those people for the rest of their life. They occur in friendship with people in a long distance, and there is no reason why we do not meet these people again. We do not always know their names, as we do not present to each other and sometimes we forget to ask their names. It is interesting that ordinary humanity sometimes makes friends and we like to keep it, because reconciliation can loot lazy memories, or we do not know it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was very scared to see this picture. I never intended to see it, but although the discussion seems to be interesting in the couple, I gave a look to the rest of the film. I did not know what to expect from it, but the young couple did. Until the sunrise, they had time to discuss with each other and they could happen before they got separated. I believe this movie has been well-researched because the situation is something that lives on this planet at least once or twice. It makes us think about all the people we once met once in our lives.
