A young Frenchman from Rada Moroccan dynasty. Despite his Muslim heritage, he is very French in attitude and values. His father announced from Nil that he would take Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca - whatever RADA did not want to do, agreed only with responsibility. As a result, although Rena was angry at the start, being a traditional Muslim man, it is difficult to discuss or discuss her with her father. Both father and son seem to be very rigid and rigid - and when the father tells his son that he should not be so resonant, it is very ridiculous. <br /> <br /> When I read the summary, it discusses how many letters it grew up and started to know each other. However, I do not really think they are and that's the film's fascinating and sad outlook. Certainly, there was time to understand, but it often involved enmity and repression. I really liked it and were grateful that it was not a complete solution - as it seemed guilty. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> It provides an interesting risk to traditional Islam and secular young generation. While the lack of transparency about slow-motion and film-related relationships can disturb some people, I think it has given the film a strong reality and it looks like a movie about humans - not some sources. A nice and unusual film.
