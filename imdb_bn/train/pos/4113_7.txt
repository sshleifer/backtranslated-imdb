The title is a word that carries the trolley of its letters across the carb dumple, where the characters live. This picture is based on a series of stories about Shugoro Yomamoto and at the end of the dump, Ramakalal tells the story of a group of people living in the house. This is a mixture of humor and sadness. <br /> <br /> The first color film made by Akrila Kurasawa is something I have long wanted to see. Oddly, it is available for some three or four hours from the original to the short version due to runtime errors in some promotional material. I was waiting for the full version, waiting to see what Kurosawa wanted to see, just want to know the recent release of Mixer that the 140-minute version is full version. <br /> <br /> Finally I sat down with mixed feelings for the movie to watch the film. The first and foremost linking each film to his visually follow. You can see others in Kuruzwal reflecting the six films in this film, below the painted sunset. It is an interesting movie using its color and you understand why it will be happy to have it so long for such a movie stock (there are definitely failed projects). A visual work of the film industry. (Even though you are going to watch it on your widescreen TV it will be warned but it was shot 1.33, so it will be displayed in the normal TV ratio.) The rest is a mixed bag. A part of the problem is that all these people's lives are not together. As a separate story they do everything well but do not hang on as a filmmaker as they are one. I do not blame Kursova, because no one can always hit things outside the box, especially when someone like Robert Almanan specifically bomb attacks on such multi-role films. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no reason to see the film saying that. All of the Kurusawa films are always watching their movies, because they do not work. The first trip to the "trolley" Kurasowa is one of the best things ever and worth a rental price. As a trolley, one of the most witchcraft moments in the history of the film is visited and it is revealed. The resident of the car is touching the father and the boy (though very sad) and there are other bits and pieces that are shining (the cast that is across the board) and at least one person should try to do something different from a person. We are usually a samurai film or Associated with crime dramas <br /> <br /> This is a curiosity muffer from a major filmmaker, which means that in this case it means the success of other filmmakers. <br /> <br /> between 6 and 7, the pieces are a lot more.
