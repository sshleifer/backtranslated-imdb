The first two-thirds of the biology of this idol model is very interesting. Bettynn MÃ¶llle's extraordinary warmth comes in the form of a beautiful, girl-after-door type, who did not see anything wrong with her (and of course she was not "wrong" with him). Betty has restored America by mixing old black and white stock footage with new, abusive, black and white footage, by director Mary Harron, who created "I shot Andy Warhol" and "American Psycho". Once Bati started making land in Florida and started working with Bonnie Jaeger, the color was introduced. Most of his work was with Betey's notorious Palla and Irving Clo (Lily Taylor, a great performance and Chris Bauer) and John Wiley (Jared Harris). The scene where Hannah Betty Bond repeats the Bond Photography session is fascinating and adroitly executed. The initial supplements of fetish elements are not very neutrally portrayed and we understand that these people are part of a tight "community". Betty did not have too much problems with her ugly, though we think her fame prevents her from directly accepting acting in the acting world. Because the third act of the film is virtually unattainable, we have impressed that instead of structured drama we are seeing a feature-length documentary on Betty Page. The final crack, it well evaluates a movie and produces a fine feather of producer Christine Wachan's cap.
