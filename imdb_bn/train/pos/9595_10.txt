One of the commentators at the beginning of this movie said that he has been told that there are two strikes against him: he is black and male. But besides his, he has a third strike: he is gay "You must be stronger than you ever imagined," he said. "Paris is burning" is a documentary about gay black and Hispanic men who are transvestite or transsexuals. <br /> <br /> The miracle of "Paris is Burning" is that director Jenny Livingston has taken such a subject which can easily be a fantastic show and people allow their humanity. We learn homophobia, men, women, their opinions, their frustration, their thoughts in their dreams. It is sad to have some sadness in this dream. Many are seriously refusing <br /> <br /> This is not a movie for everyone. Nude transsexuals have this movie shot. If you have a problem with homosexuality, then this movie is not for you. But if you look at this movie you will understand that "Paris is going to burn" is not about men wearing men's clothes, it's a group that is regularly limited and enlarges by society and that they can get it <br /> <br / > I was released in 1991, I saw this photo four times, because it said a lot: it is in our culture about materialism, about the role of speech. Who is a comment, about the rich and poor people, media about publicity and publicity and what it celebrates. "Paris is burning" is one of the most humane and most tragic films I've ever seen.
