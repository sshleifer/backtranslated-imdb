Many issues avoided in the film and eating problems are among them. This picture shows it as. It is not glamorous to enjoy the audience, it is shown with real truth that makes it even more powerful. I only saw it once and it was a few years ago but I still remember everything about it and how it feels to me. This is a very powerful film and it gives good support to anyone affected by a wings disorder so that they can stop their will. What these movies should be - should not help people and glamorize the wrong things.
