Brian Zonstown may use some therapies to suggest the genocide of Ant√≥n Noucky, and it can be used flexibly. Dig! Which won the grand jury award in Sandans, we see him and his band self-reliant for more than seven years, when former friends and contemporaries compare Dandy Warhols with greatness (any mobile phone advertising, however) <br /> <br /> elevates the dig! An infinite, close-biblical trick-tragedy is being played on his contemporaries: a sad book on art and compromise against industry is a sad book. For posting all his "Look at me, I'm bloody talent", Noucamba is actually gifted alone, if he is too rival, the musician - his opponent, Dandy's Curtly Taylor, who is much more talented than the figure he describes. If Newcomb is Dennis Hooper, Tyler's Peter Fonda, <br /> <br /> Even the saddest, Taylor began to realize through this tired, self-defeating voice-over: He knows his band won the war - but what is the cost? Indeed, they sell indie-light record, keep their teeth clean and clean, and possibly brush their hair twice before drying - thus winning record contracts and a big tour bus. And jettisoning all the credibility of the process. On the other hand, Newcombe living in dirty condition, constantly getting annoyed, hits a fellow band member on stage, jumps on the head - and finally digs up! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> An instant classic moment is released.
