I basically saw this very dark comedy on the 2000 or cable TV. What a surprise and joy! Everyone is secretly armed in this picture! Dreyfas plays "emotional" Dawn (New York reminds Don who wants to become schizophrenic? The industry life or vice versa?). Diane Lane and Allen Barkin are not toyed with them the most beautiful and! So proof that beauty and energy do not go together! Then there is a fantastic "bullish" scene between Barkin and Jeff Goldlom (Rita and Mikey), where they verbally played the world "bullish" This image is both fine and cold. For all the shooting, it can be a very cool film. And, you have the opportunity to see different actors in their final or closest final roles. Joey Bishop Richard Pierre Henry Silva This is not a movie for everyone. But, if you like a movie that sounds a lot of noise and the sight goes on without everything, it's a movie for you. Roger Ebert dumps on this photo. He's flat on the plane. This is a fine, fine film! Maybe not just for Ebert. I consider this as 10 because how it is done and how fun the script can be, although it is not actually a direct comedy type movie. I like it very well that I bought it in DVD because it simply does not show too much on TV. Now, it's all mine!
