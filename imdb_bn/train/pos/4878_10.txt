Kabhiye: Our Mother (2008) is a poetic and glorious beauty of Japan. A real tears! I heard great reviews for the film and hired it from Netflix. I am glad i am In the 1940s and 1950s, this film reminds me of the old style of Japanese classic filming that I have come to love in Yasujio Ozu pictures, for so much love - title credits can start alike, in a red letter against neutral color burlap material in Japanese Characters (Characters). I immediately thought: This director loves Ozu. The same style is used very much: mostly mostly indoor set with a few outdoor scenes. Even a couple of "pillow shots", such as Roger Ebert, called them. The power of the film is based on the love of each other. <br /> <br /> This story follows the lives of Japanese families before and after and after World War II. The mother can take care of her pregnant women, who can be arrested for anti-war sympathy for parents (a professor of the university). He will never be free and there is a brief meeting with his wife before going to jail because of her hunger and disease. Meanwhile, a professor of former students often helps to take care of mother and two girls. He began to love mother and alternate father for two girls. But the war started and he would dare and they would say goodbye a goodbye. Will they ever express their love for each other? Will he ever return from war? <br /> <br /> Chief actress Sayari Yasinaga has many heart and mild feelings in her career. She's almost kind of Madonna, she's so beautiful! Large lively eyes and flawless skin. Student actor actor is remarkable: his name is Tadanobu Asano. What is a sensitive performance? There is no macho in him; He is gentle and kind. I certainly want to see these two in two other films. I'll check to see what's available for them. Two little child actresses are very surprising. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> I gave 10 out of 10 out of the IMDB. I screamed almost similarly with the Japanese film classic Trenty Four Eyes (1954). Do not miss this picture!
