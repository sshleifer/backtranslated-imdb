People complain about the number of movies created by mentally disabled people. I do not see this as a legitimate criticism, but it is not more about a person than many other allegations. Jacquo van Dormell scripts and performs an excellent job in the direction. Daniel O'Toole and Pascal Dwuken work themselves together, Duaneen is basically playing himself. The film has added an amazingly big role to the phenomenon, and is not the only content to go beyond "Rain Man". Finishing is rather depressing, but it does not destroy the wonderful stories that have come before. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 7.8
