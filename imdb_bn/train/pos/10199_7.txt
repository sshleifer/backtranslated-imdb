As a kid, I like this game. I spray with my friend Andrew 1993 it played a zillion times during the time. I used to play excel or glow and he would be Adam and no matter how many times we played it, we never got bored. Then the angry road 2 came out. And we quickly forgot that this one was even existent. <br /> <br /> You play as ex-police, like Exports Stone, Adam or Blazer Fielding, who have left the forces to take bad people on their way. There are 8 levels to work through a driven and corrupt city under the leadership of the naughty Mr. X. Bit all the bad guys and the last-level boss is so much fun. Level 4 (bridge) was damn me because you could shine baddies down the river holes. You even end at the end of the game (Mr.) Get the chance to become X's right tool. This leads to 'bad ending', so you become the head of the syndicate. How do you destroy the syndicate on your way from Mr. X. It is a possible mystery, okay then <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The composer Ezo Kosiro Sega did all the miraculous work with the limited technology of Genesis. Main theme, Level One, Level 4 and Finlal Boss stand stand. <br /> <br /> As a Wii Owner I am proud to have this on my console forever. But along with the road 2 of the road, this first renders a bit obsolete. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The average graphics but nice backgrounds represent like comic books. The progress of the panel that fits the game's voice. <br /> <br /> Great tunes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Baddies often engage in battle instead of walking away from you. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Graphics B-Sound A-Gameplay B-Long Lasting Application B-
