Although I agree that this is not a good but a great movie, I still enjoy it because of the other posters. One reason is music: I like to pay attention to the very calm look by the Candoli Brother in Conte and Pete in a well-organized view of Nightclubs. These guys had two of their day's best jazz trumpets, and they firmly inspired Jamie Stewart's mind to play a trumpet blueprint by playing a trumpet on each of Stewart's ears. Candolis really plays that good, too, although I suspect that the actual music for the scene is dubbed by two of them later. I do not know much about George Dinking, who has received music credits (even more that he seems to have worked with three Stugis on multiple occasions), but Casting as a jazz-playing warship for the Candolio brothers was a real nice touch.
