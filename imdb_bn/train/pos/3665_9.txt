They did it. And, boy, do they do it or fantasy! The BBC finally brought the doctor to our screen on Saturday evening, where he was! And they did it with style! <br /> <br /> Episode One: "Rose" - Russell T. Davis as a writer and executive producer in the new series of powers. He knows what a fan of the show and other fans want, but the experienced writer of his own experience also knows what other people want. Another force, perfectly shown on this first mountain, is Billy Piper and his character in the film of Tyler Tyler. Eventually the doctor's companion gets a credible back story and a strong character. Great to see the return of Auton - there is something nice for the classic series. <br /> <br /> "End of the World" - To show TARDIS at the beginning of this double bill, 'Energy, we are a story where special effects end up all! They now have real, reliable environments and techniques to create monsters - there is no rubber case! It is also indicated at the end of this new episode of the new doctor - it is very inspiring to kill Lord all the time and make him the sole one. <br /> <br /> Episodes three: "dead dead" - we were in the 'future, now past. The first non-Davis episode is slightly flat in some places, but it is made by Simon Dyne's Charles Dickens and reveals the intricate wrapping of the plot when it is revealed that the Gracious Golf is not so ruthless after all ... <<br /> Episode four: " London's Eliens "- The results of the doctor's performances in this series were fully researched, and there was no response to the reaction with him. Also, we have our first cliffhanger; Confession is not good. Slythane is an interesting villain, although they can see good CGI for themselves. <br /> <br /> Five episodes: "World War Three" - The second part of this story about Slythane is primarily suffering from the same problem. Also, the clips of the next episode coming to the end of the next episode are annoying and looting it for the people. <br /> <br /> Episode six: "Dalek" - Yes! We have received the future, past and present (Isa), but now we can get good things - the return of doctor's arc-nemesis. Here I think we can complement Christopher Ecclestone - he was brilliant like a doctor, and not only in this episode, where we saw the pain of his face, when he remembered the time of the war and its alien nature, a dale himself. <br /> <br /> Episode Seven: "The Long Game" - Only a story to act as a suggestion for the end of the series. Samuel Pegg's memorabilia editor and Timcin Gregg preserved as an entertainment show. Media is controlling us - it has never been done before, it has ... <br /> <br /> Episode Edit: "Father's Day" - it's a great episode. For people to complete the passion and heart disease for everyday, and true results of what is happening when you really muck up history. Here is the complete sign of Billy Piper. <br /> <br /> Not episode: "Empty children" - I do not think this child is too scary. Sorry, but I do not. Although this is a good episode, Cliffhanna could still be good - it's the "next time" bit that looted them. John Barroman has been called Captain Jack here - he is a good actor who has been around for a while, but only seems to be seen now. <br /> <br /> Episodes Ten: "Doctor Dance" - these two parts are WW2 stories - very good historical context. Ending a gorgeous exhilaration, even though "mummy" is expressed when it is a little confusing for young viewers? <br /> <br /> EPISOD ELAVEN: "Boom Town" - is probably the weakest of the series, but its meaning is not bad. An excellent return for the slitene and an interesting character of Doctor and Rose. <br /> <br /> "Bad Wolf" - It starts with a fool, shows some hearty humor and humorous fun making him a master on popular television. The events turn out to be deadly fatal, but the best cliffs in the series are finally published! <br /> <br /> Episode Threaten: "The With Partings" - Bye Christopher Exelstone. An excellent doctor in many ways, David Tennant is really working his socks off as well as his. At the end the rebirth scene was beautifully played. Oh, and Delix back - into the extreme! God bless the CGI, because they can not naturally pull this off! <br /> <br /> Overall - Bright! 9/10
