I have seen this documentary twice - and even though I'm a movie main movie, most of the documentary does not hold my attention. This picture was fun though. Almost every shot is perfect - saying a lot more than an audio commentary (which is not a documentary). <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​this movie is amazing, I can not praise it enough. Mardi Gras Wizard - Who Did Think ?? Wonderful and fantastic choice of interviews - The footage of a factory in China - the film reminds you that you are really there. <br /> <br /> I am politically conscious - and I've read several books on globalization, so I was not surprised at this picture. Anyway, it made me think so much. <br /> <br /> I too wish that this world was a good place. <br /> <br /> One million cudos for the creator of the picture - and thanks for creating this image. <br /> I wish everyone could see it.
