This one is great one! Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding have created a strong and very influential film. This is the true story of the first black American Navy Diver and the barriers to the achievement of his certification in the racist master Diver. Along with this, he will have to face old old secularism from all of his classmates, who do not want him in his class. When they come, they come out of the barracks. Finally, he became certified and has a great job as a US Navy Diver. See this one! It's a great story of courage and respect. As the story goes on, we gradually get rid of racism and everyone at one time begins respecting man.
