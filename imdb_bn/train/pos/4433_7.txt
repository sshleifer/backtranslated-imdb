Story: On the island's Texas, photographer Bob, who shot a photo for the magazine, fills the mysterious catlinin. Bob's free soul and desire Bob for the plot of life, very soon suffered a very traumatic experience. It seems, his life is not so easy. Through Kathleen, Bob gets entangled in a dangerous network. <br/> <br /> Review: The dialogue is very normal in this movie and the story is nicely expressed even though it is somewhat steep on the surface and the character's 'psychology' has been done a little more. Why do they do this? What does their choice motivate? It's a movie depth and thinks about my opinion. The story does not reach a psychological measure even though the letters are enough to justify. So you do not know that deep layer letter. Actors perform well and act in a very normal and credible manner, but I think if Kathleen is played by a small actress, then the film will make better, because the depiction of this character does not work for the full growth. Up women Camera-work is beautiful, and there are some great shots of island nature. I give the movie 7/10.
