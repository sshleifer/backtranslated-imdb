I did not see it because of all the negative reviews of this photo. However, I was glad that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie. The performance was not extraordinary - in addition to the wonderful Alice Cr√®ges - but a bit of dialogue ("Just consider your lunch.") Was quite funny. <br /> <br /> Stephen King's efforts at full-scale - 7/10
