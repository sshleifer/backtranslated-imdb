Sopranos (1999-2007) <br /> <br /> No 1 - Always on television show <br /> <br /> Everybody thought it was a stupid thing that would not go before the pilot episode. Sopranos became a cultural event, universally agreed on as one of the greatest television shows of all time. <br /> <br /> James Mandolini plays a star cast alongside New Jersey criminal Tony Soprano. Eddie Falcono is as touching as anxious, loving high-middle class mother; Tony Siric√≥ is a superstitious, brilliant consul general, who is often very funny. <br /> <br /> This show has often been criticized as a mafia for Italian-Americans' negative stereotype, and for some it is unacceptable, I can see many poses from the show. Strong family values, friendship, love and compassion; Can these gangsters present a fat television show? Yes In addition, other burning topics such as terrorism, social discrimination and injustice, homosexuality, medicine etc. are discussed. This is not a shallow, uninterrupted show about tough boys and violence. It's too much. We see that most of the issues are most realistic. <br /> <br /> The writing that has been good has inspired the current problems successfully and has led them into the life of character, which makes the whole thing more interesting. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> <br /> <br /> <br />
