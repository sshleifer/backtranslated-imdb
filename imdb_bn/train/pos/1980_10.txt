The end of 60 is one of the great music. I was 7 years old at seeing this movie, and since then it was always loved. Musical numbers are all memorable. Individuals cast in music in the 60's were actually musical geniuses (nominated for a large midwestern city based current music, like a Sartan Academy Award). All the main roles are nicely cast ... Ron Moody shines as Phagin, such as Shane Wallis Nancy. Oliver was very much like Reed Denzer, a Mursing Bill Six (who thanked any music number, lol) and Mark Lester Oliver and Jack Wild. Mark Lester came across like an innocent wife, what was the purpose of Dickens while writing the book! Then there are certainly many dancers who "consider yourself", "I want to do something", "who will buy" and "come back soon", who were children! This is a great show for the whole family.
