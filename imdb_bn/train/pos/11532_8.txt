Well, this was one of the movies I got in this offer, and it was enough for me to record the next time it was shown ... If I like myself, then 80 horror Flickr that spreads you a little bit from the norm ( That is not the second glow of generic signals) but I think you can enjoy it. When the bad guy finally turns into person, he definitely did not have what I expected! After all, I will not go out of your way for this, but if you like the style, but it comes and it lasts one and a half hours for you, I guess. I want to give it 10 out of 10.
