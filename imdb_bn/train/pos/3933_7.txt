The problem of illustrating real life is that performance can be good, but visitors do not believe that the actor does not believe that he is portraying the person. "Young Mr. Lincoln:" Henry Fonda gave an extraordinary performance, but it was difficult to believe that Abraham was portrayed as Lincoln Funda as it was soft-spoken. <br /> <br /> It's basically a courtesy drama with a young Abraham Licoln. I do not know whether it was the true story, but if it does not, why would you use Lincoln as a central character? Do not remember though. In the film, Lincoln is protecting two young men accused of killing. <br /> <br /> There is not really much to this movie, and as a result it seems empty. I wanted to develop more stories and characters. The film is 100 minutes long, but it does not seem like it. There are some small scenes of growing relationships with Lincoln and Mary Todd, but they seem to be worshiping. Acting is good around, but as I said, Funaar acted as a character, but not Ibrahim Lincoln. I do not believe that the real Lincoln was soft-spoken. Indeed, he has a big voice when he needs it, as he instigates extra-judicial publicity for the trial of narcotics, but Fonda lays down Lincoln very humbly. While other performances are strong, especially Alice Brady accused mother, as Abigail Clay She is a wonderful lady who we can truly feel for. Simple and uneducated, yet very sweet; We can know why Lincoln wanted to help him. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be an epic of John Ford, and it probably was during his release. But still, there is not enough material to present it. <br /> <br /> This is a beautiful watch, but not classic.
