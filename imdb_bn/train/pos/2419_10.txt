Along with planes, trains and automobiles and Uncle Buck, this is the most fun movie of John Kandy. When he is mesmerized with playing cards (like Manchurian candidate) and becomes a horny guy, he does not know what he is saying, he has created two very memorable quotes (both treaties with male physiology). Grunge items will be seen in love scenes, it can not be described. <br /> <br />
