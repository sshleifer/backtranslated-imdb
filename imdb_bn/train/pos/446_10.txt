One of my favorite films all the time. Just beautiful, human emotions, intellect, humor, full of intelligence. As the story of life goes up, so is a wonderful movie in many ways. <br /> <br /> Castes are a fantastic choice ... a great selection of the best British titles around. I love them all for each different element brought in the film. <br /> <br /> The romantic places to create stories like this story have to be in Italy - everything works about this image. <br /> <br /> I love it :)
