With the risk of leaning towards the recent philosophy, I first agreed with 'Shawn of the Dead'. Now, I see Simon Pegge as an unknown comedy genius, I understand it's a big demand. And it may be possible how much you agree with the last statement. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Zombie war is over and zombies are becoming better members of the community, better coordination of themselves. This is so, we have been able to know at the beginning, in most cases thanks to the good progress of the good people - a wonderful game in the romantic comedy? <br /> <br /> The beauty of the film is in the making of a place for the soul, and the honorable special dangers, while maintaining the original quality, is based on his dead-pan illustration of a respected neighborhood. The magical and the balance which it does this is quite close enough. Themes that you can expect from more mainstream kitties comedy - through the plight of good cleanliness of adultery, seemingly objection, depressed emotions, fake parent's values, social decorations and the disadvantages of isolated people. <br /> <br /> A story called with a heart full of heart and wide appeal which is definitely brought to life by the tough all-round cast. This is a job where it actually shows that everyone involved has gone out of the part. Billy Connelly wants to learn his script but it is very interesting to imagine ... <br /> <br /> So in conclusion, if your father does not want to feed you, then you would appreciate the humor of this movie.
