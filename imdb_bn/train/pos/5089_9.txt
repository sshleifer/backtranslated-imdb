True, it does not follow the book very closely, but it's still a very entertaining story. Swayze was much better in the role than I expected. And Dudi rejected the "innocent woman from the depths in our desert", which is probably our expected ("Cape Town Cape Town" in Indiana Jones and Dumy's Temple). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's very memorable in the west. The only thing that I care about was all mystics, but I guess it is part of the section and parcel. Like "How do you sink without an African adventure story and without preternaturally wise terrible tribes?" Oh
