Starred: Jim Carey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston I first suspected this movie first time. I mean, what a conceptual nightmare. Jim Carey Playing God? There is nothing else sacred. <br /> <br /> Well, this picture is very rare, but it is not limited to, at least no one is limited. Yes, Jim Carrick has God's power for a while, but he is not God. Confused? Jim Carey plays Bruce Nolan, a journalist who has been able to solve his fate and feel very unsuccessful with life. He lives with Grace (Aniston) with his beautiful girlfriend and you can tell from a bat that you love each other, but the relationship is fairly lazy to the ground. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, it has to be stolen intrinsically by Ivan Baxter. Obviously, Bruce has presented his ideas through television in a way that is ridiculous and it's usable to expel him. Of course, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After a while she got tired of tiredness, so she responds and goes to the Omni's presentation building (Hey). There he meets God (Freeman) who is the boss of the building, the electrician and the janitor. I found this very funny. God boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, clear. Electrician, everything keeps running. Janitor, clean the mess that the person has left the world. Brilliant However, Bruce is really a little suspicious about meeting God, but when God gives Bruce his power and when God shoots him during the game, he begins to believe a little bit. Why surprised Insert power abuse for personal gain and abuse of power. <br /> <br /> From this Hollywood, Bruce has probably become smart, learning his lessons, and using his power for the world's welfare. Finally he cried out to take away God and prayed that he would fulfill his wish, not Bruce. <br /> <br /> This is from Jim Carberry, this film is quite funny, and certainly some pretty entertaining moment in it. The film is not perfect theology, but it is a good effort for Hollywood. Many statements in the film can be quite anxious and even challenging, and I congratulate Tom Shadiac for his efforts in this movie. <br /> <br /> So, from the perfect, of course, it's a funny popcorn movie with a little bit behind. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is 3.5 out of 4 (one view or two price)
