It is very rare to find a well-translated literary work on the screen, which I could give the film a higher rating than its capabilities, but not much. As a long-term student of Vongut's work, I have no hesitation in suggesting the film to the readers at least to those who love them. Welding is inspired: Nolt lost and lost to be defeated and defeated. Sheryl Lee is delightful across the whole, but her handling of traitor Reese and her unfortunate crossroads almost makes you forget her beauty. Alan Arkin is completely loving, but equally traitor, Soviet spy provides. <br /> <br /> You can not read the Mother Nights to appreciate the film; Although, if you do not read Mother Night, you probably want to see the film. <br /> <br /> Returning from color to black-white and go back again, and do not miss Campbell's nose is the ultimate symbol. See also for Kurt Vongut's Camio at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby's "White Christmas" will never hear the same word (I write in the middle of December, when the song gets heavy radio play, and it's driving me a nuts).
