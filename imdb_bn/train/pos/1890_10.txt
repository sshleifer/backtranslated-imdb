This is a movie I've seen many times that I can mostly quote. Some lines in this movie are just unexpected. I especially enjoy watching him fall into a drunken state and go to the part of the fabulous restaurant Drunk and Moose. <br /> <br /> I do not know how many times I saw this sequence, but it's fun time. From the moment Arthur Susan's father's place became odd with the majestra, you mostly laughed quite often. I remember watching Moore with bit out with Moore. It just went right down to just like I'd imagine. They were all so ridiculous that it was difficult for them to film. <br /> <br /> The late Sir John Gilgood was an excellent teacher. His disrespect, his one liners and the way he managed Arthur was all equally colorful. It's always a fun moment when he whacks over the head with his hat or a spoiled little ____ him. Every time I listen to that line of "I'm going to bathe" and smile every time.
