<br /> <br /> Artistic shots, actors portrayed just their role. You get a real feeling of watching the most beautiful girl ascend from poverty to Lucienne. Tragedy is a sense of tragedy win again. After all I saw this image at least 10 times. And I can say very well that Prix de bet (Beauty Award, Miss Europe) is my favorite of collecting silent movies. Louise Brooks's expressiveness is perfect and I appreciate it with a tragic storyline that praises the beauty of this image of any artist.
