The Chamberlain family is camping near Ayers Rock in Australia, when Lindy Chamberlain (Merrill Strip) sees her baby dingo out of her tent and then begins an aggressive start that does not have to be experienced by anyone. It seems that the story of Dinggo is not believed by the public or press and the whole thing becomes circus. Lindy does not help the subject because she does not play in the jury or court room, she is herself, and she is hard working like a despair, so of course everyone thinks that she seems guilty because there is no part of the evidence that the light does not come. Sam Neil is a prominent pastor on the seventh day, like Michael Chamberlain, who doubts his beliefs and possibly his wife. It is good (or worse) to see that like the people, they are also ancestors and foolish as in the state. Because the Australian people do not believe in this story and the media just likes fire. Finally, Lindy was convicted and sent to prison for hard work, but after a few years, a missing evidence proved and he was released, but until family life was largely destroyed. A heart broken story, very well, to see a little long but better value. 10 out 8
