I saw this movie when I was about 8 years old and I liked it, but at the age of 13 I did not see it again that I really understood it; A cartoon about a gifted dog that "realizes the creatures" by using the true heart of gold to use it to talk to its gifted creatures. Dog star, Charlie B. Barkin is murdered by his official business partner, Corfaces, (who is absolutely deviated). His soul then goes somewhere else but the heaven is only the time of his life, which is Charlie's secret but loving cad is finding his golden clock, which he steals and raves, returns him to the world. Once back to Earth, Charlie is seeking revenge on the evil Carface. In this way, he brings only the little orphan that little Ani-Marie, Elon Marie, who can talk to animals designed to hate for his enemies to return to enemy affairs. But Chanel Charlie, young Anne-Marie and his plans come in unreasonably care because Anne-Mary is right "new and good dog casino, now she must be rescued from the terrible carface." I still love this movie at the age of 22. The idea and plot Much different and different from other animated movies. I especially like the idea that dogs are at once For the villain role. He had all the dogs go to heaven Siegel Carface even better than it was. The film, about the role of the villain was quite skeptical.
