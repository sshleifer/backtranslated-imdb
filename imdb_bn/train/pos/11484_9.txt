I'm just back from Montreal's premiere of Zero Day ... and I'm surprised to find negative comments in movies like hell. Basically the blame is that Kosi is doing a simple and exaggerated social message ... Well, Mr.-E-Amivir, it's a simple and extreme critique of movies with a social charge. <br /> <br /> I want to express my life here, but I came from a small town in the same school than these boys. Reject menus and ignorance. Things ... I understand how young kids can do such a terrible thing. High school similarity became the field of battle. This is a real ugly sight. You have to fight your way of being like others. Difficult to explain, some people do not know that high schools are becoming a human intellectual cemetery. Meanwhile, the parents closed their eyes and how their life is perfect in their comfortable suburbs <br /> <br /> The real purpose of the movie is not about running them. It's a quiet suburb of death and everybody close their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere in a perfect city. Cal is well expressed. Call it a wake-up call. The drama is everywhere and it can take shape in every shape. In that case, small plays (such as Andrea's JC Panny shirt, a fagot to wear) are taking the entire city's bad nightmare. Andr√© and Cal take the most extreme way to express their pain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They express their pain, Cal and Andrei told their community about their blindness, refusing to think about the reasons for some work Did it <br /> <br /> It may seem aggressive as a movie, but coach cio is meditating more slowly or enunciating ones. The under and cal is alive ... and a horrible one that can get to other kids. <br /> <br /> Boring movie ... Home made and strong feelings made Ben Kakiso a very annoying movie.
