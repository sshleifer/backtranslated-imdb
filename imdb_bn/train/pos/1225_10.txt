Does anyone know where I can get copies of this picture? I'm looking for a very long way, someone help! In 1997 my girlfriend and I were extra in this long film based film and we did not actually see it. :( <br /> <br /> I was hoping that I could find a copy so I can finally check it and share it with the girls! Can I stop making myself mad? (Also, it does not matter Why I am still in the VHS format but I'm still in the age of ice age.) Please, if you, or anyone knows, please have a copy of this picture, please, I would love to give it a good copy!
