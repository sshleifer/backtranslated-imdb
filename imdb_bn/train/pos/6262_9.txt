It was unbelievable, which meant it was difficult to believe that "forgotten tribe" would make this amazing transfer twice a year, and the filmmaker Cooper and Shoodax did not have some scenes and shots on stage. But what shot they are! Cinematography is bright under most extreme conditions, and the score of Iranian music in video releases gives an extra enrichment to this memorable documentary. <br /> <br /> I was happy to see this and "Konik Tiki". The same weekend, which was a thriller and certainly saw me how difficult and robust and brave people could be, whether in the name of primitive survival or bravery or science.
