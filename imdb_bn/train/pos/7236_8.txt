This film was found in Hollywood, from David Shepherd and Kino before the Fort Lee, NJ, although it is a short version with "behind the scenes" movies. I'm not sure if there is only one movie on Blackhawk movies, these parts are printed, or they edit other scenes. The original Blackhawk version was recalculated in a movie romance. The entire feature is alive, but the print of this version has some nitrate isolation and some sections seem to be bad, so why the blackhuck version may have been edited. <br /> <br /> Directed by Morris Turunu, this movie has played itself in the tournament, or perhaps you are fancy yourself. Recommended, director Emil Choortard and future director Joseph von Sternberg may also be <br /> <br /> Country Las Merry (Doris Kenyon) is tall enough to push his thrilling man to his feet. He dreamed of a sad dream that would make him anxious, but only the only available local boy hindered him, Johnny AppleWill. Meaning, a film company in New York (actually New Jersey) is filming a western film in the countryside. Mary watches an Indian (full helmet) and wakes up an alarm - filming a movie company destroys a scene. She is immediately attracted to film star Kenneth Driscoll (Robert Warwick). She encouraged her to leave the house and try to be an actress in a big city. <br /> <br /> When he comes to the studio, he discovers that everything about the movie is fake. Doors and walls are assembled only for sets of flats. The western walker or the happy walk of the heroine is just acting. The set is at a big rotary stage, so the angle of the sun can also be manipulated. The black attendant at the studio signs all "Star" pictures of Star Star. The signs of the walls are called "Smoking smoking positively," but everyone smokes. Even the title of the movie (which is beautifully illustrated) emphasizes the fraud about the filmmaking life. <br /> <br /> Movies star Diskal, uncensored with hen-hem like making everyday films. She split up a temporary breakthrough from girlfriend Vivian (June Elves) to follow this "sensational" girl. Mary's screen-test has broken her plans during the frustration. We can not see the actual movie, only the audience's tragic reactions. <br /> <br /> Mary is devastating, but she does not want to acknowledge everyone for returning home that she has failed, so she continues to see Driscoll and we have lunch with him at the studio cafeteria, wearing police, soldier, cowboy etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Their pictures "friends" in a party, they agree to marry him but they do not have much love. Surprisingly, her mother appeared with a cake for her birthday, especially on the birthday of Mary. That is why Mary could re-evaluate her future. <br /> <br /> This picture contains all kinds of interesting visuals, movie set, dressing room, editing room etc. in the studio. When the scene is made in a silent film, this movie peeks behind the screen.
