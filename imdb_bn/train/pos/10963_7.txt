Jackie Kennedy's sister and the cousin of this lady, Lee Radijweil, encourages Messel to encourage the issue of "Big Edi" and "Little Eddie". They can of course be considered "skeleton" in the family closet. Additional features of the DVD include contemporary fashion designers who hold some of their ideas on these weird women. I'd like to find someone who designs fashion designs fascinating by this designer. (Like "Are they almonds? Or am I missing something?"). It's hard to come from this movie. Netflix does not have it. Facets, though.
