Although there were some rough spots and some plot lines that were not suitable for the character, it was classic H: LOTS. Characters were created out of Mike Giardelo (Zycararo Esposito) and the reunion scenes of Pembulton (Andr√© Broogar) and Belize (Kyle Sicker) were deep and well-played, like a deep screen grace. <Br> <br /> "Homeside: The Movie" Ur "Life Againning" is a fan flick, but it stands like a two-hour episode of the series itself. Fontana, Overmier, and Eshimura did a great job with dragging the edges away from the 7 seasons and with each major cast member of "Best Show on Television", NBC never stopped giving it to the end of the series. The form "Homidis" is true, there is no happy ending, such as life. This show is always set on television except on the left-hand cookie-master cop shoe. To create something on the series episode and to challenge television viewers and producers alike, the film is grateful to the writer and cast. <br /> <br /> ** Because I'm more than a coworker in my fellow colleagues to call myself "Homicide Maniac" for someone else. **
