All versions of the Odyssey (or a Greek mythology for that matter), in my opinion, the best of them all. The main storyline is true - some minor deviations and money, in the absence of Skila & Charybdis with the exception and the fact that Eumaeus pig admits Odyssey in the disguise of her hut - realistic acting and authentic scenery and costumes This is a truly memorable masterpiece, not some Hollywoodish sword-and-moon B. Contribute to the stove. Despite the fact that dialogue and subtitles are familiar, if one is fully acquainted with Italian, he is still going to head and what to do in the pimples and what the actor (saying you can have a good handy text in the Odyssey). At least I did, and much more so that it inspired me to appreciate more movies to study the Italian language.
