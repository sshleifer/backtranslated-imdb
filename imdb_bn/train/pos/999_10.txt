How amazing is this film, and in IMDB, in the average movie of 7 to 10 stars, the fantasy films (and others average 5 and fewer than others) have hit the fanbase mentality again. Former girlfriend mentioned this movie as suspicious. After a few years I was watching this movie and I enjoyed myself. Even it was pretty ridiculous. This and The Replacement Killers are such movies that people label Antin Fuq as Black Michael Bay. I do not see that much of the Fuqar movie is much smarter than with Michael Bay. At a rate <br /> <br /> Used by a Nonsense Treasury agent, Adger (David Morse) to catch a murderer named Bristol (Doug Hutchinson), a former criminal, Alvin Sanders (Jamie Fox). Each of Alvin's steps is tracked by the bug stuck in his jaw after the accident. Although these agents are brilliant after Bristol, Bristol's gold brick is a horrible that after a heist is taken <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Alvin is a fast-speaker that he is far smarter than he Doug Hutchinson is right as Bristol. He may sometimes be leading in his John Malkovitchesque demeanor. He was better than the Looney Bin Jim in Punisher: The Battle Region David Morse is a strong authentic Treasury agent as well. Michael Epso, like Alan's brother Stevey, is fun Both him and Jamie had some funny moments on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only error in the movie is the flatness of the thriller. The horse race track scene above but I can not see. The director went there all so he gets that point. Besides, the bomb scene with a Treasury agent was tied in a chair, when the explosive was standing at the door was beautiful. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its not annoying, it's always fun and I have not been checking my watch every minute. That should be calculated for anything. One of the most underground movies in the 2000's Bay PS: Critics who claim that this film is very violent ... how long have you been living under a rock? I'm sure you watched every movie by Die Hard Series and Quentin Tarantino. But those movies are not violent? Absentee
