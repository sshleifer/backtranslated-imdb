In 1979, when I was 12, I was a boy, my parents had just got our home box office, which was quite beautiful around us. As a 12-year-old boy, I saw the first time on television. I will never forget the joy of that time. The makin's love was fairly new in racing vans, rough vans, water beds, smoking fires, warm 70 kids, in my Chavie van music. An entire movie with all of the memories you could remember. I own it and enjoy it almost once a year. When I see this movie, it wants me to get my skates, with four wheels, not a wide line, go to the park and birds find some kids with hair. Very young adolescent great memories!
