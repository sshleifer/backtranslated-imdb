Because people want to tell me the name of the horror movie that I saw, I always answered "black noon" and no one has ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> I saw it alone almost 30 years ago. 13 years old when my parents left the evening. As far as I know it is only shown once in the UK and sadly unavailable in DVD or VHS. <br /> <br /> If someone can trace a copy please let me know. <br /> <br /> If I have seen it again, it may be a big disappointment, but it is stuck in my memory as a particularly annoying little movie!
