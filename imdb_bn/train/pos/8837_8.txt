My personal feeling is that you can not break the film from the political / historical underpinnings of many (American) critics. It's not getting bigger in the main street in the United States. When it was broken in East and West in Eugoslavia, it was growing. Just as Esther and the others have burst among others, and Esther broke up between "Tarrish Joe" and the boy. In the particular circumstances, the audience is lost that has never lived under Tito. I think the film is poor and it is very bad that we lost the director. Like this, movie freedom seems more important. This is not just "the upcoming movie of another Eastern European era" ... it's a fine line walking sensual illustration of kids that eventually can lead to their true independence.
