If you need promotional films for appointment at the Australian Post Office, this is the case. This is one of the movies, whose heart is in the right place and you can see it again and again. Miranda's performance is touching because it shows the views of the undefined Australian by many Europeans, so that it can be cold, wet and silent somewhere, just like anyone else, and somewhere else that is important to others around you. The characters of the film are warm and welcoming and make the concept of career a 'dead letter office' concept. Miranda has gone to the big movie, but I hope she will always keep such thinking?
