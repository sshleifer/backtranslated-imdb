All right, so today's values ​​of Robi seem to be a little bit, and some of the performances are pretty, and most of the special effects can now be duplicated by a bright 12-year-old kids with a beautiful computer editing program. And do not start my poster. <br /> <br /> It's a great film after 40 years of release. Local Television's "Science Fiction / Adventure Theater" on Sunday afternoon I grew up with "science fiction", so I saw several SF movies in the 50's. At the time when most of the movies were torn to rub a rubber suit on someone and were destroying a small model of the city, the Forbidden Planet repeatedly raised and showed that it was possible to create a science fiction film that was actually a plot. <br /> <br /> I suspect that many SF films produced in the 90's will still be considered observers in 2030.
