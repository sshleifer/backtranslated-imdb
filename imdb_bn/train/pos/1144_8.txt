In 1955, the British created a comedy named Simon and Laura with Peter Finch and Uzzal K Kendal. Today, this is the best example of British comedies and television sitcoms become so popular, especially. It was, and this is a wonderful example of self-referential film. <br /> <br /> So Sopdesh, a movie that I had never heard of a few hours ago when I was caught on late TV. I was very doubtful because comedy has done very well, as you know. <br /> <br /> However, I was delighted and delighted to see very shy mocking about American TV during the day. Actually, I've been a bit lazy for a while. So, if you like the mock, I'll suggest you see it. <br /> <br /> main actor ?? Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Robert Doni and Kathy Marriette ?? Do quite simply do a great job, acting how evil and shallow only express. As I saw, I was thinking of myself: what real life does this anxiety? Is that, if the actor ever has a real life? As you probably know, Peter Sellars, for example, was notorious for hiding his true personality behind a group of characters, so that nobody really knew the real person. So, when I played Tablet in Celeste to play the Celeste Field Maggi, then again I thought again about that former British film, who plays a character in a TV sitcom opposite Laura Potter Finch with Kandle. <br /> <br /> Some actors Wondering to have nervous breakdowns? And when Celeste finally encounters her daughter (played by Laurie, Elizabeth Shu), and that feeling became fantastic, and in a mental moment, she repeated the fictional lines used in her previous era of Soap, when she met her fictional daughter . That show! Are you confused? Well, this is not all that, but the dialogue is originality, humor, animosity, anger, distortion, duality, and even stunning for love. <br /> <br /> the story? Well, there are many stories in this movie, all have come together, and which finally come together (of course, but not like Robert Almanman, all right!), And finally all of them are not resolved. Life is not like, okay? The speed is almost frenetic, and you will really see and hear all the sight gags and delicate jokes catch up. Spend 97 minutes of your life and see it; You do not regret using the time. <br /> <br /> All the Castes work well, though I have never received much in Hypie Goldberg. Perhaps interesting exchange robbed between Robert Doney and Kathy Moriartia and for my money, after stealing many scenes from others, he gets my vote as an extraordinary player. I do not kid you, she gives a completely new face bitch ...
