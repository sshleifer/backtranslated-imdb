It was a nice movie, I liked it. I thought it's a pretty fine look at Balimia and how it is not about diet, it is so much pain that it has to find ways to deal with them and they like it. Beth is a very accurately pictured character and the scene where he faces his mother about the mother's disorder, you can see the pain inside her and hear it in her voice and you know how deep the pain is. I think one of the best lines in the movie is where Beth says these words, "This is not about you." To her mother. Those words were so true and so much of the movie was added to that scene. I think that the scene was definitely the most important scene in that movie.
