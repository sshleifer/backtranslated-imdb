The title of the title 'Second Beginning' shows us the beginning of mankind's end. Set before the existence of the matrix, Wichoski's writing in this short anime shows us the world that does not keep it away in the 21st century, the second revision drops into common problems with human behavior. ; Greed, strength, control, vanity etc. <br /> <br /> In science / fiction stories, robots or artificial pure uses like slaves or slaves are common. This concept of the second revival is no exception, but instead of a common man vs machine layout, this story explains the struggle of human conflict with the people-led struggle. Where Matrix films show our human perspective, this short animation will tell both sides of the story. <br /> <br /> The second revival part answers the many questions raised by the original matrix film, 1 + 2, as the war broke out, how the sky became black, what was used as a human battery and it brought us a city called 01 Comes, which can be relevant to the upcoming matrix revolutions film. <br /> <br /> I will not go too far from the point of view, because I do not want to break the viewer's viewers experience, but I would recommend it to someone interested in the Matrix world or anyone interested in Japanese animation (ANIME). <br /> <br /> 9/10.
