It was a very good historical drama. John Tarturo illustrates the tortuous talent Luizin as excellent and brilliantly his curious dance's character's emotional impact. Emily Watson sensitized lover Natalia as the role of her support is fine. <br /> <br /> The relationship between chess and the closest crazy is well-searched by Gerris and the familiar 'National Innocence' (such as 'Lolita' is clear in this film) I think now the novel will be read. It's a sensitive and tragic end And it was hard to keep a dry eyes. Bright movie!
