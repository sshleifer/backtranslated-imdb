China O'Brien (1990) USA tried to make Cynthia Rothrak a star. This was helmed by veteran director Robert Claus, Director of Golden Heritage Production. Sadly, he was lucky with The Enter Dragon, or he lost his touch because he was not a director. The only reason to watch this movie is the fighting skills of Mrs. Rothrak and Richard Norton. If this movie is directed by Corey Euney or Hoi Men, then this action can be classic rather than a Chess Straight-to-Video Action Flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is having trouble with the local crowd and she needs her help. So he returned home and restored the order (with the help of two improbable people). But will they be enough to remove Mr Big and his bad chances? <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Cynthia Rathrok, this movie will be made for you. I just enjoyed the war scene, everything else is garbage. Why did Raymond Chaw not exceed a few shells and was the director of the top step? <br /> <br /> Recommended.
