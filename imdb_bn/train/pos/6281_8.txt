Blur and HD DVDs were able to watch several movies. This movie has its wonderful actions and great stories. You are looking for a movie with an excellent picture but this is not one of these. The movie did not help making the movie easier to purchase. I always enjoyed intense action and excellent performance which is not always together. Overall that makes a nice fun film to see. Now on the blue ray scale. In many Blu-Ray movies you get two things. Clear a crystal with a movie with a picture that is almost no distortion or grainy HD pictures. I was frustrated when I made my first Blu-Ray movie. I almost started to think this was the value of Blue Ray. Though after watching other movies I know well. I do not believe they spent as much time as they should be transferred to HD in this movie. That's usually a problem with some movies. And you should have only the best picture for the price of Blu-ray players and Blu-ray discs. So I do not just look at this movie or buy a DVD version, it's a worthwhile investment for people.
