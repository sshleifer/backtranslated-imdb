I wonder if there was a feeling of magic in older slovene movies ... Well, I was wondering if that feeling was only in Nostalgia. Or that "feeling" decided to pack his bag and say "goodbye" somewhere in the middle of the history of our movie, and then return? Or did you do it? Because for me, for the first time I have seen "Express, Express". And it was again old spirit. <br /> <br /> This movie has three qualities which it is a bit unique and enjoy watching it - smooth flow of the story, color warmth and, which I have appreciated most - lack of excessive use of oral communication (some other (not just) Slovenian screenwriters should be considered at least). There is no use for words, when you understand each other in other ways (yes, or better). Just look at Bakovic and Sierra. Oh. So, just a lot of words, regardless of why I heard about Slovenian, you must recommend "Express, Express" for all movies (if you've ever heard anything ...). <br /> <br /> Oh, that scene, where Bokovic dances in Vivaldi's music ... a treat. <br /> <br />> Treat yourself See it
