Shakespeare said, we were kept in a great stage of the actor. But when this stage is Israel, the work we interpret is quality for ten and we work hard to do whatever we do. Dan Katzir managed to make a spectacular portrait of a part of life in Tel Aviv, but in addition, Katzir managed to enter into the heart of the Israeli people and this man, far from the prominent figures, they talk to us from the heart. Katzir's film permits Israel to leave where they escape from dark informative crooks, and this wonderful country is revealed as a gorgeous bird that is born of its sugarcane in light of light. This is very great for me because the reality of the state of Israel, which the Europeans know only for informational diary or newspaper, is a perfect and absolute human reality, the reality of millions of people who search for her place, searching the whole state, the sole goal of the entire culture to realize its part . Katzir constitutes an absolutely wonderful documentary and when he shows that a person with passion is projected with deepest feelings force, and this feeling crosses our hearts. Thank you for opening our eyes and giving us the most beautiful portrait of the most wonderful country in the world.
