Though any home in the country is recognized as the best film treatment for the problems of being (or bought) in your specifications, it is not the first and last. Jack Beni and Anne Sheridan George S. in 1940. Kauffman and Moss lead the heart of the comedy George Washington Slate. And about fifteen years ago, Shelley Long and Tom Hanks were headed for finance. The former 18th century country was going to the house ... wrong, work was needed. Later, in the late 1980's - your dream house was about to be built. Although there are moments in both the pictures, both are not as good as balanding, which was based on an autobiographical novel of the same name. <br /> <br /> Jim Blandings and his wife Murrayel (Keri Grant and Mirna Loy) see the tight corners of their apartments, which they share with their two daughters Joan and Bitscr (Sharon Muffett and Connie Marshall). While earning well as Spanish Executive (he earns $ 15,000.00 per year in 1948, which is $ 90,000.00 today), and lives in a luxurious apartment - the day he rents in New York City! - He thinks they will ask for something better. He and Muriel took a drive in the country (Connecticut) and soon discovered an old ruins which can be modified to both the imagination like that dream house. <br /> <br /> and they both fall into the financial worm. May be buying land and construction. One thing, they are so ungroup that they fail to take caution after careful observation of the idea of ​​building such a house, if the molecular friend and lawyer Bill Cole (Melvin Douglas, an excellent simple role). For example, Jim bought land from a Connector dealer (Yan Wolf, quietly sucking his chop) before double checking the exact cost for a Connecticut land area. The bill mentions that he paid more than five thousand six thousand dollars for the land. There is a problem with the supply of water, both of which never think of bloodshed, such as hard and soft water - that leads to Jeis-Jeis Water Softening Machine. They think that the designers have their mind and have worked with their architect (Reginald Dione), the moment's decision can not be cheaply dropped at a moment, for which no one plans. <br /> <br /> The extended cost of the project is Jim's tragic subject. He was appointed to manage the "Ham" account ("Spam" became the popular result of World War II, so that the public began using it as an alternative to meat in light of its success with the Armed Forces). Jim can not achieve such a firmness (he is not alone - one or two other officers ruined him before). He is "poem" (?): <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> This little piggy went to the market, <br /> <br /> She is beautiful like pink and ham. <Br <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She said, <br /> <br /> James tried to look at the mural in the bill, <br /> <br /> < > <br /> Jim is more involved in suspicion. Bill defective But he is always in the neighborhood (Jim forgets that the bill is clearly untitled and he made Jim and Muriel a lot wrong). Three of the accidents have occurred, when they are locked in a house in a half-built house, just as men leave for the day. They can not open the door, and Jim (in a panic) tries to break the door by battering a make-shift batter. He broke a window, and opened the door itself. <br /> <br /> The film works quite satisfactorily, all the actors apparently enjoy themselves. This is a movie (despite the level of price and salary level) is not entirely old. Finally, most Americans dream of owning their own homeowners and always have them. <br /> <br /> A couple of years ago, a paint company used to have a colorful view of company with Marna Loy and Emery Parnell.
