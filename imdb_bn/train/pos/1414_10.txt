First, the date of liberation war is not for documentary documentary of this feature of 2009, 2007. It should be more accurately said: "Earth, 2009". Secondly, allow some critics of the 2006 "Planet Earth" TV series to report the allegations. <br /> <br /> I did not see this TV series, but here we learned that this film is full length length version of this 2006 TV series. I judge a film, its own merit, not by its source. I judge the results, myself, and the results of "Earth, 2009" are really nice. I dismissed this small complaint to some critics: it is only an extended version of the 2006 TV series "Planet Earth". So what? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> This was the first film of Disney's new "Designer" category, and documentary documentaries of the 1950s and 1960s movie theaters of Walt Disney's pioneers and academy awards. Follow in the background. <br /> <br /> Movie editing, movie editing, music score, sound and description are all excellent. There are several types of documentaries that are also excellent in these categories. Really set the "Earth, 200 9" its' scope. It literally covers the entire planet, covering all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first viewing, there was a great effort and preparation of time and talent for this document. <br /> <br /> Three production companies will have to create this amazing documentary film. <br /> <br /> "Earth, 2009" combines four species of stories with stories of their great migration, starting in January and ending in December from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </ p> This filming technique really adds drama and beauty to some scenes of "Earth, 2009", especially the cheetah cheeses and great white sharks, to catch the sea lions, and to get to the edge of the world's highest waterfall, an aerial view. This documentary has many beautiful shots. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, music score and description, this document contains drama, sadness, humor and great looks. With a great music score of Philharmoniker, Berlin, the world's best known creative and technical painter and James Earl Jones, I consider "Earth, 2009" as the longest documentary feature of the world's greatest nature. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication really are very good here. This picture is needed to be seen in all schools around the world. I am predicting Academy Award for the best documentary feature among other awards. Really, a wonderful, wonderful, delightful and great documentary film. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended
