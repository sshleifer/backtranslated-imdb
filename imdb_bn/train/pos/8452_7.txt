Over-operated mobile cases that could destroy the entire army - check it! Surgery should be rarely noticed and still must destroy everything - check it! Mobile lawsuits based on angels - check! <br /> <br /> Okay - this is a hooligan series. These, gang wings, good character development, real-world complexity, interesting ideas and some beautiful eye candies. <br /> <br /> Initially weaker Rena Dahlan (later Piscraft, later returning to Dourlan) with characters is strong and more independent (though still completely descended with Hero's series main character). The previously mentioned heroes, primarily a cold, tough butcherer, become more and more people, yet the rest of the characters. And looking at the lost Melondo Peacecraft (Hos Nom de Guer Jeses Marquez), floating between Oz, Freelance, and White Fung's commands shows how some people might lose themselves in their own creations. <br /> <br /> The political and military situation is also quite good - reflecting on how the real world works. However, it has become a responsibility of 49 half-hour episodes that this complexity is not used for its full potential. <br /> <br /> The essence of the series - the necessity of war, peace, and so on - today, which are frustrating. On the background, the series was ahead of its time, "war of terrorism" and all that was. But the search of these ideas, psychologists, especially the trousers, is an incredible dramatic piece, writing some of the best writings in the series. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, sometimes good writing is sometimes bad, which can dramatically lose some of its ends. <br /> <br /> It is in the bucket loads in the eyes of the eye-candy, everything is mobile with war criminals Libra (not the tampon) you are stupid!) Well designed, orange large big ball burst (which is bad, because good animation good explosion Have). But who? Staff blast, and that's all important. <br /> <br /> Short, though complex complexity in the series means that if you missed a few episodes, you missed a lot. Poor writing can leave you cringing, and sometimes the animations give you "WTF? !!" Makes it! But it has been created for its classic animation style, its scale, sparks of incredible dialogue, and for its more mature search, such as the Japanese animation it hopes for.
