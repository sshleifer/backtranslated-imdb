I will not hesitate to doubt this adaptation of "Death Trap" on the top 5 list of best stage-to-movie adaptations. Kine and Reeves (an underlying actor, who never sogi romance and "Superman") play well with each other. Even Diane Canon - I usually do not take care of anything - even if the actress uses her boring quality as a role to be cast completely. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of "Death" with "Slath" - another great stage-to-screen adaptation featuring Michael Kine - legitimate, or even fair. Yes, two stories are very common. However, as much as "Sleuth", the battlefield of the class as the battle for victory, and the house of "Sleet", as the two actors of at least one character in the film - the house is not exactly equivalent to "Deathtrap". And "DeathTrop" is not a fight of so much war on how people can not be accused of any good (and they do not seem as smart as they are) and it's a particular point about it. All they deserve is that I just say that both films are fantastic For example and your time and money are valuable, this America, after all, you do not have to choose! <br /> <br /> I will have to give away the twists and turns of the plot , But I think it does not matter. I have watched the DVD eight or nine times for a dozen years, and still chemistry and time and money, the horror moments were enjoyed when things went "the size of all the animals". <Br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
