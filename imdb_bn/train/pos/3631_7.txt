The film is a fairly good story, but it is frustrating at a number of important places. The director has thrown the film together without taking any time to cut the film. Dennis Kayad has performed fairly well in his role ... but there are definitely some missing in some scenes. <br /> <br /> This 25-hour film can be reduced to about 2 hours. And perhaps it was a great movie, if it does not seem to have got together. <br /> <br />
