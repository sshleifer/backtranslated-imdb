Bette Davis is acting quietly like Melredrade Rogers in the 1934 film. The film seems to have changed in 2003. There is no doubt about the film's buff and bate devis fans, but there is no greater appeal for today's average film viewers. Mrs. Davis looked at this step to see how it was surprising for me. Actors are essentially the words which turn on the performance and the story is meaningful and interesting. Leslie Howard Club-Padmatic Medical Student Philip Keri has performed well. This is a strong message through which we like to love and why. However, "human bonding" does not seem to have a strong impact on my emotional or psychological. After watching it I felt a little indifferent and isolated about the movie. I have an insight that this reaction might be going for that director. You judge <br /> <br />
