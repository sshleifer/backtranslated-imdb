A compelling and heartwarming story by how French brothers Zeus and Gideon Nudad, and Robert De Niro and described by the fire selector James Hannal, is one of the wonders of this dark day in New York. I first saw the 12-year-old young man, and at that age it touched me. To know how the whole effect of 9/11 was being looked at at 9/11 We found the heroes, how they were living there and how they kept their lives in a position where most people would protect themselves and protect themselves. These brave men keep their lives in line and seeing my appreciation for them just increases. If you can see, this is the best documentary I've ever seen personally.
