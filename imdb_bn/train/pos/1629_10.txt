This movie is so cheap, it is respectful !!! Ron Lieberman (Major Von) has provided the most entertaining on-screen directory in the history of the film. I have two copies of this video in the video ... On one hand, Ralph McQuee was caught in cracking in the background of Major Wagon at the time of the "hash" in fact. Obviously they forgot to remove this mistake from the film, but it shows how funny the movie is when the actors can not keep themselves straight!
