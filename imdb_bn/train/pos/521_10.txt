This is probably one of the main love stories that can be seen for ages, especially for war based (short) movies. Basically, it is a story based on two worlds, which is probably a real, other fantasy but the filmmakers initially say that it is only a real event if the coincidence. However, Peter Carter (The David Nivene) was going to crash in a flat area, he spoke before talking about June (Apollo Kim Hunter's Planet) and said that he loved her. He was aiming to die from jumping without a parachute, but in any way he survived, and now he is loving and loving in June. This other place, like Heaven, was dissatisfied because he had survived and was supposed to be in the world, so he sent the French conductor 71 (Marius Gering) to persuade him, but he was probably in love. Peter advised him that he should appeal to keep his life in another world court, he was given this. Clearly love when two lovers declare that they will die for each other, offer even its place in June! Robert Cott also played Bob Troubes, Kathleen Byron as An Angel, a short (then known) Lord Sir Richard Attenborough, an English pilot and as a judge / surgeon, called Abraham Sophara.
