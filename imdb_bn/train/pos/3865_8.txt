The "Story of the Century" was a half-hour series and the first run syndication appeared in the '54 -5555 television season. It was the first Western TV series to win Emmy Award. Western actor Jim Davis is referred to as Railroad Detector Matt Clarke, the series set Clarke and his fellow railroad intelligence partner (between the mid-1860s and mid-1860s, between the mid-1860s, between Marie Castle, Frankie Adams and Seventh Miller's second half, for the first half of the season) Outline The series was very pleased, easy to see and fairly realistic due to Jim Davies's straightforward appeal to the limited role. She feels like a real western character. One other note. When Matt Clarke came to the city after a long journey, he found that he was riding on a long horse, because he would cover the dust. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
