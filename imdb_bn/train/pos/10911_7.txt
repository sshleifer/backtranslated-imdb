This 1936 film is a series of well-known classic actors, and especially William Powell, (Dr. Lawrence Bradford), "Mr. Roberts", who played a doctor and a detective. Dr. Bradford once married Gin Arthur, (Pala Bradford), "Shane" and got a divorce, and still they were able to live with each other and were able to fight always. Palla wanted to investigate her husband's suicide and he can do whatever he can, it is very important. Gene Arthur plays a soft type, and a lot of comedy and murder in 1936 is something that you would never believe, especially with a jockey in California's race track. Robert Armstrong, (Nick Martel) "King Kong" James Gleason, who is a detective, to solve the mystery of this ghastly murder. If you watch this movie, remember that it was produced and directed in 1936, and in those days people thought it was great entertainment and it was really those days!
