It is one of the unfortunate films that suffered more tragic, unfortunate deaths at the box office. I saw this movie as a revival in local art film, shortly after it was shot in mainstream movies. It is certainly second time (or even a third) communicationable. Sandra B. The spoken word and this piece took some of the well-known songs to the limit (Han William's 'I So So Lonsome I Can Cree', his version of this can easily be moved to tears). Maybe someday, viewers will be ready to take this picture even more seriously (but not without any good smile). The film moves quickly (thanks for some great editing), so that some viewers will not find it old and annoying. Perhaps a resuscitation pipeline down.
