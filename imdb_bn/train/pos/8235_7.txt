Who can not convert the useful members of the Jumbo community? Certainly not the makers of "Fido", who never came to landless editions for the 1950s, where the growing land of the motherland has become the backlords and slaves. Timmy Robinson is a all-American boy who has been associated with the family's new full-time domestic - modernly resurrected Zambia, whom Timmy has tenderly dived into a fido. All this has been made possible by Zomcom, a large brother-type organization, which has found ways to manage and convict zombies (who were originally brought to life by radiation from outer space) - at least most <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This twisted, modern day spin in the TV series "Lascie" - it can easily be titled "A Boy and His Zombie" - such as the absurd mockery of pre-60's concerns As a result of extraordinary social harm (meaning here - means meaning of being a zombie girlfriend more than forced force), suburban life ruthlessness, corporate control of civil issues, small city corruption and nuclear family values ​​- all played party colored houses and immaculately manicured lawn Out of a beautifully designed setting. The movie does not hit the audience with its message and laughs laughing Instead, it is a low-key, subtle satire, which enjoys grateful chocolates instead of full-bodied gaff. Most humor arises from the inconsistency between the stability of the setting and the caviar's attitude towards the death shown by prominent citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been temporarily replaced with the Death Magazine). Despite some dramatic graphic violence, the film has a realistic view of the spirit of civilization, which we usually associate with the horror films of the 1950s and Chess, low budget which was part of the pop culture scene of those decades. <Br /> <br /> K'sune Ray, Kerry-En Moss and Dylan Becker are spacious and impressive and appealing and attractive as Timmy and her cleaver-esquiera parents (as a little frightening colleague), when Billy Connolly performs remarkably impossible The role of a revived body has been completed, bringing a great deal of humanity and depth. <br /> <br /> What could be this "Lassie" is that Timmy's best friend has been violent rabies.
