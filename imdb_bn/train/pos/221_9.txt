I think the movie was originally seen at Radio City Music Hall. I did not understand the humor again, but this movie can make me laugh loudly. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathu also qualified for the Oscars for this photo with due respect to George Barnes (rifle). Her performance is amazing - given that she is 20 years old than her character, Willy Clark. His behavior is the first rate. ("You know what kind of song she wrote?" And talking face-to-face with a Spanish-speaking person: "No! No! Enchilada !!") It's absolutely sunny! <br /> <br /> Richard Benjamin's codos, who played directly in Matthawat. <br /> <br /> I want this DVD, because my VHS recording is getting a little more. <br /> <br /> I did not want to see a remix with Woody Allen, because it does not match the original in any way.
