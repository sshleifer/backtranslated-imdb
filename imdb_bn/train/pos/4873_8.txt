Castroica explores her film occasionally, which is not aware of the theme - Western invasions in traditional Serbian values ​​- it is impossible for you to understand its descriptions. The series theme, fantasy and illogical jokes in his car, published by Castro, was elected to answer. From his excellent work and Magnum Opus 'Underground', Castro's films 'Black Cat White Cat', 'Life Is Myself' and 'Promise Me This' with his Snapstick, Carnivalist style 'Westakaran' of Balkan culture, his ambivalent in traditional disguise Arrival and attack. In the case of 'my commitment', the city (urban space) and villages (traditional idiom) are inverted to the opposite world. The city has been ensconced in local and temporary setting which reflects the western characteristics of the world; Organized crime, sexual exploitation, breaking ideas of identification and ignoring respect for traditional values ​​- such as young children - have been exposed to villagers. The end of the film gives an example of this idea as we perform a funeral and wedding ceremony in the one-step dust street. They are a clash of fat; The appropriate creator, which represents the village Lifeline and Puls, such as traditional values, remembers the example of the death of heritage in this context, the funeral is in conflict with the bereavement. Yet Kusturica brightly examines this theme through its own unique, stylistic singularity. With her portrayal of her abusive and flamboyant style serve as a car.
