I really liked the first 2 seasons. Because good characters disappear after a lot. Most of the events are slow at early but better in the following seasons, but it is completely opposite. Jenny from the first season and Valerie Sabrina's friends in the second season, I really did not care for others, Jenny and Valerie were her best friends. I think for some reason, the producers did not want us to like their college friends for some reason, they were so cruel in Sabrina. But my favorite episode of season 1 is Cats Shodown and My Favorite Episode of Season 2 Witch Trash, this is the most fun episode. I also felt how popular Libi was funny but she was always jealous and she was never really a lover but always wanted to stay with Harvey. I just wish they could create more good ones. I like the first 2 seasons, at the beginning of the first time, Sabrina used to say a few things while dressing up, in the pilot episode where she was dressed like a witch, I like that she said, "It's not me" and then she is trying to change herself in something else, Which I think, but it's really a great show. It's great like Andy Griffith Shoah because it's good at first but it was even better once Color and Barney Fight left. But I still like to see it, but the only reason to watch the season is Sabrina. What I mean about the opening sequence is: The first title of the 1-3 season introduces Sabrina in front of various mirrors and documents, such as cast members' names quickly flash below the screen. Eventually, Sabrina said that she had any kind of punishment related to the outfit she was wearing, then disappeared. Season four contains the letters in the opening bubble in the opening order. Season 5-7 inauguration credit features Sabrina at different locations near Boston
