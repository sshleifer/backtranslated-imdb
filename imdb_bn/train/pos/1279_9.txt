This movie is a fun and completely satirical scene of pop culture and its producers. I was impressed by photography with bright colors and spin doctor settings, especially when you think it's the first big scale attempt of Jokovich. <br /> <br /> One caution, do not take the movie's message seriously. It's not for mass spending (and that's not a compliment). The message is a somewhat stylish post-college, a social perspective. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed licking the original plot line of a fictional genre, verbally whipping the democracy of the 90's.
