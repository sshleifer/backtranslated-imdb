It is an entertaining look of the Gospel presented to Johnny Cash (of course, black in color) who sings and singles a bit. If you like Jonny Cash, this movie is quite enjoyable. Also note this in the golden color of Jesus' description ... Just to have fun, try to remember five Jewish men who have hairstyles ...? However, this is a fun representation of the greatest and most important stories.
