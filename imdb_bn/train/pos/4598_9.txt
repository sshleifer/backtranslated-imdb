It is one of Jackie's best movies, one of the best opening of any of these films, including Open Friends Samo Hong and Euene Biao. This is seen as the only critic with Jackie showing some high quality stunts. It gets a bit slow in the middle but it shows for a great 25 minutes in the movie and the last credit shows that the crazy fool Jakey Chan just keeps us happy for the film's adulterers.
