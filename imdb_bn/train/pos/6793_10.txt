I absolutely love this game of death. As I was 9 years old (now I'm 15). It's great graphics, characters, magic, weapons, additions, and ultimately do not forget the form of awesome Dragon! I'm still waiting for a rebuild, prequel, or a sequel of these wonderful video games. <br /> <br /> You play as a darts, a young sword who is likely to be enough heroes. In this adventure you encounter wonderful creatures and boss fights. You encounter some friends in the way those who have their own special material. Such as fire, darkness, water / ice, thunder / lightning, earth, light and air. There are items known as Dragon Spirit, which allows you to transform into legendary magic creatures. Dragons, wizards, animals are called wingles and evil creatures that you face in the face of action-packed thrills and excitement. My favorite games, The Legend of Dragon!
