Three sergeants of British Army in India were sent to stop the mutiny of a group of murderers known as Thugis. One of the sergeants, Katter, moved away from the camp in search of the golden temple and was captured by the Thugis operated by the heavy guru. Ganga Dina, son of the regiment's water, went back to the camp for help, and the other two sergeants went behind him, but they were detained. Now the main three later sends a detailed description, but they do not realize they are walking in a trap set by the Thugees. Although the Ganges Day saved that day. Excellently friendly film, although it is a politically wrong today. Grant, McLaggellen and Fairbanks have performed very well and thriller with saffron and are very good in the title role and as serious as Cynelli Guru. Ratings- 10 out of 10
