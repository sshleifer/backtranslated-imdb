It could be a 10 if it is not for a predictable and Hollywood-Isaite scene. Daniel Day-Lewis confirmed his position as one of the leading actors of our times (why I can not say the leading) and the rest of the cast stood at a very high level. I was personally impressed with Hugh and Connor, who played Christie Brown as a child. I was really strong to see him in the very first scene. How nice.
