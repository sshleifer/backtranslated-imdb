The film was a fairly entertaining comedy about the implementation of Marifir's law for land ownership and construction. If a movie like this is being made today, then there is no doubt that the family will be effective. Since it was set in 'simple' Forties, we are considered to be an ideal family of the era. Of course, Grant completely combines comedic and dramatic elements and he works more than capable of being able to highlight by the fusion and Douglas. Their shenanigans made for a firm ninety minutes entertainment, 7/10.
