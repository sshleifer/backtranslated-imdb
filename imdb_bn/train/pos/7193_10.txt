God! There were many actors like Zarro Tarzan, and perhaps many actors in the title role. <br /> <br /> This serial is one of my own personal favorites, and as mentioned earlier, it is one of the top 5 soundtracks. Surprisingly enough, it is a production that came out in the year 1939 in that watery year. * At the time of this 39's production, Zoro was actually known as a (Pulp) literature and film character. Mexico opens with Spain a little footnote about the history of Mexico's struggle for independence from the European Empire rule. The story calls for comparison with the American revolutionary war. <br /> <br /> This story focuses on San Mendellito's mythological province and its 'council'. It is being mentioned by Benito Juarez ** on their relationship with gold mining with the new Republic of Mexico. The golden vessels will travel through Mexico City. <br /> <br /> From Dan Francisco Uncle, Diego Vega said that he organized a patriotic organization to work as a security force for the golden coal. Don dell Aro crowd, 'insulting' himself and pushing Dawson Francisco into a fight with the sword, goes to Don Frascasco. <br /> <br /> A sudden masked masked sword comes in a sword and carries a trademark. Jaya faces a bad man, and he sent him the next day. Don Francisco His Ward Ramon (William Corson) announced his breathing with the death of his nephew in Los Angeles City. He also tried to talk about the true identity of Don del Oro, but the term expired before completing the statement. <br /> <br /> There is a great reception for Diageo in Dances Francisco Hassidas, where Diageo Ramniesaar has frustrated (also its ward, Don Francisco) with his awesome laws. "A FOP !!", he announced. Afterwards, Diego and Raman left the slip to join a meeting of volunteers. When they ask, "Will we ever die Dawn Francisco?", Ramon announces "Zoro, we are the battlefield of Zoro!" Well there is a big fight with the lazyon, now everyone with gray paint, masks and caps, protect the Gold Train. Then Zoro seems to be trapped towards man-made ornaments made for coffee, well, you know the cliffhanger's end of one section. <br /> <br /> Wow! It was a lot of writing for a chapter, but like most serials, the first one is much longer and there is plenty of ground to set on the story line. Let's start saying that 11 more good, well made, the actions have been followed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We are fomenting the problem among different groups who have an unknown evil leader. Who was the suspect behind the mask of 'Don del Oro'? We had our troops, the White, the unfavorable Indians and the revival of Lejin. <br /> <br /> As a childhood, everything will be asked and then some cereals. And, eventually, they knowingly choose that no actor influences any aspect of Mexico. <br /> <br /> What's there to make ZFL out of the rest? What makes it different or unique? Well ........ <br /> <br /> First, it portrays the play and action on the screen, and has a more detailed and exciting musical score. The opening theme is displayed in a flamenco guitar revival at Cantina even in one of the sections. This is probably the only time that is very specially invented in the serial soundtrack. <br /> <br /> And there is still one more feature that sets the legion logan Saga in front of everyone else. In other words, this film does not only have heroic musical themes, but it sings songs, yes, lyzianas! We hear their opening credits and singing different chapters! It works really well and adds the feeling we got from seeing it. <br /> <br /> When the serial was shown in our local television (about 1955), all the gangs immediately recognized the voice of Reid Halleley's' Captain Broadcock's Racket Squad, from the TV series. Mr. Hadley had a very distinct, deep voice. *** She operated very well in the role. His costume and especially the extended mask looked very good and was probably very effective. <br /> <br /> has a small slip up. Benneteau Ju√°rez (Carlton Young) addressed to the San Mandelito Council, a small immunity, as Jerez was 18 when he was 18, and although he was probably the greatest solo artist in Mexico's history. Still not achieve such a specialty. Perhaps the addition of his story was probably monetized in the Warren Brothers Juarez Liberation War of that year, which played the role of Paul Munie in the title role. <br /> <br /> This is not just like the top 5 sound serials, but my favorite Zoro movie <br /> <br /> * We reminded of the big crop of the best flight movies of the year, which together with the air, M. M. Amth Washington, Citidell, Juiz, OZ's Wizards, Mais and Men, one million BC, Zenobia, we count our believer in that year's output. <br /> ** Again, Jurez did not go around any national importance. 1850, about 25 years later. Also, the political sub-section is called 'provincial' in the story. In fact, they are called 'kingdoms'. Just as we are known in America as well as the United States, they call the United States of Mexico as their Reflecans. ********************************************************************************************************************************************************** See and listen to his description in the 92st Street (1945) and Goodnalan Diary (1945).
