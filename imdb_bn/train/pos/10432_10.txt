I must admit that at the beginning, I was mad at seeing this movie. I thought it was a stupid, little romantic movie about a French woman who met with American train and decided to visit Vienna. I'm not really inspired about this type of script, because it convinces me that it's just a movie. Yet, I saw it! And I was surprised ... "Before sunrise" was one of the few movies that dared to speak philosophically, we were executed at the moment of our birth, or it is a strange idea that couples should rest together for eternity, or We, humans, can sometimes live fairy tales Ultimately, we do not know if we will meet at Vienna's station in six months, six months - we are sincerely hopeful. Actors acted very well, so I started to believe that I could have survived the story of love myself.
