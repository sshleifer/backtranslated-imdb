Quo Vadis Best Screen Version Methinks? Never made Well, yes, this plot is not as strong and clear as the book, sometimes in the aesthetic damage to the loss and frustration of its mystery. But the film is really and beautiful "weird", there is an identity and style, that is the other version - the new one from R.Taylor and Poland - definitely lacking. It is the Roman decreasing air, falling paganism and the beauty of children Christianity. At least I believe it). Brandwire, Forrest and Pseudov did a great job to illustrate their characters. Forrest Petronius Caste seems to be the most successful (only Brandouier one of the greatest actors of all time) and this mortal world (IMHO) is very briefly collected. That's it. The way it happened, boys ...))) IMHO
