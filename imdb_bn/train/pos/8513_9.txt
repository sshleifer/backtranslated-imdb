I always had a vision that every person has a different taste, I thought this film was great and I think every college student can agree with me. Yet this is not a "plot film", it is a real son and some "problems" that they face. I found the movie a hilarious (especially the parts that they played practical joke on each other). Simply tell, if you are in the same "wave length" like these people, then you will find this movie wonderfully. I do not think it has won with a Golden Globe or Oscars, or people of this film will become the star of Hollywood in the future, but among young people it's a kind of "culture-classic" that can be related to their experience. Hans, the most standing man for me, is a Scandinavian man who, according to him, "is not a visitor", but gets all the girls (or something). The "little guy" also plays a big part in the film, especially when they are drunk. If I continue, I could provide a spoiler and I do not want to do it, just go and get to the movie and you will not be sorry. I give it 8/10
