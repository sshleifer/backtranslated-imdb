First of all, I want to say that those who criticized the film have made some flaws. There is a rating below 6/10 that is clearly fooled. <br /> <br /> Cripple is a fantastic movie with great film effects. Actors are extremely credible, descriptive, inspirational, and awful and graphical stuff very annoying. <br /> <br /> There are many mysteries in this movie. Visitors reveal strange and strange creatures that create shelter in dark tunnels tunnels. How was Craig created and what happened to him? <br /> <br /> A superb movie with a big chill factor. After 28 days, there are many inappropriate questions that should be admired with others like The Bunker, Dog Soldier and Deathwatch and a movie with a movie. <br /> <br /> Come forward to these amazing movies !!
