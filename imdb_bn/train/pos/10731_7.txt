I think there is a visible line or line between the posting and launch of FRF in the DVD version. They can prove they can gain the right to sit in the RFF than the green team. <br /> <br /> Another scene, similar to the time of simulation failure, Kevin gets Jokin <br /> <br /> I think there can be all lost things in VHS version other than ABC. <br /> <br /> I would like to know that there is a lost DVD release. <br /> <br /> The DVD that I saw has been edited for television.
