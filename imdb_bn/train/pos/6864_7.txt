When we first saw this movie in Canada, a drunken drunk When flipping through the channel came across the easy lube part. My friend kept flipping but I told him to go back. Something was not right about the simple lube name. Seeing the rest of the movie is fantastic sunny A few of the names from the credit hanging down and got home to see it. Sheve turned out to be Chase's first movie. I do not remember him. It did not feel much about me, so I hired it and gave it a second veiw. It's quite funny and quite graphic. If it's not funny then just like Kentucky Fried Movie. Finger love, easy lube, and I'm part of the president of da f ** kin '. The seller's chit is very nice. I think it's 10 or 6.5 out 7
