This movie is great! Brad Pitt, who played in this movie, can not act. Dovovini was top pure as Forbes and Levi's. Four main characters At the beginning of a beautiful road trip to historic murders sites, the 1960s model was one of the coolest cars made by Lincoln Continental. An alternation with a taste for Early Grace dry toothbrush and murder. She does not curse her women or smoke, and likes to wear PWT dresses. A pair of artists from the city of Dvoovi and Forbes, and Trailer Parker on the rural coast of Early and Levees. Although most of the movie's tones are dark, there are many interesting scenes. Writing, dictating, and acting brilliant. If you like road movies, murders, humor, and look, see this film. You will want more when everyone distributes, and rolls out. My favorite one all the time. "Hey! The dog that hunts you!"
