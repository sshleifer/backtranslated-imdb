The Spirit's 1986 film was a pilot for a possible series. However, spirit creator Will Ezner did not like the film and thus no series was created. I thought it was a very entertaining film and the comic spirit with a modern twist (sorry) captured. I'm sorry it does not materialize into a series. Sam (Flash Gordon) Jones was a perfect spirit. Visitors to a great Allen Dolan and of course go to the Star Trek after: nine years after the Deep Space. Perhaps with the release of the big-screen version of Frank Miller, more people will be able to see this rare jewel in this soul's history. It seems that when Hollywood produces a movie from the already established character or concept, one will inevitably look for the previous versions of the property and leave it for a few dollars in the video. When Antonio Banderas drew Zorro's mask, we could get earlier version of the masked heroes in DVDs, such as the great Allen Delan Edition of the 1st 1970 (though the copies I saw were badly edited). Hopefully some will release the TV adventures of the DVD.
