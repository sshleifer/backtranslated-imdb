I love this movie !!! Purple rain was my birth year and I was able to remember my heart. Prince is so tough on this movie. I went to a special exhibition of purple rain last night and it was like a concert, I was happy to see some real fans because this film was so worthless, it was actually one of the greatest movies of all time. Music is untouchable. The movie is played by Prince, about the movie "The Kid", his family is functional, his band is the most popular work in the city, and he has an eye for his aspiring singer, Apollonia. Purple Why my favorite color is no question that I can thank the "baby" for him. So if you do not see it then you need asap. This is a classic - 4ever!
