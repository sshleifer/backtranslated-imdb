One of these few movies I can watch over and over. If you do not see it, give it a shot. Richard Dreyfas and Raul Julia are amazing together and even though the movie makes me amused greatly, but it reminds me of Julia unimportantly. Terrorism and Fear This is a good opportunity for us to sit back and laugh at international conspiracy.
