Yes, it is the rules of games redox. Even before the Gaston Modot, the Rugly Gamekeeper, shows a look - as a Gypsy capo, not less! The events happen very little thick and fast quickly, so there is some confusion for this non-French speaker, but Hena Kya - Elena and Her Men are another deep human renoir masterpiece.
