This movie is not a Kung Fu movie. This is a comedy about Kung Fu. And if, before creating this film, Samo Hang spent time watching movies by the great French comedy filmmaker Zax Tati (e.g., SSP Jar De Fat), he must be on the length of the same wave. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's ridiculous! But they all do not taste. Some people told me that they hated their work. I never understand why, but I think because it usually plays the character of the tattoo itself, it is so dead that it is not affected by the events surrounding it (which is usually happening). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He usually gets serious problems with little things like record player or radio. He is a hazard in a car, but the world is safe when he runs a bike. But through this, he never lost his fall, which arose from his spiritual recognition, which was even more interesting than the eleventh century. <br /> <br /> Similarly, Chamber Samo Hong himself plays the children of a country in the big city of Hong Kong, making sure the city is attractive that Bruce Lee has made Kung Fu movies there. It hurts him in small ways, because what he sees in a small town will never be seen, but it is considered inadequate in a big city - as soon as he starts urinating on the street, a police stop him, only to discover Hanga is really shrinking the water outside her shirt, the wetting time in the Gulf region is wet during the dip. What is interesting about this shocking thing is why it is not understandable that there is a quarrel on the police forehead - in a country's city, until someone sees you, you have to go. In other words, the narrow streets are not really urine - but of course he - and what is the problem of the officer? Of course, Hung's passion with Bruce Lee also gets him in big troubles. He beats a gang of thugs who refused to give up the owner of their restaurant. Of course, in a Bruce Lee movie, the lips would be reproached and they learned their text. But in Hong Kong, unfortunately prevails, unfortunately, and thugs when he is not around, returning to his uncle's sword. <br /> <br /> Of course, Tati always end as last finally won. Such characters must always win (at least comedy) because they are completely innocent, and thus, despite their jokes wrong and misunderstandings, they really praise the people we want and they want to be the best of those who represent. We do not really want to be Bruce Lee (he will have to suffer the loss of all his friends before he gets the chance to defeat the bad guy), we really want a world in our own innocence where Li's heroism is <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this world Only available in movies <br /> <br /> "Ah, but what will happen ...?" - And in that question we found Sammo Hung at the best of his comic.
