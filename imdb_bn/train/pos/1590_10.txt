I started watching the TV series "What I like about" and I must definitely see it as a pleasure to see. I always like to see a new show, you really get a feel for them before many shows are closed. I've seen Amanda Bains that she is really funny girl, her best about her comedy is natural and I want to say what it means, this is one thing that a person can tell the best friend here is not rehearsed. <br /> <br /> I recently started watching the show and fell in love. I just see it running again but wait for the next season. Show all the characters to give something to the whole story line. I was happy to see some old faces from other shows, such as Jenny Griffin from "90210", Lesley Grossman from "Popular" and Wesley Jonathan from "City Guy" The new character is also very talismanic, Nick knows that charm, even when he made a mistake in Holi (love) still loves him. <br /> <br /> Overall, this show has the right ingredients to succeed, I look forward to seeing it grow.
