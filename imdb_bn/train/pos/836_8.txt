This year's best comedy will not be voted, a few have many coincidences and plot holes. However, we are talking about a movie where a hit-man and a white bread will become a selling friend, so some insomnia is not very surprising. Brosnan has played a nice role in this role, James Bond of Woods (a role he was wasting). If he can maintain such quality, I hope he will make a comedy. GREEN KINNA BROCHURE is also excellent as a direct man. I've read some negative comments about Hope Davis here, but I thought he was as good as a cloned housewife with a deep dark darkness. Brosnan is sliding on his way and there are several scenes where I have almost smiled, there are very good chocolates. My father (a mentor) described it as "convenient" for Julien himself. Like another hit-man comedy, "Gross's Point Plate", humor can be very dark. If you are ready to enjoy yourself that.
