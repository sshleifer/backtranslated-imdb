I found this episode has been a long time to be the fun one to be. The makers of the South Park have made the best breaks for any scenes from the Romero film. He has clearly touched Romeo's underlying social commentary that he has made with each of his films. I want to know whether George Romero's opinion was on this episode that I was sure that it was completely positive! His zombie epic kept his true vision for fully intact! Without making the most spoofs viewers, Romero tries to try with his film, with the agreement of pure Gore. I think that if a zombie outbreak happens then we can really think about our property values ​​before our life as shown in this episode!
