The verdict of 2006 was not really bad for the first PPV. But the last was actually attended by everyone and was really frustrated for those who were sitting at home. <br /> <br /> In the first match - Ric Flowers VS. EDGE W / LITA is not a bad opener for the WWE Intercontinental Championship, if they spend more time in a wrestling match, these two can play an important match. DÃ©cor Flair won the Ejaz pushing him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 Second Match - Trish Stratus VS Mikey James, for the WWE Women's Championship, does not seem to be bad for the first time that these rings face together in the ring. Mickey goes for a modified chick kick, but tries to duck and nail his own chick to keep his title. 3/10 Third Match - Trip H HS The big show was really good this match, really. The whole match focuses on the injured HHH Big Show but the Big Show still has to fight. After HHH was able to pull a big show and nailed Perigree for the win. 5/10 In the fourth match - Shetton Benjamin W. / MMA VS. The visa {it was a bonus match} was not bad, it was OK. After the visa was down, behind the referee, Benjamin's uncle received a pump [which contained bricks}} and vasarkar vasarkara three times. Visitors were caught with Benjamin's fork to win against the big people. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Fifth match - Zeri 'King' legal VS Gregory Hales is boring, slow and dusty. Both men did not really make a very good effort. Jerry Lollar won after winning a fist for the win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> Six matches - Terry Wilson VS. Victoria VS. Ashley VS Maria VS For the first time in the match, Kandis Mitchell was very interesting to me. Ashley {I think} won the first female guntlet match, ending the candidacy of Candice. 5/10 Seven Match - John Sena VS Character Master VS. Carlito VS Shawn Michaels viez. VS in the ear In the Championship championship championship for the WWE Championship, court Angle W. Davyri was a great animation chamber match. But last year's last extinction chamber was not the best. The last three master, Sina and Carlito. Carlito walks behind the master and gets a roll-up on him to eliminate him. Secondly, after winning the Elementation Chamber in Sylhet and maintaining his WWE title, he rolled up three times in Karlotov. But his night was not yet. After the 7/10 match, Vince McMahon came out and congratulated Sen for his victory. Vince McMahon said that his night is not over yet, and says Ed had given the opportunity to challenge Chen to recognize his bank's money in the bank. Edge comes out with the lease, gives a briefcase to Vince and wipes the head out of the ring as Sina has to play one more match tonight. <br /> <br /> In eight matches - John Sena VS. Edge W / LITA {Opening the army during the Chamber match} is cut off by the straight edge, for Edge W.H.E. Championship, and then he knocks on the soldiers' spiers, for the cover and his shock Sina breaks. Edge is involved in the cover for his three spinners and covers for the cover, because he defeated Sina and won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So last year's new year's revolution was better than this year, but it was still okay. The EC match was also good, and the threat of Edge Agency Cashing in MITB is certainly the most frustrating of the PPV show. <br /> <br /> Overall: I got it 7/10 and one
