It was my childhood favorite - I can see it on TV and be thrilled every time. Now that I grew up and I had a baby, I wanted to introduce him to this classic movie. We saw it last Friday, and he loved it. During the battle of Abu with the huge giant spider, crept over my son's hand and hold me - he was actually scared. Will he kill Spider, poppy? Just see, you'll see. There is no historic frame to speak of him (8 years old), so under the rule of Harun al-Rashishi grandson Ojma may be under the weight. <br /> <br /> I think he was particularly fiercely versed in the fight and was convicted by the boy-thief, and the old king did not. In fact, if you narrow down the story of the film, then the king is not the protagonist, the protagonist of the thief - that would be very pleased with the fantastic, brave young boys. It's a definite piece of time - I doubt it's like 11 or 12 times, my boy will find it 'corny' or use any of the next generation words. The story of love is only one dimensional - such a playful friend comments, "Why does Ahmad love Rajkumar? Because the claim demands." For the Apurba, the beloved abducted king, Abu Ray himself gets in trouble (repeatedly) equally impossible. But while flying mechanical horses, fifty-foot pairs and seeing all the eyes of the eyes, it is extremely extreme to be impressive about these things. The satisfaction of seeing the full prediction of the movie's climax is extraordinary, as the final final shot to finally escape on his (stolen) magic carpet, "finally find some fun and courage"!
