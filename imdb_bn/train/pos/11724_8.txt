Elvira (Cassandra Peterson) hosts a cheap horror show. If his dead aunt left some things to him, Elivera is going to England, hoping this will be some money. But due to his horror, Elviya wanted to know that her aunt gave up her house, a dog and a cookbook. Although Elvira decides to sit at home, but with his striking dark appearance and its stunning features, he can not live in peace. All the neighbors are now turning the whole city against her, and the slightest resentment of Elvias and looks like everyone keeps an eye on, because the Elvira fire! I really enjoyed this movie, it's really fun to see Elvivor on all these events, he's just cool. The whole movie keeps you in a Halloween mood, sure, it's stupid and joke cheap but it's a delight to see. I'll give Elvis, the mistress of The Dark 8/10
