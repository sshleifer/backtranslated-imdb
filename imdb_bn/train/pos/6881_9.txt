How can the Curtis Muffield singing feature be bad? It will not be! Grav Tube is a series of skeletal black-out sketches that have made some fun at the Olympics since 2001. Height, (Cocoa Cocoa, Simple Lub Recipe) is much more than the lower (a very long "seller"), but even less fun. Engage Cape Cape Shapiro's Best Busy Manhattan Pedestrian (Shapiro, Nate King Cole, you just do not sing). Certainly the date is now, but at that time Grove Tube was unreasonable, brave, shameless and funny. Why Shapiro hit this little civilization, then 7 years later created Christmas opening bombs, modern problems (although I enjoyed it) and since then, unfortunately, there is nothing. (Perhaps he can play drums on jazz groups) Grove Tube is a continuous explosion of positive energy to me, even after 26 years of initial viewing of my film, it brings me real pleasure!
