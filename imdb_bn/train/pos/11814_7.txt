Generally, when we use the word "escapist" we negatively mean it; The big screen version of "Dick Tracy" proves that "feather can be good". This is a really entertaining movie. Untitled, wearing yellow, fearless title character, Betty has created a detective with which we can all be involved: ready for action, but not without its weaknesses. <br /> <br /> The remaining characters from there are almost a world for themselves. Tes Truhard (Glenn Headley) is like a girlfriend because a criminal wants to become a warrior's husband; The breathtaking Mahoney (Madonna) is probably the most dangerous person imaginable; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) Average villain: Ruthless but cool. Other characters include Speech-Challenged Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), Over-Musical 88 Kisses (Mandy Pattinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Coursema). Charles Darning, James Kane, Dick van Dyke, Estel Person, Catherine Oahara, Semur Castle, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Betts are also star performers. <br /> <br /> Oh, wait a minute. I did not even explain the plot! Plot Tracy is trying - and so far failed - to find some way to the Big Boy. At the same time, there are very few wicked cases happening in the city, whose answers may or may not be closer to everyone. <br /> <br /> Of course, the main point of this movie is that it is fun to watch. When Warren Batty was in trouble playing his age, he used her well here. "Dick Tracy" is a cool movie.
