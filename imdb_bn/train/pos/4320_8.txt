This highly intimate film (to me) should be all of a good writing in a movie. Cassandan finds the meaning of our lives and makes it look and amazed. The film is divided into two different categories of violence, hatred and conflicts. <br /> <br /> After asking questions about life, we are asked. Davis (Steve Martin with a big beard) asks himself, 'Am I creating a violent movie (and enjoy our enjoyment through it) causing violence in society?' Claire asks, "What kind of world does something valuable to human life?" Not being as a reaction to Mac, he asked, 'Is it possible to go beyond the crossing of the race and (even difficult steps) to go beyond the meaning? These are not necessarily quoted from the film but generality. Others also ask their questions and be honest <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Own needs and wishes We can not answer the questions we like people like. Some answers are true. Clayer and Mac realize that they can take the easy road and allow the state to adopt the child, not to decide on its responsibility to make Davis 'case the light' and fierce films, but the next day revolves around him and under his industry Dismissed his epiphany. <br /> <br /> We all look for answers. This movie does not answer for them; It just reminds you to find answers. <br /> <br />
