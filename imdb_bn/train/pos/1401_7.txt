Well, we've got Verevenen violence (although not the other such as Vorovan Flickr), we have lots of sexuality and nudity, but some are absent ... Oh, yes, it has lost intelligence that Paul Verroveen is known for his scientific file. I present the characters of VeroEven and how their sense of humor is presented, even then, in contrast to most Vereovan films, the film does not have enough humor to read the comedy genre. The performance was overall above average compared to the highest slasher film. <br /> <br /> Holman Man does not have a good movie story, nor cast or character, but the wonderful special effects that would otherwise make a film, like this impossible. The crew has really created an invisible man, without using things like a floating hat to suspend piano wires and other real effects (impact on the set). When Kevin Bacon disappears, the most spectacular effects are not seen, Kevin Bacon is invisible and becomes visible when he becomes visible. <br /> <br /> The problem is that the story of this invisible person is more desirable. Here, it mostly takes place at a lab. I used to hide the invisible Kevin Bacon to hide the bank and get away with it, or tell people to steal something from Paris or steal something like that. But what is shown is enough to make Holly Mann an entertaining movie. Grade: b
