I can only resist here other reviews to appreciate. It is a delightful film to achieve without a line in the soppy sentimentality which is a delightful film. Naturally sweet - there is no associated sugar. A little thing: It seems that Paltelton's character, Ubetinov's character, is being given a light objection to the avoidance and defeat, that Pendelton is clearly such a genius / savant of things. Yes, this movie was quite unclear, but Pandleton showed 'computer studying' in her flat, and I believe her gifts allow her to suspend the whole night only on her gift. <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes were seen in a big moment that Genetopol was trying to test Pendalton's knowledge and call Bluff. I was sure that we believed that Pendleton came out of this situation quietly, or was quite knowledgeable for the test - it was a little clear. <br /> <br /> Surely he knows enough to set up a dummy account. It is possible that Wallach and Ustinov worked on how their computer works worked, rather, depending on their ugly concepts and to understand the details of how they got them, they must know what their concept was. They knew that 'method' was something which was important; They thought that 'smart lights' could actually control security instead of pointing to its status; They thought that the (idle) user's terminal features would strongly influence what Manfram could do in itself - even though I could not see it myself except for things like graphics features. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/art Do not allow them to give some artistic licenses, I do not think there is any problem with their efforts. <br /> <br /> CD
