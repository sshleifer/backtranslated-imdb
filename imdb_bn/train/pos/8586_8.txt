Welcome back to Kiefer Sutherland. It was too long after you appeared in the movie, and it was a movie, it was not 24, but very engaging, especially as a Secret Service agent involved with leadership like Michael Douglas. The character of Kefar is behind Michael Douglas, the caf√©'s partner, Eve Rhino, and the terrible housewife. Wow, actually he can do good work in addition to flirting all day and see better, but Kamasing had a big role, but more than that, I fully feel that the whole movie was an explosion starting from the beginning. I consider this movie as a political thriller, everyone has played in their part. Nothing is expressed sooon in the movie, so keep you guessing all the time. And I really think that Kifa made a hack of a work in this film, but in my opinion Michael Douglas' performance was a performance of the day.
