All right, so, these weeks are late, but here it is. Mostly, because of this the statement of various negative natures. Start with technology. When Star Trek: The TOS ran, special effects technology had extremely low technology, and more than that, there was very little money to make any kind of make-up to the crew. In the 35-year-old CISCE TOS premiere, the star tracker crew has become an expert in the economy. <br /> <br /> Finally, they decided, I think it is OK, to abandon the look of the TOS and the engineer TNG reverse is all about. So if they do not take the transporter from the gold glyter or look at the stage trace from Stage Trek 2? Based on kicks and rickshaw commentaries, it was found in 2200 with the clonal of the Earth to choose the knot for the first contact with the Klingon Empire. Nothing was established firmly. <br /> <br /> The enterprise gives us the time that we've seen a time to visit the most promising venue. This could be a Voyager. Any series can develop without some inconsistencies, but thank you that Star Trek has so little. So, leave gripping and enjoy.
