How to lose friends and aliens in 2008 This is a bomb attack on the US box office. This is a absolutely ridiculous movie with a great cast. Simon Peg's great player Sidney Young wrote the book "What to Two House Friends and Aliens Locks". I know this is not a real story. The only way I know because I want to go with an actress named Sidney. Sophie Mess does not exist, but another picture may be realistic than that. How to lose friends and hugs, maybe it's the most fun movie of 2008, and I think you see it. As I said earlier, with a fantastic cast of the film: Kirsten Donast (Spider-Man, The Virgin Suicide) Danny Huston (No. 23, 30 Days of Night), Jillian Anderson (The X-Files) Megan Fox (Transformer, voice of a teenage play queen ) Jeff Bridges (Big Lebowski, The Venting) Above all, how friends and detached people are frustrated. I think Simon Peg and Kirsten Donst work well together, and I think you see it. Although there are some malicious nudity with trans-sex, it's a ridiculous and awesome comedy. Simon Peg's best <br /> Plot: An English journalist traveled to New York to work in Sydney Young Sharp. While there, he starred in the actress Sophie Moss and tried to sleep with her before her boss.
