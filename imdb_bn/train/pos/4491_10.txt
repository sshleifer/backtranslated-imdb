I love this picture 'Spring and Port Wine'. I was born in Leicester, a city about 7 miles away from Bolton. I went to Bolton at the age of 20 in 1965. My work place every day through Fenworth, through the Little Liver, sometimes on bicycles, but after driving the car. This film will bring back all the memories of the working class's neighbors, who were almost always broke, but if they could, they would always help you. Fred Debna Bromovitch was the corner round from the center of my bedsit. If you can not see the movie when the first release is released, then you can forgive him for comparing the soap-like soap, so I agree that this is a soap, but then it is called 'kitchen sink drama'! Watch this movie for a gifted cast, which soon became the family name from the TV on the TV, I mainly look for the area's shots and good feelings for the poor people but happy!
