I did not actually start watching shows until I came to FX. I was disturbed and did not see anything and saw that the occasion was a premiere, so I decided to see it. I was so annoyed that the event was never broadcast on TV. I love so much to mourn! Finally a show to enjoy everyone. I remember the flower house and family issues and step by step and they were okay but not enough fun. They would be laughing at the things that were stupid and simply little stupid, but that's not 70's show. That 70s show was sunny, smart and so real. I think it was the best show ever and I'm sorry it ended. Although I love this show, I think it will end in the seventh season when Erie and Kells are gone. The last season was not right, Erik was the main character and the show should end when his character leaves. I still love this show and I hope the TV will create more such shows.
