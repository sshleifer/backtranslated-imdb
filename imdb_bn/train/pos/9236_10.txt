Let's start thinking, let's face the original, because the original Battalister series was a wonderful composition, even with all stars, story lines and art. Green was great in Lorne like Adoma and Richard Hacht, and it was funny like Apollo and Dirk Benedict Starbucks, but I say, not as beautiful as a starbuck cut. <br /> <br /> I like the episode with Pagasas and the good wishes from the world were good. John Calicos Balter, the best man in God's war, was the best man, I thought it was a way that heaven could wait, then your Blessore women were compared to them, compared to them, Tixia did not say those who are awesome as six numbers Beautiful, but it can not be compared to the beauty of Zen Semur. Let alone Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was pretty fantastic. Its beauty was that it would be embarrassed by a floor. I liked the original as soon as the new ones. <br /> <br /> Can you imagine what John Calicus was a six? :) <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
