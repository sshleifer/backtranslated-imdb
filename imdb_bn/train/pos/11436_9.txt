This type of picture will be made today by the John Lascietta, if it is not progressing to CGI. Since 1983, the technology does not make a sexy and strong tower, so he may forget. _Twice ... got the same intellect, imagination, and real tension which you can find in a pixel flick, only executed under the limit of Medium C. 1983. Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing, which creates a movie that appeals to a large degree. Should talk about the same breathing with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_.
