I just saw "Behind the Door Back", and this was the first softback Flickr, a strong story behind it that I saw. <br /> <br /> We start with two neighboring couples - Vivian and James Fenway (Julia Cruis and Eric Carrington), and Lillian and Gabby Harris (Nicole Sheridan and Chris Gustafson). Vivian seems to be a housewife, a lawyer for the James District Attorney, working in Lillian real estate, and a successful plastic surgeon in GABE Have you got that? Now, let's get into it. <br /> <br /> Write ABB, porn star star starred by Chelsea Blue. He rented the house across the street from Fenway and lived all by himself. At the beginning of the film, James saw his window and surprised Abie with his girlfriend Gigi (played by acting porn actress Monique Alexander), engaging in platyme and being secretly with her. The next day, get acquainted with Abby Foursie, and seems to be a beautiful woman who only maintains an alternative lifestyle. He made a pass in Vivian, who feels striking and said to him, "Oh ... I ... do not do that." Everything seems to be okay ... as long as the plan will sit in motion <br /> <br /> At first, Abi Gabawi showed up at the office, asked nude, if she had to get a job. This is where we get our quote from the movie: <br /> <br /> "Tell me about Gabe." "What do you want to know?" "Are you happy married?" "I am married." "There are problems ... I guess your wife is at home and you do whatever you want, but she is a good girl." "Yes." "Is not she a bad girl?" "Number" "Is that door locked on it?" <br /> <br /> You know, what will happen next ... Abby takes it, okay room room there. Then, he sees a little show in his window for James, who takes time to have sex with her and waste time. James does not know that Teddy Bear is actually all camera taping camera with flashing red eye (it is clearly anyway). AB again has sex with Gabby, and this time Jigi joined to create three ways. Now there's something AB has on both men, she requests her $ 100,000 to buy her silence. For James's office, he could not break the run, but he could destroy the habit of gab. <br /> <br /> While Gabe and James wrestled with their crimes, Abbey found her while persuading Lilian - who "examined" with the women in college. It was long ago, but you do not know that she was shown with Abby working in - she looked like an old pro. <br /> <br /> When Jigi goes along with this plan, she feels jealous of everyone as her girlfriend is being sexually abused. "It's just business," said Abby. Confirmation of confession and forgiveness, such as some amazing information about Abi's true identity - seems to be doing the same thing in different men in different places. Gabby and James ABB used this information to fight Blackmail. <br /> <br /> Now, towards sex. Sex scenes were great, and considering all the women involved in this film, I could not have expected anything except Julia Cruise's long porn background. Nicole Sheridan's four scenes were in the best film, coming in three ways closely. Monique Alexander once got naked, but he was a relatively minor character. Julia Cruse was a major character and got the same time naked. I think I was surrounded by experienced veterans, many of her sexual scenes were not needed. <br /> <br /> The wrapping of "Behind Doors of Behinds" was a great story, which increased the overall grade of the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> She said, Nicole Sheridan was good in this film - Fred O'Nein is better than Ray's next comedy comedy. At least he could do some drama. Chelsea Blue scene theft - she was not as bad as the rival. I want to give him an A by myself. Julia Cruise is her usual self. I wanted to have more time in this picture of Monique Alexander.) <br /> Sex: B (Solid, very strong sex scene, Nicole Sheridan's performance was often of great quality, Chelsea Blue looked very good in her scene. <br /> <br /> Story: B + (I liked dialogue and original story. Chelsea Blue's acting was good for the genre, and <br /> <br /> Overall: B (It was a beautiful soft flick, I'm glad I was able to see it, because I was happy, if Chelsea Blue was even more than that. If she wants to do anything then she is welcome anyway. + That's too much for Nicole Sheridan, - She's probably better doing a comedy. I do not think that hardcore girls who can do softcore films.)
