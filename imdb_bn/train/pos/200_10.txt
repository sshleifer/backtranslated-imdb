Updated to previous comments. Outstanding and intimate, Marion Davis shows his comedic comedy in late comedy (1928), which also shows the wonderful William Haines. Davis has played a hick from Georgia, who has crashed Hollywood with the help of a bit of hydeuse's legendary comedy. Morin became "discovered" and became a big drama star until he appeared in comedy comedy together. <br /> <br /> A great lamp on Hollywood and its preistances. Davis and Henes is a wonderful team and Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks, William S. Hart, John Gilbert, Elinor Glen, Norma Talmag, Ma Murray, Rod La Rocuk, Lettrez Joy, Dorothy Sebastien, and Estil Taylor's guest shot. , Lola Person, Rene Ador, Aileen Pringle, and Merriam Davis (you should see this) make a move. Must for a serious film buff or for anyone interested in still fierce Marion Davies! Dale Henderson played Dad. Polly Moran is a maid. Paul Rally is the leading man in despair. <br /> <br /> People are thought to have been used as a model of Gloria Swansea (I think close to Murray). Davis and Swanson were friends. But the story of this movie is about the rise of Sanson from the one-rail Mac Senate curiosity to Charlie B. with Charlie Chaplin. Actor in an Egg movie and at the beginning of the thirteen, in the early 20th century, Demil starred in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Davis and Hens are huge MGM stars and friends. Curious that MGM does not combine them into a box. They are great together! A sweet romance and prettiest Hollywood spoof delight. Greta Garbo and Bebe Daniel are mentioned but do not appear.
