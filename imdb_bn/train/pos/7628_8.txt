This movie is "Wow!" Movie This is not the greatest movie of all time, because it surprised me. It was not just a TVV movie, but it was on Elvis. I can say just like one alice safely, but I can safely say that Kurt Russell came very close to the real thing. It was the greatest disguise that I have ever seen. He believed me that it was really his. I learned a lot about Elvis's life from watching this movie. And do not lead to the television segment of your confusion - it's really a great movie! And Cart Russell Elvis can be Twin :)
