Who can see a movie, look at Lucy Liu and not be happy. That lady is amazingly beautiful and a talented actress. It's a solid combination to find a day now. And Jeremy Northam. I've heard his name many times, but I did not really look at him. My suggestion to Hollywood is: "Use it more". <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: I saw it transferred to my graveyard. I do not recommend anyone. It's complicated and a bit of mysterious for that. I still can not believe I did not see the end. I will not say that why the cinema film will loot? Although it's not enough damage. <br /> <br /> Now I'm asking to vote for me about this movie. I like the dark mysterious story, the actor has done well and I like the director (Natali) work in the past. There is no big audience for this type of thing, it is also quite risky. You know, I'm going to give this work 8 because everyone can see it. Then again, because 1 point deduction always has room for improvement.
