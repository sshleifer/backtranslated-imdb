Before this little black-whale, the obvious case of criminal rape did not make the American screen face-to-face. Until the 1960's rebel, the code for Hollywood and production was kept secret. So it is not surprising that it would take a little independent organization like IDA Lupino filmmakers to raise the issue. The results were quite meaningful but some were compromised, which is not surprising because director Loopino had to work with the code demand to get the movie released. <br /> <br /> Attractive, Anne Walton's (Mala's power) main problem is not seen by others, but how she sees herself. And carry it a heavy load. Would he be able to relate to men again? Will they see him as a "distorted product" (after all, this 1950)? Instead of facing these concerns at home and at work, he went away, although family and friends are generally supportive. Overall, this first part is sincere and well-done. The plot is promoted to engage in some action in the plot, but it is a film - see how the extremist neighbor does not react to the zero horn near the pursuing horn. Instead, the alarm was shouted from the power, if the response to the neighbors' lack was complicated then <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ferguson (Todd Andrews). He (he quotes a phrase) who "gives his courage to face life again". There are some attempts to make him human - this is what Anne or his hesitation he is most interested in. Nevertheless, his gentle and intelligent presence is very miraculous and comes as little as Hollywood. Fortunately, because of the last hope, avoid the end of Hollywood's Cop-outs with the emphasis on happy resolution for Anne. <br /> <br /> Give Lupino a one-dollar credit with the Prothom-alo. Given overall results, I hope he was treated as well as he was treated fairly. I hope the audience's audience mainly focuses on the dramatic drama mainly in human drama, because of the excellent performance of the power, and it seems to be very attractive. However, the film now works best as a document of its time, and that day's cultural surveillance was appropriate for adult viewing.
