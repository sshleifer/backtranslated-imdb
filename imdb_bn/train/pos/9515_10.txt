With a very nostalgic end, one of my favorite movies is one. The film is about the Sullivan family, perhaps Michael Sullivan (father) is the main member of the Mafia, speaking to the murderer, and an expert. One of the children wants to know his father's work (a terrible mistake), so he hides in his father's car and he does this by saying Tom Hans in such a way. <br /> <br /> No one wins the Mafia or Mafia, when they want you, they take you out. Of course you can see a person who is a huge house, the best car in the world, whatever you like, but does something wrong or does not want your "boss" and you are being fired, and killed. <br /> <br /> You can see what you can mean in the movie, Sullivan Junior saw something that she did not see, and well, all her family made her "wrong thing" her boy. The movie is really entertaining, you'll see how live after chasing by Sullivan Mafia or his kinda. <br /> <br /> This movie is sad, shows us about revenge, those who do dirty work, almost everything you want. Hopefully the person reading this comment does not work for the Mafia, and if you work in Mafia then enjoy yourself and leave the country before killing your boss and their staff. <br /> <br> This movie gets: 10/10
