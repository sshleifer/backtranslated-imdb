One-third of the "Konvictus" film works. All the dialogue and character interaction in it comes from the long winds of the south. And, recently, the life of his main character, Sol (Robert Duval). <br /> <br /> This is the first collaboration between director Peter Masters and writer Horton Fountain. Six years ago, together they worked together in "The Trip to Beautiful", a film that is often more efficient than this. Masterson is not necessarily a good director. In fact, he's just enough of this side. Gradually, the walker painter Tomsi leaves many rooms for the Kadita, which simply adds the film to the correct feeling of fragile light and warmth. <br /> <br /> It is essentially a graphical game editing or skill guidance, it comes in all acting. As far as I'm concerned there is no error here. Robert Duval and James Earl Jones, two American American actors (both born January 1, 1931) have created characters that are nothing but living. A young actor known as "Testament" and "Witness", Lucas Hass played a character like his other primary roles. He is calm, withdrawn, a little scared and sad, somehow. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> The headline, as well as the opening scene, seems to produce an image of a picture of a more high western picture. If gradually the stage productions do not give you much interest, but you also want to pass it side by side. Otherwise, the way you like this movie can often be. Enjoy <br /> <br />
