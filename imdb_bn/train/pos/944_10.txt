You can store the version of Charles Dickens "A Christmas Carol" with sock puppets and you will probably see it. Since I was a child, this has been one of my favorite stories. Perhaps it is believed to be good in everyone, and therefore no one appeals to me, for any reason, I never miss a chance to see many of these screen adaptations in classic classical adaptations. They are inevitably this year's time on TV. <br /> <br /> This version is really about how the dome that comes with its own role. Over the last few dozen lines we have heard about the whole new intensity, and each character becomes more real and credible in the hands of this wonderful group. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was nominated. For this role, in 1985, Emmy. Instead of sleeping on this illustrated role of Scrooge, instead of his everlasting achievement, he instead gave a new explanation, in my opinion, one of his best performances. He did not try to speak British intelligently, but instead provided the famous jackfruit with his line. His screw is not just a pimple old man (as he often portrays), but a man who conveys deep anger against the world. When he is visited by each of the three spirits, we realize how the anger of this anger increased, and ultimately strangled his spirit. When he was forced to review his life, we saw him softly, and then came back to the unexpected tendency. And in the great dramatic scene when he wept on his grave and wept on his cry, he prayed for forgiveness for the third spirit of his repentance and the desire to change his life, we see a man who was completely broken, his knees literally and figuratively Scott made Scrooge credible and painful. <br /> <br /> Emotionally influenced by the performance of the scoot, the boldness of the role of the support of actors contributed significantly. Fred Hallwell, the nephew of Scrooge, this is an excellent example. Often praised as Bafuna, where he played by Roger Reese, which is a mental acuity from the previous screenplay. When he requested Scrooge, "I do not ask you anything, I do not want anything from you. Why can not we be friends?", We do not see his disappointment in his face, but his pain in the spontaneous breakup of Scro Relative This is an ongoing performance, and one of the most dramatic scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only because a dead person is hard to portray strongly, and the result is usually stupid (oh, look, it's a scary ghost ....... No!) In this version, it's probably the most popular scene in the whole movie. At Marley's entrance, the doors at Screw's door echoes the word of their own accord and branch, all around the house, this is surprisingly obscure. But Finlay's Marley has no spiritual soul. He is an oppressive soul, both fearful and unfortunate. Marley may be a ghost, but his wrath and sorrow towards gaining life in search of wealth, and his frustration in his feeling that his sins have now exceeded the solution, still many humans. As illustrated by Finlay, we have no problem that even flinty Scrooge will be shaken by this nightmarish apparition. Finlay really stole the scene here, when you can do something reverse, you reverse George C. Scott. <br /> <br /> And it's just and after, after another extraordinary performance, it looks like you 'facing this story for the first time. Edward Woodward (Remember him from the eclectier?) Christmas generation is as dull and touching as ghost. When he distributes the famous line, "It can be good that in heaven, you can be more vulnerable and more than millions of people like this poor man's life." He is another consolation Santa Claus tenant, but a retaliation angel who is not <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br />! Poverty, a sick child, and a helpless boss. Face up to helpless situations, his face shows his brave courage, and occasionally shows his fatigue. Later, Schuerarg was shown by the Host of Christmas Tithi, while the Titan team, Tony Tim, when Warner's performance came to the Crichit family, while rarely speaking a word would take you to tears.
