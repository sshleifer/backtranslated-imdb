The dress and make-up were grand, there were some unusual funny lines, and Jim Kerry was made to play the role. Carry did a job better as it could rather be written in frustrating script. Surely this was a movie for most kids, but if you are going to spend a lot of money making this film, of course you must give enough story to go out of the price. I expected more from Ron Howard. It is worth a price, but it lacks the necessary qualities to be a major classic by any measurement.
