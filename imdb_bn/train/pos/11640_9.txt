What I liked in this movie is like the movies of Hitakoos, a thriller that does not take itself very seriously. <br /> <br /> Hitako understands that people go to the movies to have a good time. In recent years Hollywood has forgotten something like that. It's a thriller, but it has a lot of smiles and always has a burning eye on the camera. <br /> <br /> Rachel McAdam is always surprising. Sylvan Murphy Kippiera than Batman Beginn In the old days, those who always played bad guys were. We do not see most of these days because Huaweiad agents suspect it as a bad carrier step, but the Sylifan Murphy is really good for the worse. <br /> <br /> The instruction is amazing stylish. The story is good but the dialog may use some spraying. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> "Red Eye" People are really appreciated when they are really funny movies and loading credits. If you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller, "Red Eye" may be your ticket.
