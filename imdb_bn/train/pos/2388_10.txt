I love the doodlop My son has been watching them for a year. We went to the doodlop concert last year and went to a concert yesterday (Connecticut). She loves them Doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who care? Are you being serious? The TV can not teach about the number or alphabet of your children. Parents should Drink it Doodlebops can actually sing. Deedee has a beautiful voice and at the concert you can say all three excellent singing voices of her and do not lip songs. Imagine, they dance, almost jumped and still singing. They have talent, kids love their love even I enjoy watching the show. This show is by the best show on TV for kids. And a rock band for children. How amazing is that? Why is Chad (Rooney) saying gay? Where did you hear from Whether he is awesome! Leave him alone. This or someone else is not promoting homosexuality to our children!
