I'm sorry for those who go to the movies with pad and pencil, write errors and note how bad the movie is. I feel equally humiliated for those who go to the movies and suspend the reality and / or let them enjoy 90 minutes from their annoying or busy life! Get a GRIP People ECGTTB is a very entertaining movie. If you take movies seriously, it's not for you. If you expect the movie to be like a book in any way, this is not for you. But you have enjoyed the playful scenes of Priscilla Queen of the desert, or "what Moulin Rooz sees". Or the topmost comedy of "The Sweetest Things" then offered to escape from Cowgirls themselves. It has some really interesting parts. Really ridiculous It has some really good music; kdoslang kudos I mentioned about 90 minutes of Umar Tharman ... I say more?
