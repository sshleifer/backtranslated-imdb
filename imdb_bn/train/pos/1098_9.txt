Modern viewers initially introduced this short film as "The Money Pot" as a remake model. The old spectators look at Nostalgia's significance today: Keri Grant, Mirna Loy and Melvin Douglas were all "superstars" in a simple, less complex age. Or was it? Of course, there is a way to correct perspectives and today's conversation with many films is social and political, there is a natural curiosity to be surprised at the debate over the older, seemingly less provocative movies. "Mr Blondings creates his dream house", so, what visitors are looking for in 1948. There are political commentaries, but fine. Finding a house in the late 40's was a really exciting experience, which became soft as LeviTown and Asa. Politics in politics? Blonding kids always seem to talk about their progressive ideas, which are being sent to their school (which will be accused of community communists in real life). In real life, Morina Loy was a Housing Activist, Democrat and feminist. Melvin Douglas was not a less democratic firebrand: he married Congressman Helen Gaggan Douglas, whom Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism (and which destroyed him). Jason Roberts, SR, has a small role in this film, but his political activism was less visible. More importantly, his son, Jason Roberts, Jr., has been a very active liberal Democrat for many years. Almost strange comedy was Curie Grant, whose progressive conservatism reflects most of Hollywood's political sentiment that has already decreased. But this was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and black list was just around the corner. It will be a decade before political activism appears in mainstream films, and then these are not very few.
