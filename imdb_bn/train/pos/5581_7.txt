Due to the nudity of the Hoodie Lammer nude (Eva Harman) in the 1930s, the film was banned from the American movie house, which caused all kinds of problems in women in the 1930s, but not so much for the male population. This story expresses concern about a young woman named Eva Herman, who gets married in an old age and carries a threshold on the wedding night, and the husband never frees her anxiety and concerns about all the small things like shoes and bags. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. In the warm summer, Eva travels on her horse and decides to swim nude in a lake of wood. His horse was closed and he ran after him, and a young man saw him and dressed her back and came back to Eve. These two people became very familiar and are starting a romance that blooms. There are many other interesting problems that you will see at the very end of this movie. Enjoy a great classic film in 1933 which was a shocker film. Enjoy.
