This is a brilliant scientist who is very curious to see the same movie both men and women. I talked to a lot of people about the film and almost everyone liked it and said it was bright - though most women thought that it was just hateful and stupid! This is the only movie I know that has a gender-based polarized opinion. Probably most women have less tolerance for hateful or depressed plots - but whatever happens, I always consider this difference to be interesting. <br /> <br /> This picture starts with the assassination and next investigation Charlton Hesson. It has been set in the perfect future and the head of a huge international oil corporation has been killed. As soon as the film is released, you quickly realize that it is a terrible and highly ill-fated American society. Rich people live in a lot of secure apartments and can buy money for all facilities (including "furniture" - a warmth for paying accessories that comes with the apartment). At the same time, the population lives in dirty, unemployed and in many cases abandoned cars or apartment halls. Excessive population and smoke have taken a severe toll and looks really awful in the future! <br /> <br /> I will not really talk about why rich people died and they could not live with that terrible truth - it could destroy the film for you. However, the film is a great plot and is super exciting to watch and watch. In addition, it is Edward G. Robinson featured in Houston's Crusty Sidekick in its final screen performance. Although it is not easy to get depressed, it is a great science-film that is metaphor and deep.
