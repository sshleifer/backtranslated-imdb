I love this show! Mr. Bleck, Gordon and Waffle are different from each other, but they combine themselves as 'brothers'. I often try to imitate myself with the tedious pronunciation of Scottish Boro in Butler, Howis, even Gordon. More episodes about Human Kimbery should be made. The humorous classical episode of Hamilton Campbell's own sharing of disguised as a pre-adolescent girl of cats, to drink their favorite drink, Rootbearer is a ridiculous classic. Apart from the film 'Slap Shot', we can not drink the tablets in our house, except for the Kate's Voices or the Hanson Brothers. Future Classic Where can I get the first two seasons of the DVD ??
