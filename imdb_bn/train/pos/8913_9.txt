This is my favorite classic. It was painted on a small west of Philadelphia, when I was 13 years old at Ph.D., in 1957, and the next year was released. Then in the 1970s, I myself worked in the same county as a Rocky PA State member. I have always enjoyed checking out various places where the scenes have been illustrated. I knew the owner of Downingtown dinner, and there was a road sign in front of it that told all the running motorists that it was "blob home". The theater scene was at Phoenixville, near the Valley Forge Park and it is still showing movies!
