I cried out my heart, watching this movie. I never suffered from any dietary disorder, but I think it will be a very real picture. <br /> <br /> Ellison Louman is excellent! He expressed these feelings amazingly well. My teenage years came back to me so clearly. Anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or a teenager will be able to relate to this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm positive because she's perfectly suited for role as Agnes.
