Above all, I like Bruce Brutton's music score, very songwriter, and this only adds to the kiss of the movie. The best aspect of the movie was the three animals, especially Michael J. Fox, Sally Field, and late Don Am√®che. Fox has the most fun lines, but the other amazing character (voice of the cause) in Amex, and the field connects intelligence with a character that is always seen as a chance off. The man was not as captivating, and sometimes pulled the film, but this is my only complaint. With Canada's beautiful close shot, it's a beautiful look film, I believe. Although the film is very long, it is not a very timeless moment and it is benefited by voice work and a well-written script. From all, a charming and perhaps underrated film with a 9/10 from me.
