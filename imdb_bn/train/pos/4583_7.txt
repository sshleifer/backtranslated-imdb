I saw it in Cantonese VCD with English subtitles. I thought the story was good, but there was some time when subcharactors played mostly. This film has scored far better hair musical, which really irked me throughout the whole movie Musical score was improved, I could overlook a few overacted scenes. Then the film will be a lot, much better.
