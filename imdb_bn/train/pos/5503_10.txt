The material of this documentary is so strong that it brought me to tears. Yes, I tell you tears. This popular struggle of a traditionally exploited population will not inspire us to stand up for our rights, highlight greater love for society and prevent the brave excuses to challenge the organization. Chavez is a weak and unfortunate representation in the same way Bush faces the dirty corporations and Ammu runs capitalism. In fact, Latino America is being rescheduled and the limited majority has a voice for five centuries. However, in the case of Mexico, the selection was clearly stolen by Calderon. Chavez is not perfect, far from it. He is trying to change the constitution so that he can rule indefinitely. That can not be tolerated. Enough with politics and return to the movie; Speed ​​is breathing taking at the moment, and others are deeply philosophical. As a popular hero, Chavez refuses to challenge US dictatorship and global organization's supremacy. If you think the author is biased on behalf of Chavez, your homework does not interfere with you. An important message in the film is being questioned about the information source, such as the supporters of Chavez, were clearly shown by the victims of sniper victims of the shameful murder. Venezuela shame America's alleged democracy! Hesa La Revolution Simprese!
