Before I left the scene, I could do it as long as I could. A delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars. Only I could find it again! Of course I could buy / buy it certainly see Please, someone, bring it back. During World War II, his role as a patriot in Fred Macmuire was perfect, and his leading female Joan Leslie, and especially in June Havre, was beautiful and engaging. It was a musical, but romantic, fun, and cute. This June was my favorite movie starring the Havar star, although I always loved him. His radioactive smile made the screen shine, and his beauty and talent was a movie resource. Supporting cast credits their personal roles. A well balanced and light-hearted film; Just like we want more!
