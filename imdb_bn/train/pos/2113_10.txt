The location of the corner shop at the beginning of the Balta Street in Budapest is right, but it can actually be in some place. Small sets reflect a central European design but it can be a shop near an angle. This film is not about business in Budapest or Retail Leather Products, but love has gone up and out in love, which is reflected in most major characters. <br /> <br /> Although Alfred Crawl and Clara Novak are partners in the work, their anonymity is full of hope and desire and romance with each other, and the story is reluctant to merge these two aspects neatly. Hugo Matusek, the owner of the shop, is being hurt by his wife, he is only one voice at the end of the phone. Fenaszas has a secret relationship. Ilona Novodny is a gentle friend who bought her fur costume. Mr Pirovitch's life is centered around his wife and children. Santa Claus played Pep Katona, a girl from Christmas. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It moved effortlessly from view to scene This is one of the silent films that again and again again simple, deep but deep repays. Conversation reflects the talking character which is common on this day. <br /> <br /> All acting great. Even the caf√© waiter and street police personnel on the street are also perfect. James Stewart and Margaret Sultan play off each other perfectly. She actually got into her stride as an actor and gives a sweet and sharp performance. Margaret Sultan is under an awesome actor and praised these days. His other films are somewhat valuable. As Mr Matuschek, Frank Morgan is amazing. The truth is that its momentum is moving too much. <br /> <br /> This is a good word that they do not use like them (the vague reshuffle 'You've got Mail' was terrible) but Gold stars. In this case it is true. Director Lubitosh, not only thanks to knowledge, but also distributed a classic movie of soul, charm and warm humanity.
