Although it was not without its flaw, this play was perfect for showing Easter time. It reminded us of our spiritual spirit and showed us the face of the fact that we often hide our deepest sorrow and experience. There was not much to enjoy in the drama, at least in the sabotage youth who played better musical instruments in drama rather than bad sound scores. The acting was nice and Timothy Spal again was fantastic. Climax was very easy, if rather simple. "Permission" to commit a suicide by a long-dead wife of Timothy Spal was believable and mirrored the feelings of depression in the presence of a harmful teen girl. Result between graffiti boy and Muslims was pleasurable but less credible. A wonderful play that left me and my husband well spent in the evening. Congratulations!
