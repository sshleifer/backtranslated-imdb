Wondering where ever romantic novels and other papers come from ideas for release back? According to 'Jack Speed', they are based on real people, they publish what they write and publish. This film is about quality family entertainment, moderate amounts of violence, and the worst dogged cloth. Language is not a problem, and Jokes is fun at all levels. This is an 'Austin Powers' look of 'Indian Jones', without Michael Antivirus's top antics. I highly recommend this film for kids from the range of 10 to 15.
