In the hands of more efficient directors, this picture will be considered a horrifying skill. Despite Michael Michael's "Death Wish" winner's only transmissive side, the film is more interesting, original and a bit more terrible. <br /> <br /> As the heroine boyfriend, including Chris Sarandon, who literally listens to her words, she insists she's going to down the eerie things, because the script closes her back with multiple horror clicks (several may not shake it). Burgess Maryredith is delightful as a loving crazy neighbor. Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D'Angelo as her silent and disturbing lesbian lover. John Carradine is a hacker working in a chair. And look for a short-lived show from an unknown-time-time Chris Walken! This movie is vague and creative. Sheen twists are lovely, if a tad is predictable. Measurements, which I will not give any detail, are annoying and quite impressive. Again a good director could do more with him, but he was satisfied - at least with seventeen horrors of sensitivity. <br /> <br /> If you like to visualize the modern-produced body, but you Do not like it. There is almost no gore. The direction is quite spartan. The effects are a little bit, though at the end there are some fun makeup - which is not really makeup ... but perhaps I've said so long ago. <br /> <br /> I rated it a little more than just the quality of its quality, but I found that it enjoyed just like any "8" movie.
