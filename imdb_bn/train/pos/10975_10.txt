Poetry in the girl's words: "I can not go to another year. I have to go to the hotel room." "I've lost my blue scarf on the beach." "The marble is moving in the faun ... he just gave us a washing machine. It's a contract." "I'm pulverized by this latest thing." ".. raccoons and cats will become boring for a little more time." "... the house of many small mice, the mouse hole I want to be good." And there is wisdom in the words of the mother: "... yes all my joy." "This little book will keep me straight as a die." "Always have to do everything correctly." "Where are you from?" "... bring me my little radio, I have some professional music." "I'm your mother, remember me?" In this great film, the relationship of the mother / daughter has been drawn. This is a Mother's Day film.
