This movie will always be my favorite. It should not be a plot, because its producers (Charlie Shane, I think) people believe that this is a real skeptic film. It was an exercise of visual effects and when it works like all other movies, it does not work out. At this moment, movies are all about sound effects, the scenes made by computers make it easy to deal with CGI blood. There are still movie makers who can not get fake blood to see the real thing. There is no rape scene because it is not about movie making. Have you seen there are hills in the mountains 2? Rape scenes were rather fun. Although I am certain that some Gonzo pornographic filmmakers tried to get away with pornography. But perhaps they suck to make movies, they probably will not be able to stop it. The movie "Base Moi" is an annoying rape scene because actresses actually sell porn stars and movies, but they all show up. <br /> <br /> It is very bad that the movie can not be made without thinking about all its profits, especially when it is talking about the rating of NC-17. I'm sure Eli Roth has the talent to make her hostile film series even better, but she got very few ratings and got a rating ... or at least I hope her films have been sued due to this limitation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> Do not forget that this movie was made in 1985. This movie can still stand against most whips this day, much to say about this movie That's 8-bit Super Mario Brothers, who says that there is a better graphics than the PS3.
