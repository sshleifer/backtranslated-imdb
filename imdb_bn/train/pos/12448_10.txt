First off; I was a devoted fan of Modesty, and I was reading a comic from a child, and I found the previous movie about our heroine dissatisfied, but where they failed, this one rocks! <br /> <br /> Well, we go here: Miss Blaise is working for a casino, a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends. If the robber wins in one round, then he will have to talk about himself. If he wins twice in the row, then a staff member goes free. (Stupid wife, yes, well, I'm not good at understanding) ..);) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Old man in refugee camp and how he escapes, living by his own rules of nature. They look for food, and they teach to read and fight. When they came forward to civilization, they were caught in the war and they were taken for rebellion, they were shot and old people died, which allowed him to meet the city. <br /> <br /> The person he is working for now meets the casino, and the story ends. <br /> <br /> What is followed is a great fight and the line is completely calm. Alexander Staden is a Quarterly Humility Blaise! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Speak loudly, but of course there must be a few existing pronunciation. (It's not saying that everyone speaks this language in Balkan language.) <br /> <br /> The role is really good, even the small bolez must be congratulated! <br /> <br /> <br /> Wherever he is, he's stupid to kill his stupid robber! Completely awesome! : D I can not wait till the next boldness starts in the next movie! <br /> <br /> See it, you will not be disappointed!
