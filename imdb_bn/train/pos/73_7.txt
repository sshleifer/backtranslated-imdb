In both the role and role of Vincent Price, both the movie star, it is a diversity in the House of Mac. In both the films, he plays a talented artist, who is sent on the edge of the time of his creation, managed by other gifted, less talented people. In this movie he played a delusional designer for the stage magicians, who wanted to be disappointed himself in an acting career, when another confusing, Great Rendallo (John Emery) that he agreed to his contract and gave him the first choice of any confusion designed. Priceel has already put Rendal in trouble because his ex-wife is now Ronaldi's lover. He took away the talent and his plans for recognition as a designer and designer, and employed himself as a brilliant example of revenge for Rennley and others. <br /> <br /> Prices get much more show here and as a good man turn a good judge star whose fierce audience gain sympathy. If the colorless and the weight of the entire enterprise is applicable then the price is easily understood. The rest decreases. <br /> <br /> Good Quite B movie, Melodyram, it is a horror movie criminal film and it is enjoyable, which makes you feel like a great composition. Black and white colored shots are low on the cow and it is best viewed as melodrama and its presence stars provide an idiosyncratic performance
