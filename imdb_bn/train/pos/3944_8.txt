This little film had long been on my "champion" list. Did people realize that how stressed, myopozal, mentally tortured women (as well as mentally disturbed) were actually treated by medical profession at the end of the century? !! Religious Motivation All the time, the Christian attitude of those times was lethal for the discovery of true emotional feelings which would allow us to embrace the spirit of suffering, to find out what it means to embrace humanity alone. Can you really imagine (according to today's standards) Walt Whitman's book was banned because he acknowledged the woman as great as feeling and emotional response to the man? Fought for that! The sensitivity of this movie still gets me and I credit myself for holding the director with his eyes.
