A few years ago, I bought several $ 1 DVDs, of which there were two movies. One of them was a Broadway Girl (an alternative title for the Greeks, a word for them) and it's Happy C Lovely. It is basically mistakenly marking a backstage musical comedy which is held in Scotland and a dancer who hits a passenger from Limousine in Millionaire. He came in the dancer and wow, the legs! Caesar Romero is a producer who takes an opportunity on her after leading the leading lady, because she thinks she is dating Millionaire whose car I mentioned. And David Niven, the rich man who is looking at Vera-Allen, is mistaken for a journalist, who wanted to meet him, but Romero stopped him. What I've mentioned may be confusing, but if you're willing to test your brain, it's great for most of the time when watching this charming sculble comedy with the amazing music numbers performed by superb music-by-allen. Romero may be a little upset here, but Nivan's life is confused all over the world. I saw the print actually considered its age and it was actually quite good in that public domain. And because she's not really an actress, Vera-Allen works quite well with her line. So in that note, I recommend the Happy C Lovely for movie buffs who love the old music musicals.
