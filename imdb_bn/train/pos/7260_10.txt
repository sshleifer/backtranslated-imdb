Hi everyone. My name is Laura. I was 13 years old when I was about 4 years old, I saw a curly case and it hit my socks that I saw only about 30 minutes ago that I saw this movie. Alison Porter is really a good actor and I love that picture when she is dealing with cards. Every time I see it at the end of this movie, I cried, I know, I'm only 13 years old, but it's a sensitive story that is really lazy 25 years old. Every time I look at the movie one is always young and the film comes to a year of production and when you see it and understand how harmful the person of the movie is, how much harmful you are. Next. Like Harry Potter. That movie was also great, but Daniel was still about 12 years old in the first movie and I was about 11 years old. So how did he go to the age of 12 to 16 in about four years and I was only 13 years old. I'm not sure that he is 16 right now I think he is about 18 years old, but when you look at a movie and then about 4 years old then it is strange when you were only 1 when you were young. I'm not sure that I have a big imagination and I like to revive it. I'm a computer person but I like to do a lot of kids. I am very smart like a curly case in the movie but one thing I do not like in movies when he calls the feather home and takes a curly case, I would kill the person if he was working in real life. . Well I'm going to stop writing I sometimes know to write but kids have a lot to get out of the head and if they do not, then the kids will not be able to learn. <br /> <br /> Larissa
