I do not think this movie is for everyone. But I saw this weekend in Seattle and I thought it was very interesting. I do not have that hard smile during a movie long time. I have done a great job in the whole cast. You will get a smile from the very first scene through the first moment. I suspect some moviegoers (especially those who take themselves very seriously) will be off their favorite brand. I do not The movie was a real surprise. And the whole theater was roaming around with laughter. I felt that many people enjoyed themselves and happy to spend a good time in film for change. I can not wait to see it again! If you are in the mood of LOL, it is for you. Interesting funny fun!
