Red Rock West is a perfect example of how well a movie can be with a budget. All you need is a smart script, good actor and atmosphere load. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! He played the role in Red Rock and wrongly made for a hit man from Texas mistaken by Wayne (jetty Walsh, his most deadly-but still evil) as the bowler. <br /> <br /> He gave him to kill his wife and it looks like a thief. Just when she gets there, just check her out. He offered twice to kill Owen. The cage just wants to get out of the city with its free money and be sparring lovers. But a series of disasters and depression gives him the result of Jo-Ying in and out of the Red Rock and beyond. Finally, Texas's Dallas (Lily and some kind of sympathetic Dennis Hooper) run-in with Lyle, who is the real Hit of Man in Texas who is helping to make this plot more complicated. <br /> <br /> There was no major release of the RRW, as a result most of the visitors discovered it in the video or cable TV only. In this way, it might look like a TV movie but it is bigger than that. Sick, slow direction, moody score and haoling desert air theater is made for a great movie but you can do these days to watch the DVD at the best HDTV. <br /> <br /> I think the only weak point of the film Lara Flein Boole can feel with the annoying femme fatale nasty dyke-ish hairdo. I certainly would not fall for him, but if you guess that Nick Kage's character is in militant lesbians, then you will accept it.
