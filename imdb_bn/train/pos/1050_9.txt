This wonderful documentary gives us a glimpse into the lives of brave women in Cameroon's judiciary - the police, lawyers and judges. Religious / ethnic background of aggressors and opponents of the country - Differences in money, lack of funds, poverty of people's frustration, multiple languages ​​and multiple legal examples - Differences between these brave, powerful women differ. <br /> <br /> This is a rare thing - a truly inspirational movie that believes little to mankind. Regardless of the persecution we saw in this movie, thanks to these passionate, hard working women, justice is justice. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie is widely available in the United States. More people see this picture, good.
