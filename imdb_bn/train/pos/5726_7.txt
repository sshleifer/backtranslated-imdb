"The Grudge" is a remake of Shimizu's own series of popular Japanese horror films. Shimizu knows that he is not working on something new, so he does whatever he or she wishes to do in his place: He argues and concentrates on giving visitors a fun journey. He usually uses common-known clich√©s associated with ghost stories, but Shimizu plays with this element in a fantastic way. Nonlinear description is not a fascinating way to present a mere hostage but sequence from different perspectives. In the end, I can say that if the only purpose of the horror movie is to fear the audience (likewise a comedy man laughs), this movie is successful with flying colors. I saw it in a theater with the viewers and watching the audience was fun to see. It probably does not play well in your living room.
