Despite what other people said (* cough *), it's always my favorite movie. I do not know how long I was waiting to see it, but eventually I loved, I immediately fell in love. Of course, it is weird, but it only gives more of an exciting smell. For those who do not know, one of the first films of Muchchild Gait and Hayd. They did not do much at all, probably 3 or 4 on each top. So, give them some credit. We all know that Adam Sandler was not the best at first. I believe that they throw some strange situations in there, but I see the best points in this movie, the emotions show up and what's not. Therefore, I will give, and always give, 10 out of this movie 10.
