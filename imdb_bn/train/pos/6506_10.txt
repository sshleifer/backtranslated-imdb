Perfectly bright Strong and evocative The most compelling documentary series related to war Its voice often contradicts the un-hostile attitude towards World War II, which shows the media. Rather than shouting about the horrors of war, the true image of Sir Lawrence Olivier's peace battle allowed the actual seat of the war: dead bodies, explosions, terrible civilians and soldiers everywhere, broken men, liberal politicians, thousands of worthless lives, innocent possession. Most able to live when it is really clear that all the normal rules of humankind "civility" are removed. There is clearly something Hobbesian about humans in the real state of nature, he will return to a more shocking form which is capable of crime which will still be shocked and fascinated for 60 years. Perhaps for the twentieth century, the follow-up series "War of the Century" was a threat to the century. I think this is a huge amount of scandal which happened in an event that created such mandatory and excellent series of deaths of 50 million people.
