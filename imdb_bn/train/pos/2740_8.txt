Fantasizing black and white night painters and its abundance, in the 1950s Kansas highlights the real real account of the massacre, of which a whole family was deleted by two men. <br /> <br /> The story is written by truman kopo, so at the end of the film you will receive a message of Liberal anti-death penalty, which is ridiculous to know the facts of this case. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson have harmed two atheists who have a view on life and unnecessarily killed this beautiful family. <br /> <br /> In the end, despite the annoying slots, it makes an impressive story and cinematography more interesting than ever since. Famous photographer Conrad has done a fantastic job. This makes me want to create more modern shades of black and white. See it DVD. <br /> <br /> Black, Wilson, John Forcoth, Jeff Corrie and the fully supporting cast are wonderful here. In the beginning of April 2005, the third scene of this movie was originally announced, in the real life of Black, the murder of his wife was declared innocent. Nobody can help but Black and this film will look differently after that.
