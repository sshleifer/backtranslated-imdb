Spanish films are not a golden, definitely a silver age. Piedras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflict seriously. Though the feelings are strong or often on the level of life or death, they are still not musicians. This can happen. <br /> <br /> There are different stories, which have been connected. About one bored girl, who does not dare to pass the road to the next block. One middle-aged woman who finds a feet fetishist lover of her life. Another girl leaves the girl's boyfriend on the problem of drugs. Yet another person who has found a true love of prostitution (almost) about Madame. <br /> <br /> must be seen. It took the filmmakers of Spain seriously.
