I saw this movie when it operated the science science theater in 1993. It's the worst thing I've ever seen. To be honest, it is very bad, that this film will get ten ratings because it can be believed. <br /> <br /> Anyone who wrote this script in mind with this scripture should beat them. I mean, really, Satan vs. Santa? The visit of hell? Curious smile wind up Rainier? Child child labor with ethnic stereotype? It's not whale street, sure. While showing MST 3, Crowe said, "It's good ol 'fashion designer fuel!" <br /> <br /> There are many strange weird and ungodly faiths. Marilyn (probably Arthurian Marilyn) with Santa hanging in his crazy palace (like heaven). Santa babies discusses about Jesus and sends "Mr. Stork" letters to children asking for siblings. There are icons around castles that look like ponts or RAF stars. My best friend and I have seen it every year since 1993 and we keep an eye on any person so that we can keep it with us for 2 hours to see it.
