These years I saw one of the best movies! I'm not a Gwyinth Paltrow fan, but he's wonderful as Emma Woodhouse. Alan Simping is pretty as Reverend Elton, and Emma Thompson's sister Sophie, violent as Miss Bates. And check out superb Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley; What a gentleman! Anyone who says that you need sex and violence in a film, never seen Emma to create it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is no longer there. That movie in Emma. With a beautiful setting, wonderful costume, and an outstanding cast (I mentioned the superb Jeremy Nutam?), Emma is a perfect ten!
