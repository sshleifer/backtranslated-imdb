I have reached this end and I was shouting "No, no, no, no! It can not end here! There are many unanswered questions, it is related to Dishwashers? Mona's disappearance? Helmor's unrest?" Jimmy? "Little brother saved his father?" Then I read that at least two custom members passed, and I would say, perhaps I know it would not be true for Lars von Tier's view, but I'm glad to see that the last part of the last thing has been planned. Imagine, it's hard to find someone to play Helmor as a worthy character. Helmer, the doctor you want to hate! I think I still see more self-absorbed, unconscious, self-righteous character on screen! However, I can ignore a change in the actor .... I just know how to end it!
