It starts with the true True Heart and Noble Heart Horse. Noble heart meet Horse Dawn and John and the true heart brings them to see beer. Later, the care meter went further down and True Heart beer and Nobel Heart Horse check it to see whether it is a dark heart, but they can not go before taking care of the club, so they ask Don and John to take care of the club. After returning to the true heart beer and the Nobel Heart Horse, they sent Don and John to the camp. Club and cousin grew up to fight Dark Heart. In the end, Dark Heart is tolerant of all care and the children (Don and John) will unexpectedly tell Christ that the Dark Heart is evil. They work together to save the beer. Later, True Heart Beer and Noble Heart Horses found it a dark heart shadow and came back to the ground in search of their past. The Kid's (Don, John, and Christie) came but they were not strong enough to stop the Dark Heart. True Heart Beer and Noble Heart Horse come to help Don, John and Christie for the release of other care, but Chris goes on the road and is hit by dark heart magic. Christie was hurt more than the Dark Heart and wanted to stop fighting with the caretaker to help her, but that could not be the reason because Dark Heart did not have the ability to care for the Christian. Caring for care and helping kids save Christy's heart in the dark. Now began to care for the Dark Heart and became a real boy in love with Christ. Dark Heart now helps Christian to work on a real boy and camp. <br /> <br /> This is sometimes a great step and the best care beer movie I ever saw. <br /> <br /> Like all carers, and I can not wait to see "Care Bear: Big Wish Movie (2005)" <br /> <br /> Who likes this movie?
