I think it is a great example of the differences between the two cultures. It will be a great movie to show in a sociological class. I was told it was quite funny and I must say that there was a sucker, plot device for "I give the band together and get the job done". It seems that most people do not realize that this movie is not just a comedy. It has some dramatic elements and I think they are nicely mixed. Overall, I give it a hard 8.
