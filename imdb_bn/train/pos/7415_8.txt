How easy and captivating could be making simple quality film This image tells its story in every day view that it prevents hidden privacy. Just as others have said, how this film really makes it clear how Hollywood has had a special effect on it, how the mentality and the higher climate have been lost in the end and forgotten the essence of a meaningful story with simple reality. Most of what is happening through these characters is introduced by the scene instead of the conversation dialogue. There was an aspect I really enjoyed about the movie, in contrast to the two brothers, who are very openly publishers like her child, and the other is able to develop complete emotions but deep emotion. It was a little needed to talk about the older brother, as he did, just as he was facing death! Beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, great direction! Can not be missed!
