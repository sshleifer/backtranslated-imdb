This movie is really a mixed bag. On one hand, the film's story and concept are really good, imagined and there are some nice plot twists on it. But again on the other hand, it is called very slow, without style and uninvolved. Yet I think "Just Coz" just because of the fine cast as the top thriller. <br /> <br /> Shawn Connery may have made a mistake in his role. I mean, he is not a credible believer as the real 'hero' and the father of a young daughter (which is still operated by the young Scarlett Johansson) and Kate Capasau's husband. I think that the role was really old enough to be truly credible for him. However, Shan Connai must be a great actor and the only reason he can convey this film as well is that. Of course, he has helped with a very strong supporting cast that includes actors like Lawrence Fishburn, Blair Underwood, Ned Batty, Hope Lange, Lin Thingen and Ed Harris. All actors are really good but some of them are highly underused at the same time, which is a real shame, as well as a missed opportunity. Especially in Ed Harris as a psychopathic serial killer its role is just great enough. He's really cool and pretty played. Normally he does not play roles in these ruthless movies, so he is really surprised by his role. Because of his performance alone enough to see this movie already. But the story is very style and without much sources, a character in the film does not really work because it seems very remote. <br /> <br /> It is the story of the story that all the movies kill its subtle possibilities. Ern Gleimer runs the film with a little style and sometimes moves very little. For this reason, we do not engage with the story or any of its characters, as the audience. <br /> <br /> It's really bad, because "Just Coz" was more than likely enough. A slick story with a fine cast and some unexpected twists and turns that which does not seem to be anything. Cast and story is that this movie is still the only reason behind the average thriller, which may please please the fan of the section. But it is an eternal shame that there is a lack of storytelling and style, or otherwise this film can be a real classic in its style. <br /> <br /> 7/10
