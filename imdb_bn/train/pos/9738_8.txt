Oh dear, do we not like it when we develop our super-hero love interest brain? <br /> <br /> Something happened to humans, they lost their ability to enjoy, a simple feeling-good, love story / comedy? A revelation to Kirsten Dunst - funny, sexy and real. I smiled at least five times and said, there was a tear twice in my eyes. Cast, acting and script is great, I see many movies across the board, and I saw a scene in this series that was successful. Those who disagree tell me where I will get it! I'm sure the book is good but I think you have to judge on your own merits.
