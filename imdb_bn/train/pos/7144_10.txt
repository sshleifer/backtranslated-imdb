I saw the movie Holes and say that it will be the best movie throughout the year. It finds the baby in everyone. I can understand, who will come up with the idea of ​​crippling boys to dig the hole as their punishment? Who is Louis Savare? Although the film is different from the book, it was still very good. For example Cavannon / Stanley was supposed to be the highest one. According to the weight and height, the zigzag / riki was tall and the major / theodore was large. Also x-ray / rex was supposed to be one of the younger boys but it was not. The only thing I liked about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather motivated and long. I would rather look more than the past but it is just my opinion. I especially liked the boys though. Jack M. Smith played squid / alan like moody and tough baby Jack M. Smith acted just like this and did a great job, as almost all of Hollus's actors So you'll say if you still see the hole, you must definitely see it when it comes back or you will not be completely fun.
