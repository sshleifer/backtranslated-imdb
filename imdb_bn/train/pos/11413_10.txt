I was a great film for kids of 6-12 years old. A little sad, but the story is a fresh uplifting. This proves that a teenage dream can really be true. I think it's a feeling of stories for a child that is feeling uncomfortable, or it seems like trying to wake up a lot of things in them. Very 'cute' film Salad
