As others have mentioned, all the women who are nude in this movie are mostly fantastic. The plot shows the hypocrisy of woman's libido very ably too. They want to follow when people are nearby, but when "men" are not nearby, they are the followers of the 14-year-old boy. And the boy will really become a man (we should be so lucky at this age!). Then he gets the courage to follow his true love.
