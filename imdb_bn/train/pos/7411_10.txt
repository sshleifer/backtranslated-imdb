The essence of happiness and beauty, the pain and suffering of our life, is the ability to recognize our life primarily, so we do not continually strive against that single compelling truth. So doing, we find peace. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The director of this movie showed us this fact but lets us discover our own ways. This is a beautiful but simple story, a novel that played very well. Actors are watching that they are actually living in the house with real people rather than watching actors. <br /> <br /> I have struggled to write the review of this subtle movie so that others are inspired to see it. I am in a loss. The story is about men in a bath house. Sound off a real, does not it? However, nothing can be far from the truth. The American title is shadowed for this photo, but it is the atonement of a major theatrical component of this film, which is a bath I still have a loss. Talking about stories or characters will not judge them. So, how much I enjoyed watching this movie and I would tell you how the experience was touching and moving. I was pretty entertaining. I care deeply for the characters and I care deeply about what happened to them. For a story, it is the highest form of praise. <br /> <br /> If you are removed by the King of Masks or fewer movies, make sure you see the shower. Have Netflix and DVD video and sound quality is excellent. I saw it in the original lanquage with good work and good English subscribe. <br /> <br />
