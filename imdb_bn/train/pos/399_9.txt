This movie is very cool. If you're a fan of Sui Harke and Chinese fantasy movies, you have to love it. This picture is from the Asian Lord of the Ring: a real fantasy story, based on the original Chinese mythology. (I realize that many critics think that this film is plots-less, it seems that they probably have zero knowledge about Chinese mythology.) If you like Stormedrider or the Warrior of Heaven and Earth, then it should be your lane. Although it is purchased with the Crowking Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Iron Monkeys for US film, the film is still very difficult. Good price search !!! This DVD is owned by.
