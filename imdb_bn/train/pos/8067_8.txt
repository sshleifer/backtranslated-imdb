Today if someone mentions Victor McLaglen, then the reaction is "Who?" Or perhaps "why?" Well, believe, Victor McLaughlin won an Academy Award for Best Actor in this film, a poor, depressed person who is willing to sell his best friend for "Carrefour" in the US. This is a funny movie that shows very few meaningful shorts just a few bucks. This movie is held in British-domination Ireland and all other characters are directly or indirectly fighting for the political independence of Ireland, but Mr. McLaggellen's character is concerned about money and drunkenness. The film makes it astonishing that political activism is valuable to all problems, because the workers are struggling to create a point, but many are not only taking care of them, they also do not know what is the problem. The morale of this movie is: Find a friend, he can sell you for the dime.
