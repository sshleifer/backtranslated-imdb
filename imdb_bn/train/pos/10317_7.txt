How do you know star track fans all star track movie flocked even really worse than ones? Why? More than once their heroes see the action. I think about Doc Savage. I was a big fanatic for the character, and had an expectation to see the dock and his crew in adventure. And the first 20 minutes of the movie only increased the feeling of that feeling. Then they decided to run away from some of the Doc Adventures and dropped them into this movie, which resulted in the creation of a few different films. There are many promises here, immersed by unfortunate selections (music, "camp" ingredients), but Doc's soul is there and it responds to those who recognize us doc and his crew. . So, in my long run, what I'm trying to say is that it's not a bad movie: it's not exactly the same. And anyone who is an admirer of Superman, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Bakaru Banjai and many other characters, he just wants to check this movie to be known about the hero who has given them inspiration.
