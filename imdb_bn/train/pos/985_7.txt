The film 'enemy of the state' has come together in many ways with Will Smith and Gene Hackman, because with us all the modern technologies known to humans, an innocent (black) man is following the 'government'. Generally it is a disaster when the story is copied. That does not apply here. Of course I love everything from David Morse, so my comments are not fair, but there was something better about this movie. Chief Baddy, who was operated by Doug Hutchinson, was brilliant, and the stories David Pemar and Robert Pastorelli flowing with such excellent extravagant. Our hero, Alvin Sanders (played by Jamie Fox), but bored most of the parts. He is far from the place, crack the bad joke, evoking any sympathy from the audience. Or do not have to start, the strange thing is that he is growing on you (and also his followers!). I did not expect much when I rented it, but was amazed with a good solid worker movie with comedy bits. 7/10
