Lucino Wisconsin was lighter years than her contemporaries. In the 40's and 50's were the great directors of the Italians, but there was a person of philosophy, Lucino Viccanti, who dared to bring a movie that he was able to show. James Kain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice", based on the famous "Osseini", in the beginning of his famous career, he clearly showed his talent, which was later made by Hollywood, but the version compared to what Wilkins achieved in the film. Lucino Visconti and his collaborators included an undesirable Alberto Moravia on screen, who knew about the effect of emotions on people. <br /> <br /> The film has been protected in the DVD format we have recently seen. The film is a must for all serious film fans because we can see how Wiskenti's vision has been translated into a movie that is a true way of expressing a legitimate way, which lacked the American version. <br /> <br /> The intensity of the movie, which got from its tremendous director. Great Clara has done an amazing work called Kalamai Giovana, who has married an old man, but when Gino appears in his life, what he wants to do is release himself a person who gives him a chance. In the Italian film, Mrs. Kalamai is one of the best Govivani achievements. The latest sequence of the film, Mrs. Kalamai, shows her the best way to act as a moral obligation to the terrorist who committed the crime. <br /> <br /> One of the best actors is his generation, which appears as a genius Geo Giano, fierce people that awakens emotional emotions in Giovanna. The perfect man for Gino Geovana, something that Mr. Along with the Giri project is not equal before the screen with such ease and sophistication. Mr. Girota makes people alive in a performance that seems very easy, but it may not be so clear about another actor. Juan Delanda is seen like Zeuspe, the elderly loves Geovanna. In fact, his character holds quarterly form compared to American movies, where he is seen as a buffoon. <br /> <br /> The picture is nicely photographed by Domenic Skal and Aldo Tonti. They saw the film's natural appearance, which was in favor of the Italian directors of Iraq. Zeusape Rosette's original musical score is perfect. Viscounty, who liked the opera and was a great director, also has Arias with Bizoyt and Verdi who fits well in the film context. <br /> <br /> "Oscation" is a treasure because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of its form.
