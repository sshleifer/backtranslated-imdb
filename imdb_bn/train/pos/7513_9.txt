"The Notarious Betty Page" (2005) <br /> <br /> Directed by: Mary Harron <br /> <br /> Starring: Gretchen Mole, Chris Bowyer, Lily Taylor, Sarah Paulson, and David Strathren <br / < MPA rating: "and" (for nudity, sexual content and for some languages) <br/> <br /> <br /> It seems like today every celebrity is getting biology about her life. Ray Charles to Johnny Cash, Biology is very posh now The latest "The Notary Betty Page" to be released from the DVD. It illustrates the world's most popular pin-up model, Gretchen Mole as Betty Page, and is mostly portrayed in some parts of black color. Unlike "Ray", "Walk the Line" and "Finding Nevland", this film is not going to be the one to watch this year's Oscars. This film lacks the mental resonance shown in other biologicals, and the most dramatic moments of Betty Page's life are completely ignored or only suggested. This does not mean that it is a bad movie. In fact, "The Notary Betty Page" is a thoroughly entertaining and full-length movie - a tough job in the film. This image focuses on the page's exciting career and slim lines between sex and pornography. It is animated and caring with care and the side of Mary Haran captures the look and feel of the time, because most filmmakers only dream. <br /> <br /> Everyone knows Betty Page (powered by Mol). Do you know him as an icon ?? Or an easy porn star ?? You know him He is a woman who is very much influenced by American culture, more than just the right consideration at that particular time. Now, most people recognize him as America's first sexual symbol - a legend of many models, especially especially in Playboy and other adult-oriented magazines. He lived in a time when someone with an inch of meat below the waste could be arrested and the page's slavery-style photos could only make the American people excited. In fact, the pictures have begun a full Senate investigation into the differences between general emptiness and harmful films and obscenity. <br /> <br /> <br /> Its performance as Betty Page is just brilliant. I realized that when he announced for the role, many were suspicious. His name is not the one that leaps my mind immediately when I think of great performance. Now, it will be. He fully assures the role and draws me with his weak and yet deeply engaging performance. Last year's "Good Night, and Good Luck", David Strathren is one of the best newest performers of 2005. Here, he gives a more subtle performance? Although he is a little underused I was amazed at how limited the screen time was? But quality is always the most important aspect of a good movie. The only performance I saw from Lily Taylor was "The Hunting" (1999). Although most people ignore the movie, I think it's enjoyable if not completely shallow, horror movies, and I always thought that Taylor was completely believable as emotionally confusing nail. Here, Taylor still gives another credible performance. He gives a very humble performance and Gretchen Mol praises that gives perfect performance. <br /> <br /> After all things have been said and done, I realized that "infamous betty pages" can not be compared with other biology, such as "Neverland quest" and "Line Walk". It is impossible because it tells a story of a woman and her career, from beginning to end. His personal life is briefly mentioned, but its impact on the world that it really has high impact. How did we know that this page will eventually survive and we know the effect of its decision? But we rarely showed his influence in his personal life. She could not look back that a woman and constantly reinvent herself. After all, he turned an adult model Christian missionary. This movie is not something dramatic. It may be fiercely sobbing the page's imaginary moment and may include begging him to forgive God. Could it be trying to escape from its past Scratch, screaming through the pages running and rain ?? And not yet. "Infamous Batty Pages" tells a simple story and it's something rare with today's standards. Fortunately, it is quite refreshing. The final thought: "The Cottage Betty Page" is a shocking movie with absolutely great cinematography. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: 9/10 (A)
