I do not know the big, or modern Chinese teenage music - but when I see it I know a thoroughly entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Everybody looks like it was so much fun to make - the production prices are excellent - and modern China shows Glasier than here in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> The plot of abandoned orphan is very good to grow up in Kung Fu School and then to play basketball (and love and more etc.) Superstood - it's fresh, fun, and extremely entertaining <br /> <br /> < > It's easy to enjoy all these ways with great action and good conversations - and one of the best family movies we see for a long time on our money. <br /> <br /> <br /> Please ignore negative reviews and sink an opportunity - we were really happy - a good sports comedy movie.
