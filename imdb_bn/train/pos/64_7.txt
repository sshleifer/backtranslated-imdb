This is Paul F. Ryan's first and only full length features. He did not do anything. However, he managed to cast an amazing ensemble in order to illustrate his story characters. I do not know when or why this idea emerges on its head, but Ryan wrote a screenplay that later became his own home movie "Home Room". <br /> <br /> Busy Philips carries a movie on her shoulder. Alicia, a troubled girl; We always see in the television series. With dark hair and black clothes; Cigarette packages in pockets, weird looks and annoying eyes (with makeup, of course). An incident happened in his school; A shooting Some students have died, and he saw everything. Now Detectives Martin Van Jund (Victor Garber) is investigating the case, and, as expected, Alisia suspects. But shooting is just gestures; The movie is not about shooting. <br /> <br /> Diana Cartier (Erica Crissen), who is lying in the hospital room. She is one of the survivors in the hospital. Principal of Script School (James Pickens Jr.), established a bond among them. He is helping all students recover from the event, but Alisia is not cared for. He is isolated So Principal punishes him; He must go to the wings every day for five hours. Then the movie starts. <br /> <br /> I can not even imagine how wonderful the film is written. I can identify with the characters and the circumstances they live; I like the reality. None of these things can happen. And what they say is fully understood. They are growing up and trying to deal with the experience they have experienced; They're doing their best. After learning this, Alicia (when she meets Dinar for the first time) and Deba (when she shows Alicia in front of her), her journey will begin to define her personality and ideas for the next step of her life; After high school <br /> <br /> Director Christensen and Phillips very well manage their role. See the contrast between them. Deanna feels with homemade and flat thinking; No complications inside her mind When Alicia enters her house and sees a lot of flowers, she asks: "Who has brought them?". "Many people", the wing answered; Although after some days we learned that they came from their parents, who come every week. Parental statistics are all well represented, but the characters of their boys are not as important. Debt alone Alicia looks mature and violent; Smoking cigarettes and talking about. But after visiting the two days, he returned to the hospital himself every day; Even sleep in the dinner room all night. When there is war after both of them, I believe, the wing says: "Why are you coming back?" Alicia is very lonely too. <br /> <br /> It is destroyed without ending the film; It was something I was not waiting for. It eliminates some of the power of the movie. The revelation comes completely unnecessary; The logical climax might lose the movie. This is a nice script anyway; And a nice direction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was when Erica Christensen played a role to make it fly higher. His role was printed on "Traffic", but it was a big step; Main role. Perhaps there was not much chance for him to see in this film, and it is a sad thing. She is not a false step since then. He has even come out with awesome performances in the terrible movie. On the other hand, busy Phillips, who is very committed in this movie (no transformation), there are not many opportunities for his other roles. <br /> <br /> I talk about Paul F. Ryan as well. (Under the guise of curse), and I hope he is now sitting on his computer, completing his new script; I'm waiting for his next movie. I hope the best for all of them.
