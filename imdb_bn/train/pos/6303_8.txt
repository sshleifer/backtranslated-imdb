To hear quite a positive reviews and watch the trailer I was watching this movie. William H. Messi, Luis Guzman, Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell were also present. And it delivers it. Overall, the film crack-up is not funny, but a scene that really stands and it's a classic in my eyes. At the end of the Spirari, they broke the wall to reach safely, and we looked at Rockwell and Waterseer's jitter. It's great as the scene in The Big Lebowski, where Dude is using a chair to barricades its door, but the door is turning outdoors! The last spinner just goes to see this movie, you will not be disappointed.
