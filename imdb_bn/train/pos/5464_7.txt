Babefees - The infamous Barber Stanwick is telling her that she has power with her local Professor Prince - she is trying to read him night-to-night - she says that books do not do any good to her. We soon know that his father is primarily pumping. Local politicians and others have him out. Finally he got enough cities and moved to the big city. We follow the path of the men until the ladder of success in the international bank.
