Between seventeen years of all films, no one was caught in the perfect void of good versus evil war like Sentinel. I mean, yes, there were movies like Exosiist, and others; But some of them captures the elements of heroes like this. If you have time, check out this one out. You will not be able to get past like dated devices, but this is a story that is worth getting. Then all stars and soon they can be. My best friend was Eli Walach, Sylvia Miles and Barge's Meridith. Then there are very clear sources that also lead to what is happening. Pay close attention. I had to see it four times to hold small strange statements like 'black and white cat, black and white cake'. Plus, the book is really good as well. I am sorry that they can not make the second book a movie. It is so scary that it will overtake this movie.
