I have never heard of this movie before watching it, I thought it was an independent movie, and I was right, but with a good cast I decided to do it. Originally Drift, Michael Williams (Nicholas Cage), looking for a job in the city of Red Rock, Waiming, and repeatedly met with owner Wayne Brown (Jetty Walsh of Plaztville), he was paid a lot of money, he was unreliable to Hit Man's mistake. The tenants for the murder of Sujane (Lara Flynn Boole) He does not correct him, does not take money and goes to warn Sujon and he forces him, he decides that he has to leave. When Owen knew his real identity, he beat Michael with a big gun until he took Dale (Dennis Hooper) car from Lail. But when Michael realized that he had misunderstood Lail Hit Man, he was a little complicated and he was quick to rush. He returned to Suzanne and knew that they are in both hazards, they are planning to go together in the city, and fall apart for each other, adding another complexity. However, before they leave, they go to Suzanne and steal a large amount of money safely. Of course, things are not going to go smoothly, and Wayne and Lyle can catch them, and Lyle forces them, and now to get the money to bake Owen and bury. In the end, both Lyle and Wayne received what they had earned, Michael and Suzanne were able to get on a running train, but it is clear that she thinks more about money, and she gets what she deserves. Jim Johnson played in Craig Rey, John Johnson, Van Johnson, David Matt Greatak, Timothy Carhat as Duke Yakam as a truck driver and Robert Apple as Howard. Probably without a hair-boyle performance, all fine and sandy, and it has a great film Noir feeling for a black comedy thriller. very good!
