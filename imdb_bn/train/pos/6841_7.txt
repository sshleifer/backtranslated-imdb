This is probably one of Brian de Palmer's best movies but it is not his best. Body Double, Furry and Kerry are good movies but this movie is better than Blu out and Invitation. De Palma is very influenced by Hitcoak and this movie is taken on a Cyco. Angelina Dickinson closed the offer after a psychotic housewife, who had thought of having a relationship and played Michael Kane, Dickinson showed a man in an art gallery and he was sleeping with her. After this point you know what is not good at it but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who saw the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective in this case who does not really believe in Allen and must find himself a murderer. This is a great movie but Palma is not the best.
