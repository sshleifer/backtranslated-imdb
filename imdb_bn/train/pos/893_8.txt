Samo Hong's 1989 film, Pedikab Driver, is considered as one of his best works. As a Hong Kong film is sometimes incredible and pretty, I have to agree a bit to transform the film into its greatest part. It is a very good and well-written play, attractive and sympathetic (and non-sympathetic) characters, some really funny trick and really the combination of the top-notch hyper kung fu which guarantees to drop many jaws if not known. Hong Kong shows this film with cinemas as well as it is also for experienced artists of the unique industry. <br /> <br /> Samo and Max Mike Siew Chong are running two pedikag drivers who are in the middle of Hong Kong last century, I think. They drive their cabs and are frustrated for love. Samo is interested in local unemployed girl Ping (Nina Lee Chi), when Max meets with a mysterious and beautiful fiancee Yuan Kit-Eing, he becomes crazy in love. Many other characters are also present, and the audience really focuses on the film and its plot, but they are quite clear, so I can not say the film is confusing because it can be worse in Hong Kong! Soon we know that a cruel gangster family is terrorizing the neighborhood and of course their violent actions affect our drama, and so most incredibly the basis for the continuation of the dancer Kung Fu war. As well as some excellent plays. <br /> <br /> The image is a great cast. Leeds is all very well and restrained (for example, Sammo's otherwise Great Eastern Condors (1987) as played over painfully awful and not as "humorous", and they are carefully identified with the written playplay, commendable, desired and easy. Cinema face and director Correa Yuevan Kawai (legendary action director and movie director of the War of Liberation War of 1 and 2, Dragon's Small and minor role-playing director, Genge and Fong Saike, UK 1 and 2), the Southern musician Lowell Low Qun-Ting (John Wan's The Killer and Ringo Lames School on Fire and Carriage on Fire, among others, includes pedikab drivers!), Shaw veteran Liu Chia Liang (with which Samo sticks to the fierce battle) Alfred Cheng-King Tang (since the dark H.Q. silent classic on the run since 1988), the great great Lam Ching Ying RA HK vampire horror / kung fu / kamayadite known for his friendly face) name just a few. In fact, the driver cast pedikyaba any other product I have seen the most interesting hockey. <br /> <br /> There are several interesting moments about the love relationship between Max Mok and Fioni. Yuan and a crisis thank the character of Lowell Low. If they talk about the true values ​​and the meaning of love, they really could have done it very seriously, it does not matter what has been done for your past or your living, it is so serious and really effective in the middle part that the film is immediately our average Kungfu visual Gets much more significant than the worker. Attempts to heal things from other characters are also very sensitive and for the right people's relationship and friendship, and of course, they can say a lot of fun for love. Still I think what Fanny Mac says (about "bad cooking" of the future) is very unreasonable and pulls the functionality of the whole department and its themes quite effectively. Unfortunately <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Movie makers were most interested. What is this, operational and final step? The scene includes traditional Kung Fu, some sticks, meat cleavers and choices and they are never seen here in any film, Jackie Chan's Draken Master II (1994), they really are great! There are cables and they are used very cleverly and when they are kicked or punched, people literally fly in the opposite corner of the house. Just amazing and can again distribute some Hong Kong movies. The hazardous stunts also keep its breath in sight because the film quickly shocks the car with velocity velocity and the dangerous hazardous findings and winds through the air and the strongest destination. Still, filmmakers do not consider the film's violence as "acceptable", like Samo, like late Bruce Lee, is willing to give up after the final assassination of the gangster Vila, and I think this kind of morale, no matter how clear it may be or is shallow , Even in ruthless movies like this one is a good thing, because the film is far more than just an intelligent entertainer. <br /> <br /> There are a few different bits of this movie Humor I am not sure whether everyone in Hollywood or in America (for example) can understand or like. The Sunny Star Gaga is clearly in the beginning and I understand what I saw and literally force me to laugh. Also some funny scenes are made out of Sammo's passion for ping. Nevertheless, the greatest wonder-filled smile came in the scenes painted in the previous paragraphs, such as the images of big and tall people flying in the wall or furniture with huge power on the screen is just INSANE and so exciting, I just can not hide my feelings and think about these eastern filmmakers when When I see something like this, it is definitely positive and the rhythm Asucaka is nothing more than a reaction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < If there are not many small flaws, it can even grow at even higher and higher rates. 8/10
