I liked this movie a lot. Animation is working well and romance was beautiful. I liked most of Brian Adams and the score of Hans Geimmer was excellent. Many do not understand how well it relates to dark heart / apocalypse themes (which is "civilization" when someone attacks elses home, what does it mean to be "civilized"?). The opening scene and the music were very stirring. This image is a wonderful event in America that was once beautiful.
