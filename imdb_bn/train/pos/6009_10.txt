Mark Frechette stars Mark as a college, fundamental leftist. During a campus riot, a policeman was murdered, and he flees all the way to the desert. He stole a small plane at the local airport and did it himself. <br /> <br /> Once upon a time flying over the desert, Mark gave a car to the wind. A young girl named Daria gradually watched Mark. Mark swoops flat on the plane much less, Daria Duck or the reason to get hit. When he occupied the land, he met Daya, who was surprised by Mark's sky hygiene. <br /> <br /> After being involved in a few hours of confident conversation, Mark and Daria become nude and love the sand. But Mark breaks the law, they realized that he must continue. So the concerted effort of Mark and Daria is quite curious, because it does not develop in full swing romance. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " His character was in the film on Frigate, as if the person was unknown. A few years after the making of jabrisky points, Frayt was robbed in a real-life bank. While giving sentence to his prison, Mark died of an unknown death. He died by weighing 150 pounds, when he fell on him during weight loss. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the great cinematography, and special visual effects. After an explosion, the incredible, slow scenes of floating debris in the air were a gifted genius. Although a film as Easy Rider was not ground-breaking, the Jobrski point was revived with the first counter culture of the 70's. I recommend it, those who love the anti-garde movies that show the uprising of the youth rebellion in the early 70's.
