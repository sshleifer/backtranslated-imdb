What are all comments on Europeans (especially England)? I would all say that when I first saw the movie for 13 years, I thought it was fantastic. Of course it's stupid. That's the real thing. To get the whole joke behind this movie you will see Dr. Strangelov and Men in Black, but come to the people, what do you want to see? I can think of a lot of movies which are much worse than this, and they are costly for Hollywood movies with real actors among them. For what it's worth, White In-Men is a very stupid-funny knock in a movie. And the stupid things that have been created for the last half century of England, I am surprised at all the negative comments. Our stupid humorous stupid Americans like us. PSS, see 'Team America: World Police' some really laughs that the Europeans would especially like.
