Victor Vargas Raising is a movie you really need to see. It was very hearty and there was a lot of humor that caused you to suck properly. It's like real life that teens have to go through. Victor, a cocky teen, but deals with love in the right place at all deal with a good heart girl and family at the end. Eventually, after dealing with Victor's old clothes, the true meaning of love is understood and she is actually using that girl she wants to use. I recommend people to show this movie because it will be as if you are watching the real family. Thats how many feelings this movie has. There was a heart felt moment when Victor's grandmother threw the winner on some easy. Victor was really heart and could not believe he would do something like that. It feels real sad for me like it was real. Overall I give this movie a B +
