I know, I know: it's a child. But I just love this type of movie. A bird that suffered many "accidents" and still lost her faith in humanity and humor. What is special about this movie is that the main character is Polly-Tottakpakhi - and he does not use some hot-headed human act as encouragement. Besides, I like the story: Polly told her toilets cleaner that she hit the rock bottom. (The way J. Moher's voice sounds like Joe Pacey!). And of course Cheyen Marin, the man is ridiculous to me. Since I saw "Smoke In Up Smoke", I have accomplished her normal behavior, makes the simple situation laughable .. she can not help herself.
