This movie surprised me in a good way. From the box I think it was an action thriller but it was very interesting to be an adventurer, although it was somewhat exciting. <br /> <br /> There are many beautiful one-fishing and fun situations that were born in this movie and James Belushi Bill Manucci, he did a great job. The rest of the cast is not bad at worst and especially a treatment of Timothy Dalton. <br /> <br /> The picture shows new characters while the story may be quite confusing. Things get complicated as someone is rarely telling the truth about things. If you do not pay attention but eventually get a little dirty, I really like it. <br /> <br /> Louis Mornoo does not know all that, but he has done the job perfectly. I was not really indifferent when watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Made men can experiment well.
