Television is a landmark in the art of shaking Davis. Everything is respecting Amelie and Tim Burton, but in a world where the new ideas are rarely rare, this show will ensure that it does not matter whether it's fresh or not. It's just brilliant. <br /> <br /> I started submerging, intelligent writing, backdrop, and dialogue from the beginning, making this show the most incredible composition from Shield and The Wire (okay, but Pishing Daisy's beauty does not compare it to television) . <br /> <br /> Truly addiction and complete pleasure. Perhaps one of the pimakers like pies mentioned in such tantalizing ways.
