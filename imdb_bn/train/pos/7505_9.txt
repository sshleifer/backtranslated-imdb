If there is a section that I am never fan, then it is biology. Always confusing, filled with false information, over-theatrical scenes, and playful around, biology is almost never accurate. Even in the hands of truly talented managers like Martin Scorsese (The Aviator) and Ron Howard (a beautiful mind), they often do wonderful things for people trying to capture on the screen. On the way to the Big Screen on skepticism, most of the biopics took place, and the notorious BT page was different. Some critics and cinematographers betrayed Gretchen MÃ¶ll as the role of Page, he was no longer a celebrity, and was not a part of the part. I could never hesitate to manage this part of Mole, but I did not expect to fly away with his performance since I was just watching the movie hours earlier. As a pin-up girl of the 1950s, Mol was given the role of Oscar for the first time, who for the first time abused and abused (later festive and transparently portrayed, some directors would probably do) unknowingly talk about most models of all time. The film still has many places in spite of having three concubines in more than 90 minutes, but there is still a feeling that a small part of the story may be missing. The director / co-authors Mary Harron and Giniver Turner's fantastic script only beat up very casually and it is not clear until it's over. Nevertheless, credit should be given to two women almost stupid biophic, which motivates them to respect and both, and it imitates efficiently in the decade. Come to Oscar's time, Mole, Turner, and Harron got nominations. It will happen, although no three women are more qualified to them. 9/10
