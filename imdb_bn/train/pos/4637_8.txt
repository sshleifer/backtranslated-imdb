During the weekend of this guard duty, he met a young Palestinian Ashraf (Yusuf Joe 'Sweden), and found a mutual attraction. Three friends decided to take shelter in Ashraf (whom they named by an Israeli name), stoveway, and while Ashraf and Noah lived in a relationship of love, Eli appointed Ashraf in his caf√©, and Eli and Lulu continue to find love interests, Too much Ashraf will have to return home to marry his sister until all is well. Though Tel Aviv has been able to be gay openly with Noam in favor of Ashraf, life in Jerusalem is much different: Ashraf has been told that he has to marry his sister's sister-in-law. In an effort to save Ashraf from his fate, Noam and Lulu Ashraf made themselves as a French journalist for the sake of access. In a moment, Noam and Ashraf were kissing and marrying Ashraf and giving it the reason for blackmail to 'stay in the cottage'. <br /> <br /> The youths of Tel Aviv danced to an event to attract attention for peaceful coexistence, an attack in Jerusalem - in which there is not only immediate consequences, Ashraf should also guess in the revenge mission.

This story finds the right balance between serious and light hearts, and this balance is better than making it a good writer / director. More people will see this important and very fine film.
