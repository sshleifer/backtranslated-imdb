I did not expect to do things like Gekt and Hayd as well as I did not, and I do not expect it to be thrown into an artistic film that has enough diversity to maintain your interest and enough diversity. This movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me, and I look for the next movie like this. I especially liked it as a vampire movie, but it was not a Chess vampire jarring, and it does not embellish that reality. Characters were characteristics of all people. The way to increase the characters' growth was incredibly delicious and it makes you feel sorry for them throughout their life. I give up to two thumbs up this movie. In the last five years, I must have seen the best film.
