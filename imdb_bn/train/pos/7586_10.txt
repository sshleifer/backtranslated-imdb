L'Hypoth√®se du Tale Vol / The Hypotheses of the Churing Painting (1979) An old, three-story parlor apartment building begins on the premises. Inside, we see the collector, an elderly person who clearly dedicates his life to the study of six known images of Toner, an artificial Impressionist painter. A narrator reads epigraphs about art and painting, and then involved in the dialogue with the collector, who describes the imagery to us, shows us, imagines us a little about painting and scandal, and then he is going to show us something .... < br /> <br /> When he enters a door, we enter the other world, or the world, or Probably can exceed the limit to exceed the other limits.

And so, and so on. Each room, each description, leads us deeper into a labyrinth, and all the time collector and narrator are verifying their individual monologues, very often in dialogue, but mostly in separate and separate stay.
