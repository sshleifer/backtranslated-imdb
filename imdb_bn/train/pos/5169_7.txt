In 1998 or 1999, I saw the last five or ten minutes of this film one night when I used to surf the channel before going to bed, and really like what I saw. Then I hid, scoring the TV list, flip through the stores with the DVD / VHS rack, but recently I did not receive a copy when selling it on some internet stores. Then, being a world-class procrastinator, I have not ordered it yet. Finally, when I visited Portland, I found a DVD copy in Circuit City, or a few weeks ago. It took me just a month after I was sitting in the house to sit down. <br /> <br /> So, what do I think about the film? It's good. I think so well and do not expect it, but it's also worth $ 9.99. After watching the whole movie for the first time, I rated it 7/10 and got 8/10. I'll try to sleep less then, and there are a good sound system to avoid for reducing some dialogue.
