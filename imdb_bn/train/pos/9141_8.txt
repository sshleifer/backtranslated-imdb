You can debate Prince's acting talent, even in this movie he can choose to parody his own life. There is no debate about her musical talent either now or now. He looks like a galaxy-twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and pretty. <br /> <br /> Living with graduation in this movie (postgraduate high school '85) I can tell you that there was nothing big at that time. Tipper Gorer (Al's wife) tried to censor the "Little Nicky" and anything else under the sun, through the PMRC (Parents Music Resource Center) in every "air band" in the prince, it was the most hot thing. For at least a few weeks, Prince Madonna and Michael Jackson were bigger than. <br /> <br /> We all waited for the film and were excited at the premiere. It's not frustrating. Everyone was caught. I was then an MTV junky (actually they actually play music ... all the time) Prince played at least one or two hours a day. I must say this commentary that at that time my choices were Billy Idol, Ongo Boingo, The Fix, Flock of Seagulls and others in 'Punk / New Wave' style, 'Prince's music all the time and style crossed. . Some of these seem so impressive and hesitant that it was big. All the things that reminds you of the 80's were only symbolic. It was mainstream and it seems like a clich√© now. It became so ridiculous that it is so popular. It's like Randy's Hamburger's Granny commercial. <br /> <br /> It's now stupid because everyone was caught by this (sadly, an odd eggplant McArena or something like that.) However, I hope it gives you all the insights.
