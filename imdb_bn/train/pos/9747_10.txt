After the first film came out in 1982, I thought of seeing this picture. About four years later, in New York (Toscana) I had the privilege of singing Lukanya Pavarota in the Metropolitan Opera House, so the end of this movie reminded me a lot of that great night. Do not like this picture? The music was brilliant and Pavarotti (Finney) was the best and still looked great. The story is actually very funny and the 'Battle of Food' scene is one of the most fun I've ever seen. The hot air balloon flight in the Napa Valley was beautiful and sang "We love if" the song sings (a song in English several times in Poverty). And listen to the duo of Santa Lucia Pretty. The real people got it, this was a movie about an opera singer named Georgia Finney, who only played the Powaritei. Catherine Harold and Eddie Albert were excellent in their supporting roles. <br /> <br /> I am very happy that I still wear VHS tape of this movie, but I want to release it in DVDs especially Pavarota is not with us because I think that Nisune Derma is the best actor in the film today.
