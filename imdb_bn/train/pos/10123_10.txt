Shinjuku Triad Society: The Chinese mafia wars are not likely to be distributed outside the western film festival in West Bengal. Why? Your sensors can be beaten in the belly of a film where police men try to talk to men and women suspects (and enjoy victims) or watch an elderly woman dragging her eyes on her forehead? This exaggerated police and gangsters have just a few shorts in the store for the audience of stories. It has been banned for the year in the UK for Clockwork Orange, which looks like Disney Cartoon <br /> <br /> Do you see this movie? Yes it is fantastic and essential for asian movie fans to see. There are threatened moments illustrating what these characters are world goers. If you make sure that you are dead or alive which is very similar to the catch (of course without the insane ending in the DOO). Great for Japan, such as Taksi Kitano also works at the same time. The DVD is the best chance to watch this movie outside of a Tuxedi Mike at a movie festival. If I do not try to find you Hong Kong version on the web, then make sure that it will come to that country.
