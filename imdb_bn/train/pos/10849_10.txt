This is probably the best rocketry - British, well it's spinal tap. The characters are credible, the plot is great, and you can be truly sympathetic to the events - like Ray's problem with fitting in the band. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack is excellent. Real-time stuff, even if it's in the same key, but you'll do hamming songs for a few days I liked almost all the British cast, with some favorite family names. Ray's wife invaluable ... <br /> <br /> The film never gets dragged, it just moves at a speed and there are some real interesting parts in it. Some really good catchphrases are a generator! <br /> <br /> This is a hidden diamond.
