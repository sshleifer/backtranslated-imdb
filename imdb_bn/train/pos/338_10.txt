I watched this movie at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam, and had the privilege of meeting director and Tobias Snybabam, all of whom are alive and candid in New York. Keep the title of the Amsterdam movie The River on the Right Wright, makes the sensational view of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. It was also equally important to be loving - and gay-related Tobias Schnebamam, who was studied as an anthropologist. At the age of 80, his reunion and inevitable holidays were very much up to date. I can only recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is something other than pedestrians.
