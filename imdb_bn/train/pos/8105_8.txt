SYNOPSIS 1939 In the future seen from England. After the war like Europe, mankind's salvation will not be available in the past politics. It's a brave science on the new world to overcome the past mistakes of people. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Thinking outside the box can be bright tomorrow. There will always be descent and fear, and our only hope is to learn to overcome it. <br /> <br /> <br /> I have seen this photo long ago and recently it has been downloaded from the Internet (it is a public domain). This is an impressive work of numerous levels. Since it is a story about the future, it has obvious errors since 1939. This aspect of the future is both horrific and alarming. This picture was cut for his day. Special effects as story lines are very good. The actress suffers from some of the British theater, in which she can shake a bit towards Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> One of the underlying themes of the film is that science and technology can solve all our problems, which we now know is not always true. Other plot-line films are the charismatic leaders who are curse of human existence and probably live with us. <br /> <br /> The film will be seen almost all over the science fiction film. The set design and outfit of "Forbidden Planet", "2001: A Space Odesi" technology failures, even the lovely landscape / city-scenes of "Star Wars" give some inspiration to this movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie makes the viewer a little annoying. When they are optimistic about the last hierarchy to reach for the difference, we are surprised that mankind can never make it. Even if we reach, there are some who are trying to keep us on. The future of this movie is a little abstract by the dream of today's dream. Large flying machines and guns that can shoot people in places, have never been implemented in the real world, but in 1939 they are considered as the next logical step. <br /> <br /> There are many great British actors young people in this movie. Cedric Hardwicke and Ralph Richardson are most recognized and their spoken skills are clear here. Raymond Messi is a strange character in the main character, playing the cabal. The new character is often sent to the new world for the destruction of science. <br /> <br /> This is a good part of movie history which today's themes are still relevant. Mark's future missed the mark.
