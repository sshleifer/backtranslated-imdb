"Things about my folks" came as a surprise. We did not have any idea what to expect. This movie, directed by Raymond Defiliter, and a star based on Paul Reisier's screen play, is a happy time for movies. Although the film is predictable and we know what will be the outcome, it is a journey of discovery where Ben first asked his father for the first time in his life, Ben did not see for his father exactly what he had said, and <br /> <br /> the picture was by his star, Peter Falkle It seems like a car, and he hoped that it will run with the film. In this era and in the past years, the most popular actor in the film, Mr. Folk is an actor of such a joke, he must count. Like Ben's remote father Sam Clemens, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood by Ben, but it is shown to the whole family and his wife for 40 years. <br /> <br /> When Muriel escaped from Kleinman's native tongue, everyone became scared because this woman, who was a strong family member, is all important to stay together. While knowing where he went, Sam seems confused at Ben's house, suddenly he wins the woman he married and he was faithful for years. <br /> <br /> She wants to make a trip to find her father's house so that she can bring her family out of Manhattan. This tour gives Ben the excuse to bond with his father, just as he never knew, because the old man always presented a different picture to his younger son. Alongside the path, father and son realize how much they love each other and how miserable their children are during adolescence. Sam's love for the mueling spans many years they know each other; They seem integral. <br /> <br /> In the picture, Peter Folk is pretty fantastic. He makes an excellent Sam Kleinman, who suddenly understands his life, that people are changing for the worst. Mr. Falk gets brighter like an old man and there is no false movement in the interpretation of whose world is growing under it. <br /> <br /> No Paul Reais fan, we must admit that he is right. Ben and his father discover how common their love for both of them and the mueller, the mother who devoted her body to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis is only seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as a fleeing mother Elizabeth Parkinson plays Rachel with a brilliant style. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful look for Dan Gilham's cinematography and Steve Argenta's excellent music industry. Finally, the film has written for its director, DeFelita and Paul Reiser's screen, one of which shows a great team effort. <br /> <br /> Although this film is definitely targeted for older viewers, it will make someone happy.
