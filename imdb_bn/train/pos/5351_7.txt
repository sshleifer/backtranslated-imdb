Although this image is filled with some eighty thousand cheese, my DVD RAW has a place for it and I do not know why. I like it because the story's moral 'television is garbage so stop it and go and get a life.' If you decide to pay attention to those messages then you should try reading the book, it's nothing like film. At the end of the story, it ends up crashing in a seriously damaged Richards Network building, destroying it for yourself, killing yourself inside and closing the network simultaneously. I read it many years ago but it would be difficult to compare it to 9/11.
