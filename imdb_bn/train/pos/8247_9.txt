As soon as I heard about this picture, I knew I had to check it out. Well, I heard about it, then I could not find the trailer. After that, when I knew that I had to see it. And i'm so happy i Do you want to see classic television zombies mixed? Any? Then go lost. <br /> <br /> FIDO is the movie I have ever seen. Well, actually, it's kind of like that. It's kind of like a lassie episode and a zombie. Although combined, it feels completely new and original. About FIDO Timmy and a young boy named Fido, his new pet. Well this new pet is not a squawking parakeet or some potty trained puppy. This is a re-animated dead guy ... a zombie. A huge radiation cloud consume the earth which raises all of the dead, which started the Zumbo war. Although Jimcock's lead scientist Reynold Geiger's genius, although he has discovered that if you destroy the brain, then Jimmy will be destroyed and thus will give us the edge and win in a militant war. Although due to linking radiation, anyone who dies has become a zombie. Which may be a problem especially with the elderly. Although Jomcom is moving forward with more success, especially with the dynamite caller. Caller closes the requirements of the zombies for the human body and thus, it is cruel as a pet. But this is not perfect in this jumba utopatia, the factory breaks down, old people die and .... I will let you see this incredibly unique flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With an all-star cast, and great writing, Fido has grown the most in comedy / horror genre. There were lots of fun and real situations that really entertained me. Even after watching the film, I personally think the film will be good in black and white. In less than 90 minutes the movie can not go on for a long time and visually moves from view to scene. It would never end up to be a genius classic type because it does not really make a smile out loud comedy or even a horror movie. This is a comedy / family / zombie movie that was submerged in the 1950s. If you say anything then I said check out this picture here. But if you are still traveling, swipe back on your feet and stay there. 8.5 outta 10
