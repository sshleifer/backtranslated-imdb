It takes a long time to find the title in Berlin on a special videoway and I was lucky to find the English version with the Holland Undertles. I think it's one of the best horrormovies ever. It seems weird that some people call this movie a black comedy. I have to admit, I never smiled at seeing it when I first saw it (and it was the same for the second time!) Trelkowski feels very nice and even beautiful in his shy manner, but on the other hand he hits this boy in the playground And there is no explanation for this. But the most tedious thing is that his conversion to Simona Chawl and the truth, he does not know, who he really is. Her hallujinations are the most awesome of this movie. Of course it is in his mind, but is it the plane that spawned this woman's direction or was it even before it moved - I think this is an interesting question. His schizophrenic behavior is difficult to understand and it is terrible to see his two sides or contacts in a fight against each other. As a result, he jumped his arm first and then jumped from his window. But this terrible tears - what does that mean, that everyone will repeat again and again ... his soul has a cage or something? And this Egyptian Hieroglyph and other Egyptian stuff? In fact, he looks like a mummy in the hospital - that's not an incident, but a formula of my perspective.
