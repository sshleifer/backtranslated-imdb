* Can contain spoilers * * spoilers * <br /> <br /> At the age of Shake (film) and Pixar (studio), this is a much more traditional animated film. It combines some characters that will not usually be seen together (not to mention, preserve a human baby and bring it back to its father). They start as enemies and end up as the best friends. If it is a word (like the Disney film) it is (made by 20th century fox). The movie trailer is one of the best I've seen in ages, but the movie trailer set does not live up to expectations. The makers of the film are the liars with the problem of the filmmakers who do not make up their minds. Yes, there are some curiosity in the film that only adults can understand, but the film mostly targets children. Parents will enjoy this for 90 minutes. The attention of their children is focused on something other than them. The background is nice and the voice is good but this is nothing more than a nice film. Children will love this picture, adults will like it.
