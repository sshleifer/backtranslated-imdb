I think many people have written it like one of Tom Cruise's strange movies (Magnolia, Aye Wide Shut), but Vanilla Sky certainly must have his own movie. Many said it was weird; It was not. It was different and confusing but not strange. Kinky is the Stanley Kubrick or Pauly Shore. There are several truman shows. Confusing are the matrix or the game. And unlike Kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. Everything makes sense - probably not immediately, even today, but it will be knowledgeable. Vanilla Sky is confusing because David Aames (Tom Cruise) is confused. That's the real thing. The so-called "curiosity" came against those critics. If they had stopped to "open their eyes" as the Spanish movie of 1997, they saw it. And if it is not enough reason to see it, then watch it for the song. Cameron Crowe offers a nice soundtrack; She uses it to set "feeling" - the notorious element that lacks many movies. During the dramatic and psychological measure of the movie, the song "Good Vibrators" produced songs from The Beach Boys, he created an offabout, but wondered "right". An amazing film in her script, music, acting, and portraits, Vanilla Sky, sadly, is a superficial bandwagon film that screams critics for being intelligent. Excellent: A +
