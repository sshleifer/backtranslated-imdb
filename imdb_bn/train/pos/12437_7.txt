For the long time of the greatest creation of Peter Odnell, I saw this film with great hope of enjoying the DVD; I'm really expected to reach the hat for remote control in fifteen minutes. But instead I have enjoyed this product perfectly and I have enjoyed it specially and praised how the producer and director Modesie Blaise's story was successful. We managed to avoid the trap of creating a (bad) film version of books that we were all familiar to, instead of focusing only on a specific period of psychology, only in the novels. <br /> <br /> For production costs (and I'm not a student of cinematography!): Yes, this movie was portrayed in a tough financial and time budget and probably shows ... but looted the audience's enjoyment? In this case I do not think so. Instead, we got acquainted with the greatest literary heroes in the world and got the taste of his capabilities. <br /> <br /> For Casting: Because we are the only person in unknown areas who actually resolve and (possibly) Professor Law. They were completely credible for me. Alexandra Staden, described as something like wood and very thin action heroin, has been brought to the judge's poses and coolness screen; His tactics (when martial arts were needed), but most importantly, the moddy blouse represented the perfect person in the main part of Canon. OK, so we all know that this film was created to participate in the demand for the Miramax. Modesty Blaise Character, it was created quickly and cheaper, but ... I can not wait to see the next production of this series by these producers - unless they hold the original value and characters of the original stories!
