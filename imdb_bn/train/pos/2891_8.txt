We saw this in "The Wonderful World of Disney" on ABC yesterday, and I came to the conclusion that things would be more difficult in "mouse" than usual. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> And during this commercial break, they had other advertisements in the wake of a "TV show" hosted by an oh-annoying Kelly Rippa, revealing the magical wonder of "Sidra 2: Dreams As True". After a break after the break, Disney took out time from the original movie to tell us, loyal spectators, which we have to get a copy of the seagull. Thank you, Disney, for giving us a signal creation service to a movie favorite boyfriend wax. <br /> <br /> However, all these commercial and cash-register-rings have worked hard to get to it. The original movie of "Cinderella", because when I finished advertising, I forgot the story was closed. <br /> <br /> However, "Cinderella" still maintains its magic, and the story is still a good one, although we've all seen countless times. It is embarrassing that how to make it cheap with all marketing for a stray follow-up.
