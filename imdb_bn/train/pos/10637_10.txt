In 2000, I saw the best movie. Bravo Reggae Ozzette Corp. Sensively shot and stunningly illustrated, Harem is a brave film that deals with different romances, which is banned like Hollywood. Women of all sizes, sizes, and colors, fill the film. Cut out from the outside world, women are entertaining each other with stories about conspiracies, rivalries and jealousies in their positions.
