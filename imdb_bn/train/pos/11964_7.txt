I hope to be scared of the movie theater this afternoon in the movie theater. Happy, beyond the expectations of the film, at least a little bit. It is heavy, nothing is deep - and no real allen is as good as any number of excellence - but it is also completely enjoyable as a light, humble comedy. There are some simple and sweet about it. After listening, they started walking, the "cute" listener heard from the people. Allen does not feel like making an excellent composition here, it seems he wants to make a comedy and have fun. Everything can be compared to making Hollywood, Allen's staff has a tendency to attract. Even fluffy stuff. This day is just refreshing to go to a movie made by real people.
