I just want to say that among the so-called classic hip-hop movies, I've seen wild-style, crucify, breaking, style warships ... IMO Beat Street is among the best among others. As I asked them about what other people said, then it seems that Bit Street is the most pop out. But still, it is the lowest lowest. 4.3 Just below the belt is a punch (if it is called, 5 point belt). I love music performance, breakdancing wants to spin me, Ramo lets me throw a piece ... Come on, this is a classic !!!
