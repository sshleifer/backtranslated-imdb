This is an extensive (4 hours) recurring story of Rider Haggard, an ex-concubine with a wealth of King Solomon's wealth, along with the addition of a woman who is normally added and a "rock of existence" with Russian soldiers. It's a very good shot, gave a strong sense of the wide open space in Africa, and played very well. Patrick Swayze is an amazing Alan Cotterman and Allyson Dudley Elizabeth Maitland, who qualifies Quarermain to help rescue his father. Wanwo as Ombopa, Gavin Hood as Macnab and leader of the Russian soldiers (not named on IMDB list) are memorable. The Hollywood that alone can not leave a good story to adapt to it alone, it can be said well and I have enjoyed it without it. 6/10.
