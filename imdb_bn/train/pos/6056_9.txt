Super Speedway creates a great demo of your new DVD / BigScreen / 5.1 channel sound system. IMXX camera puts you in the right car, where you cruise near different tracks at high speeds, memorable of Grand Prix driving sequences (if only appear on DVD!). I enjoy viewing it again and again. <br /> <br /> only subtraction, and why do not I give it 10, some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the fast speed of the film. The soundtrack also requires a slight suspension of disbelief - you can hear a real car engine. You will not hear the swooshes as you go under the bridge.
