Hey, I mean, <br /> <br /> Wherever I find these two movies and I can not find any place in their local area. (I'm Australian). Can you help me and tell me where to buy it. General Home Ward Bound 1 and 2, I have seen the best movies and good for people of all ages. My favorite movie was Jane, I'm 5 years old and still I'm still a teenager. This is a great movie for the whole family. My entire family loves this movie without my younger sister because I saw that she is very sick I love this movie and I can not afford to buy it again in DVD. <br /> <br /> Sally
