1933 seems to be a great year for Sat√©res (for example "Doc Soup") and it fits well even though the deal is obsessed with the bridge. This tone is a ridiculous piece of New York, which is appropriate, as the magazine starts with the "Talking About Town" page. Seamless the only thing is casting. A few years later William Powell and Mirza Faye were perfect. However, after 1934, you did not run into adultery in such sophisticated fashion, some shiara and a group of prostitutes for listening to some shiara and bridal show in the young or beautiful Loretta Young, or the radio on the radio. Even if you do not know anything about the bridge, you might still want to see a rare example of Hollywood mockery.
