Okay, I think about Jack Frost. I saw the morphing box for VHS tape and I was thinking myself, it seems interesting. I rent it and I take it home Boy I was right, it's interesting. They keep the spirits of the serial killer in the dream, walking the dead body and inside the machine every day. But it got to be the most unique place to keep a serial killer spirit. Inside a snowman body. I like all the picturesque snowflake pictures of landscape, pot holder, snow globe etc. I like Jack acting actor, he keeps some fun in a killer who is not really seen after Freddie Craigger. All right, I said it. Frandy Kruger It's that "cool" layer. I hope some doll effects were good, face movements matched well. But I got that wheel up to a small budget. Throwing has a great job, there are some great one-liners and scares to jump in any hardcore horror fan. All and all, a great story, good effect, great dialog and a great cast. I give Jack Frost ... 9 stars
