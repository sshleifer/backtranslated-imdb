Europe (Genetopaea) is an excellent composition which encourages viewers with the story of the movie about a century ago. This picture is really unique, and a job of talent. Camerwork and editing are bright, and combined with statements of films used in separatism, it creates a stupid and unforgettable movie experience. <br /> <br /> Barbara Sucqua and Eddie Constantine's throwing two should be seen and enjoyed guilty pleasure. Max Von Sydow offers her great voice as a narrator. <br /> <br /> One type of movie! Four stars (highest rating).
