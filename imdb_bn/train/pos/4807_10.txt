I was really impressive of this movie. Just the history is not correct, but style is luminous and still intimate. I was a fan of Victoria's Emily Blunt, and when she was compelled to immigrate herself during her youth, she was also a fan of how she maintained her spirit. Blunt charismatic and sometimes dogmatic methods that Vicotria became famous (probably infamous). Romantic elements of the film are so real and humorous that at the end of the film you actually have to understand why Victoria has decided to live Albert's rest for the rest of his life. <br /> <br /> The technical aspect of the film is also note-worthy. I appreciate beautiful scores, which came quite surprisingly with the dramatic movement of the story. I considered cinematography as outstanding, some scenes showed me innocence and greatness and left me a lot of breath. <br /> <br /> This year, this movie is so nice and flexible as this year has been so low and it is rated as one of the best in 2009!
