This short is a puzzle. The words fail me here, because it's almost unclear, technically exceptional for over 90 years (the visuals are amazing and even sometimes amazing), it's not something you like as a charity or "normal" - because it is most certainly No This is a strange team, gang. Good to be verified, but if things like Rain and Steve hurt your head then you can avoid it. Recommended.
