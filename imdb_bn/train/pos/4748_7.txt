The story will never win the awards, but is it not ... This script was incredibly entertaining and suspicious enough to create space for the incredible dancer fighting scene. Who needs story with war? Really, it's worth watching that reason alone. If you can manage Gotta, which has a lot ... none of this is practically adequate to see. I gave it a 7.
