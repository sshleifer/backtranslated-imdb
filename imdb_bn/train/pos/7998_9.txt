I like this movie. I was a Mexican and at least it was offended by it. Actually, I think this image should be shown in the police headquarters across Mexico. It is a sad fact that our police system is rare like a 3 month old corpse. It encourages me to read the news that how slaughters, abductors and other bodies are freed from fictitious fines or residences like inside kings in prison cells. There must be someone like our ICC, Dzig Washington. A bodyguard turned vicious revengeful. Persecution raises the industry here (at least in major cities). I really want to enjoy the same fate of the real life abductors, because KREC has done a good job. That would be so wonderful (sorry, that's annoying!). FIRE MAN is a missing film in which you can not miss If you do not use some subtitles to read, it can be difficult for you (Mexico always sees this when watching American movies) but the effort will be good. Some editing is a bit unclear ... like traffic, do you remember? (How else a lukewarm Mexico is corrupt). The film starts a bit slowly but increases the speed at the second half speed. I swear that you will be happy to send Darail Washington to the wrong-doers. Its performance is nothing short to small. Last (no spoilers, OK !!!) a little sad, but I'm sure you liked it. FIRE MAN is one of the best movies of the year. There must be a "must" for a DVD collection! 9 * out of 10 out
