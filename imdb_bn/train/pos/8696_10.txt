One of the uncertain gems of the decade of the 1980s, scenes ... Roger-sharp satire and Arnatia Walker have outstanding characteristics (after how much did they not play?) And Wallace Shawn. This is a delicious text of class battlefield and people of that class. The writing is lovely and the characters are nuanced, while not fine. And, sorry, but Asian gangs (if you can call a Japanese person "gang" in one of the other characters, but not for "social values"), another review shows that they should be. Here's what the film is making fun of and what it does here in a tragic way. I found it creative, funny, and unreasonable.
