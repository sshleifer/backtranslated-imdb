I was very entertaining by the movie and. This was my most favorite movie in 1976. After being raised in the 70's, I fell in love with Chris Christopherson's appearance and inconsistency, of course I am not a movie critic, but for the time being, I think it was very good. I like Strasand and Crossfire's combo. I think they work very well together. I have seen this movie many times and still love two esters and John Norman among them. I'm a huge fan of Chris and I can see him at the concert when I can. What a talented singer song writer, not to mention, actor. I saw him in many movies, but still thinks that a star was born.
