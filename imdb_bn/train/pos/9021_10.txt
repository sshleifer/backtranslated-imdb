My sisters and I have seen all three series in Tenko and agree on one of the issues in the BBC series. The entire cast was very convincing in the portrayed parts and although the third series was diminished, it was enough to see and it was the same in my evening. No doubt we'll see it again because it's a series that I'm not sick to ever see. The BBC is a fantastic show and a complete series for BBC and full marks for casting. First series in all categories and this series will recommend to anyone, but due to some age factors, some age limit should be considered. The BBC is grateful to release the series on DVD and video.
