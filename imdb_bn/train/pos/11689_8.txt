Hopefully this score has changed because of my wonderful and amazing review that inspires you to everyone and shows the movie, which makes an instant diameter of "8". The true score of this picture. <br /> <br /> King mentioned before King Rock! I did not top it before watching this movie, but now I push it into the doors of Chris Rock's website, requesting him to take him to his project. This movie is really funny, if you are not funny about this movie then you must have therapy and its humor which stand up in the community (race), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, joke in all areas of the society. The list is running <br /> <br /> There was little disappointment for me. While going to the movie, I did not understand that this was a remake of another good movie "Heaven Can Wait" created in 1971 with Warren Batti. I was surprised to see this movie and suddenly the plot started unraveling as an old movie that I saw on TV a few weeks ago. However, this movie is a better version than my opinion, and it's more than just a couple of days of any year in any of the year, and it's more fun than any other day. "<br /> <br /> The real plot of good film <br /> <br /> Do not waste your experience! Do not read the plot! Just go and see a movie because there are two reviews on the IMDB that have gone crazy about, because it is the most fun thing to watch over the longest, go and see it because it is a movie experience. That does not leave you annoying at the cost of movie tickets. See it because it is a good movie!
