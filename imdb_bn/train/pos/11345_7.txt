That's why I still have nightmares. <br /> <br /> This horror film (a musical instrument) was considered suitable for children in the 1970s. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mayor of the island, Pfonstaff, who was a dragon, wanted to see me with a new look with conjunctivitis, and a witch-talked wild man was targeted by a witch (Billy Holidays, who was considered 'a little better' at that time). <br /> <br /> Foolish homosexuals were rescued in a 'funny' Duke Convention with the old time. The boy then dressed as a 'fairy' to wear clothes. <br /> <br /> Not suitable for children.
