I was excited that some teacher in his advertisement was in gas / coffee / phone / play station and he saw him on his beautiful TV station, all of them did not hate Chris, but he always laughed a small part, why do we have the right 10 lines so much that Stupid? I think I do not think I'm still doing this fun? Why do we have to go all in line ten ... what is it really ?? !! I just enjoy the random sound right now -_- Maple Story I love my friends
