There are many mainstream films after colonial Africa and those who have a mixed set. This one, in the 1970s, its indirect tendencies to show slavery in Africa show the best and worst values ​​of Africa, which can not be different from the standards of the whole humanity. It also has errors due to the Western Eastern ideas and especially the Arabs' illogical effects. <br /> <br /> An English doctor, David Linderby, was taken to the beautiful African-American wife Ansa Lindberi. Arab slave businessman, as well as a teenage girl in Sanupu and a younger boy. Main slave businessman, Suleiman, with its flowers and sometimes ridiculous rhetoric and mingled gestures, in the phases of the period of Arabia - which will not move away from the "follow on camel camel", but it is not standard film demand. Peter Ustinov certainly achieved enough skill to address some errors in the script and otherwise he could have been a harmless one-dimensional character. <br /> <br /> Continuing the stereotypical theme, three Suleiman Arab employees are intelligent and have pedophilic tendency towards the boy, which is not gratefully portrayed on the screen. <br /> <br /> One of David's first ports is the local police officer, a stereototypical pump and the disabled African bureau. David then met two stereootic white pre-Pat, an Englishman (played by Walker, Rex Harrison) and an American (played by Sandal, William Holden). Sandals are a mercenary with "conventional" opinions of mixed-relationship relationships, who initially refused to help David without paying up. For the sake of victory, David won over love and was aware of his inability to find love, he agreed to take David to his helicopter in search of Amnes. They crossed the border of Suleiman and his prisoners and failed to pursue them in the neighboring areas - due to Sandal's hesitation and lack of David's firearms experience, his helicopter was shot dead but David survived. <br /> <br /> We then introduced David to Malik (the poet's altar), who lost to Africans Suleiman, and now he is driven by revenge only. They found Sanufu girl with a group of tuage and they went on the right track to find Suleiman. <br /> <br /> Among the most impressive scenes they killed a group of slave traders, it was not a Suleiman group, and before sending their prisoners, they had no alternative to send them to Tuaregs. After that we see that the child has been raped, it is a direct doctor and a spectacular spectator, he uses his knowledge to kill Suleiman's Henchen. Ansar managed to manage the death engine of two employees of Suleiman - despite his son's suspicion - and in his part. <br /> <br /> During this period, Sulaiman and his slave slaves within a few days of reaching the market. <Br> <br /> Suleiman, now there is no doubt that Anasas "trouble", trying to sell him a corrupt, but intelligent, lazy Arab Prince (Omar Sharif). While discovering that Anansa is working for the United States, the princess decides to continue her wages, rather than undecided, regardless of the results. The scene where two people laugh, is the film's seratum. <br /> <br /> The young boy is sold in middle-grade German podophyphal in the slave market, and we are left to guess that the boy will still be considered "Wandabbar" when his master ends his master's skills. <br /> <br /> David and Malik finally face Suleiman and the bitter sweet ends from the owner's point of view. Finally, David and Ansasa are again united, and the owner, whose life is at the ruins, can himself console himself by seeing the work done. <br /> <br /> The overall plot of the film is extraordinary but it loses the mark for the stereotypical painting of almost all leading characters. To address many errors of scripting, credit must certainly go to all leading actors.
