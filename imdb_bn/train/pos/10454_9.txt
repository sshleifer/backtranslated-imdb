Before the romance for the Sunrise slacker generation. Richard Lincoln's romantic drama tells the truth about a dream for most people. The film portrays all of her glory romance, but most couples do not face any losses; And in short, this movie is related to the relationship of about two people, which will be closer to the relationship - only one problem, the problem of time. Although most relationships flow with the wind over time, it always gets stronger and the only thing that time itself is wearing. Sunrise is definitely not 'Rabindranath's romance', which is another aspect that keeps the film leagues in front of the audience. Two people follow the story, Jesse; An American and celine; A French girl who met a train in Vienna. They immediately connect, and after about her terrible idea for the television show and almost close the train, Jesse asks Selin to join her for the lovely city of Vietna City ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Basically works for two reasons - realistic acting and an extraordinary script that creates characters through their thoughts and feelings, and thus we have to I can know as we live in real life. It lets characters be free and it is easy to believe that it is not real actor and actor acting from just one script. It lets us feel for those characters and only because they are not heroes. Such truthfulness is difficult to detect, at the end of the day, we know as the audience that they are watching a movie and not seeing the real life; But the sunrise never before seen on the screen represents the truest one from the real-life exhibition. A really cool script can not work on it itself and it needs great actors to perform that which is fair and even though I'm not passionate about Julie Dapley or Ethan Hawkeye; To see this picture, you can not do anything but give them both respect. I do not know whether I was in character or could only play myself, but when a movie is good; <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most important thing to write about this film is written and the script contains several observations about life, most of which I Can I personally describe. It represents what Richard Lincoln has achieved with this script, because it not only creates and creates letters, but it also manages to express true love, along with other aspects of life. In fact, all the narrative is not related to me, and the genius of writing. Everyone is different, and various parts of the script will apply to different people. There may be some people about a person's love and other hatred that may be some person; And that's the case with these script's musings. The beauty of the film adds beauty to the city of Vienna. The city itself is not really important for cinema because it is a story that can be almost anywhere - but it is some beautiful, visible and enthusiastic, energetic romance that matches the beauty of the flower throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and impressive together before sunrise. Richard Lincoln has created something that is rare in the world. A movie which never gets top of life or becomes too emotional. What is it before sunrise And that's what, pure cinematic brightness.
