The part where the part was left in one part, the next part is the uncertain fall and the more serious aspect of human heritage, just as it has been said. On the direct opposite from the first feature, the part represents a change in China's pride and glory from China, which will release the freedom fighters of any country in the previous relationship of a country. Changing the setting is not just aesthetic; From the autumn of spring and spring roots, the voice and the heart of this feature change, which replaces the hope of the previous predecessors, which is a brutal, deadly and hurtful reality which is tied to a new struggle. Nevertheless, Che himself will say, what exactly is such a struggle? Part Part A group must have helped the document that the Revolutionary Guerrilla achieved its first generation power, the part two takes more sophisticated, neutral and inferior part of Che's life and ambition, and it gives a strong painting that is both furious and unfortunate < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And as much as possible fabrication. There is no doubt in the remote, cold way of telling Che's stories and struggles to stop any audience; In fact, I'm still preserved whether I should name this feature after a person? If there is anything, the chay is completely accepted, gives a story that only crosses the biography and instead records a man's struggle which helps him carry along the path. In any way, Soderberg Hugbeggel tried to draw a similar human portrait with Dr Unitergang before half a decade (excuse against sarcasm); Che is a slow, dynamic, and meditative method that talks about a lesson in history that is described by just one man, which is reasonably handled - the whole thing operates. <br /> <br /> The story behind green landscapes of Cuban landscapes and the second part of Bolivian's hazardous backdrop, inevitably captures a distinct reverse voice which is not very annoying with previous predecessors, rather it is enough to give its reference point . Here, what is the basic structure of Part One reflected? There is a time of initial struggle, war, fallen comrades and appointments to replace them, when we see some of the people's attention behind the movement. However, anyone who knows the strange idea behind the feature, the part two has decided to end even more shocking and uncertain notes. These differences, in combination with one similar to the part, make a compulsory and memorable full; In all the ways, both of them can position their own (and such as Cudders near Soderberg for achieving) and they enjoy it, but accept as a statement, giving it to Che for the sake of making it right. <br /> <br /> In fact, the part that created the part one a month ago is still central to the slow cast from the cast, actually the structural battle scenes are still clear from the subtle performances ?? The drama contained in the characters on the screen is as vague and strange, but with a feature like this, Part Two again proves that the hierarchy of such elements does not hurt a film while reflecting enough plot and other elements to maintain the audience. In fact, after writing this review, I did not add a paragraph or two of my initial review for Part One or was completely unique as a review title, but I felt it was only <br/> <br/> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, no matter why I have been involved with the audience for four hours to challenge the challenge, I can not properly decide. Runtime, but to see both parts, I can at least verify the capability of the ability to do this. Endless Messaging photography with intricate, intricate screenplay, and dancing performances that meet the justice of the film without attracting the attention of the characters, is compounded by Che Part Two as its precedent, and every bit as fruitful, but at this time a tragic but up-to-date history of the film Suitable for conclusions. <br /> <br /> - A review of Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)
