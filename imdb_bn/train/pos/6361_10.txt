I have been waiting anxiously for opening this movie for several months. Jim is like a big fan of Canyon Fan, I've easily seen how he can transform himself into Sioux Green, and make the character his own. I was not frustrated. <br /> <br /> This movie was pure magic. Kerry was a master of his business and nobody could fulfill this role as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children, and this movie is becoming a timeless classic to enjoy in the upcoming years. I've already been sitting here for years to see this remake in my young girl's viewpoint, and I will definitely keep an eye on her and laugh as I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> The movie is written by Jim Carrey, and I do not believe that it will come together with him. However, supporter throwing was engaging and entertaining to their own rights, especially to Taylor Taylor Momsen who had perfect foil for carrier antics. Set design, musical score and dress all put a hammer, fabulous finished product their hands and believe that I may be proud of all involved. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those critics who disagree, perhaps your heart size is very small.
