Curt Russell, whose career started when he kicked Real Elvis at the World Fair, probably did not have the top of his work as king in his workshop. In such a message you think that you do not see Elvis until you come back ... probably the memories of the memories of Elvis and beauty scientist Don Johnson? All the performances here are excellent: Priscilla seasonal hobby, Pat Hingle as the colonel, even Shell Winters brings prolonged rendering of the brain and brings them to the right level of cruelty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is subtle performance from Robert Gray, like Elvis's father Vernon and Alvis's friend and bodyguard red west. <br /> <br /> One must look for Rock N Roll fans.
