I was scared that this is a movie that you must see to get something out of it. I'm not like a stupid movie ... "Lethal Wipon Part 58" Do you know where Riggs is really crazy? This is a movie that is not exactly the same, it's a start. You can always run a conversation on the phone and you can enjoy it in any way. I have noticed in the past that most people who do not like this kind of movie are doing something that will do most but watch a movie and then slam it because ... they do not get it or understand what happened. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
