This game will be the bomb and this year's 007 games and the greatest hits. When I got the Agent of Fire, I thought it was a good game but Nightfire came near and it was good, but now there is a new type of James Bond game. This time it is a third person shooter and more than 12 missions, this graphics game is out of graphics. Like Pierce Bronson, this game also has one of the biggest actors and actresses, such as James Bond, William Duffo, Villene Nikolai Diabolo and Judy Dunk, who quit as M (if I made a mistake, forgive everyone). This game will be your own as the greatest James Bond game ever. <br /> <br /> I can give it a 10/10
