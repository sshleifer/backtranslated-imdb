True genuine crime film is a true criminal novelist who is made for TruMan Capote's book and truly trusted. Quincy Jones plays musical score and Scott Wilson and Robert Blake as Dick and Perry killer. Why was Wilson not to be a big star after this movie became a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> The black and white cinematography and editing of this movie is the top notch. The reconstruction of the murder is terrible and it leaves the real killings of your imagination, even shocking than the showing off the shutdown. The film was portrayed in the original Clutter House, which was sold to another after the assassination. The film has a very documentary feeling --- along with the actual Clutter scene as well as other scenes portrayed in gas stations and the killers actually went to the shop. There are also Nancy Clutter's favorite horses, bobs, and even movies. Gear's small trial scene will come as a great change in the prosecutor, which is not only portrayed in the courtroom, but there are some accusations of real clutter killings portraying himself as a jury for the film. <br /> <br /> This is a tough movie, when you see it, it's scary.
