"Angels in the Outfield" was originally a 1951 film from Ted Turner's Library; Disney rebuilt it in 1994, using California's Angels in Los Angeles (now Los Angeles Angels) as a team (Disney is also an owner of the Mighty Docs Hockey team; Also, good use of the words, where ??) <br /> <br /> This movie wanted a family who had almost two orphan kids. A man promised the boys' family, only if the Angels won the prize. So, he called Allah in this one night and asked Allah. The boy who had prayed could see the help of the way (and only that boy); For example, when the first angel came down, a player hit a ball so that the bat did not break, so the ball too !!!!! For most of the 1994 ALA Star season, Angels was at the top of the AL West (in which my home team is one of the Rangers and it still has). However, they lost a game because instead of the White Sox / Angels game, the boy was in court (then there was no Central Division behind the baseball, so Chicago was in the west), and there was no angel there for help. So, a new rule has been made: no angel can help championship games. But wait! Final championship game, won the angels !!!!! It was really a miracle! <br /> <br /> What I like about this picture: This is a good movie. I mean, in the last few years, I prayed every night to ask for help from school and staff; Look at me now My work was good !!!!! So for one, it shows that if you believe, then God can send your angels to help you with any problems in your life. And second, it's a family baseball movie, which is always exciting. This is an old Disney movie; I recently saw it on the New Disney Channel (blech !!!!!). <br /> <br /> "Outfield Angels" When you see your life forever !!!! <br /> <br />
