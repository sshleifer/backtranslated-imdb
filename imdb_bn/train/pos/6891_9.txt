"Once upon a time there was a beautiful land called France ... people were happy, women were easy, and men were involved in their favorite procession: war, kings are the only entertainment that people can enjoy." There was a seven-year war in the war, and when it was noticed that the soldiers had more bodies than the soldiers, employers were sent for appointment. <br /> <br /> And so Phanfan (Gerard Phillip), after catching a farmer's daughter in a heart of heart, regiments escape from marriage by entering the d'akitan ... but only predicting her future by a Gypsy prediction It has been that, he will win fame and fate in the uniform of Mahima and will marry the King's girl. Alas, Adeline (Gina Lolobrigrida) is not a gypsy but the daughter of the regiment's sergeant. <br /> <br /> When fasteners move away from employers, under attack should intervene to rescue a car, but should be inside Marquez Du Pumpadur and ... the king's daughter. She now believes that she will marry high, wear very low blouse adlines. She, instead, will soon discover her own love for Fanfan. We are in the middle of an inexperienced film of the Fanfan fate, between the blows of the war of war and the ribbed incident of the perpetrators. Running from hanging, fighting on the roof of the tile, fighting war, war criminals, romantic fleeing and imagining that you can imagine. What lacking in Fanfan Polish he makes for irrationality and encouragement. She is quick to take action and speaks quickly, but we can not love her fate and such belief in such optimistic nature? <br /> <br /> Gerard Phillip was an Icon Stage and Screen Actor (Francois Trufft Kahier's Dew had published continuous discontent on the page). She did most of her own stunts. He was handsome, athlete, orderly and charismatic. Men praised him and women dream about him. He died of liver cancer in Fanfan, seven years later at 36. Everyone in France expressed shock. Gina Lolibrigida as Adeline, her own It is not a low-cut blouse who does not play it. She is sharp, sensual, pretty innocent and no one is stupid. <br /> <br /> <br /> Phanfan La Tulip is singing only with endless satirical action, illustrative situations and good nature. Funny, do not mention acerbic dialogue. After taking Adlin's steps to save Phanfan from hanging, he meets the King at his private quarter. "Give me your beautiful little hands," she says. "But my heart is of Phanfan," says Adeline. "Who asks for your heart?" The king says, "I'm glad that's what I want." "I'm a right girl," says Adeline. The King says, "Give me respect for my talent, do you love Phanfan? Then thank me, my joke enables you to show you the greatest proof of your love. Now this is a tricky, fun thing. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Gouward , Francois Troubett and the rest New Wave Gangs only make the popular entertainment movies frustrating (and they personalize their attack). Fun La Bupp and its director, Christian-Jacques, was their main goal, they probably missed the point of Phanfan, which is a very funny mockery of the army and the uninterrupted wartime war. How it must be, which can create the Angust film that can only compliment co-workers For example, Truffet and Chabral thank goodness among them, this boy A good person who enjoys movies, can enjoy a movie, can appreciate anybody who plays in a movie based on its popularity, which is a good movie, has passed the synthesis, and a good movie is a good film, publicly or only cognizable. They could not read Harry Potter as self-condemned as a curiosity. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard, eat your heart. Viva phanfan!
