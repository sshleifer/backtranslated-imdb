"Looking at the painting, then you saw better." So Dick Heller (Ronald Colman), The Light of the Filters. The film stars Ronald Colman in old-fashioned Hollywood style and congratulated Ida Lupino on her first important role, among which the credible character actor Dudley Digges (who played with Callman in Condand), and the amazing performance of the wonderful actor Walter Houston. <br /> <br /> The title of the film and the opening sequence is quite true, that Dick will lose his vision. She and her childhood sweetheart Maisie (Muriel Angelus) are playing with a pistol as she blinded by the gun powder discharge. Later, a wound in war in Sudan catalysts for its blindness. She became a famous painter, but she has already been blinded by ambition, and her attitude does not achieve her full potential until her eyesight leaves her. The bad girl Bessie (Ida Lupino) is set to enter, and her self-destroying speed is set. Loopino is very strong in this role and plays well with penman. His evil hunger reminds me of Bate Davis in Human Bondage. <br /> <br /> Good acting and well guided, this is my favorite callman Meldramas.
