White Suit Man is one of the traditional comedies that Ealing has done so well between 40 and 50. One of the plot follows a man who discovers clothes that are broken and broken. Of course, this textile world is a huge success. However, clothes threaten the lives of many people, such as garment makers, clothes factories and an old lady, who wash them every week. The Man in the White Suit is a film about scientific progress, and the way they do not always help; The old woman said at one point in the movie, "Why do not you just leave scientists alone?" <br /> <br /> Many Elig comedy, this star of Sir Alex Ginnes. Alex Ginnis is a superb actor; He has the power to stir the screen with his presence (and he has literally worked in this film), but he managed to portray his characters in the world and in a credible way. He is appropriately vague in this movie, and he has captured the right atmosphere for his character; An intelligent and ambitious, but little naive scientist. Along with Guinness, The Man in the White Suit is Joan Greenwood, who played a deep throat, who only played with the divine "Caied Hearts and Coronets" and Michael Goff, with a person who will go to play himself in Batman film Alfred's. The film's acting is not always great, but it is always decent, and it matches the film. <br /> <br /> The White Suit Man is an intelligent, worried and wicked comedy moral. The comedy is not always obvious, and it does not always work, but the film is not meant to be a film that can smell the stomach, so that it is forgiving. I recommend this movie, basically, a fan of the movie.
