This is a wonderful new crime series, which helped to clear old cases under the leadership of the young career-based Amanda Redman, by combining three ancient British (Dennis Waterman, James Bowam and Alun Armstrong) of retired detective groups. Three playful, anxious old police constitute a brilliant group, which employs twenty years old detection methods in the police force, since they have long been on the road - sometimes the horrors of its influential officials. Three sympathizers, warts and all are portrayed. Pretty comic scenery, and some too much running ones will come in triumph with each of the three increments of the growth and the succession of their pasts. <br /> <br /> At the end of the first six-part series (we are committed a further series of next year) each of the characters was developed. Widowed James Ballam could not resign his wife's impossible death. Lothario Denis Waterman is learning to take his role as grandfather. Even the shortsighted Alun Armstrong helped his new friends fight against his past giants - and continue to take medicines! Amanda Redman has always had to face familiar conflicts in life and career. The story line has been interesting, but rather relies heavily on the DNA testing wonders. However, it is the best of four British actors' interplay, which consistently canceled the series.
