A long-delayed prison closed for more than 20 years was reopened and Ethan Sharp (late, great actor actor Lane Smith), who was once guarded, was given a place as a warden. When detainees are working to fix the workspace, they are ordered to break into the old execution rooms. It reveals a terrible soul that brutally destroys both the guards and the captives; Hero may play a role similar to the low-key prisoner Bark (such as Vizgo Martensen, showing the real role in the first land). <br /> <br /> I know it's a silence for praise. The film for its atmosphere (it was shot in a genuine abandoned gun battle near Rollins, Wyoming), but it boosts this horror film to a higher level. It has been established in the beginning, in a great sense of foreboding. Director Roni Harlin attempts here to try his fourth director; This leads him to "Nightmare at Elm Street 4" and effectively starts an impressive career in mainstream action films, thrillers and horror films. <br /> <br /> It may contain stock letters but it is an able cast to bring them back to life: Young female Chelsea Field for improvised felony, Lincoln Kilpatic like Clint Vincent Chris, Tom Everett as the unstable Con Con Rabbus, Ivan as Outgoing Lasagna Why, Tommy "Small" Lever, and Arlan Dean Snyder as Captain Horton as a soft-spoken monster. It was notable for Cain Holder (as his retaliatory attitude) to credit the credit at first, that he helped Jason Bhurshid play in the "Friday 13th" series. <br /> <br />, Wonderful music by Moody filmmaker Featured by film artist McAlbarg, courtesy Richard Bend and Christopher Stone, great view, incredibly frustrating location and overall flashing and intense presentation helps it to be very entertaining. It's terrible, awesome, and good fun for a horror fan. <br /> <br /> 8/10
