Anime Mim less known than Lensman Toowo and MK Studios. It relies on the novel, but it reminds me more of the "metro" game. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, then see it subtitles in Japan or just ordinary Japanese. The English Dobbed version was almost cropped and edited on death. <br /> <br /> This is not new, it is the first animated feature to combine CGG-graphics. With hand-drawn animation, it's fun to see it.
