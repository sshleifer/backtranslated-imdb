When I went to visit this movie my expectations were really low, but I was happy. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to see the annoying tin-flick, but in reality the plot was interesting and well executed, the role was certain - especially Melville who really showed her talent in this film, and the scenes of war were - For a low budget movie - very good work. <br /> <br /> I think this movie deserves a greater audience than that. This is a movie that can be seen by the whole family - not likely to be kids, because it has some rough views. A movie of love, and the problems that can happen, when you go against your family tradition <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is very much like "Beckham's binding", but in reality I think this movie will make it even better.
