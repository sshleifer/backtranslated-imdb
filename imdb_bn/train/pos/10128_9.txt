The first episode of Friends, where we have contract freak Monica Geller (Courtney Cox), the new divorced Ross Geller (David Schimmer), Hippie Fib Bafai (Lisa Cudro), unknown actor and female male (Matt) Le Blanc and very adulterous Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry). The scene begins until the 6th and final friend Spikey Child Rachel Green (Jennifer Anton) is presented. <br /> <br /> Most people are better off than this episode, as the first episode of a new sitikam is not always fantastic. The performance of this episode is not great because Cast can not detect and is not really believable in their new characters (in addition to Cudro and Perry - who are bright) <br /> <br /> Matt Le Blanc-Man, his performance was very intense because later he became more confident, but I think he would try to be fun but most of the time would fail. <br /> <br /> David Shimmer - why does he speak every word? He can not speak normally! But he became one of the fun characters in the season afterwards, but he is not confident. And I can not sympathize with Jennifer Aniston - Rachel looks hot as Green and works well, but we can only see Rachel in the first season, Courtney Cox - this episode looks quite unusual, she's worried, she looks perfectly now Unlike, (more healthy), he played a little sketchy but this 20-minute pilot everyone! Lisa Cudro and Matthew Perry- I was working together with them because their comic time and performance quality was fantastic, and it was her first role for Lisa and she is very normal since Fiono and Matthew Perry just play Matthew Perry herself! The quality of the episode is enhanced later, such as the set, they look dark and vague in this episode and feel them irrelevant, acting OK, the characters gain confidence in each new scene and I am proud of this pilot! I hope the friends will meet again! Because they will always be there for us!
