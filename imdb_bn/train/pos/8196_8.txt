I do not know why people think of this bad movie. It's a pretty good plot, some good steps, and the position change for Harry does not hurt either. Its sure to be offensive and unrealistic but this is not the only movie like that. Eastwood has a good form as Dirty Harry, and I liked it as a small town police in Pat Hingle in this town. If you like harti harias, you have to see it, it is much better than the dead pool. 4/5
