To communicate with the beauty of this movie, not just music, but all words sound to the sound track to illustrate the word. How beautifully the theme of the guinea expulsion establishes the theme of moral ambiguity! Introduce music to the musical characters of our leadership in the marriage of Giovanni. Do not expect to find many things in Italy's political life in 1943. This is not the case. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to pictures and sounds, you will be taken to a word that transcends neo-realityism. At the end of the film we have more with the internal life of the characters than the real characters that have moments like the Antononii moments. This is one of my favorite visconti film
