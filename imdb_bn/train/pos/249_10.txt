I have seen the trailer for this movie many times, and I would say that Ned Kelly looks like it's going to be an extraordinary movie. When I first saw the trailer, I could not take it away from my eyes (it definitely got my attention). Heath Ledger, what he knows and works for him, a piece of stick at that time. Orlando does not mention Bloom, looks split second looks fantastic. I think this movie will be hit, and again I will meet many people.
