This whole movie is only worth seeing for the ultimate ultimate moments - this is the best ending of any film I've ever seen. Perfect, beautiful, funny, just wonderful. <br /> <br /> I thought the film was fun, even with its importance in French very seriously. I liked it - it's a great love story And I liked the way Algerians were woven - and on the way, the music is excellent during the final achievement. I want cd
