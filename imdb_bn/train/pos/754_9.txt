Unless you are there, unfortunately this movie will be beyond your condolences for you. What I say is shameful, though it is meant to act as if some actors are acting. Let's face it - in real life, we do not say things in a perfect or perfect way, even when we want to say. In this sense, it works. However, this film does not apply to our "known" actors, especially Jodie Foster (a natural birth). The other 3 girls are not only made up of stories - Jodi is playing glue that struggles to stop their friendships, even with the obvious feeling of death. That means no matter how close a friend is, there are some people who you will not try in any way. <br /> <br /> And the movie has its main parts. It is not about partnership, it is not about sex, but these 4 girls and their last time still young girls will go alone before doing it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , You'll feel like this movie - it's a lot of money for you, no age has been set up or you have grown up in an age. We all know this school at school or very rarely. We all knew frustrated virgins, kept half-childhood and half wanted to grow suddenly and thought that it would do it for them. We all knew the boy was crazy, the fear of his reputation, the fashions plate whose fear is afraid of his world. We all knew the daughter of the party, which they heard, not the tragic house, but the story of her infamous exploitation. And we all knew that "mother's character" is a little more real, a little more gross, a little more sad, because she knew what would happen. Maybe you were one of those girls. Maybe, like me, you were at one time or another ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > In each female head, all the precipice are embodied in each factor. Are you hanging over any aspect? Do not you toss on the edge, no matter how you might have kept it? And how painful do you know everything is goodbye? What is this movie - how hard it is to have a woman's step in her childhood while walking and walking. If you stay there, you know ... and I love this picture. Wounded and tenderly done. Caught a fine piece of femininity.
