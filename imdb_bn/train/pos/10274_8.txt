Speakers are a gripping movie about these grifers. But who are the ears here? When will the hunter become a victim? This lively, dark movie is slow moving and seductive. It puts you under the path of inspirational garden and you feel safe, just as you can run just like that. <br /> <br /> It has a writing script with good acting (at least from Leads). I did not target the background music, but it was never blurred, so it must be done. <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised that I've liked this movie because I'm not usually going for it series but this one suck me up and eventually he's hooked up.
