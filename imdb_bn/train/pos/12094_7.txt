CAS of the Blood is a good example of the worst quality of the work in Italy in the 60's. The film has all the correct elements - old dark houses, atmosphere, a decent story and Barbara Steel. The most valuable film seen in Steel <br /> <br /> The story concerns about a scary castle. People have visited, but no one has returned. Our hero makes a dare that he can spend the night in the sickle and can collect his victory. However, at night he visited a special night. This is the year when the dead are resurrected back to their deaths. <br /> <br /> The only error I see in film is the running time. It seems almost padded. Literally, nothing happens in the first place where there is a large portion of the work. Our hero stumbles around finding darkness of interest. But once he finds something, the film comes up and is quite enjoyable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
