Love at the top - America's title is completely wrong title for the fantastic French film "Lee Mooten Engage" (which means I think, The Rabbit Shape) - this is a real movie, it seems like the previous date of 1974 is more surprising. This film was ahead of its time; Even today, according to the highest standards, it performs things that are rich and new. Hugely depicted by the underworld director Michael Devil, it converts social criticism, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satirism into a complete original mix, and denies the description in such a way that ultimately it is a sad and more understandable before a major but subtle surprise gone. Cast is excellent, writing and theme ditto But it's a delicious tale of the Devil, which keeps you on-off balance but enrapt, which in reality leads to this "lost" film very high level. (If you have a written interview with the director in the "Special Features" section of the DVD, it is definitely worth reading.)
