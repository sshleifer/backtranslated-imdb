This is a very good, made for tv film. This is a problem in the coast of the 1970s and certainly does not want to be close to it like the neighbors. The picture was the worst and most annoying part when Pork Terrells killed the dog. Teenagers do everything to annoy and disturb this poor family. But boy! Do not take revenge on those punk teens who are at the end of the lead character. The owner of the father / house does not accept all the damage from the hungry youth and it develops quickly after the lack of help from the police. He stood up and protected his house and his family. A very good actor .. I can add. <br /> <br /> When I was 8 or 9 I saw this TV. I have never seen this on TV and want to choose. Of course, a good one! This is a movie that can be captured at night very night at night and can not stop watching the weekends or in the afternoon. This way they will not show up again. <br /> <br /> It is certainly valuable!
