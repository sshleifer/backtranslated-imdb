This is the only Ruth Gordon starring Anghatha-Christie's murder mystery writer, who kept her nephew safely through marriage. Gordon believes that he killed his nephew and the young man died from sleep, when Gordon returned to New York. However, he left behind a few Blues, Black Safe Deposit Box and some well-structured and clear notes scratch. Colombo enters the case, once suspected him and only using his mysterious mysterious intuitive ability to solve the mystery. Oh, and Marty Hartley is Gordon's secretary and is going to be a blackmailer. Hartley, I believe, psychologist Big F. Skinner's big daughter. I'm not sure that his ancestor has something to do with his striking belly button, which is displayed in the sequence of a beaten dancer, but I've always admired Skinner. <br /> <br /> This murder case is handled well. This is a good plot, and the actors or crew fluff nothing. But here's a wonderful figure, Roth Gordon, a scope just five feet high. He was 80 years old and looked it up. There is a moment when she teeters around, but she consistently exudes charm. Her acting is idiosyncratic. He will never be serious or you can not be sure when he sees Colombo and the audience. He was given a very good line. Comedy comes from Gordon. Colombo does not have any of its frequent angular moments. <br /> <br /> Everyone, everybody is good.
