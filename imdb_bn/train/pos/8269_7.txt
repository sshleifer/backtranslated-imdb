I have planned this film for a while due to the high scores in IMDB - at the 9.0 average of more than 300 votes, it gives the highest ratings of any accessible silent film! How did I hear this photo before this website? Well, you can not always believe the rating. This is really a very good movie, which I hired, if any good VHS transfers would give an indication - acting with excellent principals, especially acting as William Hines Brown and some fine step footage of Climatic Harvard, with good footing in Cambridge. / Yale football game - but the story seems to be even a curiosity brown in 1926. Offensive, self-centered and charismatic people go to school and enter their place, the process becomes caring, self-sacrificing friend; I suspected the man in 1926 that the last few rail was really exciting, the prediction factor was high. Nevertheless, it starts very well and if you do not praise heaven, then it's worth remembering. Maybe the majority of the 350 voters of the past 350 ... <br /> <br /> Edit 600+ voters now and the score is really 9.2! Sincerely, folks, ballot stuff is going on here - why do not I deny to explain why a movie is better than "metropolis" or "general"!
