Nicholas Mallet is a failure. A bank is a Taylor, everyone gets all over it. Then his friend, a writer who does not like the books, has plans to change his life. Our hero is leaving his king. He earns a lot of money by spending the rest of his life and many women want to sleep. <br /> <br /> <br /> If this film did not have the death quantity (killer / suicide / natural causes), then it would be a Frenchman. Marriage, politics, journalism and life ... There are many jobs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jean-Louis Triangent is a favorite evil disorder. Romy Schneider is at its most interesting time. Of course a look price.
