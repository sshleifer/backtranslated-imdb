Once every time, Eddie Murphy will surprise you. <br /> <br /> In a movie like "Golden Child" especially. This film is a film that can be made by Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell or anyone else. But Eddie really works; He is intelligent, he is funny, he should be a hero, brave, kind, submissive, submerged, clean and everything else. <br /> <br /> has been selected for the protection of a mysterious child keeping the key to protecting the whole of the world. Evil (perfectly decorated by dance), Eddie goes to California's Nepalese and behind, the beautiful Kai no (Lewis) wonders, if he says it, he is a crazy old holy man (Wong, always perfect), that he knows <br /> <br /> This is exciting, exciting, exciting and of course, fun. Eddie is the only action hero, I know that any person comments inconsistent on reading pornographic magazines and can start a film with Smart-Alcat comments about Ed McMahon. <br /> <br /> There is no problem with this "children": this is a "golden" search. <br /> <br /> There are nine stars. Viva Nepal!
