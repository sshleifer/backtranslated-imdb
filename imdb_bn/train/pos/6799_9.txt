This episode is a little confusing. Some people say that you have to start from the very beginning but I must say that I was a little confused since the beginning! <br /> <br /> Clarke wakes up in the head and fervent psychoanalytic floor. The institution and she is having fun for the belief of a superhero. Clarke was told that what he knew was on his head. Horrific He found some unusual things: Martha was married to Leynele; After his accident in the bridge, Lex is bound in wheelchairs with his kingdom; And dedicated to Lanna Clark. But he finds a familiarity; Anyone dedicated to Clerk: Clo. He also discovered that even a psychiatric patient Smith known from the world. And a pastor from Doctor Phantom Zone. <br /> <br /> This episode reminds me directly to a buffy episode called "normal again", where Buffy begins to start lively-minded about a mental asylum. The doctor tried to convince him that what he knew was a symptom of his imagination and he was really crazy. Her parents were still married, they still lived in LA, her friends were not, Angel never had her boyfriend and Don did not even have a sister named Don. The giant and the vampire also did not exist. Both episodes are a little sad, because doctors are not just telling the characters that it is an illustration of all of his imaginations, but it tells us the truth: fiction, and it brings us back to reality. Although it's good, but sometimes it's time to understand the reality, but we look at these shows to escape from reality. It is again excellent because the characters will have to overcome new challenges.
