I waited to watch this movie for a long time and eventually I could see it at the Istanbul Film Festival. Maybe I was expecting this picture too much and that was why I was a little disappointed. I was not the best movie from Korea, but it's really valuable. <br /> <br /> This thing was nice and the film did not bother you, though it was long. But there is a gap between film and you are jumping from one point to the other. However, the role of Zone Do-Eon is incredibly beautiful. It was one of the best performances in the first movie history and I think this movie would not be good if it was not the role of the movie.
