Although not a new episode, it is rarely shown. I used to love the magic of Sabrina and the witch magician. I have never seen the last episode, but I want to know what happened to Miles or Josh? And why the aunt has disappeared from the show? I'm sure the finish is going to be perfect. But there are no answers to many questions. And I want to see the last episode of STLL! Because I heard that he decided between Irin and Harvey on his wedding day! I really love Harvey! And I can say that the hit ht !! Although hes too bad for me too old. Melissa Joan Heart's motto has her own idea that she adds to the show, but there are many "stupid" things to hear, such as famous bands that do not come from anywhere, and the songs are playing and all cast shows, stupid like this. As well as the cat really starts to get hairy, as the show continues, jokes started with just stupid and laughing things that "audio" controls the audio, I think it was very hair. Do not make me go wrong, in some parts it was funny, but I think the show is lost just as its "magic" so can be talked about as show. Although I try to give all the castles to try, even though the sweet moon fries had no taste for her, and she was a terrible actress. I wonder if Melissa or Cast worked that for any matter now, now the show has ended.
