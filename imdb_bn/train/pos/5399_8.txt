Goshara's last film of the late 1960s With a great sense of his film, a strong stylist, Gosho meets with Senter Katsura (Zatichi fame) to form this extreme allegation of neutral nationalist loyalty. <br /> <br /> The word "Tenuchi" (divine judgment) is a curse during the killing of the enemies of the faithful or the "treacherous" of the enemies. In the name of patriotic pride, Cassu calls an impressive politician the 'simple psychological loyalty' of his character. Anyone who asks politicians is labeled "traitor" and it becomes the target of a murder. <br /> <br /> One of the best photos movies, many shots, colors and incredible compositions of light. The battle scene is frequent and very bloody and brutal. Goshha's color palette became a part of the blood for his photo. Fantastic and annoying. Although it is easy to follow a personal story, the historical background is complex and the basic history of this period of Japan will be very helpful, but you can strive through it through the film. There are some flaws in the movie, the music track, the length and katasura sometimes visible chewing. He has a drunk scene that is way over the top for a film but actually has a very accurate illustration of a drunk. <br /> <br /> Downbeat but one of the great Chambara films.
