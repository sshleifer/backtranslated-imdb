I only saw the first series in the DVD, but summarized as Shakespeare's plot with the script like Tarantino. This series is good for Goodfellas and Casino and The Godfather (about 10 "no") and better than Guy Ritchie's efforts. Although there are plenty of arrangements, it is driven by many bloody, story characters. Even some small story lines contributing to the line; For example, the relationship between Carmilla and Reisterau's wife, and Christopher and his friend's friend (or lack thereof) (who was not the person nominated for the Darwin award)? <br /> <br /> In addition to plots, scripts and acting, I like it for other reasons; <br /> <br /> 1. It wanted me to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with tomato sauce. 2. Music. 3. It shows that literally someone can enjoy mental health problems.
