This dolph Lundgren car is a fun season hard forward action flick, it's not going to win any prize, and it's not very original, but it provides products that you want to see from Dolf Lundgren. Our Man Dolf is a former soldier who is now a teacher in a solid inner city high school and was taken to the terrorists on that day, to protect that day. Sure that the script can not win an Oscar for his fun and its fair share is stupid steps. Dolph Lundgren has done a lot of good performances, but he remains more alive in performances, and the rest are not the best actors, but they hold it well. All stuck all in one enjoyable action, but you saw it a million times ago.
