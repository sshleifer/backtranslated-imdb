The Wizard of the Lost Kingdom is a film about a young prince (Simon), who was expelled from his kingdom because of his father's death by a broker "evil counselor". This movie is about Simon's adventure. Special effects, intrigue, acting, and generally everything is bad about this movie. However, it is very interesting that it is fun. You'll see this movie simply because it's so funny that it's funny, and, as the film is just like other critics, it's great.
