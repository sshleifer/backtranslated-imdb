Panic in the streets represented a New Orleans, similar to Street Desire (also directed by both Gagg on stage and on screen), in which the main demand for fame - the birthplace of Jazz - does not even mention a mention. It took a long way to play Richard Willmarck's seventh film and to act in a controversial way for a long time. Gadeg sees himself in a small role recognized as a morgue, but a local film 'Big' followed by Jack Palance (still paying Walter Jack Palance), Side-Kick Jiro Mustel, Barbara Bell Jades, Emil Maire, Tommy Ratatig Plus- Paul Douglas, who is a reliable with roll-steel, is a policeman who views the viewer's view Ray called. It is very interesting movie to look after it. If you can catch it.
