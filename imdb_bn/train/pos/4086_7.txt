How nice. UHM ... well ... wow! Guess I'll start with the plot. A fallen woman (Lucy) arrives at her family's home to husband (Mathrin) in France, where she is waiting for a bishop or someone from the Catholic Church to marry (to fulfill the will). Waiting, young Lucy learn about a legend of a seed who stands on the ground before centuries. That night, on the bed, she started imagining with the house's former lady for a joint effort with Bust and her rape. Where it gets interesting! The plot is really thin (and it pulls in the middle of the flashing for quite some time), but the filmmaker's prize (?) Who keeps it confined to a frustrating and ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone. If you are looking for a great movie, look elsewhere. If you are looking for an exotic movie about vigor (which is almost sympathetic to the subject), this movie is for you! (If you have a weak stomach, do not be afraid of it. Initially, out of some horses and horses, 'performances' beautiful cartoon, IMO)
