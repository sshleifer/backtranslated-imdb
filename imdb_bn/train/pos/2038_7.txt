This film exceeds my expectations. I thought and heard that it was going to be garbage, so I did not have much hope. However, I was pleasantly surprised. At first I did not take the lead girl well and if she survives or dies, she does not really care. After a while, he clearly grew up on me and became a favorite character. This is not just a few slash movies where people die for some reason. A background story that takes only a few seconds of film, but many interpret it. I would recommend this picture to everyone. If you are not sure, then look at it exactly, it's just one and a half hours of your life. You're going to live for 80 years anyway.
