"Shower" is a story about a heritage, but rather the loss of the traditional and more humanitarian ways of life, due to the unstable progress of the modern world. A man was forced to choose between the successful career of his business, his big city life, his wife and his disabled young brother. There is an eternal suspicion between what we want to do and what we have to do. The ancient one versus modern China. The Ganajagaran Mancha fought against the public baths, its cricket shopping centers and the summer clashes. Old men and women do not need that anymore. China, one country, two systems, Ziaoping said ... even though one of them is killing another. <br /> <br /> Tender, moving, funny moments and nasty-sweet ones. Sensitive people will cry and laugh at the same level. Actors are extraordinary, especially one who plays the role of a disabled child; And Yang Zhang is a good job, easy, easy, let the story flow itself. <br /> <br /> My rate: 8/10
