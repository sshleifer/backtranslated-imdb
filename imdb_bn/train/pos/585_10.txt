After watching this film again, this time it has been published infinitely more than I did earlier. The acting is incredibly surprising. Characters are drawn very clearly. Brad Pitt is simply superb as unbelievable son who is rebel boy. Respect for other actors and actresses equally fine. Robert Redford made a wonderful time piece from the 1920's speaker's day. The view is incredibly beautiful in the West Montana Mountains and the flow. After all, this is one of the best films made in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> You can certainly see this movie <br /> <br /> <br />
