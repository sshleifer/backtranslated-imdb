I watched the recent area 2 DVD of the film that appeared in the "Awesome" section of the Oxford Street store and was advertised as a "Classic Thriller". In fact, for about four decades, a car for British comedy and the most popular name for entertainment, Arthur Askey. <br /> <br /> Perhaps its endless, delightful, brilliant, and certainly beautiful humorous nature comes in. As the culture of many cultures in the past twenty-five years of British comedy accustomed to the severity and brutal taste. However still those who appreciate the total respect of his animated and cheery personality and pathos. Askey is an idol of the great Tommy Cooper who often picks up "self-strangulation" that Arthur tries to entertain with stingy passengers. <br /> <br /> The Travers, which has an interesting, rare look by the bottom Linden, makes an impact as mysterious Julie.
