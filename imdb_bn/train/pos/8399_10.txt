The love trap is not short, it features a full-length feature film with an ongoing 105-minute running time. <br /> <br /> When I'm writing this, I can say more about the love trap. I often asked what makes love love different ... I answer this question: 1) It introduces characters - especially - which have never been seen before in the film. <br /> <br /> 2) It reveals more truth about love, and spreads deeper into the concept of love, than my ruthless views of any US movie. <br /> <br /> 3) The story is structurally called, it's different from any love story you've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 4) It gives very timely insights into various cultural topics inside and outside the black community. <br /> <br> Over time, the era of love of people will be seen as potentially original work in this era, joyfully refreshing, authentic and honest. This is a rare morality game which is full of food for thought. <br /> <br /> For complete and accurate information about this image, please visit www.lovetrapmovie.com.
