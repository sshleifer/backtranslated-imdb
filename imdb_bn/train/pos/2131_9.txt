This is a movie which gets good every time I see it. There are many nuanced performances in this. William Tracy as Pepi, bringing a delightful, sharp comic relief. Joseph Silkarkut, as well as the only "Villian" on film and his oily glasses are used here. Frank Morgan, as the owner of the title store, Mr. Miller Matusk, and its familiar method are used here well. I like Pyrovich, especially Felix Brasert performance. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie belongs to Jimmy Stewart. The film is presented from its perspective, with its rotation around it. Mr. Stewart has done the job of carrying a movie with an amazing performance that uses different emotions. Just look at Stuart, when he is expelled from his job, because of a misunderstanding. He is able to express shock, anger, fear and embarrassment, so that a traumatic event occurs, so perfectly. According to my estimate, James Stewart is the greatest film actor in media history without any questions. There is no film that has been caught in films that is able to fully express what the viewers are feeling. He made this film, before that he had most of his career, but he was fully master of his craft. It is one of Jimmy Stewart's best films and it is one of the sweetest, most enjoyable romantic comedy. I greatly recommend this movie, especially for those who appreciate Stewart's work.
