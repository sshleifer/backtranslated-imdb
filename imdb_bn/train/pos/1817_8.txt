All dogs go to heaven The dog plays on the criminal underworld. This movie is a fun and joyous song for children with a humorous but dark-but-satisfied and happy-ending story. It is Charlie, a fellow dog expelled from criminal criminal properties but comes back from the dead. He met a homeless human girl who looked at him and through this relationship he realized the meaning of life and sacrifice. It's an intelligent animation that loves very much through my eyes. I would highly recommend this film to children. I'm not sure how to respond to adults. (I tried to see it in VHS a few years ago, but the recording will not last long, is not it?)
