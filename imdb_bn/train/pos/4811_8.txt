Who knew 40 years after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, virtual reunioner Modac Dowdy Queen Victoria actually lived with drama and conspiracy in her little days. 'The Young Victoria' has not only done the history of the romance romance with her husband, but also has done an excellent job to describe political strategies in detail around its sources on the throne. <br /> <br /> <br /> 'Set up' you draw directly into it. In less than a year after the birth of Victorian in 1820, Kent's Duchess, after the death of Victoria's father, finally joined former army officer John Conowy, who served as widow and his child queen as a comptroller. To-be Conroy is forced to be raised under Victoria's 'Kensington System', designed to be strengthened when future queen is designed to have any communication with other children. What's more, Victoria became queen each day to sleep in her mother's bedroom. The film explains that in 1830 the Legislative Assembly passed the Legislative Act, which was established that Victoria's mother would be the governor (and therefore the Guardian)) that Victoria is still a minor while the throne acceded. During this time, Duchess and Conroy tried to scorn the princess princess and she insisted to sign documents making her personal secretary and treasurer Conroy. It was not a strong intentional Victoria, and refused to go with Connor and his mother's disgusting plans. Duchess dislike King William because he considered him as a philanderer, who disrespected the monarchy; The king felt that Desess disrespected his wife. As a result, Duchess tried to limit Victoria's contact with the king. On the scene in history's history, King dismissed Duchess at his birthday banquet that Victoria had the goal of surviving before reaching his 18th birthday so that his mother would not have monarchy. <br /> <br /> King William kept his word and Victoria died shortly after being eligible to be crowned. Victoria's mother took vengeance on behalf of Connie, whom she blamed for her childhood so tragic. They were both exiled to an isolated apartment in Buckingham Palace and for several years, Victoria had little contact with her mother. <br /> <br /> 'The Young Victoria', Queen of Victoria's rug around the rage and the situation. Victorian's relationship with Lord Melbourne was a good part of the film, the Prime Minister of the Hog Party, unfortunately, as much as he was younger than the picture, unfortunately portrayed. Initially, Melbourne's young queen got the trust and they became good friends. In the early years of his reign, he saw Melbourne as progressive, but later he became a general politician, paid tribute to him, which kept his humiliation to the public, whom he wanted to be champion. In fact, Melbourne had more parents than Victoria, but the film saw some erotic tensions between Prime Minister and Prince Albert, although they were romantic rivals. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the Queen must certainly commission Sir Robert Peel as a more conservative Tory Party, the new Prime Minister. This picture describes the events of 'Bedchamberger Crisis', in which Pillar resigned, Victoria denied refusing to replace some of his classmates to replace the wives of the Tory politicians. The film was another scandal, which took a lady heaving, who was one of Deses's female in-waiting, who was accused of having a relationship with John Conroe and being pregnant by him. Because of his hatred for Conno, Victoria Hustings's nasty rumor spread through the alleged pregnancy spread. As it turned out, Hastings just became pregnant ?? In fact, he was tummy in the stomach. Victoria's inexperience at Beckhamber's Crisis shows, however, film-makers ignore some extravagant aspects of her character, as proved by The Hastings Affair. <br /> <br /> The rest is related to 'The Young Victoria' - Romance between the Queen and the Prince Albert. Victoria was waiting for Albert, because the film made it clear, because she wanted to serve herself as a new sovereign. Until Albert returned to England, he spent time consistent with each other and Victoria supported during the Bedchamber's Crisis attempt. <br /> <br /> I have a parallel parallel between Prince Albert and Prince Philip, the current Queen's husband. While Philip was mainly Danish, he went to school in Germany and was the father-in-law of the German background. Both Albert and Philip did business in court for the reform of etiquette (Albert discovered that the slaves still kept the table settings for King George III, although he died!). Was Albert's struggle similar to Philipp? As a husband, they had to do something as husband's husband. Both Albert and Philip were involved in various civic projects that they did not have to live forever in the shadow of their most popular wives. Thankfully, there is a wonderful scene at the end of the film, where Albert Victoria breaks it into his "interference" in his subjects. Albert does not want 'Bechambber Crisis' for the second time, so he goes over his wife's head and arranges for a compromise involving women in Victoria's bed. Victoria is only talking to Albert when a murderer bullet puts both of them down (film Albert shot it by the hand, but it never happened!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Principal, Emily Blunt and friend of silver. Young Victoria goes on rather suddenly and closure credits are very intense toward halography (there is no mention of Victoria's depression after Albert's death). But 'Victoria' is still an engaging drama and interesting history lesson.
