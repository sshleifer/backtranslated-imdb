My observation: Ultimately the Vamp group is wonderful and wonderful, exotic and pretty. Jeetette wore it well, and got even with naiveon naiveon. The boat gave him the right to crashed into his balcony. Its female mafia's cosmetic decor is nicely designed well, especially by today's standard. 1942 costume designer has done great work. The main song theme is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Negative posters alert: 1942 WW was the second time; The year happened before Pearl Harber. United States coming out of Great Britain! Need to get out and spend the hard earned money on singing, dance and yes, gorgeous imagination diversion. Patriotic dictators are trying to free the freedom fighters. Thanks public public attended this fantastic plot line movie. The movie is going to be a depressing behavior, at those depressing times. When you are a negative poster, actor or even a movie star, there is room for you to talk to and criticize you. Janet and Nelson's films are standing in the test of time. <br /> <br /> The angel made the wonderful angel wonderful. RL Wings are not so hot in costume dresses, but Janet is considered to be great at SL. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Genetic dance was a pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> 15/10
