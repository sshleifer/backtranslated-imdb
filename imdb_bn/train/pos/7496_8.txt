<br /> <br /> I issue with the opinions of other critics for general reasons that it is not a mysterious film, a supernatural one! This is not the only movie that is not the only "supernatural" explanation ("Vampires"), but it has become very stupid. Other pictures that are believed to be "Before Dawn" by Adger Wallace and (more famous) "Vampire Mark". <br /> <br /> The movie does a great job in creating a very terrifying atmosphere, similar to the Dracula, when Rainfield completes the countdown on the castle's stairs, or the sign of the Vimier, two people show that the castle is destroyed by a windows of ruins and an organ " See when Luna uses wings! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
