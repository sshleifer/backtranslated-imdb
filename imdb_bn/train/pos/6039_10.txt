Lucky these great movies are enough to be an extra and like every minute of filming. I went to the premiere in London and talked well to Phil, Peter, Martin and John as my wife. Congratulations even after party. Then after a few weeks our cinema travel with the members of the bicycle club. What a nice picture, it's all worthy to be up there with great biker films. Now we have a DVD mama, my wife is not able to get enough amount or kids can not. I think the club is getting a little bit from the club, now it seems I'm a movie star now. I think they are just jealous. The first part of the filming was just weather, rain, rain and more rain, but hey we were in Wales. Hopefully there will be a follow-up so keep me posting zone.
