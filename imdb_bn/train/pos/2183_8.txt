Clear misunderstandings are coming out of the way very quickly, thanks to Heaven, and what's left is a wonderful and wonderful concordance with some nice songs (and some more forgotten), Crosby is a wonderful turn of Broadway legend Mary Mart√≠n during her most charming times and Basil Rathbone and Oscar Levant have supplied mostly disciplined forces (Levant rarely And his quips date is not date). A delightful surprise, and consistent recommendations for all fans.
