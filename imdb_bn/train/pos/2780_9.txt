Great movie- I like it Great editing and soundtrack usage Capture the real feeling of Indian life, yet we can all be related. A good choice to throw with great characters. The film develops all the letters so that you care for them all and you think of them as well. The use of Indian music and drums in some football scenes is great and the direction really works as effective because everyone comes as real and natural. You can not just route this picture to Jess! Acting was really good, even very drunk and both of the leading women's body gestures have been very confident as anyone that played football.
