It is very easy to achieve the film: "A Pure Masterpiece". This opinion has been made for the following reasons: Actor's performance, they seem to be citizens of that era, 1100 BC. They fully personalized the characters. The second reason is Homer's good poetry by producing poetry published in his poem. Details of others described by the chorus provide a special environment that favors us on artistic strategy. Third Reason: The restructuring of decoration is absolutely perfect, in the Mediterranean region where the verse of poetry occurs. And maximum, emotion is the addition. I repeat my perception: "A Pure Masterpiece".
