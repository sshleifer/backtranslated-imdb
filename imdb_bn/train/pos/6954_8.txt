The film is the most entertaining movie I've seen for several years and laughter supporters support me. Laughter from my Big Fat Greek wedding (2002) has been as spontaneous and intense. Last year Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005) are very easy to use in parody (Mr. and Mrs. Smith's spy and sex in my super-ex-girlfriend). The director and Ivan Rittman, among the tricks and drama, are great among the mad and neutral laughing. Crackle Shock and Dramatic Serious Crack Never At the same time, although this expected romantic comedy is promoted in advance, it does not even lose its sensitive emotional elements. In some ways, it is so clear that how it plays is great. As with real life, sometimes the truth is so clear that no one can see it. With Tutsi (1982), there are eight ranking positions in ten stars easily. Probably not a (depending on how it appears on a second view).
