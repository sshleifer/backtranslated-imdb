A good movie with it - for its time - an intense, spreading, rather dark story, remembers John Ford's "inventor" though it is not so cruel. The story begins immediately and Stewart does not start with some of the really good conversations between Jeff Webster, Rondo Castle and Sheriff Gannon. This movie is also memorable for Man-Stewart, in some of the remarkable ways of "Band of the River" (1952), but I think it is less sensitive and more interesting. There are a few cavities: very fast fast (and rather sensitive) finishes; The 24-year-old Corin Calaver is not very convinced as a neutral French teenager, and of course, the film is held in lies, where the actual laws of the tribe are not implemented and the physics are not implemented. But these trivial concerns. James Stewart surprisingly feels as a dark, helpless person who thinks he does not care about anyone other than himself and can not beat the mountain scenes. A fine western clothing drama.
