I first saw this film and International Film Studies course. I lauded the slow and reactionary passings of the film details, because of a 'non-traditional' student, and perhaps for many years living or acquiring knowledge. A dry climate is lantern with heat and dust, the story is full of deep psychological, multi-layered symbolism, and there is a detailed evolution of the theme to be 'another' in a country that can not understand. The burden that comes to understanding is the fulfillment of the memories and externalities with the intrinsic value. About 20 years ago, it is a producer of many other international films, who discovered the colonial themes in colonial locations, exploring the oddity of the culture they entered. Much more sculpture --- and widely invested --- those that have been created reflect the same themes: Indochina, two that are nowhere in Africa, which probably think chocolate is pale and boring. It has no adrenaline-pumping action or extreme violence. The struggle is emotional, emotional, and delicate. But, that's being said, it's a fine film, worth seeing.
