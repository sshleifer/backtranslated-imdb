In this film, Ed Harris's work is on its standard standards, that is, he stole the screen due to sharing with anyone, and there is a great San Connie. The film, which is more than transparency, lives only in the scene when the attorney interrogates Harris for another conviction. It's exciting, a master class in artistic control. <br /> <br /> Other cast members are all careful and consonant faithful, such as a fish, but the story itself does not pack any wall. The plot basically depends on the context that black prisons will always be abused by white law enforcement officials. This is an engine that makes the story correct, or wrong, and eventually ends up feeling deceptive. Still, Harris is worth the money to look at the steps.
