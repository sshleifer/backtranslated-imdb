Jerome Crabbabe plays a major role in this film. I have seen this movie 6 times and I am still not tired. This movie is in some ways like Flesh + Blood. Gerald Soetman is a great writer. He wrote Paul Vernovan's Dutch films. Paul Verhoeven is one of the greatest directors. I have seen all his films except Shobarger. My mother does not like her much but I do not agree. I think all his films are specially remembered for a total and a journey to visit the fundamental institute. Jerry Goldsmith has done several of his movies, including Total Recall, Basic Institute and Hall Man. I do not want to die in Jerry's Goldsmith. A variety of Dutch films but still enjoyable.
