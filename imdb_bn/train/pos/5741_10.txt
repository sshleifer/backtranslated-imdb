Seeing Seattle's preview is one of my favorite movies. Tom Hulce was amazing, could express his feelings / thoughts out of the word. I actually sent some donation money to Mike Ferrell to help in distributing the film. It's good. The system says I need more lines but do not want to give away the plot staff. I'm Hulce and director, a spectator from Seattle and I think Michael Fergell was among the viewers. They talk about an hour later. The house does not really have a dry eyes. I do not know why Hollywood fools continue fools. (Actually I know, it is our fault, what we see) Well what you pay to say. Get this and see it with someone special. This is a jewel.
