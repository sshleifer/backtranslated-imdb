Norman, is that you? (It's all the third hand, so take a grain of salt) Adopted with a Jewish African African family, when it is transposed onto stage and screen. Also, it was originally one of those films that were shot on the video, so the theater prints can not be that great. But the performance of Redd Fox and others was quite good. <br /> <br /> I wanted to tell you that this movie is a very fine one: It reflects the attitude of finding a gay boy or daughter in your family between the 70's and 70's. Because of that alone, it's quite interesting - if not a little "Hollywood". Do not believe me Check out lines about screens, etc. too stereotypical. Not too deep. <br /> <br /> But ... the movie is really burning in some areas. Raid Fox is trying to find his wife when there is a side-splitting scene, who escaped with his brother (!) To the suspended assistant of the Ensena. Phone conversations across the border are really memorable. <br /> <br /> The best scenes in the film were Weiland Flowers and Madame Gay / Barber Nightclub who used his gay routine. The best of my knowledge, this routine was filmed only during the time. And, it's a little clearer and a much smaller version, I'm called. Still, it's alcohol Madam, and should not be missed. People are still stolen from Wayland; People were really gifted. Enjoy the movie!
