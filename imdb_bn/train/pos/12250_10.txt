Kate Beckinsale stole the show! Say! Very bad knightly Jeremy is not looking as good as Nutam. Mark Strong did a fabulous job. Bernard Hepton Emmas was perfect as a father. I like the last scene (which is well written in addition to the addition of the novel) when the crop is harvested and there is a nightline with its workers and high society friends. Emma must demonstrate that this must be accepted. She is a changed woman. That's very fast, but OK. I would buy it. Samanta Bond plays Emma's former glory and believing. She's nice Just as I imagined him I believe that when Jane Jiston of the United Kingdom is its best The American version of English Literature is for standard and not for quality. See this one!
