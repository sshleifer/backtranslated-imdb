I'm going to this movie, I've heard something good about it. It's coming out, I was really surprised or disappointed. Simon Peg has played many other characters like his other movies. There was a couple of laughs here and there - nothing very interesting. Probably my favorite parts of the movie when they dance in the club scene I have to completely try that I must find myself in a club. Here and there are some stars: Megan Fox, Kirsten Donst, The Chick in the X-File, and Jeff Bridges. I found it quite funny to see a camio look at Thandi Newton in the scene. He must be in a previous movie with Simon Peg, Run Fatboy Run. I see it as a toss-up, you'll find it to enjoy a level or find a little poles on it. I can add, adorable in this film by Carsten Donst. : 3
