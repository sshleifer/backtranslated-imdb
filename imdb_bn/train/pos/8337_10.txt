Being a big fan of the romantic comedy genre and seeing a large number of these movies, it hit me as absolutely unique. In that case, it is equally rare for me to gasping for breath through laughter during the scene. The story of love is a bit thin on the ground, but I would probably say that this is probably the best, because this romantic comedy firmly insists in "comedy", and in any case, I want to do more rom com so little more than the boundaries of credibility. Four scientists have not only provided some interesting moments to this movie, but I have seen it in a film for a long time. I was hesitant for brief moments before finally choosing "9" as the rating, because I believe many people use it unreasonably, and so the maximum rating will lose some of its effects. I'm a big Mage Ryan fan, which helps, but in some of these films I saw it where I would say that he is very shaded. She and Tim Robbins have thrown the leadership, but for me, the second puzzle to fight leftist intellectuals. A genuine smile-out-loud type film.
