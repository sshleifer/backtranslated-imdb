This movie is released and after that it has valuable resources. A wonderful group of actors (I always find a film casting the most interesting aspects). Truly this role enjoyed watching the dramatic actress Jacqueline Bisset and Wallace Shaun is always a hooter. The script is smart, slie and tongue-in-cheek, almost everything is "Beverly Hills". Loving Paul Bartel's "Doctor" and Ray Sharky's husband. It was messy and weird, but thank God! If you do not prude, I sincerely recommend this movie. For anyone who likes to play six degrees of Kevin Bacon, Mary Varnov and Paul Bertell, there was "Rock and Roll High School". Mary Ornov and Robert Beltran were together at "Comet Night" They had three "eating roses".
