Most people reacted to my reaction to this reaction first: there were cheap shots of fatty people, etc. All right, so he is meeting Diane Arc. . . Anyway. . . But long ago I realized that it was not being frustrating, as the images were published, I felt that the problem was completely audiences: we are conditioned by Hollywood and actually feel movies in almost everywhere that people behave with sex on a particular age It is a little unreasonable, something that should not be shown. It would be a great deal if all this was given to the film. However, the story of a woman with a humiliating boyfriend and her drunk friend is truly a brick-to-brick hit: It seems to be a good story, incredible performance, and the idea of ​​improving the scene. That blonde guy is a genius actor. Finally, I want to give opinions on how cruel this movie is to all these people. The old man who is finally made up of the dancing woman for him, is completely a perfect character that breaks the mold, so do not make the movie more visible by making him visible. Yes his dog died. This is not a pink picture in the world but it's not. . . Completely disappointed. However, I felt grateful to the filmmaker for making such beautiful films. I do not want to say that each thread was strong as strong, but I would say that this film basically kicks the ass and will highly recommend it. . .
