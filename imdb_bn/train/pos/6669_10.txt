I saw this movie last year. Ridiculous i thought about Well, now it's in the video and I've seen it again. I like this movie! The work they do is sometimes stupid, but this is my third favorite film of all time. Special effects are okay, but malicious dialogue will be rolling to you. I am inspired by this kind of movie, I like the drama and other elements, so avoid that kind of person type. But enjoy everyone else! Acting fantastic Han Azariah has the best hand (he is not a comic or a result) Ben Stiller (Oh, do not correct me, it makes me sick) and then William H. Messi gave his best performance (outgoing exterior). Everyone appreciated from Messi to Garaphallo, but I think Kyle Mitchell was very good like the invisible age. Two issues: Romance subplot between the most annoying part of the film is Stiller and Claire Forlani and Casanova Parole Hearings. Some scenes proceed absolutely in the story, but they are an explosion. The King's and especially the writers were dragging on a scene until its strength was gone, but they would live and you were ready for more. I swear I see it, you'll be tired of the explosive climax (which I think was pretty) the camera is quite calm, running at a brisk pace with the actors. Also, Tom Wats has provided a great performance (he has this cool cool bad hero coolness) and someone else says that the best part is when the characters show some humanity to them. Captain Amazing was quite funny (especially in his speech to Casanova - I was rolling about his perfect plan) and quite calm as Qashanvo. A beef: Evergreen comedian (Eddie Storm) is almost lost, but his heart is in the right place. So all in all, an amazing movie. I give it twenty thousand stars and hope that one day, the best parody of the film, six million dollars will see the brightness in one of the man. Smile right now as I think about it. 20/10
