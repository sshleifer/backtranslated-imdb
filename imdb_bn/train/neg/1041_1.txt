How many more "pieces of life" will this film make of this fraud? I hope not too much. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Nothing wrong What is wrong with this movie, especially that it is the independent production of Hold-Out, "Hello" in the independent version of the Hollywood, ignoring every clip visitors and pills. <br /> <br /> This is supposed to be "real", so jump to the left without any cameras "documentary style", the camera will not intentionally remove the camera ... <br /> <br /> This is "intense" Do not waste any time to enlighten. <br /> <br /> This is "hip", so let's use the swear words like al pasino in the squareface ... <br /> <br /> And so, and more. What you have left is a very self-conscious effort to influence Hollywood, which will not affect anyone outside the "bad" indie crowd, which still seems to be praised in every bad movie.
