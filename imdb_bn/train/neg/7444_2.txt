Unless you are afraid of Russian people or boars, this movie is a snorefest. In fact, I fell asleep for about 40 minutes and had to request to leave the theater. If i had A waste of a perfectly beautiful Saturday evening. <br /> <br /> There was even "Silent Hill" scarier. Hack, even "Pan's Laboratory" was scarier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, since I brought a group of my Russian friends and we all cringed it Shameful Oh my god <br /> <br /> Hmm. Well, thankfully for me (and perhaps you) this film has already escaped from my brain and I just came out of it an hour ago. So I do not have any specific point of view, just curious visuals that do not go anywhere, and some of the weak-now-dead hope will happen. <br /> <br /> I probably saw a completely distorted version of this movie because I can not believe it has received such a great review here (for that reason I have seen it) and not only horse or suspense, but overall entertainment values ​​are also completely canceled. <br /> <br /> I can give it a 2 because yes, I fell asleep and wanted to go after 40 minutes but I got up and did not go away.
