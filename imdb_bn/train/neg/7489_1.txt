American films about war and Nazi can not be just good. They can not be stupid and refrain from following an agenda. All Nazis are bad, crazy, very proud, and Americans are so kindly but capable and intelligent and human. Let's close this bullish. The main character says something like, "By this trial, our aggressive war should be done a crime". America is peaceful country with world # 1 $ 420 billion "defense" budget (# 2 China only $ 51b)? Is it just spent without this ... ROI? Why does not America represent a peaceful country? I dislike deeply in the movie with an agenda - they try to cast the hell industry and intend us to believe something. Films should be labeled in Hollywood, just as "Parental Advice" label in record companies. Some of our films should have a "Bully Advisor", "Campaign Advisor" or "Politically Correct Advisor" label. This is one of them.
