It's amazing what it passes for my entertainment today. Perhaps I'm a dinosaur for fifty years, and I'm out of touch with today's film generation, and obviously this is the case with this movie, since many people liked it. I found it dirty and rude. I did not say that many movies of my life but this bill fits. Humorous and crude. I am not politically correct person, I have found a funny shirt, not just funny but cruel aggressive (I'm not gay). The main character of the movie is not only a desired person but also a merciful. When the movie was finally over, I heard a lot of people how disappointed they were, they saw very well what they saw.
