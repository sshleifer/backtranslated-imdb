I really wanted to like it, but eventually it was a badly made movie with very little smile. <br /> <br /> There is a spot in politics, it will condemn the hellfire to the Republicans, but this is designed to do this. .

Who knows I liked more of a nudge, Wink approach - a subtlety somewhat. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> I said,
