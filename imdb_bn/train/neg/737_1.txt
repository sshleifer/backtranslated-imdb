WOW! <br /> <br /> <br /> I gave this picture to my friend, who bought 1.98 rupees in Walmart, and he felt that he was taken away! It is boring outside, most scenes are portrayed in front of the green screen, the actors have been modified somewhat, almost as if they do not have any scripts. Martians look like CGI, which they are made by a young, or a fan produced movie. I can not stress how bad this DVD is! Example: In one scene, Martins tortured a local woman prisoner. She is a woman in front of a summer screen, that woman goes from a CGI copy. The change is completely targetable, and when he dies, you can see that it looks like a computer image, a game in the 1990s! <br /> <br /> If possible, avoid plagiarizing the movie! You can download two trailers from their site, and see how it really is God-awful!
