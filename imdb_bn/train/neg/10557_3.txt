It is a harmful little production, as well as a nightmare, as well as give headaches. It is an indefinite mix of live action and ugly stop-motion animation. It's weird, but it's not fun kind of, weird hope someone might expect optimistic. It's cold, inhuman, arrogant, sick, or even weird kind of weird. There is no reason to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-is a lot more interesting things with stop speed. <br /> <br /> Interesting, it is a French production. In this way, it re-sterilize the stereotype which has no idea about the fear of the French.
