I just gave this ridiculous headline comedy a horrible 2 flicks because in the past several prominent porn stars appeared in it. A group of tourists, on the other hand, are actually run on the holiday in Ireland but in Canada, a cannabalistic inebriated mutant is run by some or the other, and this plot is less than the Hill or the right direction. The only problem, until I do not rumble, are only a mutant in the display, and he is not that impressive at all. About five years ago that sort of mummy potbellied in the homemade film. Some poor but stupid death help, but the film is strictly amateur night and annoying outside of belief. Expiration is expected and death has been done. For any punishment purpose.
