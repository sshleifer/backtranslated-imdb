Yes ... this is definitely some of the worst movies, but I have seen it more badly. Gremlins rating R. Well anyway, I met Rick Slow in some sci-fi conference, that was surprisingly, he was lecture! This is one of the really low budget conferences, where everything goes, everyone brings something (if you want to see a shit, you should see some friends and what I have come here). <br /> <br /> It seemed like a nice man, he was talking about Hoggbins My questions and opinions were very quiet and he also told me not to take it seriously, and he liked the version of MSST 3 Rehin! <br /> <br /> To everyone, Rick Slonen knew what he was doing. And I think it was bad like the attack of Mars. So I guess I'm standing for this movie and giving it a 5, and betraying my colleague MSTI. Miserable friends
