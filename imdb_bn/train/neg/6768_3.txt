Herbie, Voxageen, who looks like a man, is coming back, now Maggie Peton (Lindsay Lohan) is being driven, a young girl who wants to be a NASA champion. The only thing that stands out in his way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do something to stop them. <br /> <br /> The main love bug was not good. Even as a kid, I do not remember it very much like it. I was expecting something for sigl though. I think the cast is quite good and the trailer seems like it's a fantastic funny movie. Unfortunately, Herbie was no better than before. This movie is weakly weak for people over the age of 12. Perhaps it will give children entertainment, but that's all. <br /> <br /> I understand that this is a child film and all but they can make this film even more interesting. There was very little laughter and eventually became annoying. Most actors feel dead in their role. Lindsay Lohan was right as Maggie Peton. She usually gives good performance like Freaky Friday and average girls. Matt Dillon gave everyone the best performance. There was not much to work with him though he was as good as the bad guy. Justin Long, Breaking Girl and Michael Keaton are really there and they do not do anything special. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Angela Robinson ordered and she works well. He tried to keep the picture interesting but he was working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Gourant have written Screenplay and will you be surprised that they are also responsible for the Taxi and Piusweier? These two light films make up but they really fail to make the stories interesting or enjoyable. This is not their fault entirely but hopefully they will try hard next time. In the end, Harbie is a safe, anticipated family movie that is valuable to see if you are a kid. Everyone else is well off skipping it. Ratings 4/10
