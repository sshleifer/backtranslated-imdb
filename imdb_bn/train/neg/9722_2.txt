Basically because of the main character, I really do not like this picture! They are both imperfect, selfish, and self-centered people. They hit almost all of playing their evil game. The visual effects were good but if they are a storyline or interesting storyline connected to you then they are good at what they do. Can I be happy if these two psychologists end their love for each other? <br /> <br /> I was thinking after watching this movie "It's Stopping # 1 from France?" ........ <br /> <br /> * spoiler * <br /> <br /> End: Good Rhythm! They both deserve each other! <br /> <br />
