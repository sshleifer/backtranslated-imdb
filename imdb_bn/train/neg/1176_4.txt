Revolution is always the current opportunity for dramatic films, in fact, most revolution is in their own dramatic events. Unfortunately, the lack of drama of this film is compensated by an excessive amount of turmoil. Someone wakes up, loses, does not die or gets life - it just ends up as soon as possible. It seems to me that due to large measurements, background technology seems to be a useful use. Scenes in Paris and French countryside have a cardboard quality about them. They can be well at a bare stage and that way may be left. The amazing effects of "Flying Daggers of House" or "The Golden Compass" can not be expected, but above all it is the production of the 2002 digital multimedia. Characters seem to enter a scene to enter a scene, so that many enter the number of characters and leave the number count to leave the number. In my view, this picture transforms the French Revolution of the 1790s into "Poppy-Cole" world's "Papia-Mash" revolution.
