I thought a horror comedy film could fail so helplessly in both the fronts ... really awful. It does not take itself seriously (usually a good thing) to work against it, because the actors are so woody, you really will swear that they are reading cou cards. Although in Apaston ... version of MSST3, as always, there are some smiles ....
