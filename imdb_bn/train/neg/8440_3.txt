It was a sad time for the team for those fans of Laurel and Hardie after and after 1940. Their contract with Hal Roach Studios has expired and now they are "free agents" - have been able to work for any studio who gave their jobs. Unfortunately, Fox, RKO, MGM (except for the taste) and a French film company who was renting boys, had no touch at all for their junk counterparts. The plan, Stan and Wali were too old and the professor took this sorry men, sorry not to be particularly funny. Stan was very sticky and Olea's weight reached up to the point where she could walk only - and so it makes me uncomfortable to laugh at very, very shameless antics. In addition to their age, this special movie suffers because Fox studios have oddly played their supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple - something that reduced their time on screen and instead of having their own "Hangers On ". In the old Lorele and Hardy of 20s and 30s, an intelligent and eccentric Stan and Woolley were very foreign - and looked very weird and they were badly compromised. <br /> <br /> Now their age is, in this call it was a decent film if it was written beautiful and it took care of the studio - and it is quite clear that they use "B units" - best, second class Using the support. In particular, there is very little smile, and the last 10 minutes of the movie are only terrible - for a stupid Chase scene, only a Pallab depends on the rear projected screen - it can only be ranked as one of the worst types of film history. For <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " However, for those lovers who want to make this film a relatively easy evaluation of their amazing previous films, it only comes in real absence. In fact, before 1940, I did not like less than the dancing masters in their full-length films. Unfortunately, in the later films of 1940, it could only be one of the better ones. Sadly, it has got worse - big dirty and nothing but bad movies like Trogell. Finally, I wonder if all positive reviews for this movie in IMDB reflect the love of more than the critics' indication, then I am surprised. Is this a good picture For viewers who are not already in love with the team, I do not know what the film will do but will encourage the audience - surely locale and Hardy will not be pleased with someone who was curious. But even the comedic genius needs their talent-worthy material.
