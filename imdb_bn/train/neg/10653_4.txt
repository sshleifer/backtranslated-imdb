One two three four five six seven eight and back, wow. It must be seen, first of all to see the work. There are many jobs shown, those close up, people see you will enjoy. A video clip of some years ago was definitely based on this movie. It's a slasher but without mystery. The end is very interesting, and Jesus, wearing a wooden face in front of the copper, looks like a coat. Killings Most of the screens are closed, blood flow, but never too serious. There are lots of battlefields, and hey, somebody got hurt. And what about the weapon to kill, it is not that big, it will not loot, you must see it. And having a slasher is very t and there are a lot. To guess who the killer you are trapped a few times, and this is the best part, but what about the story of wooden copper, huh! But still because of his consciousness this one still wants to have a lot. I'm happy that my copy is one of those slashher failures. But people do not mention the clothes and hairstyles! If you are within 40, then it comes back to memory lane.
