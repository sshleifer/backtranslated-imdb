It's hard to imagine if anyone who has seen their most shorts, this little boy can find their favorite, but I know that humor is very intelligent. I've seen all their word shorts (their stuff is far superior to IMO) and I found it one of their weakest efforts. <br /> <br /> It was made (1930) Stan and Baby 15 shorts and one feature. They were very popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage of their continuous work. In addition, there was a time of testing for the author and Stan. I want to say that this is a test that has not really worked. Someone else says it does not play their power. Too many conversations and plot <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A few fewer then par can be forgiven for turning the shorts. They did something like roughly 108 films. There were some very few failures (except in Fox) but there are some. County Hospital, Me and My Pal, Live Ghost, Fixer Uppers comes to mind seemingly weak ones. But then who I find some nice about them all about the shorts. Most of my book records <br /> <br /> <br /> If you've watched all the other shorts and enjoy it, check it out to everyone, but if I could be memorable for Stan, it was less. And baby
