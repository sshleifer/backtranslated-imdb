With the advent of blood succession, after the arrival of lawyer Tom Dreck (Norman Burtold), he was owned by Christopher Dean (John Carrenne) before his death in Dean Estates. He is also the son of Dean's four sons Gregory (Jeff Moro), his wife Laura (Mary Anders), Victoria (Believed Domergus), Johnny (Richard Davles) plus Leslie (Brooke Mills) and her fellow Carl Eisenberg (John Smith). Drake plays tapes recording late after the death of his father, the estate worth 136 million dollars is shared equally among his four children, if someone dies, the rest will be shared equally among the others and if all Elga (Ivy Bethune), Igor Kartianian) and more grandly, Frank (John Russell) will suddenly kill the ghostly slaves. Well, I'm not satisfied with a quarter part of $ 136 million (which is still about 35 million dollars in 1971, which does not appear to be too bad for me) Some decide that they want it for themselves and the refrigeration is not long before the decapitated heads were launched ... <br /> <br /> The bloody legacy of Roy Monson has disappointed me in two written, produced and managed co-accounts. Initially, this film's alternative and more general title is the heir to the blood. This is the title of a fuzzy movie directed by Andy Millen, which I always wanted to see in '78, these two films have been mixed regularly. I was excited when the same story and when I tested the cable TV on the screen for heritage of blood, because it said that it was a millington film and even listed it as a manager, so I was actually sitting to see it and I heard John Carradine's voice. Then I knew that I did not want to see the film of MILIGAN, my heart sank. Then, of course, simple but arbitrary direct fact that blood succession is a complete fork which is literally painful for frequent visits. Monson and Eric Norden's script is slow, annoying and highly anticipated. The character is very annoying, very annoying, a servant's embryo who wanted to ask his sister (?), A strange set of brothers and sisters who have gone far beyond impossible and realization that any tension or mystery available in the available Hoodunit story is undoubtedly missing and then terrible The end of the bend is what you can guess in the first 10 minutes. It's annoying to watch, read it weak and it's a trick to even think about it. Please, do someone save me this as really bad stuff. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole image looks ugly, it has been badly photographed and has no atmosphere or fear. Blood and cow dung tomato, ax in the head, decapitated head, a scene when someone kills someone and plays a pinar and smokes someone. But there are question marks on this scene, so there are victims, right. Piraha Tank is there, okay. Piranhah tank was placed on the head of the victim. Piraah ate the face of the victim, all right. <br/> <br /> Technically blood succession is terrible, it sounds awful that the word is clearly shot, and it is difficult to hear that it is drunk and difficult to be considered. Terrible dialogue is probably a blessing in disguise. Actually, no one can win any prize, at least it is good about it. <br /> <br /> Blood Legacy is a horror film, it is not actually a positive side or I can not remember it. Do yourself a lot and do not get bored with it, there are better movies.
