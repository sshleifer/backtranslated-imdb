Ha ha You just have to make all the way through this movie if you just smile and smile. It's something I guess about myself. The film itself was created, I think that like any kind of psychological examination, or some kind of drug, to take you to a place that you have never done before. When Witgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece Tractus (span?), He said nonsense and vain, but if you read it, it will take you to a new level like the stairs, and then you throw away work and clarity and See things with true understanding. I am the same as the movie. <br /> <br /> As a movie, without any doubt, I have seen the worst movie in such a remarkable movie for a long time. First of all, these snipes are. I like watching these guy kick ass in different movies. And I have suffered a few weak ones. However, even though you know that the film can be sucked, you never doubt that it was really bad. Which is fun it I mean these snipes. You know it might be good, but it would be right, right? Smile <br /> <br /> So this thing on every level is a pure borod, pure single life. Professional references are both dead and obvious, yet so badly done as to be comical. At least interesting, this movie does not have one character. And to make the whole thing more realistic, they have a soundtrack that sounds sound like parts of the type of movie in various bourns, not just right. Actually, it seems to be closer to the action movie background music, but it is such that it is done in a manner that can surprise you. <br /> <br /> All the scenes are in black, where honestly because the characters are so flat, you really do not care about what can happen, but if not, if it happens and someone dies, you will say to yourself, I What did you want to see? What else Visible with dark scenes, offensive flurry at the speed of the strobe light, the time is too long to carry. Let's throw in that sure. Although how to bout this When you are doing a strain and your eyes can no longer handle it, then they do not see what's happened in the dark times. And on top of that, you do not care about it, let's face it. You had past the annoying way from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I went in a few times, but I grabbed almost all the movies. And it becomes something that makes you do something without adding anything to your mind, it becomes something that you can effectively quit and start thinking about your life, where it is going, where it has been, the people we have <br /> <br /> And that's ... This picture is really magic.
