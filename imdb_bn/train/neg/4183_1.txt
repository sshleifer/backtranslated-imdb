If this is not for "Oh Gaurs", then this b-movie was not worth a sector of my Tevro disk space! What low rental, back was supposed to port in many warehouses? "Endless people!" It is a basic principle in making real movies! A villa in a place called port and day (a space station on night and day?) At night!!?!? People please! The only thing I would appreciate is that the dress is empty. Continuously, freshly released documentary to keep the drama! Even the women who saw the bomb praised those parties that he must have spent some time spending! Scientists would be better than displaying the spaceblues! There was some real humor to see at least something incredible. <br /> <br /> PSS. Michael Ironside, please asap your agent fire! You are much better than an actor to join this level of filmmaking.
