I saw this movie in mystery science theater when it "lives on the night". That's a lot less confusing than the title "Batpeople". In fact it will be more accurately called the Batperson. This film is about a doctor who is reading a bat because he wants to make good remedies for rabbis. This is not really clear. Obviously, he and his wife visited a cave and he bitten by the bat. Why scientists need to have a tour to study the bat is beyond me. He will not be able to go by himself. After the cat, he and his wife went to their honeymoon, where she fits. They never went to the worst doctor. The man lives in the hospital and kills the nurse. Eventually the man killed 3-4 people and his wife stood beside him and you were supposed to be rooting for him instead of investigating Sheriff's murder.
