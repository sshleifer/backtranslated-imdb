I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and it is definitely more accurate than the Batty / Duneaway version, whose clothes and locals resist the actual photos of the gang. Especially Buck Barrow's death, and his wife Blanch's prisoner. This actress seems to have felt that her Blank's day was overwhelming on her dead husband. However, this movie is still Hollywood, and our opponents remain endless even after the drilling of holes (in life, Boni was accidentally burned accidentally years before his famous operation, and did not see a cruel cheerleader at the time of his death). The script is tedious, and the acting is poor, especially the boxer. Very frustrating. Sticks with Beatty and Dunaway. They may not be "true stories", but this is a great movie.
