Add to the curriculum list: A South preacher and "congregation", a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), A dancer and Mills Brothers - it just makes it worse. <br /> <br /> Abusive burlesque "Negro" actors, who often appear in films to parade their own and their nation. Although today's "Negro Comedy" has been adopted, it is highly humiliating today and I suspect it was funny. Although I was not bothered, I do not think that I used to laugh at the humorous efforts of humor. As a 11-year-old white boy, I might not have understood anything.
