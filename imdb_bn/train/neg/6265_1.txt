I will be the director's nephew. I took a copy of this picture for several years and I can make sure that it is actually one of the worst movies of all time. There is no other copy of my uncle (I asked). I'm looking forward to bringing him a copy. <br /> <br /> Currently the film's average rating is 1.9 / 10. As far as I can say, it should be kept somewhere under the "100th" IMDB in the mid-30s, but it has not yet been established with only 206 votes. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the film does not get even 100 titles. <br /> <br /> However, I give copies of this movie to family members for the holiday gift this year. Best ever / worst gift?
