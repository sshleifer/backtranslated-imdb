Jamie Fox is my favorite comedian. However, I think he sold his first major budget to achieve the lead role. Fox followed the opinion of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chappell, who each sold their talents brutally and saw that black men seem to be guilty of a pretty cool idea (see: Money Talks, Blue Struck). <br /> <br /> Well, I smiled a few times and all these comedians continued to play a cheerful role, but I would like to wish these guys to greet Wayne's photo. Or Tommy Davidson of Leaving and Damon Weinen Spike Lee's acting rebellious bamjosale.
