I have seen many Chinese movies - and Hong Kong This is the worst. No, the worst one was 'unknown pleasures'. Yesterday I saw the 'platform' and thought that Zia Zhang's two other films would certainly be good. This evening I was frustrated again. I will not see 'Xiaow' tomorrow evening because I have just banned three films! Anyone who gave this image, 'platform' ten to ten, need to watch more movies! Photography was very poor: Due to the lack of close-up work, it was very difficult to differentiate between letters. The story was so confused that I was quick to move forward towards the end of despair. I will not recommend anyone on this photo. Give me a day, Zhang Yimu or Chen Cage. This is the true master of Chinese film, not proactive male!
