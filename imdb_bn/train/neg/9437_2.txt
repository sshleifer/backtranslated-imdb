While watching the movie, I do not think of myself as a "student", I see them, create opinions and that's it. But unhinged all this changed. I have never seen this picture that the most perfect effort to make the film without any doubt is without doubt. Every year those who rise up in the university think that the next Spielberg or Tarantino will have to transfer the film with the title "How to Not to Film". Not just a story, filmmakers are not capable enough to watch the movie. It looked a bit later, but I can say that OpenHide tracking shots are seen in the opening scene. They do not end! It's not much fun, like having your teeth pulled around.
