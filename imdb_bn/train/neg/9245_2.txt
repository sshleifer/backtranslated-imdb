This video guide was one of the greatest compositions of 1995. Perfectly done! Mathew Perry and Jennifer Aniston have chemistry on the main screen by talking about what to do with the start button. I'm waiting to release a special edition DVD with Microsoft's deleted scenes, a commentary by Bill Gates commentary, Windows 95, Windows XP, and much more! <br /> <br /> Overall: 10/10 (should have won at least one Golden Globe)
