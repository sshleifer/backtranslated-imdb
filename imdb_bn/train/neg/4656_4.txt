An old, unforgettable English film unforgettable and void rebuilding. Although it may be too maligned as a total disaster (which is not it), it creates any tension and does not believe its TV source. Richard Burton is sleeping through his role, and Sofia Lorraine (in this movie) has closed mouth, that too does not show much emotion. (**)
