I do not like this picture for countless reasons. In the first ten minutes of the film, I became extremely disappointed and came to the conclusion that if this movie is going to save itself, at least for me, that myself must pull itself from a huge hole. . Unfortunately, that does not happen. For me, two draws of the movie were to see Jane Fonda and Felici Huffman. He did not know enough about Lindsay Lohan's work, which he was eager to bring to the film. Then, I had "moments" in each of their performances, but three of them felt frustrated. I imagine that each one of them was a very difficult task to find their "moments" because there was an extraordinary lack of character development and unclear conversations. Although this plot is an interesting subject, the film is so weak, written and edited that anyone's activities as an actor will be affected and will be affected by it. The humiliating outlook of American American sexual violence and objectionable attitude, I think, was the main reason for the film's failure to identify this movie. As a critic, and I agree, the market is almost impossible to give the finished form to the film. I doubt, or at least hope that (whatever the actor is doing) there are some real gems in the cutting room floor. Sorry for us, but if it is true, actors can enjoy it and feel some good about lending for their talents and time such as flop. Oh yes and another thing ... I would like to see an American film once, which includes the tragic but surprisingly varied settings, such as one in this movie where the main characters are not absent and / or disrespectfully torn.
