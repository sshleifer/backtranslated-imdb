.. this one one! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, but here is something that disturbed me: whenever the ghost appeared, which I really liked; How it was done, how it looked ... There was only the relation of Scratch Because in the first scene, because of the decreasing things, you thought their mobility was different. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But ultimately, very good indeed! Of course, 'The Grace' basically talked to a smooth lens on the same screen, but there was no samurai and I liked it compared to this movie. <br /> <br /> Please, recreate this movie with anyone who has a tempered style. <BR> <br /> 'Silent Rage' fans will absolutely love this movie.
