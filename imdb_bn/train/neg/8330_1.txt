I saw "Shiner" on DVD. When I was watching this, I thought, "It's a bad pornographic picture, not pornographic." I thought, "Anyone who wrote it has some real problems." Then I saw the director / writer Carlson explain his process as a special feature. Yes, it was real special. <br /> <br /> The emphasis on film is that two alcoholic people who hit each other. They are a little interesting. There are front and full nudity. These reasons may be visible to the movie. <br /> <br /> The most annoying element of the film is that of gay rebels and later more similar gay people who try to take correct revenge from their attackers. , Two drunk damaged The subject is technically unreasonably and badly operated, but the act is terribly bad. <br /> <br /> There are Boxer-St-Alk Themes. This is not really insane, just crazy. This hockey boxer is attacked by a fleshy wax boy's continuing outlook on his gym parking lot. This LA, you remember The boxer was so hurt that he turned towards Stuckler's house and got excited about the stripes and process. <br /> <br /> Well, I can say, why such a boxer will be in the heart? An exhibistist be so traumatized by the attention of a stalker? It only makes no sense. And, I'm afraid, some psycho-dynamics really makes sense, if you take time to read about them. However, bad scripts rarely make sense. <br /> <br /> The director / writer thinks that this film represents a significant minority among the gay community. Well, he might be right, I think. We never know, the minorities will be so effective, because they will not be able to organize enough for a vague gay festival festival or DVD store, only two places they might find this turkey. Thanks for that thanks to Mars.
