It was just a terrible movie. Hit me to see it Almost every step was unsupported in the context of the film, the role was really poor (P. Didki was the best actor who actually said something about the movie) and the plot was usually expected. Some links to Carlito's Way were right, for example, one day's dream was going to the Caribbean, but it was all weak. In my opinion love interest was wrong, but hey is controversial. However I did not really expect much before watching movies and I guess you could even guess that the expectations are not met. I feel bad for J Hernandez because he's really a good actor (Friday Night Light). He is lucky although I'm sure there are not many people to watch this movie. I usually give a good rating to the movies if they spark my interest, then I will go ahead and give these two stars. Good luck next time. And yes I've enjoyed the Carlito Way.
