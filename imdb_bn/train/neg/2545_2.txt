There is a smile on this film, that's sure. Michael Keaton was a talent and he used to be funny (before deciding he was a serious actor). However, it makes me so annoying about this movie, how all of the letters are unlikely. Everyone is a quarrel, not everyone, except the lead two. I mean, the victims of this small town are unknowingly like you. You just see and think, man, this will be damaged unemployed. Moreover, American factory workers are portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It surprised me whether it was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, they all came together eventually, but I did not enjoy the trip to go there.
