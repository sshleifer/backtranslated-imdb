This movie is a bad-looking and poor set design as well as a durable line and a lam plot a cring-fest. But it's so fun to see Everything is interesting about it. A group of fundamental conspiracy scientists are trying to hold their evil colleagues during a future visit, who aim to destroy all of them. They meet him in 1146. Since 2033 the scientists 'future' lab is a 'modern' flashing button and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shade, an eight-style room. The actors provide their line with the unsophisticated Aleppo, which is not difficult to understand that the lines are usually "double-checked twice!" He double checked all of the double? He checked four times? Not only this, but they let you eat the entire court of the movie in the first five minutes and keep moving fast until the medieval area hit. When Roger Cromwell went out of money. And the time and the result was to stop traveling through a variety of sets. The medieval set was a comedy mix-mash at the end of the 10th century at the end of the 16th century. Any clothing they could find, they used. I think the chain mail was not in the budget, because the boys wear the Maccadder shirts as armor. War scenes are ridiculous, people without doubt leave their lives in cardboard swords and die in death. It seems really awful. But when I see it, I enjoy it. Single lines are enough to make you fit, and any other one can pull together to create an incredible B-movie that if you are the majority of Konar Flix, then I recommend you. And once you, review the movie review of the unknown. I love to listen to all the funny, really awesome bits out of the movie.
