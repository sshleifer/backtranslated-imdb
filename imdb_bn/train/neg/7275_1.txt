"National Lampon Goss to the Movies" (1981) created the worst movie, even stupid even "planning outdoors". Lampon film featuring three different and connected links, unreels, different performers. The only common thread is the total lack of the quality of a release. <br /> <br /> Well, probably one. Another critic on this site said that the fleeting nude shot is beautiful, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry optimally flash their part, part one and part two, respectively. But their glamorous displays, lazy, wasted. The directors have forgotten that even T & A needs a reliable story to turn around, and there is no one in the philosophy. <br /> <br /> The third volume, played by Robi Benson and Richard Wyndmck, is the three most hateful, and this film is a lucky choice as the windup. Benson plays an interested Beaver young man, reports Brightly on the first day of his duties, ready to get rid of evil streets. He is associated with an old, senior police acted by Wyomker, and when this oil and water partner sets out on their first patrol, we feel the film's previous failure is possible to get released. Maybe, Sunil's old timer will be corrected by the firmness of his new partner's duties and loyalty. Probably all will end happily afterwards. However, this movie is straight for the toilet, there is no release, no happy ending, no coherent stories. <br /> <br /> "National Lampon goes to movies," I thought that I already saw the worst schllock that Hollywood might have ever seen. Unfortunately, I did not see it half. <br /> <br />
