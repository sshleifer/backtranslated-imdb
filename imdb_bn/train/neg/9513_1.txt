I try to watch three different time in this movie. I rent it at night. I got it for about 20 minutes. Hopefully if I had to rest the night then it would be good. The next day, at around 15 o'clock, how stupid it was, almost the opposite ... it was never funny fun that was sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie is only the capital S (if you know what I mean) we live in the sensor world. . And finally, on the third day, I saw an idiot for an hour and I did not enjoy a moment! not anyone. How to get this script greenlighted. Oh boy <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/10 - For cheerleaders ... they deserve at least some of their hard work.
