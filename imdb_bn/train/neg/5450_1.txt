Such a pretentious and lame hipone attempt Misleading scripts and dialogues and acting really embarrassed. The really bad movie I've ever seen (in movies). My opinion is that nothing can save this movie from total disaster. I saw this after coming out of a movie in Brighton. People walk and people are sitting outside the toilet more than the auditorium! Finally, the rest of the people were warm and stupid, which was mostly tragic, because one of the main actors was present and that he really broke up. But the film was so bad that I did not really feel like that sympathizer with them. Everyone has to start from anywhere and their son started his acting career with this genuine attempt at 'Tantinninaj of the United Kingdom'. 5 years have passed, but sometimes I was fascinated by the memories of that sad night! It's not without a movie without a movie! I found it 0 as a 1. All those involved in this sad world of film should find their 'shyness' for them. I know some good things have gone out of them, the positive thing is that some of them might be less compressed.
