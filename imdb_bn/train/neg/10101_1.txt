Notice I gave these 1 strikes if I had given the option but I could have given this zero. I put this DVD on my TV and sitting on my couch, I'm hoping to make her the best movie film. I saw this movie on IMDB and saw that it was the worst rating film so I think I've criticized every mistake. But it did not prepare me to get out of my television screen. <br /> <br /> does the box find this movie? Okay okay Do not you fool that This film needs to be banned from all takbeers all over the world. <br /> <br /> The best way to describe this movie is pornographic but without any sexual scenes. Acting (if you can call it), "plot" (so many holes must look like a Swiss paneer), and special effects are really terrible. <br /> <br /> Please do not be like me and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I can take a better picture than that, but I'm thinking about it.
