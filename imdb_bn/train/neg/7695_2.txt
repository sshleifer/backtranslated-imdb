I had such high expectations to see an adaptation of a classic story like Arbianan Knights. Instead, I was disappointed with a movie that failed to maintain my attention from the beginning, although I tried to see it twice! <br /> <br /> It was a movie that Kardine was in the film but the actors were not lacking in favorites. Very nice for Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras, a little similar zoro action, comic moments and overall enjoyment. Well, so there's a lot of potential fans of Dragon's son, but if you want Marshall Art and Plot Line you do not have to say anything about it. If you want kids to sit on Sunday afternoon, maybe with 3 enzias it may be for you.
