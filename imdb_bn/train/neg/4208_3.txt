"PageMaster" which has a really good movie hidden beneath the surface of the layers on the cheese levels. <br /> <br /> I saw it when I neglected this morning for some years and I saw it again and year. I remember hate with a passion when it first out, but this time, I found special effects quite well. This plot is simply "Creativity Story" with Creativity-Antiquity, but it's just a little flick for some people who just want some extraordinary eye candy. The animation is amazing, and I especially like how animators let their characters see and behave more spiritually than the ideals. I give it three grades as I gave it a two (only for parody quality), if I ever decided to watch this movie my story would be a story-based hit.
