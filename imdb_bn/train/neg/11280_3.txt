This image is going wrong in a man's life. His business has failed, and he can not impose his wife despite multiple attempts. <br /> <br /> This plot is full of chaos. It just does not make sense. In fact, the film makes sense to nothing. The story is so bad that I just could not understand. It is a shame, because the set and costume are working well, and the stimulus is enough stimulant. The shots are well-formed across the film. However, these ransom features can not yet create bad intent and poorer stories to tell. I am surprised by the big names that have agreed to play in this film. It's such a waste of their talents. This picture is very bad. To avoid it !!
