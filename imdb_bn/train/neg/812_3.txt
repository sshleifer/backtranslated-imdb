I'm very disappointed with "K-911" The original "good" quality of "K-9" does not exist anymore. It's more like a sitcom! Returning from the original movie came back to my memory. The Dowlin captain now loves to hit him like a scene from an old comedy show. That was crazy What is the deal with the change of police? Looks like they are now LAPD! San Diego PD This is a completely different movie "
