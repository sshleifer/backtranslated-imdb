I will admit that I am currently a college student, an English head of it. At that time I saw this movie I was a high school student - I want to say junior year but it can be old, difficult to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes far beyond my curriculum of physics, Quantum Mechanics's interest has led me to read many books about books on things that can be found in an article in addition to theoretical aspects of the field. Discover and like. I'm not PhD in any way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is terrible only. It is designed to appeal to the average New Age guru's scientific mind, who all want to believe specifically for everyone. My mother is such a personality and she has tried to see all of her friends after this movie and buy a copy of the film. I tried to show errors and problems with the reasoning and science of film - and they were numerous - and they dismissed my claims because "Oh, so high school students know more than all people, including PhD." In this case, apparently so. <br /> <br /> A person who earns Ph.D. does not need to be accurate or intelligent. My basic idea about physics is enough to reduce half the film. Keeping behind that, filmmakers fully utilized their interviews with at least one participant in order to support their belief that, in fact, he totally opposed them. <br /> <br /> I can go and I think the intuetire really did a good job to debunk the film so if you want to take care of it, feel free. <br /> <br /> http://www.intuitor.com/moviephysics/bleep.html
