Oh dear, this movie was bad for a variety of reasons. I was expecting to see very few scores for this picture and was surprised by most scores. Sorry, but many have a joke to rate this rate! Once you've got a shot / black and white movie hostage once, it was a great idea, the film only went for 66 minutes running. The credit sequence at the beginning was very annoying! Boys in the van tolerate a flat tire and change the wheel, wow, the story was needed! How slow was the back and was actually injured by Campbell? They do not seem bothered to be behind him ... sigh .. I'm so happy that I got this free with a special edition of Evil Dead !!
