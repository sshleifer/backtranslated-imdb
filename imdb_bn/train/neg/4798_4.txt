* There are some spoilers * These movies all have terrible fat 80s in all its horror. The plot takes a long way to get out of the ground, sometimes not stagnant, and the film only plain crashes within 40 minutes. There are moments for junkie fans, but there are not enough zombies to create the real concept of terrorism. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Firstly, a film about the massacre stage and the prison gang Whole half The protagonist of the film Vietman's former Vector who was caught in the crowd.

Yet, the most annoying scene is in the early part of the movie, when a serious corrupt guard rape a prisoner. <br /> <br /> The main highlight of this movie is a scene at the end. The hero, the woman, and the kids are only trying to make their way to escape. Their way is to take them to the long haulway, there is a wall on one side and the other is a prison bar.
