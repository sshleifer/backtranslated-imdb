I recently saw this on cable and kinda enjoyed it. I have read the comments here and it seems that everyone likes half more than half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (very bad, which was not extended.) The second story, I thought, was clipped. And that "California Dreaming," if I heard it once more ... The Chongqing Express is OK, but mainstream viewers will not see, like "Crouching Tiger".
