I have seen a long time in the worst movie! It starts badly and is just worse. Catherine Higgel expressed sadness in the role of Lolita and Leo Grillo struggled with a cardboard cutout character. Tom Sizmora is the only custom member with no enthusiasm, who hamm it as a villain and completely overboard with his role. The scripts are terrible, acting awesome and it has a big plot hole enough to run a double decker bus! This is the sexiest movie I ever seen! The character of Kathryn Higgel is completely disrespectful. He lures his wife to the poor, innocent married man who sees as an evil, rude seductress. This film is about her life, and the message of the plot begging the beggars believe! Finally, he is definitely not able to purge himself by being angry with anger and crime, but the script allows him to kill himself, so that he frees himself in the eyes of men everywhere. Horrible Do not waste your time.
