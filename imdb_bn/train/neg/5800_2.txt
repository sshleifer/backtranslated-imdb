As a scary-movie fan, I try to see all the novels in this genre, especially those of my local movie products. And I can say that "The Power of Fear" (or "Wadema" as the title of "Ram") is among the weakest films in them. First of all, it can not even scare a little child, it is so slow and predictable that there is no room for genuine horror. Actually, it's worse than all the things: from secret plots (I do not know why Russian producers / directors have decided to convert classic stories into some of the long and ridiculous modern-day American thrillers about the Ukrainian wizard, the previous critic ?? It's a bit Not thrilling) and terrible and sugar actors' work. All actors, including Valerie Nikolayev, and Yevgeniya Kreukova, are famous in Russia, who see wooden dolls or similar things and feel that they do not even bother to play them, only their English lines speak without any expression. And at the end I did not understand why they used to represent this flick in English with Russian actors? I had to turn them wrong. At least they can make them stronger for some leading American or English leading actors. I can say about "backgrounds in small American cities" that were shot in Estonia and it's like The only positive moment found in "the power of fear" is visual effects. They are not nice but better for Russian movies. And the music is okay, at least it does not tease me. So I give it two stars. Overall, if you want to see good horror films ?? Do not waste your time and money on this annoying flick. And if you are looking for something to be afraid of the Russians, I suggest you find a copy of "Viy or Evil of Spiv". This is really a horror movie based on the same novel as "Fear" but much better.
