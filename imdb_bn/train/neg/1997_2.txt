This version is probably available in your local Dollar Store DVD. The print is not great, not the sound, but if you have $ 1.00 and 90 or more minutes left, you will get the value (which is not saying a terrible thing). Anne Neagle is extremely vapid as Nanette. Whatever its impressive day comes back, they are not clear in this picture. There are a number of fine-looking actors in this movie (Helen Broderick, Jasu Pits, even Arden), but the elements are significantly less of their competition. Despite this, it is interesting to see what kind of performers of this type do most of the weak writing. Musical numbers (really only have two) are quite awesome. Clearly, the studio does not feel compelled to cash in on the rich musical power of the original "No, no, nanette". For what it's worth, the DVD can have for $ 1.00. It's okay to say that you've seen it a lot.
