1993 was the year. Philip Simu Thomas had it long before winning Oscar. Who knew I could be extra in a movie with him? I actually paid an extra payment to "My Boyfriends Back", which shot at a suburbs in Georgetown, TX, in the suburbs of Austin. The original title was "Johnny Jabby" (Thank God God has changed hearts!) I was in the theater scene. To see the day I was released in the theater. It's a comedy more than a horror movie. But ... for a good smile, you want to test it. There is nothing to do with "Don of the Dead" or even "Dead of the Dead", but the cheese factor is good enough. Ciao
