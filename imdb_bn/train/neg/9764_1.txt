One word ... unreal I give it a hippie sex scene and a star for women in the eye candy, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst attempts, times to anyone Ben Vereen was supposed to hit her name permanently from the cast. I can not believe that it is now becoming "Wild in the Street" as a DVD (2/15/05/2015) - another rectangular stinker. Today I got sick in bed in the morning, decided to show me a movie, digital channels scanned ... This view seems pretty interesting because I like watching movies like B-Movie, Hippy culture and rebel. Teen flicks It was known in some way and threw with Ben Vereen, I thought ... why not? What a big mistake ... This was a terrific startup for my day. <br /> <br /> After watching this, now I know why the identity of my newborn brain rhythm is created. As a 14-year-old (45-year-old), I remember the upcoming attraction of this film, in Santero in the early / mid-seventeen years, a local art theater that no longer exists ... the whole theater laughs violently and even the movie looks at how bad it groaned . Acting: Awful, Story: Awful, Cinematography: Almost Awful, Music: Awesome, Sound: Awesome, Instruction: A joke. If you choose to watch it after my warning, remember ... "I told you." <br /> <br /> "Gus-SSS" is a title suitable for this movie ... You may feel like "geshed" later see this movie - or you should take you to the "gas" chamber to ward off your brain. I saw this super-made Super 8 movie that has made the film a shame. Definitely my newest addition to the top ten movie of all time ... It is there along with "Quarterly". <br /> <br /> Gilbert, AZ
