What a boring film! To add all this, basically only Nana Patkor beat his daughter Karishma Kapoor, when she tried to escape from the village, with her son. No one is saying ??? The idea was not very bad, but it is badly executed. The Canadian Parliament, and some scenes of the village were nicely shot. However, overall the cinematography shortened up. The story could have been great, but the movie just started to pull. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, this movie was a part of the cat.
