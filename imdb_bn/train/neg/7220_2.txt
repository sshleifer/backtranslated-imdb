Where do they get money to make such films? I mean, there is nothing empty about this image. No actor is known, the writing is horrific, the photography is unclear, the story is a bad version of Repo Man and a Nicholson Western and incredible acting. For any film that shows good and bad movies, I must admit that this movie was the worst seen since the IP attack at the age of 50. I really do not like to try trashing people's efforts trying to entertain, or ban in heaven, art but no one can appeal to this image. The bad version of Celtic Soil Eater is the story of a mysterious pollution of a person who works like a male sex organism without sexual intercourse. Bad people need to be in a city where they can not escape from them. Since taking it from there, lazy, good part. My suggestion is that if you have not done bad myths, amateur writing, incompatible roles and tiring settings, you will be given the best service to leave it when you are out of video rentals.
