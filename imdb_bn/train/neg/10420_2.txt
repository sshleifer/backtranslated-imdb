All right, I know that many people will probably disagree with this review because the watershit down is a "classic" and an ideal part of childhood for most people, but seeing this film for the first time in the age of 18, I must admit: I really hate it. <br /> <br /> We saw this picture because my sister read the book and really enjoyed it and many people who shouted "Watership Down" - seeing this movie their memories are broken up in children and their emotions seams - it suggests . To be honest, I do not bother, I wish. I gave it the benefit of doubt; Usually I do not want to stop seeing the way through a film halfway. It was an exception. It was really, really, excruciatingly sick, dull. This picture is probably the slowest thing I ever saw (imagine a doped up snap in space), and really "it's not" for me. The art was right; The background was beautifully made, if not a little soft and whale, the rabbits themselves were not very respectful and the animation was quite fun and was badly produced. <br /> <br /> I will not go to the big story about the beginning of the story; Originally it is the story of the rabbit group that left Warren due to the intrusion of people in the area. In general, an ethical story about the dangers of human interactions in the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbit throughout the message. For me, I wish that they will get gus, because I'm not terribly sad, but because the letters were vague, annoying, neutral and generally very rude (I'm very awesome English). I found that I was watching the clock while watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or more before what actually happened, even it was a terrible anticlimax. <br /> <br /> If I appreciate that in any way, I must admit that the idea of ​​showing the dangers of making children in the village and hoping to show the pride of man is so good. Perhaps it is all sacred and public, but the message that is trying to publish is good in its nature. The musical score was not bad. <br /> <br /> So, in conclusion, this picture is quite poor. I could not see the whole path, or perhaps I would be forced to feed my own feet in the worst of frustrations. Imagine, it's not a "dot", but it does not give me too much attention, so I gave it 2/10. <br /> <br /> Hope this helps.
