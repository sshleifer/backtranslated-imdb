... the child actor was annoying. It seems as if the creator of this film struggled to fill 90 minutes. The sight of indifferent death, though. If not for the death scene, this film will feel very Disney. <br /> <br /> The hero of the original child was not as fearful as he was afraid of. If I was with the teeth of the eloquent type of eloquent killer, then you can surround your ass and I could not drive my bike. <br /> <br /> Overall, I've seen bad (i.e. this is waiting) but I will not see it again or it will not be recommended to anyone annoying unless you are a bizarre collector.
