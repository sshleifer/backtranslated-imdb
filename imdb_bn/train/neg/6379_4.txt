How can you make a mistake with a film named "Outdoor from the Locals"? Throw a bit above the stereotypes for the characters, use the villagers as the main supplier for the soundtrack and throw a lot of gay-gags. Plot is essential. Very bad, there is no one in this picture and every joke misses the spot. All of the characters are different from the German geneira, one or two jokes work, the rest fails. <br /> <br /> The title laughs me and I was ready to laugh more about the film. My expectations were apparently high.
