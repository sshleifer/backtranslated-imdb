Painful to watch, and not entirely for the sympathy of the character struggle. Two of the main characters, the mother of Cynthia and Monica confessed, the coolest bulk of the film is gently and sadly crying. Their character is so firmly established that their release in the tolerant personality after the rapid family Catheris is unbelievable. It was not worth the wait. I had a headache to see a worthy pitch for honesty in the family.
