This movie is awful. At the end of this you will realize that you have been stolen several hours from your life, which you can not get back. The "packing" end is very much surrounded. This is ultimately not consistent with their final action at the conclusion of the development of the leading character. Preparation for the ninety minutes - in this context, the character of Rob Loey will die Christmas Eve - in literal sense, "We're just screaming you." Then Rob Loire's character is not even bothered about it! "If you can forgive me, then I will forgive you," he was so upset. If someone took me a few weeks to convince me, then I was going to die and then I said, "No, sorry, just fooling you" I will raise some serious hell. I could be able to save you something from watching because the spoiler does not feel bad about me away. Please save yourself and do not see this movie.
