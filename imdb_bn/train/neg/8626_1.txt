I am surprised to see other comments that there is no warning to these potential visitors that what they want to wait for renting this garbage. First of all, I realized that it has rejected Indiana Jones in a competitive contest. What I found was one of the most objectionable movies I could remember to try to sit in, making movies more frustrating by relatively high production costs. <br /> <br /> I do not think it's a mockery, but if it is, then be careful ... <br /> <br /> If your idea of ​​entertainment is watching Bimo rape behind the horrible tribal chief She sees the dead eyes of her significant other scattered head, all means, rent this flick. If not, I would suggest you to entertain elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Let's think, the scene is so brief that the film has nothing to say.
