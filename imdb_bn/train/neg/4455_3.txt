Where do you start? Okay, do not compare this movie to start the club - ridiculous. There was even a patch of battlefield, violence, blood, grave etc. would be more clear and realistic. Secondly, this movie is not a football factory - which is much more real (and Danny Deer Nicholas Nicholbi feels embarrassing). Fairly clean, the story is quite decent and there are good dancers in battle scenes - I can add to a decent finish. But the whole film is poor, poor poor. Since people's statements are not mentioned, they will not waste a film - I disagree - a common casting error, or because of lack of coaching efforts, this movie can irritate all time - it is a visible American / Geordie role. Do not make me wrong, it looks good, the guy who looks great with the head of the skin - but not football ammunition. How ridiculous was the footage of football - I could go to the situation about 'fake steward' forever. Also, when GSE is going to play United, they can go to the expected train of only 3 people - it does not give any idea - it's the gang of thugs and gangs, which are portrayed as some miki in the movie, about 5 people worship the mouse. In terms of correctness - West Ham and Milwaul did not play together in the last few years in the championship? Hmm, ten years is fine. And I'm sure that 'Bather' can only waltz on a concrete wall. Basically, a very poor film that people would love if they do not have true football and concepts. If you really love football and are confused by the bully's insight, you simply think that this movie has insulted your intelligence. Ross George
