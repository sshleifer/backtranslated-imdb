If you do not understand what is going to happen in the first five minutes of this film, then it will take another few minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst. She has a teenage girl who only highlighted that she is not being any younger. While examining her daughter, she discovered a world that she was never brave ... Cabaret, where she can dance to the skimpychecked outfits and people throw money to her. The film is very misogamist. The image of the human image is frustrating. Lilia is rather weird than a stup that it is not for money, but for the sake of roaming around them, but only for hell. When he is successful in their excitement, then he thinks of him as a woman again. He is not willing to connect with them but he is addicted to attention. Other dancers are mostly adolescent females, who look like men and drag their spots in short time. I'm not enough to summarize. He has found romance, however, you guess it .... no wonder here we do not see coming. Although the last is good, it is understood that it can end in some other way. Maybe this picture does not just target my population - 30 men
