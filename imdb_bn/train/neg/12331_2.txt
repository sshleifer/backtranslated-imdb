One of the "Age Coming" films, which should be committed to nostalgia and kids for adults. This movie is not there. This is a poor excuse that allows Silvia Cristal's body to dabble with Dirty Eric Brown. To make things worse, the movie is funny, sexy, stupid or stupid if you try to be dramatic. We smile incredibly that we believe that a teenager alone will go alone with the burial of a dead woman in front of her. Think loud why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double. Since the film was going on, I started to imagine a hybrid of private lessons and Little Miss Millions, which inspired Silvio Cristal Jennifer Love Havitt like the Hedgehogman, who created our nostalgic for the WKRP. Check out the stupidity of other people, or for the success of Ed Begolly Junior, or see if you like Silvio Cristal Jennifer Love Hught. But I can give you an idea of ​​your lesson, stay away from movies shown by Simmania Kristel, which is not Emmanuelle.
