Che the same age Completely ignore the true interesting facts of Che's true character. Sodeberg Che redid the same annoying statement. The poor seductive story of Argentine richest boy, who was shocked by poverty, he fought with the poor as well as Robin Hood, who was eventually killed by the CIA. Yes, yes, before all I have heard, disturbed and uninterrupted! Che Guevara's reality is very different and much more explosive! The events show that he was unanimously with a messenger stroke, who openly tried to put militant pressure on the Maoists. At the most tragic end of the Cold War, he wanted to duplicate New York, Washington or Los Angeles and apologize to the Soviet Union for the end of the world. Urging Khurshov to run a nuclear strike against the United States. For the rest of his life, he announced that if his finger was on the button, he would push it. When Khrushchev made the background and literally saved the world, Che was angry at "betrayal". If you follow the recommendation recommendations, you will not be able to read this review. How a homicidal maniac becomes a pop icon will create a more interesting picture. Che and his postmodern post-media convergence have shown that the filmmakers have been brave enough to show the real side that it is incredible. To make an Oscar winner film! I think the meaning of creating independent films is real risk and groundbreaking! They only maintain "safe counterclosure theme", "Che Cold", "Wall Street Bad", "Republican = Nazi", "Hitler's Bush", "Worse than NRA KGB", "Christians are fanatic and stupid", etc. Ad breaks. Oops, how brave, how the heart swells. Tres anti mainstream and edgy I hope they will have some real kooson and will deal with independent film orgies! That would be really brave!
