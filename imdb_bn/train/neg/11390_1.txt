This is not a movie. It's a collection of irrelevant, sick and poorly integrated videos like a 10-year old unwanted results, including a small-DVD camera. Actually, I have a theory that the most disgusting girl in the train cottage - with sticky hair, dead-pan steer, ipod and nervous ticks - it probably shoots itself at creative stage. <br /> <br /> If you do this for more than ten minutes, do not try to fit what you see in the context of the European artist mentality mentioned above. This is a real and complete waste, money and film that William made one-shot Bowden Crink. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What's next? Six director Wal-Mart Snake counters shooting social gatherings?
