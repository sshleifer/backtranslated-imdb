I hired a dubbed-English version of Lensman, hoping that it came from a well-known novel so it would have some substance. When there is a hint of substance in the film, it is not mostly on the cartoon level of the kid. Perhaps the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it has lost much of the dubbed version. Or even the source novel was lightweight. But whatever, there was not much there. <br /> <br /> I have seen many details that are derivative, rural, bad dramatic, or otherwise lacking. Some examples: The opening scenes were borrowed from the 2001 "Star Gate" scene and the Star Wars image of the Hyper Space. Harveyster's robot looked like an anthropomorphised "and 2-D2". <br /> <br /> Star Wars has begun to try its hilarious relief style, but sadly (comedy does not work) and it plays serious. In this sense, it is better than the Star Wars franchise, which started with a clever concept of humor, and eventually got worse with Jar-Jar's boring fascination. <br /> <br /> Meet a farm. Harvester was driving through an unselected field in the field, instead of working from one side to another, the drum in the crop field or the dumping of trucks instead of dumping in non-dependent crops. The mummy (mother) was pouring the grains of grains, but the farm land was drawn like a wheat field. <br /> <br /> When Kim's father had time to meet the fate, there was no dramatic weight from the scene. This was partly the fault of English language voice actors, but the drawings did not show too much weight. Kim's reactions in the scene were equally uncomfortable. Similarly, when a character named Henderson was killed, Chris responded a little, although apparently he seemed to have stopped. (Henderson's death is no spoiler; his name is not revealed to his death scene.) He immediately forgot him. Expressions of some sympathy show more feelings than that. I think the voice actor is worthy of the highest claim of fault in that case; There is at least one hint in Chris's drawing picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A villain The leader often punishes those failures with unfortunate deaths I can not say whether it has been lifted from Star Wars, or if it comes from previous sources - possible lansman books. <br /> <br /> A scene where a spaceship crash-land. As it plunges toward the ground, ship ships are broken. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The teenage daughter of a misconduct. Anyone who is hard enough to kill Henderson's death can suddenly shout, "Help, get it and I can not reach my gun!" Instead of just shining <br /> <br /> character of most personality (almost too much). J. Bill He made a sound like Olfman Jack, D. J. Among American graffiti. I'm surprised if he speaks well in the language. <br /> <br /> Two planets explode in the picture. The explosions were helpless, and they gave a lot of inspiration to Star Wars. But in his credit, the reason for the explosion was completely unlike the Death Star's primary weapon. There was a good, interesting explanation for the reasons for the dialog. Many more explosions look good in the movie, not just the explosion of the universe. <br /> <br /> Some sound effects are very hungry, as in the late 1970s, video games were taken from. Some images look like primitive video games and some effects from the trunk are also visible. On the other hand, the effect of the sound is often quite decent, although it emphasizes the part of the Chess-Glossary. The industry is very good, especially when it is often away from chessy-shown computer graphics. <br /> <br /> Finally the story is there. A movie tells a good story, it can get away with many production errors But the plot here was quite light. An intelligent boy tries to help someone to ship to a filthy place, and he does not understand a great ability to acquire. He and his duplicate partner struggled against a strong, unredeemably evil enemy in his band. He creates friends, learns about his special power, and grows into a young man. If he is continually and righteous enough, he may even be defeated by an evil enemy. The story along the way can rise above the simple outline of such a story, but much more than that from this movie. But <br /> <br /> <br /> However, it seems that initial intent is like big kids, probably there is no need to do more than this.
