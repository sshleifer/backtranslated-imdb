There was always a problem coming up with a "religious picture" in Hollywood. The strange cargo proved to be no exception. While using excellent cast talent and produced in the top budget, with the perfect Moody photography by Robert Planck, the film fails in the framework of credibility. Perhaps the reason is that the film seems so realistic that fantasy elements suddenly affect the fate of the activities and characters of the audience due to infiltration. I have had difficulty sitting still with all metaphorical, parallel and biblical references, and it is impossible to take intoxication-in-light Ian Hunter's smog-this is known as a Christ figure. And Boston, Detroit, and Providence sensors at least agree with me. The movie was banned. If the Boston / Detroit / Providence moviegoers complain or travel in any other city, it is clear from the traveler that Gayle and Crawford were involved in "message pictures" in any way. It's Floped everywhere. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, the film enjoyed some resurgence on TV. A home atmosphere is shown to allow visitors to hold more acceptable forms of viewers. However, despite its increasingly popular reputation as a strange or unusual film, this strange cargo plot flows along the expected, widely moral line, which will not predict how to end the original characters with fate.
