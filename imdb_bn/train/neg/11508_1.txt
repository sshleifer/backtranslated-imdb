Whatever Gai Richie has to do to rebuild Wartm√ºller's film, it's impossible. <br /> <br /> This new movie is a zombie. I saw another person in the audience, and he left one hour in it. (I hope he has claimed a return.) Finally, I was the only reason I never left the movie. <br /> <br /> But I stayed with this junk piece that Madonna and Ritchie could actually make a good film. The conversation is ridiculous, the actress is violent and the only beautiful thing in this movie is visible. Richie took the film to Lina and turned into "Blue Lagoon". <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you will not waste time watching on the last night of Cinemax. It is very valuable to be wasted on this kind of shit during the time.
