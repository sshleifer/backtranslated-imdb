For some reason, several young couples who walk through the Italian Alps can first see who can see their campus status. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient monster gladiator and possessed by the soul of "Tiaranas" while setting the helmet with the body. Then he used to hunt the rest of his friends by hitting the film and hacking their organs to add some stew to the deadly "Demonicus" to bring them back to life. The release of this shot-on-digital flower moon is a poor alternative for stupid, intelligent, terrible acting and sound and (Los Angeles) Angle National Forest Italy. However, it is quite impressive mainly on the unexpected smile scale thanks to overwrought lead performance. In the grappling, cheap weapons, it is believed that the Latin vulgarity of the sword or sharp nervous Latin glasses and revival, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expression and strange line delivery should be believed. Oh well, at least he is not boring like most of the rest of the rest.
