I did not get a fair rating of Amati Girls and I thought I was really giving it 4 out of 10. Otherwise a set of less child performers could not have been an extraordinary story. My eyes There are many clich√©s in that glow, women's hair is just awful and most of the scenes seem to be unrealistic or fake. There is no real emotion in this movie but there is a bunch of actors acting extra on that range of pain. It's not funny enough to be a comedian, it's really very fake to touch it, so it's not right in my eyes. Seeing it, I could not believe that something like this made my TV set in my living room in Switzerland. But perhaps it was OK and it was lost in translation? Who knows Of course I've never seen a weird movie and this is certainly not a good way! Sorry
