I saw ScarecroS due to buzz around it. Well, I can not imagine anyone who likes this movie because it's bad, bad, bad. <br /> <br /> Anyone who created this movie does not know one thing about the horrors. The whole story is a failed marriage of two series: Action movies (guns and criminals) and awesome (living horrors). When the criminals are afraid to see one insect after another, then the two sections automatically annihilate each other because first, they are criminals and those who know the culprit, and for the second reason they boot the stupid criminals! The zombie scarecrows go after them just does not work here. Where is that horror? I wanted to die the deadly, painful death of criminals. <br /> <br /> But the story is so badly designed that this marriage of the generals, if good can be handled, but not jail. We only have a bunch of super-gene offenders and a bunch of scarecrows, which the filmmakers think of whatever is left with "living" for flimsy reasons. To make things even worse, cinematography is terrible (like TV) and, most of its worst offenses, is called CBS across the whole of the dialogue, and we are constantly listening to disconnected images such as we see something like radio shows. This part was really bad. The director should be shot to death with such a stupid idea! <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> As I've mentioned, the criminals in Scorpio are amazing fools For example, when someone suddenly shows up, his fingertips are filled with damage and money and hay (yap, straw), then others ask, "What drug is he?" They threw some pink shots in it and could not kill him (he was afraid to be "junkyfide" and do not ask). Get a freaking yarn, morons. I did not see such a fool in the movie. And then there are the girls. I had a pain in the bite, because one of the scarecrows wanted to kill him fast. When he found his father nailed to a cross in the "cross" scroll, he blamed the perpetrators of an embarrassing scene (bad acting), even though the criminals could not do it. What was that? But the biggest weakness in this weak flashing horror They are not scary. Nothing is explained about them. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that scene with free and talking head. Thanks for the laughter. Finally, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen (and today I've seen many movies!) Equally harmful silo killers or scavengers, I'd rather see silo killers. Yes, SCARECROWS is that bad.
