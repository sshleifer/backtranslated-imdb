When an Arab ambassador to Washington, DC of Oshtar, tried to kill Amir, his life was preserved by a cocktail waitress named Sunny Davis. Sunny is a national heroine and media celebrity, and a prize is proposed to work for the Department of State Department Protocol. Unknown to him, but the State Department officials kept secret plans for him. <br /> <br /> We see a map showing Ahita in the wild desert region on the border between Saudi Arabia and South Yemen. Ruby Al-Khali, or simply known as the Quarter. In this real life, there will often be a vacancy in the state, and virtually zero strategic value, but for the sake of the film, we must admit that Ohatara's grief has countless strategic importance in the war and the US government, who are interested in building a military base, Doing what it can do. It is clear that Aamir congratulated his attractive young girl, who saved him and reached an agreement with the State Department; They can keep their foundation that Sunny may remain as the latest addition to her harem. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Voice down. Perhaps in 1984 the American people were not in the mood of ridicule in foreign policy of their country; It was that Ronald Reagan voted fifty-five votes in fifty states in the presidential election, and his hard line with the Soviet Union was going well with voters. (If the film was made a few years later, in the context of Iran / Contract, its voice could be different). <br /> <br /> The film is not taunting like a car, showing off its brand of authority and charm for Goldie Hawn. Sunny is an ideal golden character - beautiful, sweet-natured, naive and not very bright. However, you can limit how far you can go with the charm and elegance, and you can not automatically make a bad movie by making the main character a fool blonde. (Actually, it sounds like a recipe to make a good movie worse). Goldie tried his best to save this one, but is not successful. The reason is an inconsistent way to portray his character. On one side, sweet, innocent native girl from Sunny Oregon. On the other hand, a 35-year-old woman who works at a slaughter bar and wear an open costume. The idea is to think of Rebecca Sunnyb's firm and work as a Bonny Girl. <br /> <br /> Why Golf is the most important reason to rescue this image, even the best comedians or comedians are not even better. His / her components, and "protocol" are simply vague. Whatever humor is tired and disturbed, depending on objectionable stereotypes of Arab men, apparently, Western women want all after, especially if they are blonde and blue eyes. There were a number of such things in the mid-80's, because in this era, a young man Ben Kensley / Nastassiya Kinsky saw the movie "Harem", who kidnapped a young American ancestor and kidnapped an American American. The short series of the same name which tells a common identical story with a period of time. Filmmakers have realized that their film will not work as a pure comedy, because at the end it's the next "Mr Smith goes to Washington" on the next day. Sunny turns into a fountain of political knowledge from a blonde Bimbo and voted to vote for democracy and constitution and citizens and we are starting to talk about all types of platitudes about people and how to endless Liberty price blah blah blah ???? But in reality it is not as successful as a comedy, rather than a political paradigm. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Housewives", but "Protocol" Not one of them. I did not see all his films, but the ones I saw this horror comedy are the worst.
