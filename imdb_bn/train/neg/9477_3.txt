It had to be one of the most horrific revelers of all time and it was saved in only 2 matches. In between Edge and Mick Foley, Vince McMahon is also against Shawn Michaels. The main event was completely smoke between Sina and Triple H, and I became almost nervous to be honest. It was so stupid, that the casket match was not worthy of Undertaker's presence, and the match was a complete joke between Boogie Man and Booker Tie. If you've really missed a big fan of WWE and the first day of WWF and Wrestlemanias 17 and 19, then you probably like it. But I saw that this WrestleMania has much left to be desired.
