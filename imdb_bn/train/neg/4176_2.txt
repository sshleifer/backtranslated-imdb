Perhaps I missed meetings while explaining the meaning of "B-Movie", but what I saw was ridiculous. Do you want a good synopsis in this movie? Take allen, replace jamomorphs with replacements, then remove something good about it and it's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> In this 5 minutes, the movie "Vi-Sun Squad" (I've heard it most loudly) finds a "base" genocide by vampires and then they are down (down? what?) a Stairs backgrounds attached a billboard with a clear current day train. When is this supposed to be supposed? 2210. OK ... (Hold on, I'll go back) <br /> <br /> Yes. The character. Wow, good token lesbian asian chick, redhead cobbler wannabe, weathered captain, Goth Vampire / hot subject part time cashier, and there are wussy noob second in command. All of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost annoys me to see this annoying Micheal Ironside. Sam Fisher's voice in the Splinter Cell, is he not getting enough money? The only main thing about the Vampire War is how bad it is. It is <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> Since taping a PCI computer card in a stereo as a ready chamber? The necessary money can be used more effectively for this movie.
