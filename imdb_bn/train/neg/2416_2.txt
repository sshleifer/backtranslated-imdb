2 stars, and I'm being generous (Minor spoilers), this is a low-budget jumbo movie set in Gangland Auckland. After the plots leave, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after driving back to life. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this movie: What is Jabby ?! All "zombies" do do pregnancy (which does not even sound terribly distant) and drip to fake red blood from their mouths! Any scary eyes, no harmful flesh, just about a group pathetically hungry and running around like idiots. "<br /> <br /> The cover is confusing too.The whole picture contains only 6 bodies, so it is not a complete" hood ", such as zombies or something hurt, it's just a few, and there is no time. <br /> <br /> It is very cheerful. No one can work in this movie (probably in addition to gang members) and it really seems that a bunch of friends have gathered, decided to throw their family and a snake Tahante made a movie. <br /> <br /> The final note: When doctors tryakasyuta wear?! Please leave it!
