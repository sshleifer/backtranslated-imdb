Hey Arnold! A slow and slightly annoying movie. The plot is not very creative. Paul Sorvino Character (Shanek) is building a huge mall, shopping complexes and office buildings, reducing building low-cost buildings. This plot goes back to the movies of 1960's kids. It's annoying. Paul Sorvino is not very exciting, so his idea as a bad guy is not too scary. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal will certainly find the document with Helga's secret help, whose father is hoping to become rich in Shank Maal. Children must be moved to nearby cities of the bus, and so the exciting Chase scene associated with the bus is not only silly, but how the film shows how young children have been written. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is generally very entertaining and it is quite comical to appeal to adults. The TV cartoon is usually faster and more fanciful than this movie. Hey Arnold This movie is almost five times more embarrassing and a good way to keep someone with a quidis sleeping. Hey Arnold is hard to keep up all the way until the expected and completely annoying finale. If you want to send your kids to a completely offensive movie, that's it. I think instead of creating 90 minute movies, the producers tried to expand it within 90 minutes, starting with a 30 minute TV cartoon script. This stool story may certainly be covered in TV cartoon. Hope Arnold will hit the good writer if there is no series.
