I went to this movie that it would be a lovely football drama (Titans remember the same vein); However, I felt as if I was delighted with the typical Tempa Haggard lecture. The only thing that was the request for a decade of movie was there. In fact, this poor excuse for entertainment would probably be more than a televised preacher. At least with television sermons, there are biblical quotes rather than quotes from the popularist self-help kit. This plot was completely anticipated that anyone could present the entire plot within the first 15 minutes of the film when giving long attention.
