Like this movie, the Conan the Barbarian, but with sex, rape and murder. There is a plot under these rebellions, but filmmakers do not do a good job of showing it, it is shameful because it can be a 'decent story'. Richard Hill gives strong performance in the main role, such as Villain - who is not sadly present in any other note. The war scenes are not very bad - I like the death of her death sword to 'drink' her victim's blood - and there are plenty of full nudity and general level machismo mood across gender. <br /> <br /> All is fine, not good - but not bad ...
