But it's some good steps and a plot which is somewhat interesting. Nevsky works like a body builder and she's not attractive, really, IMO, she is frustrated. (All of his acting skills lack nothing!) Sasta played very well by Joanna Pakla, but needed more lines than his given, needed to improve his character. There are many people in this story, there are zero romance, too much work, and the path is very much over. It's too violent. But I love the scenery, this movie takes you around the world, and it's a bonus. I also like it that there were some elements about the Mafia, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. Actors need to be more handsome ... My biggest problem was that Nevsky was very normal, not quite sexy. For most people, I think saa cha will be hot enough, but for us women who do not cut employees, Nevsky will not cut it. Overall, this movie was good, I did not like it or I hated it, it just seemed like another normal action flick.
