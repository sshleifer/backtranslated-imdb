I actually saw the O'Brien II of China that I saw the original Chinese O'Brien. And I want to say that the first incarnation is actually bad. But: bad = fun! And funnier = good. If you're a bad movie fan like me, this is a great element. However, if you look for any kind of meaningful plot, acting ability or filmmaking skills, it will be the best thing to do. The best part is how they take a series of all-weather fight in the fast-forward Ridiculously bad. Watch it for laughter, watch it for fun, but watch what you do on TV for free.
