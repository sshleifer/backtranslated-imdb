After a car accident, a mad scientist (Jason Evers) puts his fianc√© (Virgina Leith) head. Then he goes on the thief to search for the perfect body to make his whole again. Beautiful lam almost all the way, nothing redeeming here. Also cast in: Leslie Daniels, Bonny Sherry and Bruce Brighton. Nobody should help this out of his sorrow. Let's die it.
