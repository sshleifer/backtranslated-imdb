My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it might be a good 'Halloween' off-off. A killer youngster, a white mask ... you get my drift. We got wrong! For any punishment purpose. We simply did not discover one of the worst movies there, but it's a ritual classic! It fills the w / plot hole and makes no sense. The actress is pretty good playing Madri, but it is about that. I am crediting for a very low budget shot - I always support such movies. Not just this one particular. <br /> <br /> It may be nice to see whether this image is drunk or high; Do not bother otherwise. Unless you want to lose the privilege of your movie as I did!
