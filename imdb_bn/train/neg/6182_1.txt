This film probably created a Elpho of Peter in Robin Hood's attire instead of Robin Hood's clothing and probably ignores all its features in Robin-Hood-Kamnium. This movie Wendy makes a fool fool. And the poor Captain hooks across a total. And of course, every Disney cartoon should have a character that had a lot of hits on the head, they made one of the lost boys. The only character that is not disrespectful in this movie is a tink. The only star for him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story? Darling's parents did not even get the time to get their kids gone !!! Perhaps the main story is one of the most important points and they destroy it! The famous Nursery scene in Peter Pan and Andy also has a stunning piece - a thimble and no roots - one of the short stories that makes the original story unique. It's a wonderful incident that he lost his shadow and he helped to stop him. (Though his shoes and it does not make me any knowledge. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> So if you do not know it before, then know this - this Disney version does not have anything remarkable with the original story - which is not really a child story, but a great, wonderful story. <br /> <br /> This is just no end to me Bothered.
