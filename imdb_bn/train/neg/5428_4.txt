Other Priodaran / Bhooha saw any other picture instead of the actual will for the tip, I saw the only reason for this movie that the film was not regular (Akshay Paramesh and others), but do not need to speak. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, the original trick, in fact this whole movie is like drumming, I mean, playing loud aloud with a loud aloud, or playing a weird beat of drums for a short time ?? Its only series can carry different bits in a nice feeling, which are considered for a long period of time. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to another device, Dumuro does not require any talent, there is no variation in it, and for a while the monkey can be enjoyable (Humor Rajpal is a good feeling like Yadav), but it is not a device that is long You can also dance or even dance like a walk. <br /> <br /> This movie was like a drummer and played dumbro, sometimes sometimes Dhumroo played, sometimes both together, but most of the dumruo played alone and monkeys danced. And the 24-year-old man got annoyed as before. <br /> <br /> There is some good moment (good) moment in the movie, but after a while I have heard that this annoying Dumroo (initially entertaining, then annoying.), big parts really make sure that the film "Murray Vince Co and the Koon die "is good for some fun clips. (If you do not see it in the movie, it comes in the evening and is really fun). <br /> <br /> It was the moment of this movie, I did a good job except for the actor Rajpal Yadav (who I can see, I saw him in Main Mary Patni), who is more annoyed than entertaining, I have said this a lot and I will say again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor, especially in multi-star comedy, have a good career in front of them. <br /> <br /> Some scenes were really interesting, like trying to marry girls and trying to get away from each other, like trying to influence girls. <br /> <br /> But later on, the film was more persistent in this 45-60 minutes, the meaning that this girl was once in a while, with a more intriguing attempt to do more with this mystery, the measure was "So Bid's most Well classified ", I mean what they were <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " You're coming to see it and it's often joking Gei started laughing. <br /> <br /> All the movies except the weird father, down or up are gradually diminished, and then quickly swirled, they made friends with girls. <br /> <br /> Most of the bad scenes were in the end, the film tried a lot more than run the comedy comedy, but most of the jokes were too old and reeked to repeat, the last 10-15 specially dististful and completely spoke in this movie. <br /> <br /> I do not think Tanusree Dutt is quite impressive, and his acting genius can not do serious questions, especially his unexpected looks, if you are not hot and how much time you can live. <br /> <br /> This film is technically a weak, constant female aspect and light-lamps and camera-work. <br /> <br /> The title track without songs was no good, when I played songs in the second half, I could feel collective gasp from the audience. <br /> <br /> All movies are common due to simply throwing, and very little <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do you feel frustrated. <br /> <br /> - Many great jokes, Rajpal Yadav, last 45 minutes and last 15 minutes, especially bad technically, bad songs. <br /> <br /> +/- Trying to be more than regular is not Cast (I'm happy for him), Tanusree Dutt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some early scenes, title songs, well-played and cast without RY. 4.5 / 10 (I'm trying to make a point here, I do not like Rajpal Yadav or Tanusree Dutt and this movie has fulfilled my very low expectations, so I give it all doubt. The movie was not more than 4)
