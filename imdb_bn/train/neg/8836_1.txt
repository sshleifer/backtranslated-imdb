It is not industrial, it is internal-city, politically correct propaganda! Political intolerance in Jindaban is not inadequate ... it is not seen as a person, but rather as members of the class. <br /> <br /> This is the greatest aggressive Australian film ever I can think of against some pretty tough competition!). In a message movie, there are tired themes in common left love: Aborigines are victims; The white male is violent or alcoholic; White women are not that bad - especially if they are lesbian - but they are more likely to have depression. <br /> <br /> Four men who go to fish find a murderer's body (indigenous, naturally) and throw them in the river for a few days while holding the trout. With almost no discussion it is a strange decision, as if humans are animals. The man who is shocked for a short time is ... we know this because he is living with a bisexual woman - he wants to keep his child a lot - and eventually more fashionable goes to expensive places (all these abusive Bush residents Away from) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> Its humiliation as it is about the country's ignorance of humiliation. The film is shot by Forboding, a long distance scene supported by mysterious music. In the end, it has become very clear that indigenous people are the only ones in this countryside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Residents of other Australians. <br /> <br /> This film was not made by the people by the real work but the film was financed by the Film Finance Corporation. This is a product of the arts set, which is free of charge by the beautiful people, for whom governmental government funds protect against sponsoring objectionable projects (which actually separate life from possible lives), actually people want to see popular movies. Although the film is frustrating, it does not matter, they still pay. <br /> <br /> Keep yourself away from the waste, avoid it like a plug. The more vicious social commentary than the original entertainment, this picture demands the pans!
