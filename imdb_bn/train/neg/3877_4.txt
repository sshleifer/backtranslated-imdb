I just saw the second consecutive Incredible Mating Man, and it was more annoying when I first saw it. I do not understand why it has become such a gradual classic gradually gradually. The opening scene shows commitment, when fat nurses fall in blood cancer and run for their favorite life. After all this, the molten man stands around some jungle and house, when he has a flashback of his life as his astronaut. The makeup is quite good, and its molten Gooey face looks fairly realistic. A cool scene where he threw a man's head in a river, and until it reached the shower until it reached a waterfall where it fell on the stone and opened cracks. Although there is not much wet on yourself, most of the scenes are shot in the dark and you can not really see what's going on. Not too much, at least the Vippo DVD has seen. <br /> <br /> No, the incredible Mating Man is not so big. I would give it a mark for its cheese factor but that's about it. If you want a genuine science-fire / horrible classic, see Deadly Spons instead!
