After reading the previous comment, I am very happy that I was not the only person confusing, especially in the past 20 minutes. John Carradine was shown to walk twice in the graveyard and then to close the lid. I was curious to wait a bit more explanation for this strange behavior ... Naturally I thought that he had something to do with evil behavior in his house, but he died by the first rising body (then called Zombie # 1), this scene is absolutely Made in no sense. Please do not know anyone else's carrardine graveyard - let the rest of us stay in it !! <br /> <br /> All tasks are limited within the last 20 minutes so I will try a summary. John Carradine came out of the cemetery to investigate, and fell victim to Zumba # 1. So far everything is right. But then we are getting confusing scenes where John Ireland and Jerry Strickler discover the bodies of Kardrin's body outside, for a little moon movement in the graveyard. The striker repeatedly tried to push Ireland from the open grave, from which Zumbo # 1 appeared, but instead of replacing the open grave in Ireland, and in the PRESTO! Strickler # 2 comes out as a zombie! Yes, I can guess that Strictor has died all along (a witch?), But why he has changed from normal appearance to roaming-meat version, does not explain it in the cemetery # 1 of Jumbo. (Considering the slow pace of these zombies, I used to think that he liked being in his "normal" form until his business was over). This scene brings a question to the mind - OK Who's the Job # 1 ??? We can only assume the # 1 Jumbo that the movie is one of the real killings shown during the opening credits, but who knows it or someone has some special charges against the film's character. However, after Ireland shows this transition and runs away, we have seen the only shot like Zombie # # 1 that we have jumped through the tree # 1. (This really leads to confusion passing over how many zombies really have). Then the best 1950's horror-film fashion manages to travel to Ireland. He slowly raised his head up on the little headstone of the dead cat of Demuruga (John Kerdin was not to tear a grave stone for a catty?) <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the destruction of the debris at home # 1 in Jumbo has been done. He easily dispatches members of three film crew, then start the stairs. Believe Domergue listen to him, and out of his boyfriend John Ireland thinking back to his night shoot. After watching it only in Zombie # 1, he screamed out and retreats into a bedroom where he recovered the Revolver of Ireland. Starlet Carol Wells is shaking at this moment and can not hear screams, his co-star Charles McLowy (who is jumping into a mirror in his bedroom and doing hamming). After taking her sweet time (and only swigs some more from her hip-flask) she finally decided to investigate. (One thing striking the viewers at the end of this movie is how they scream, scream and gunmen). Domergue Hallway comes back armed and ready, but McLough is wrong for Zombie # 1 and shoot him six times! He has done a wonderful acrobatic flip over the railing, then a horrible dagger back up, in the arm above the # 1 position on the right. <br /> <br /> Carol Welles now comes out of her shower and when she hears the gunshots and screams of Domergue; He also feels no great emergency in running to investigate. So this time zombie # 1 has Domergue string time to neck with a rope. Wells shows hanging bodies of Domergue and fates dead. The next time we saw him in a stream outside the house (???) - but after that more. Meanwhile, Ireland has rescued her senses and entered the house where she discovered the bloody killings of # 1. Though Ireland has been subjected to only three murders, yet he is worried that his film has been exposed and destroyed! For him (and the listener), Zombie # 1 dropped some movie equipment from the second floor on his head. In the end we see Zombie # 1. At this point, all of the audiences are treated with a full-blown death, which shows that the new ones "mirror" the older ones. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How did he go there? Jabbi # 1 took him down, threw him, then did John rise above the length of Ireland? Apparently one of the real victims was drowned in the tub, so Welles had to drown (but why not explain the outside of the stream instead of the tub outside). Zumbo # 2 It has never been made in your own house (everyone is dead now, thanks to Jumbo # 1, but instead) he instead took Carol Wells to the graveyard. As a flash credit flash on the last screen, we still see 23 Jumbo with his dead love, coming down from the open grave. <br /> <br /> The audience was surprised: yes, but this zoom # 1's grave? Why is zombie # 2 taking place? And what if Zombie comes along with # 1 and wants to climb back - what zombie # 2 will give him, or will a zombie fight? Will both zombies and newborn carol wells share? And now the dead John Caradin - where will he be? Finally, from the previous scenes we know that he is clearly in the house from home ... If the summary of the last of this plot confuses you, do not worry that you are not alone.
