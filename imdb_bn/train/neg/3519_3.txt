I have some stolen movies I liked, but this movie did not meet my low expectations. I believe it's hard to believe in this movie. For example, a bunch of terrorists involved in land accidents in the desert is ready for at least two days. In addition, stallions and companies across the desert are running across bridges and stairs which provide convenient little or a platy device. Also, Treasury police does not seem to make some adjustments with local rescuers. Also, bad guys who could not really hit a barn in search of high-tech automatic weapons. <br /> <br /> I like John Lethgo's villain first, but the character is a complete psychologist who does not care about his own bad boy, or all of them are being killed. Finally I could not believe the character. <br /> <br /> The rental price is not worth, even when there is no price to see.
