It contains information that is not widely reported, it is not true either. They reinvented events, took out many liberties by using the set without excluding the public and not fulfilling the events of their life in the 30's. At times, the gang was more than just Bonnie, Clyde and W. W. D. and there was a lot of people involved with them. Buck and Blanes were pleased to go straight ahead of a shootout and have actually returned to crime. Some of the events pictured in the light of the day are actually held at night. Bunny's wounds were much more deadly and were never quite right. It was so bad that he had to take him around until he got well, even then he became stubborn so that he started walking tightly. Clade is also walking with a tall prison because he cut a big toe off. I know, I'm not a pic, and it was a TV movie, but in addition to these incidental errors in this "true" story, film came very quickly from the event and came across different snapshots of their life <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> If I want to go closer to the truth, I would recommend reading books or documentaries.
