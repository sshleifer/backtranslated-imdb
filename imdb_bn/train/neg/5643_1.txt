I have 2 home entertainment stores and I saw many bad movies in my time but it was so bad that it forced me to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sovieta Coppola was eligible for Oscar for his performance with Godfather III's Godfather III. In this film with Giaida Collagandee <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was robotic and vague. His boyfriend died a month before his arrival at 'Rubber House'. Once there, he discovered that he had cheated him in his relationship but no one could register with him. Within a day, he began a relationship with Leslie (Defo)'s supervisor's home. Although he married Dafa's screen, his scenes with him were cold and unselfish. <br /> <br /> If I had a plot, I missed it. Even Willam Duff could not recover the film from the ruins of the amateur, cinematic train.
