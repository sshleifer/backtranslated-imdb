Miraculously, this is actually quite watchable. I mean, it's bad. It's really bad. But the original was so bad-it-destruction-my life is bad, it's very bad- it's a bad mood-entertainment. OK, that's enough unclear praise. Production prices have been torn across the board, acting is disrespectful and Romero-Vanawab does not pay attention to the ridiculous no-rite realistic fare. Internal logic is that when it comes back from head to back from freezes, objectionable virus incidents, bullets working against zooms, or wireless power is not necessary for the 'plots' requirement. Gore draw, of course, but the framework is so annoying to slapdash it. The conversation sounds like it has been translated by the same computer which allows guidelines manuals and none of the romance movies are the zombie infections scale. It's all topped with a terrific synth score. Absolute trash.
