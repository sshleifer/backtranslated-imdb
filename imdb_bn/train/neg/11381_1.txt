Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, at the end of 2006 when "Robotaby" appeared in Canada, I saw the premiere and were inevitably surprised. Characters are generic and stereotypical (do they really need a African-American man to wear Tiger-strip print clothing and talk to Jamian accent? Why are all Asian letters yellow and scouting vibrant? Why do the soil have big thighs and chest and continuous complaints?) Where is the point Thing is unrealistic, expected, gross and sometimes boring. Astro has even heavy similarity, even even stabs at the boy. Allow me to explain (Dub names for young people): Robotabie / Astro, Kamijen / Tanma, Constantine / Shadow, Guus / Recurring, Tommy / Alejo, Lola / Zoran + Kennedy, Mosheim / Wes, and so on. "My Life and a Teenage Robot", "Star Wars", "Kissen Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Kaman Riders", "Silly Chun" and others. Not to mention significant ethnic / gender stereotyping in advance. Do not even start me innuendos. I say they are hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Do not even try to see this. Especially if you like Astro Boy.
