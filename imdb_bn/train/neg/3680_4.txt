I remember to be correct on a Tuesday, 18/6/02 morning. When I heard the terrible explosion, trying to convince myself out of bed was dozed off. I went to the kitchen where I have a view of several areas of southern Jerusalem and have seen a pillar from smoke to smoke, one minute later the smoke was followed by the cyanera wounds. Remember to look at my bedroom, remove my telescopes, run back to the kitchen, and show the image of a broken glass. The bus was still near the pickup station where a terrorist landed on it and killed 25 passengers by a single click on the TNT device, many of whom were going to school. A good friend of mine, sitting on the bus in the back row, an abusive and meaningless decision that saved his life. <br /> <br /> I'm sure every Israelite has a terrorist-related memory that he never wanted to do and before filming it, it was only a matter of time. When it was turned on, the film was going to become a stressed memory of its own. <br /> <br /> This picture is a playwright on dry rice, Heim Buzaglow (illustrated, Hamm, Heim Buzagl√∂ also wrote and directed the film), which manages the better part of his day to compete with the empty word processor page. . Meanwhile, his girlfriend, the Field Reporter for the Israeli commercial channel, decided to cut a bribe about the former army officer to the borrower. Buzzglow, disturbed and a little paranoid, which is known as "this hot babe of the world is dating me", asked her personal girlfriend to manage her girlfriend's steakout. <br /> <br /> Progress in his investigation as a detective, his observation is flowing into life between his play and later in his actor's life. In the meantime, the game is transformed into a playful game against the irrationality of the Israeli society. For the film, well, the film has become an exercise in the progress of progress, it has become its small cardboard character and incredible dialogue, and it has moved miles away from the first issue that was tackled. <br /> <br /> When I say "Cardboard Characters" the characters I mentioned under the emotion of the "meaningful" film / writer were without any real conversation and no rhetorical reliability. I will not be very told about it. Not saying that I'm sure homeless freak male prostitutes rarely go to the theater. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This photo is by itself the first part of the current Agenda Trilogy. I sincerely hope that the other two films will arise from the experience of my writings at the beginning of my review, which are opposed to the exclusive world of letters which are existing and are not necessarily a plot. <Br> <br /> My filmmeter has 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> This movie was a landmark of hardness. It was shot within ten days, all the cast works for free and the film costs around 12,000 dollars (no, I did not pay zero or two, twelve thousand dollars). You've been wondering why it took 34,000 dollars to complete the Blair Witch project.
