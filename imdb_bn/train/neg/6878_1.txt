I'm Puerto Rican and it's the worst documentary to look after any kind of You can see that people are stupid about it. They do not know much about Puerto Rico and its culture. They claim to be Puerto Rican because they are from Puerto Rican descent, but they probably know less than those who are not there. They can see when they talk that they are contrary to themselves. If you want to see a real and I mean is a real, original documentary from Puerto Rico, you must see "Mieu Puerto Rico". This is a serious, real documentary. This piece of junk is not good. This documentary based on Rosie Perez herself. I guess it's about to be Puerto Rican. They do not know to keep repeating. Well, they got the only thing in this so-called documentary. I hate showing a kind of garbage using island names. It brings value down.
