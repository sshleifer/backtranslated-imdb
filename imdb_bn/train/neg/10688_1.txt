I have seen almost two hours of the movie I saw, all of them will be good actors, watchable. I did not believe in the end of the movie and I had no idea what had happened ... I was crazy because I could use that time to do something else ... I tried to fix everything, but really no The formula was there. Thanks to those who figured it out and explained ... right or wrong, it is better than knowing something! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair, we saw several times while driving? How did the first lady know that her husband is cheating on her? At the end of the movie, Kate said that she would finally find the truth. Does this mean that we will go to the last game 2?
