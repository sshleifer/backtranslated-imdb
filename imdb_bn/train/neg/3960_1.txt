Hi, because I'm not the theater major or a sophisticated movie ... I think this movie is "boring" and "fool". <br /> <br /> I hired this movie because of Charles Branson and it's title ... but the boy wasted time ... only two people are sitting in a vault talking ... <br /> <br /> The movie was "Dark" ... in this DVD ... I was watching hard movie ... I understand it is a 1968 film ... but they keep it in a DVD but they should have some digital remastering. Also, I was completely surprised to see this high symbol in the movie IMDB ... as I have said before, I am not as sophisticated as other people commented on this movie.
