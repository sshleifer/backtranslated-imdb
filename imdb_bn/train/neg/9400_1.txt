It is very unfortunate when it is made such a movie. A large part of the work and money has been placed in a photo that is best in amateur <br /> <br /> The edit has been reduced, there is a clear error, which is easily fixed in the second step and the soundtrack is unimaginable. There can be a lot more to do with this video movie. I think they have finished the time or the video. <br /> <br /> Holding shots have their own unique feeling.
