There were many promises of this picture, and the plot was relatively interesting, but the actors, directors and editors left the picture seriously. <br /> <br /> I feel bad for writers, it could be good. Acting difficulties, very few credible characters. <br /> <br /> Who clearly edited this, learned only some new editing techniques and wanted to spread them throughout the film. Almost every scene has a lot of quick 'Flash' edits, which are clearly considered symbolic but only end up as annoying. <br /> <br /> I wanted to like this movie and hope there will be a decent resolution of breaking the equilibrium but it does not matter, it reminds me that I have wasted my time and filmmakers have ruined their money.
