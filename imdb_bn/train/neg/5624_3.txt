Within a span of 40 years on the globe, writer Jack London was able to grow as far as possible adventure and event. This 90-minute film is a biography of a man's life, but petic is not fantastic, even the surface is not digested, and it is very ripe for modern day rebuilding. Here, Michael O'Shhea, one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance are both ugly and sympathetic. He does not have problems here. And a small and very beautiful Susan Hairdair, acting with his future wife, Karmian, whose picture is based on London's biography "foundation". London's life has broken into a series of episodes, which decreases the film. So one of our pirates with London, the seal of the Sea of ​​Buying Sea, the gold projector of Yukon and a journalist during the Rasha-Japan war ... Certainly colorful events, but rarely has something like this - depth treatment. And the direction of Alfred Santel (he directed Susan's first film "Leading Citizen," in 1939) was superlative. The anger here is very bad-quality DVD, it's a faulty print source and intelligent sound. Perhaps my best thing about renting this movie, for me, was one of the DVD's additions: a catalog of all alpha video films, hundreds and full-length movie posters featuring. Let's hope these pictures are better than "Jack London"!
