I thought I saw this picture twice. Then I read all other reviews, and they do not quite match. A man and three young students, two daughters and a boy go to this city to visit the big birds. I still feel confident that I saw this movie, despite the discrepancies between reviews. So I'm returning my review: If you like the movie 'B' occasionally, as I do, then return to the bogie crick for you! Whether it's setting up a sleeping timer, and closing your favorite movie-bomb, or just hanging with friends. Boggy Creek, silent button, and you got a fun night at Imov. Be careful! The legend is true? I think we could just find out with a non-so-star star. Will a device be faulty in the special moment? Our blonde, manly, young hero has no chest hair? At present the high-tech technikalaera the whole film? You have to find out for yourself.
