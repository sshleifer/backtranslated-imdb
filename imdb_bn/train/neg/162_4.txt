A movie that strives to be much smarter than its creators. The film became "amazing" through Mariah's plot and "plot" in an effort to guess the audience, confiscated the "sculpture", which they thought they would help with it. <br /> <br /> This pseudo-intellectual effort involving James Baloozy and walks through just sleeping movies. Applicable for the same "actor". The plot is quite silly and tacky. Whih in itself is not such a crime, but in the end, the splendid plots-twists get very tiring and annoying. <br /> <br /> However, some interest creates interest in the middle of the movie. Really a boring day is worth a lazy clock, but do not bother if you miss this miss. <br /> <br /> rather a hairy 4!
