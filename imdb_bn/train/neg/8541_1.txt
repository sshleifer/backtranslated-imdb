Movies on Classic 50 Pack Movies 17 Welcome Where we will see, okay. Another movie that makes absolutely no sense. Seriously, this movie made me so confused, I thought I was sleeping again "they are asleep." The plot looks simple enough .... well in that movie up to 3 seconds where a girl supposedly kills a cat and then ... Um ... blast? I have no idea what happened. And that was before the title screen. It is sad that I can not even tell what to say in the first 3 minutes. However, it plays a photographer with a great difficulty, who found this girl after dumping her other girlfriend to take pictures. Something somewhere. So we went there, but some of them did not want to drive 200 feet high in the city by stealing jeep. Suspicious? No So they decided to stay in this lonely village with an old lady. And then blah blah stuff happen and blah blah talking. The old lady does not tell him though the guy with Moses goes out of the fog for some reason. He is lost and then finds his way. <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention that this unbelievably unattractive 20 minutes later, the man in the house of the man who saw from that fiancale eyes Casablanca Then they leave There is really no point in this scene. It's really just padding <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, . Let me rephrase that. It was really tragic that the best part of the movie was. Because the rest is so confusing that I was looking at IMDB to know what would happen. But certainly nobody knows so I'm SOL <br /> <br /> Seriously, the last 30 minutes of the film are a few of the unforgettable moments I've ever seen in the film. They wear her clothes, kidnap, then get released, go home, then finally the house is in the house and it ends? Seriously. I have sometimes been so confused of a movie. I mean, "war of robots" is bad as a movie, at least they create senses. This movie can not be compatible with ATTEMPT. The end was confusing as "they started to sleep in confusion" and the plot was much more annoying. "I do not know what has happened in this movie" the movie gets only one of them. "Witches Mountain" gets 1 out of watching the confused movie 10.
