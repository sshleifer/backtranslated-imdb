Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Twinkle spent a long time in Twin (Cooper) Relocated compared to the re-opened Alcatraz. She claimed that it would be closer to her lady but her actual motives would be more grandios. There he goes by the chest (Bill Goldberg) a huge prisoner who can take care of himself. Despite being less muscular, Twitch is exactly the same as the face and the same. But there was a clash between black and Hispanic prisoners, which was shot dead by the blacksmith's gang leader and Bern was rebel in prison at the point of the finger. But the real killer and the leader of the Happenpix, Cortez (Robert Madrid), when Twitch's girlfriend and Berke's daughter took hostage, Shawon really hit the fan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite being a DVD sigell, this time Bill goes to Galburg (Steve does not appear on some stock footage of the first film seen in the end), but he did not do much work from Universal Soldier II.   এর কারণ তিনি একজন অভিনেতা নন এবং একটি অ্যাকশন স্টারের বেশিরভাগই নয়, একটি চরিত্র পরিচালনা করে যা খুব অন্ধকার এবং ব্রুডিংয়ের মতো শুরু হয় তবে অযৌক্তিকভাবে কার্যকরী অ্যাকশন হিরোকে পরিণত করে অদ্ভুতভাবে নিস্তেজ এক-মাছ ধরার যন্ত্রগুলিকে বন্ধ করে দেয়। Supported, veterans from the first film, Koodappat and Tony Plna, have just jumped on the opportunity to do extra work. <br /> <br /> It is a film that tried to copy the original style. Gradually light, dark shadows and rap music play a lot of it. It's quite good, unfortunately it can not be an unengaging hero, an equally opposed with Cardboard Villene and an overwhelming story that the makers went along as they seem to have been made. **
