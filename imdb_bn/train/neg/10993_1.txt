Of course, we all like bad movies on one or the other, and we actually enjoy them, however, it was not even a guilty plea, it was just shit. Some people, Vince Offers, who are probably proud enough to make themselves the main characters, probably became drunk - perhaps both - and it was a great idea to create a movie. Then he proceeded to show his script equally high / drunken people. Overall, this film was so bad, expected and unreasonable I did not get it in 20 minutes before closing it. It makes you look like a citizen Cain. Bat man WTF ... Some people walk around with a bat, a real real. She is almost as well called Fat Man, and a fat guy walks around a superhero outfit.
