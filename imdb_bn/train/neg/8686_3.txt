I'm just marking this topic as "content", not just in the content of the show's content, but also in content. <br /> <br /> I saw reading comments that how these Republicans tolerate the show, but the Democrats seem to be accustomed to its so-called authenticity, but they deny it. Even a reader (so it seems) actually indicates that he believes that these events may or may have occurred when Bush was in grade school. <br /> <br /> But I'm trying to be as neutral as I can see, that the group that created this series will really be Bush haters. I saw the last episode, that in 2010, McCain should have put together the program before becoming the first runner to nominate; Due to the fact, other ex-front runners featured all. <br /> <br /> Another thing that caught my attention is to add it to mortgages. I think Syria should not have been made definitely in Europe, because in America I have no home that America is not built in a house and probably is not built in the artists' houses. <br /> <br> I am seeing the show, yes I have caught it, I am amazed to see what a desperate desire for writers to do to embarrass the President. Certainly most Americans will agree, because there is no reason to be so scathing in public display around the world. Perhaps this event and network has created trends, so if Obama and Hillary came in, could they make "humor" about them and maintain the wind? <br /> <br /> <br /> Commenter comment comments. There has been some change in the elections in 2000, according to the author, he was so convinced that there would be a completely different acceptable president. Wow, its part is wishful thinking. Until the 911 incident, I believe that when Clinton was the President, it was set in motion, and I can not see how it would be different when Gore became president.
