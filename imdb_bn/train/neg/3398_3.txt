It seems that the motive of the movie is Russian aggressive (Mafia-like) character or at least those Russians can travel outside of their big country. It is very easy to loot a bank in England; And that British police is so void that this person is leaving the country by air, even when the bank robbed person can not find. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues had spoken in a language that has not yet been identified, perhaps by the aliens in the Ural Mountains, but far away from Russia. So Nicole, if you want to speak Russian, please go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy with the Russian language grammar and its pronunciation.
