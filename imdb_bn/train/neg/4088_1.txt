It was watching life on a lifestyle event in my movie. When I came out I went to see it in the theater. I was totally amazed how exactly was. Movies like this make you wonder who keeps the money and who has benefited - very, very big. Special effects are the first grade level, since any first grade can do their job. The rubber rubber bat in the string, no attempt to hide a string, the arrow that is dragged into the film, and the arrow on the road sign and a ridiculous line of the story. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to "victory". Each film student must see this thing so that they know the definition of a bad movie.
