With Stella Stevens, here's a very humid movie movie, taken from Las Vegas to Circus Circus Hotel, in exchange for a fee, from someone in the city of Novevada, Nevada, outside of Vegas. Stevens takes three daughters with her daughter gang, and they find that they will work faster than expected. Despite a somewhat handsome appearance in Las Vegas in the 70's, much of the involvement involved much more believable acting, and the Las Vegas Lady with a possible plot line gives a big annoying egg. The film seems to be forever in the gear, and when it only spreads here and there and never comes in motion. I was somewhat disappointed with this picture. Of course, I'm not expecting anything extraordinary, but at least 70 percent or something like this could be one of these pure exploitation films. Not even close Nobody dies One year before his grand performance as the Helper Skater Prosecuting Attorney Buggyaas, a fist gunfight between Craicie Stuart Whitman and the official George de SÃ­ngou. Gunfight has all mysteries watching a waterfall. Have a punch and a head injury with a punching instrument. Except that nothing of the terms of action. And for girls, I do not expect much there. Stella and her girls (both are very medium yet beautiful talent, get in a bath and a bath.) What do we see? Nothing without a faster side profile. Stella wear these excellent open blouses accentuating her real talents, but I wish she would like to have more of her performance. Somewhat openly. I can write a thing that will suggest the film. Alas, it was not and this movie It's not for me to say something. It's not a terrible movie. It's just not going to do anything for it. YAWN.
