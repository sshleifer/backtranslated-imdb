Immediately after watching this movie, I took a role in every actor and actress and asked about mental skills. Elizabeth Cue is a pretty actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? Although due to the credit I would give credit, though. Some moments of the movie are transformed into unpredictable and rather, they are only made for the harmful adverse tendencies of the Sevastian Kainan character of the Kevin Bacon character. I will not recommend this movie to anyone, male or female, for which there is no form of self-respect for the account.
