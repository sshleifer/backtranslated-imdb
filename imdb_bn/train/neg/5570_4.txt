<br /> <br /> Entertainment: A trashy script that was typed in front of thousands of typewriters in front of the typewriters. Acting submerged by this story ... well set / location and good girl with good quality price .. -Tating 4/10 <br /> <br /> Social message: There is no social message in the movie. It is undoubtedly thought ... but if I say I was 10 years old, and my IQ was 70. I think the message is: Do not be afraid to love? Wrong thing: The humorous Judaic Orthodox and arrogant attitude presented by the writer / director is nothing special. Normally say, good, nothing bad - 8/10 <br /> <br /> Overall rating 4/10
