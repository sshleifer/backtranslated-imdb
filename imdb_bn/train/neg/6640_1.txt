I am unsuccessful in commenting on this "movie" that there is no reason to comment on it. It is like a leaky egg that can not show any good to the world's chaos because it has been the second permanent egg number before it. But since such a grandoose immersion is a compulsory comments ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For this film, "Cinema" which is directed by Lucian Pintilie. Following the communist era (1990 to present day) to describe the so-called "Romanian reality". <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < (Like I know that you want) Enjoy and enjoy but other well-liked IMDB members do well, or write an online review for it. Is erroneous, boring and ultimately to waste their time. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this movie (among others) has some value, an educational example for it sets an example: "How to do a movie."
