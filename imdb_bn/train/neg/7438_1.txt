This film is a complete waste of time, plot horror, dialogue horror. <br /> <br /> Actually, there are no plots or scripts to work with actors. Photography and special effects are okay, but again, there is nothing interesting to see in this movie. There is no logical progress in the story, the story line is stupid fool. It is not even scary. For a movie scare, at least credibility will be a small element. There is no credibility in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie has only three characters. Each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /> <br /> Most of the special effects and makeup work have been done badly, or mostly medium. <br /> <br /> I hope you read it and do not waste time in this movie until it is weird to see a completely horrible movie.
