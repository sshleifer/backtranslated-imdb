Ridiculous Angelique 9-year-old Anakin has turned into Vani Brat of 19-year-old Anakin, whoever thinks that Amilal is a 5-year-old senior. Now 22-year-old Jadi warrior hero Anakin has two bad dreams, and so a child of his old friend and a crazy old man strongly believes in him to kill the entire structure of his existence), his valued wife can really die, and b) only he Can prevent. Ludicrosity Square. <br /> <br /> I think those who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. Characters are incredible (literally, "superb", "wonderful", etc., not perverted sense). <br /> <br /> Obi-Wian Kenobi was a wise and kind anchor for the whole series, but Claymax, he hacks Anakin's feet, loses him, and lets him enjoy. Does anyone ever think out of character a little? <br /> <br /> I hope, at least expect a story that shows consistent characters with series motivation. No one here. The story can be written at the age of 10. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, the CGI is quite cool.
