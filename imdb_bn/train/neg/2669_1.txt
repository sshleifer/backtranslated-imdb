I rarely moved to make a comment about a film. But I do not understand how this was made. Who has created it? How could they possibly be able to create a feature film? Did they take a weekend course in some photo schools, get a big check from parents, and become one after the kidnapping of David's family? Or is he a neutral, unnecessary generosity out of a chance because of a long-time family friend / remote relationship? I do not care, I do not know. Even he was tall, ashamed of him, wasting his line and hiding his face from the camera. Meanwhile, the dope may have been a gaffe from the Neighbors, it seems that absolutely no sound design, script, direction and editing were not harmful, and honestly, so much apathy has taken hold of me now that I will not be disturbed by this. Spend more.
