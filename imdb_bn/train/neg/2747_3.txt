I knew it would be, but I gave it a hare for some laugh and perhaps some fun fun. Anyone can read a few of my reviews so please see I'm pretty easy. <br /> <br /> This plot is an ancient army of dragon driven by a huge snake that will destroy the world, until I do not think there is a heir to some selected heroes. What is the responsibility? Become one with one ?? A good dragon ?? Or something ?? I do not know. It was so stupid, I was not bothered to try so much to maintain it. <br /> <br /> This is a real stupid story about ridiculous moments and stupid concepts. So many incidents just felt completely random and suddenly. <br /> <br /> I think studio interference or something was the reason my biggest problem with the movie is that the story seems like it may be grand and epic, yet everything is so fast and so fast. I think I have been hit with a million plot point and verb sequence of a big ball. The face of the movie is like a punch. It does not take much time to make characters or plays. Imagine the "ring lord" triangle in 90 minutes ?? You can have a majority of the epic war sequences but there will be no build up and you will be less concerned about the outcome of those wars. That was the case with the Dragon War ?? It's not a bad thing for 90 minutes, waiting to wait. <br /> <br /> It's hard work to get some pretty cool CGI instructions, but awesome acting, fast pacing, and stupid stories to enjoy in any way. I probably liked it when I was 6 years old.
