I hate this picture of 13 years old and the worst movie in the world, I completely ruined my time when I saw it, and I was frustrated because of the look that was pretty good on the cover and behind, but I was wrong with her. But when I saw Delta, she was a totally different and bad actress, and I did not really understand how old I was because I was so confused. The film was a bit confusing and I did not enjoy it, but I saw all the movies I saw to see if it was getting better, but it was not, it was boring, lazy and I said BORING.And I do not think many other people find it Like it My annoying boring
