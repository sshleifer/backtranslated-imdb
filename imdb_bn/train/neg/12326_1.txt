A woman (Silvia Krisel) seduces the 15-year-old son (Eric Brown). They are sex ... but it's all stuck in stupid plot or something. <br /> <br /> One of the most annoying sex comedies is easily. Does anyone feel the light of this film in the light of children? I think it's okay because it's a teenage boy - if one of us is seducing a teenage girl, there will be anger (right) there. Sorry, but it's not a excuse to make a boy done. It's still sick. I was in the age of Brown (18 when he was actually made) but he looked at 15. I'm just annoying that some people find this just right. Acting sucks aside (Kristel is beautiful - but I can not act; Brown easily saw me as an actress of the worst child) And endless nudity becomes annoying and not even a distant lover. <br /> <br /> I saw this drill in 1981 a theater back With 19 years and my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass for 18). She wanted to see it - I did not, but what did I decide? We got and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously less. The idea of ​​my cousin was annoying and three kids went half way! Let me make it clear - three tennis kids have left a movie with several women's nudity! That would give you an idea of ​​how bad this is. I am surprised that this was ever released. A 1 all the way.
