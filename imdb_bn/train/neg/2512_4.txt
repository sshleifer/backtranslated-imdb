Tim Robbins, here, is astonishingly humorous, filmed as a garage mechanic in New Jersey, who turned into Albert Einstein's nephew and fell in love with Behya Blond! Although he is mostly on screen, Robins canceled the fines in his intense personality and in the background (it's easy to forget even in the film!). Geometrical romantic comedy, which is playing with Walter Martha Einstein (what he can do with cartoonist fantasy characters). Otherwise, it is sweet and sunny, rather directed by Fred Schepisi rather slowly, who looks at the heart but no intelligence or brain. Meg Ryan is very much like her self-esteem, and she and charming chemistry between Robinson and her older brother. ** **** to
