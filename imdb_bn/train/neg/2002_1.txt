Perhaps a light-handed camera was used to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started to start speed-sickness after seeing it. It seems that someone has captured the camera with cerebral palsy (cp is not a crime for patients, but I do not think you expect to get as much work as a cinematographer!) The camera work is so annoying and so confusing that my wife and I think it is unknown And leave it after 10 minutes of torture. I tried again after a while (it was shown on TV), and it was not well earned. I suggest you miss this one miss unless you get rid of any bad sushi that you can eat!
