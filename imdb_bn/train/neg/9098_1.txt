Some movies may go directly to the video, and obviously it is obvious that if the theater audience is very naughty for it, then they are released directly on the video. Of course it is good that movies will not be fair and still they will be released directly on the video. The film is played with good actors or at least actors but it is not an exception: Amy Adams (Oscar nominated and talented actress), Robin Dunne, who deserves a good or at least a good agent, and Sarah Thompson is a departure from the teen melodramas who asserts the role. The film also has been misunderstood: This movie happened before cruel motives, so this movie is really a preview and stupid than that. It's a waste and it's really a film that is in the same level as soft-core porn and pay-per-view masturbation movies. Thankfully for the actors, hopefully they can remove it from their resume. So if you want to see something naughty, then do not get the courage to buy porn but rent this movie as a starter.
