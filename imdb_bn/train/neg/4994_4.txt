Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch anyway, but sometimes you are not in the mood for it. <br /> <br /> I want a little easier, when I saw it, there was no easy task at all. It was good to start and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. Finally the movie has lost its credibility. The storyline was not that impressive, the action was not very special, but it was fairly well, the acting was right, so more than just fulfilling my needs. But everything was broken because something happened that was upstairs, and it gave me a bad feeling. They tried a bit more to make everything believable and found a 7 in the category "No Idea Only Simple Steps". So in conclusion if you know that you will get annoyed because things seem to be totally irrational: do not look! Otherwise I would like to proceed ...
