I could never start this movie, and stop seeing after 3/4. I really miss the last botched. This picture was frustrating because it could be a lot better. It had excellent atmosphere, a top notch throw and director, good location. But a Baaaaad story line, a bad script. I paid attention to Kenneth Brangh's southern language - it was better than the script. The plot was stupid - driven by the characters acting vague and impossible ways. Anyone outside this Hollywood script behaves this.
