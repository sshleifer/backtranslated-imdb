I did not know this movie soon after watching this blade: Trinity, I was roaming around the Trinity board when I saw some users that the Wes Craven series is much better than 'curve', so I'm blood. My quick research: Check the scores of IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes for Dampakulara: Ascension, and with the search I discovered that it is a sequel to Dracula 2000. I noticed that one of the strongest follow-up in the Wes Craven Dracula Board was for this movie which I saw was the bigger conflict. <br /> <br /> Now let's quickly repeat it here. I remember Dracula 2000, and I do not like it much, and then saw Dracula's scores: Ascension reduced my expectations, but again, I'm like someone who needs to watch the real movie (any movie) so that I can make my own opinion. <br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie, I knew that it was a low budget, so for this I am going to ignore many V / FX and it seems to be compensated by stories and acting, I Some of the film's castings (Jason London, Ray Shaidar and Jason Scott Lee) were a little imprinted by <br /> <br /> Oh giz ?? This movie was Cheyasi! But Chesy may be at least entertaining, I find it pretty striking, bad audio sync from some re-recording of the conversation in the scene, the stupidity of this film character. Surely they all knew vampires and some basic things, even Luke was a book, but did they not want to be 'infected' deliberately? No, it's the worst slashher flicks then where the girl has to hear from the shower and heard the sound heard with something more than a toilet. <br /> <br /> I must be blinked at some point, because I'm not sure how Dracula got her body cloth, especially since she is wild and angry and if I am in this condition, then I want to wear her No <br /> So the movie ends with a triangle middle film ?? Not that, instead it's a 'cliff hanger' where I'm going to wait for the third theme 'succession'. Hey Chaisi movie entertainment value!
