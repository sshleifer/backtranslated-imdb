This film is really done in poor taste. The script was really bad. I am really sorry for Gregory Pecker, who plays the title role of this B-Movie adaptation to the greatest generals in history. The film was politically incorrect, and it was disrespectful to others to fight against the Japanese in World War II. There was a scene where I was roughly opposite, it showed McCarthy that he spoke to a banker on the Corridor island as a fundamental politician when he was a wounded, a legged Philippine soldier. The soldier directs to see the general bleeding and death of the general and says: 'No father, no mother, uncle uncle' and McCarthy has given his small pep talk that America will never leave the Philippines. The scene is inspired by McCarthy's words and gives him a smart salute. I mean, if the United States is seen as a great white savior, the scene of a great scene, please tell me why it takes a cake. It shows that Filipinos are the daughter of honor and daughter, and only to Americans, to rely on free Americans. This was contributed and deliberately contributed by members of the United States military forces (United States armed forces forces), the Filipino volunteers had gathered in the US Army during World War II, who died alongside America in the fight with America. Japan, who left alongside Americans along with Baton's death and McArthur went to Australia, defended Corregidor Island by launching a guerrilla attack by his famous 'I'll be back' speech. My late grandfather, a Filipino World War II veteran and USFFH soldier, who fought with Japan with respect and love to the country. I think this movie does not respect them and thousands of others. McArthur's Lit relies on intelligence preparation for his famous return to the golf landing.
