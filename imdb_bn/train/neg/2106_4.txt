Bela Lugosi is as cool as normal but the movie is nothing compared to Dracula. Probably he played the perfect part in this film, but a legend like Ludosi can not save the film's perception and the film does not set the mood very well, like the old vague horror movie. Even in its worst times, baler movies are only moderate.
