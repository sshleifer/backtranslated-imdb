Apparently interesting, but the elementalities fall flat. Tactics wear thinner after fighting these tiring exercises. Burnt toast has charisma, but in its defense, I included some of the worst conversations ever seen on the Big Screen. The script is so poor that it keeps you out of the film, and I think about the work, the bill, my dog ​​etc. There are many moments that shout bluescreen. Paltrow is as wooden as they get. It has been stored in the graduate film Nir dialogue or the top camp. My only complaint in this way is that black and white films (sorry, computers) will help because it looks like Turner is black and white, Just a big dull cliché mess. I would rather break my femur than this patience test again.
