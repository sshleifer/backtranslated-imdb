The movie is annoying, the characters and the scenario are unreal, incredible, action is ridiculous. This movie is a big mess. It seems almost when action kicks the music, the most impressive stunt is running. Voice with Mr. McGregor was dubbed or Steven too used to sing more and it changed his voice. This movie has a lot of dialogue and everyone has a very bad performance. The movie is also great sleep therapy. The fight is ridiculous. The effect of the shape of the eye on the addictive female drug addict drug addicted was moderate. Chief villain was a joke and his character was badly developed. The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation, he is only going to supply "random water plots" (mocking) "CTX (his designer drug)", which will not be even mentioned in the conclusion or even mentioned in the film again. This movie is highly recommended to pass.
