All the bare chested women in the world could not prevent me from scoring one-third stop button with this trash. With lazy acting, matching equally scary script plus poor CGI FX; This movie is a violation of the Weirolf style. It is considered to be serious, it can be fun if it gets fun. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where the people behind the camera are probably capable but even a quarter is too lazy to do decent things. Avoid all costs and instead see one of the classic Wehrland movies. <br /> <br /> 10 out!
