Salvage is the worst so-called horror film I've ever seen. There is nothing terrible about this far. It does not deserve to be fine so fine. First of all I do not see how much people can think of such a big movie shit. If I write something annoying and ridiculous, I will be disappointed and be ashamed to make others fool. Second: The acting is terrible and the main actress is unexpectedly ugly. Third: The story is lost, it has been used earlier and it is not an excuse that is an excuse. Read the summary behind the case, it reveals the whole story. I do not advise you to watch this movie until you have 80 minutes to do something that would cause you to regret it. I feel really bad for those crooks and annoyance of their names. All Holes Anthony Perkins !!!!!!!!!
