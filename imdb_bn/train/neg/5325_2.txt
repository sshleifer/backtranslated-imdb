The critics of Poland must be a feminist, because he considers "Young Catherine" a great film and historically correct. Nothing could be more from the truth. As a Russian historian for many years, for many years, I've been exceptionally aligned with YC in almost every room, and especially politically correctly as its signatory boss who led to the transfer of sole authority to Russia. The truth? To be his wife and mother, he was just brought to St. Petersburg, and found that he had to live with divirians, boys and the military. As long as he does not challenge them, he will be able to fill his heritage with cultural heritage (industrial fame etc.). There is so much evidence that he is not "great", but the proof of modern revisionism of this modern post is not very popular. YC is just another costume drama, a bit of Teddy Turner's Fleft, which was a painting of how bad the West painting in 1986 was like "Peter the Great".
