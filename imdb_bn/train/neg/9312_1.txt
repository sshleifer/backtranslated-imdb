The worst movie in the world. I do not even know where to start, but I hope I can save someone else from punishing myself with this movie. When it comes to acting and lighting, this movie is very similar to bad porn without sex. Some of the actors I've ever seen are bad, and they may not be bad even if they try to make the whole movie full of fun. The film was certainly a broken budget low budget, which I definitely had almost lost in the movie cover. This movie has now become an ongoing joke with my friends and has become the standard to compare other garbage movies. I would like to point out that any other movie even starts to compare. I personally am personally responsible for advising a friend and I see this movie and I am surprised that he also treated me as a friend even after the pain that he gave me. Do not watch this movie!
