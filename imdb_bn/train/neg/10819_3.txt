I agree with the good story and other commentary about good actors but agree, and I said ran. The book in school is about 24 years old after reading it. But I felt that when you want to know the story of Jane Array, it will need to be seen because the bits are left and so it does not fully understand. For example, Jane and Mr. Rochester have talked very little and suddenly they are suggesting marriage !!! Actors do not have time to tell the audience how their character feels about each incident in the story. Actors are good but this story is not enough time to judge. I'm sorry to say it, but I did not really enjoy this version. The 1970s edition of Susana York and George C Scott, I would like to have Jane Eyre Cinema, but you can check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Jella Clark and Timothy Dalton played two main roles. I love it a lot, I see it regularly. Full version for 225mins or 330mins which is a short version.
