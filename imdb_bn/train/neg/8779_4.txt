As a filmmaker, White Noyez was very good at filmmaking, well-lit, nice camera work, reasonable side. But as a film it seamed as predictable as the other 'so-called' horror movies that have been in the recent flood in the market. Although it was a bit 'chill factor', the entire concept of EVO (electronic voice phenomena) does not seem to be reliable. This film did not explain the reason for some incident, but continued with them. Acting could not impress the main character, which does not portray any emotion as many recent thrillers / horror films. <br /> <br /> Of course, I will not buy the DVD and no one will recommend it to watch. .
