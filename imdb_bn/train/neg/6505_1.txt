A confused mess from the beginning. They like to talk about BeatlesCams, if you give LP, it was a secret message. If the scenes of these movies have patience to see the scenes from the end, you will be disappointed with the same frustration. <br /> <br /> Besides these psychedelic hajj pajas of flashbacks and false starts, the backgrounds of the movie were the Callist carrier, if they could not delete the movie for revenge. There was nothing like this about these two. The comedy book is distributed in fashion, screaming and threats. I think one dimensional was an overstatement. <br /> <br /> Unlike their like that, so the kind of artist is upsetting their eyes, we do not get it just plebeians. Well I was afraid to get anything. And from the beginning to the end, no bad movie has two major sins. An existential and kind-hearted story line if you want to call it, and as far as the worst, single character you're not least taken care of.
