Sure I've seen bad movies in my life, but it was so bad that I was really angry with the theater. I wanted to return my money. I wrote to the director to ask to return my movie ticket, of course I did not get back (or even an answer), but this is the issue. On the 1-10 scale I gave this movie A-42. Why "Zip" (Chevy Blazer ??) break from hitting a bat? Why did they hit "Zip" (Chevy Blazer ?????) instead of poking the left crane? The plot was thin, the film was obviously full and some parts of it just did not give any idea.
