Well, it's hard to add comments after reading what's here but I think I must say something. I was not exactly looking for 'splatterfest' because someone kept it or even 'blood and throat'. I respect the relatives of the hunters though I do not really feel filmmaker. - They were unnamed, faceless and meaningless. <br /> <br /> I found this picture interesting enough to think, 'Who can be a serial killer?' Besides, I have a clear idea about the story of Dahmar, which I know very little about. Here people think that the story of the story of Dahma in the movie has not been covered. Its history, what happened to what happened, subsequently, etc. But it is important! You see, I guess American would know all this if you have. We do not all live in America. For example, to tell this story about a man, at least some history and actual events have been shown / shown. It means money and not the meaning of emptiness, in a movie there are ways to show intimidating things or make smart films without excuses. Without touching what he did (I learned more about reading user comments on this site!), The film seemed to be ineffective. A moment of time with very little substance. I want to know if there is a movie about Truth Dahmah, because of its lack of direction, the pace that does not change very slowly, the strange illustration of homosexuality and ultimately the unfortunate lack of an endeavor, this movie is Pohor. I will not recommend anybody that they waste time watching it. A specific 1 in 10 (for acting!)
