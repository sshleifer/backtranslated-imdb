This movie is a decent effort by Spike Lee. He is capable of doing more than this movie. When he goes officially against racism, he does nothing but Barrett White and reduces blackness. A group of black men traveling on the bus in March of millions of people of Louis Ferrakan, the plot of this movie. Among the people of the bus you can imagine: Gay, Muslim, Gangbangar and Uncle Tom (although he is left out of the bus). There were only white people on the bus. Minutes he was charged as racist for going to the bus. He was a Jew and he explained that the situation became racist and left the bus. I do not want to say it, but these films have to understand the RanPhotos of their own Hippersi and stereotypes. It should not be seen as a win but as a sad dissapointment. You can think I'm racist for this writing but I mean better. Good luck next time Spike.
