Zoo Warriors must of course have an animated series because it is seeing the old enam of acid as a movie. The movie does not just start from anywhere, and people just wander in combat with metal wings and other stupid weapons until the princess is sacrificed for herself. Her lover in a cloud or something. This princess is beyond me in a god or an angel but soon after this flying wind comes to bad guy enough bad guy and some other mysterious god / giant / wizard thing with the razor bird is not the plot plot line or it is very difficult to follow. You have to be very intelligent to get this movie. This plot soon follows the Chinese body, which calls for evil flying through this god, the princess kills the bad people, and soon we are like a very bad dancer on a mountain like a Bowl or a complete battle scene with deadly martial arts. Even the visuals can say something strange that they are great and colorful but I say they are like blurry and acid trip (yes it's a word!). I saw it with both dubbed and subtitles, and both were equally bad and hard to understand .... I was crying because I did not understand it. It felt like me. Watching 30 episodes of 1980's animation and how the story started and I started to start the comic series 4, because I had no idea where I started the story where it started and how it would end. Full time I can honestly say that this was the worst movie experience ever seen in the 134 drunken moment Inu-Isha ... Yes, well you do not know what you know. Do not waste your brain, the brain is trying to find out.
