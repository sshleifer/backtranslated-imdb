Do not get confused with this review of the Wizard, Weiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a late-eighty film that can play a serious silent boy while playing video games and walk through full opening credits. Unnecessary updates to the Wiz's Wizard of Oz and Mr. Wizard is the person who linked 100 strokes together and some babies have drank it. <br /> <br /> Now that we've all got out of the way, tell me this: There is no reason to see this movie. It's just a 100 minute Nintendo commercial that is designed to capitalize on Powerlove, The Legend of Gelda and Super Mario Brothers. I use the word "design" in very little sense, because it seems that this movie was written on a weekend weekend. The guys who did not play Nintendo broke up, and style less than my grandmother, driven by a man. Maybe the writer and the director could sit and play some games, they could understand that they were going to take pictures on roughly mobile phones and instead went to vocational schools to learn to install a car stereo. <br /> <br /> Hope this has an enlightened experience for you. It has not been for me sure. Actually, I think I've lost some brain damage in seeing this movie and writing about it. The next time you will be in the video store and you will see Weis, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz, it's sitting on the sand in a beautiful little row, miss them all and instead play duck hunt.
