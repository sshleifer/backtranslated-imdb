The name of the main character (the French) is the German word for "woman". I do not know whether or not it was deliberate, but definitely last year the Fantasy Film Festival received some giggles from German viewers, when it was shown. <br /> <br /> But these were the only giggle movies. It was not the target of Giggs, it's a horrible movie for Heaven! Multiple meaning is a horror movie It is a shame that the audience fell in love with such helpless moments (definitely not for heart's weakness !!)! And it was not even necessary to show all the things that were shown. I am not even going to moral obligations (because there is no such work or effect in movies) for the discussion of what has been shown here, but it has been a whole new level of "torture movement" which has increased in the last few years!
