This has got to be the cheesiest, stupid, most retarded giant film all the time. It is a complete joke that even surfaced in the theater. In rural America, people like to look at the neat giant. This movie is worth throwing in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, you shame. People involved in this Moroccan heap of trash need to be lobotomized. Wait, maybe I give them a lot of credit. I was sure that they were lobotomized before filming. How can one else explain the stupid and sheer stupid that has this bucket in brace. Do not waste a minute of your life to see this. Do not waste time even sending a review.
