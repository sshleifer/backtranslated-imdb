Do not make me wrong, I think this movie will be stupid, I've done the right thing, I've given an incredibly low value to fill it. The only reason I saw it even though was a bunch of girls (different stories for a different time). When I started to see I noticed something, this picture was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, Freddy v Jason is terrible, where you and your friends sit back and laugh and joke about how terrible it is, and then there is such a movie. Hat cat failed to create a momentary interest in me. I saw it the first bit only I was bored knowing, but I felt that there has been some way violation by the horrendosness of the movie. Mike Maera is usually bright, I love her most of the work, but the movie did not click anything. The things that have changed in the director / producer / writer / voters are that they refused to use any of the original books (red, black, white) on any character, but the cat In conflict or not, they refused to capture any of the original (and I hate using this word, but this is basically genii). The book was like an ice cream on a Sunday, colorful and delicious, and the movie was melting and hard like dusty. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
