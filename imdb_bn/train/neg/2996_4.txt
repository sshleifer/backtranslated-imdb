Bourne is again a sub-standard episode from a season. It deals with rebirth issues and just does not fly. I have not been reborn bigger and may be part of my indifference toward this episode. This refers to the case of the Tooms, which has some nice continuation from the previous episode. But the positive ends there. Which is unfortunate because it is done at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ridiculous that a dead man will choose to rebuild a fully related girl's body. And at the beginning of retaliation, she waits at eight years of age. There is a serious lack of stupid Mildred and school dialogue to maintain the episode. If you are in rebirth, perhaps this phase is your lane up. If you are not, then at least you can learn what BradCardia is.
