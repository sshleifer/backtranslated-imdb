Superdome is one of the movies that makes you wonder why it is made. The whole plot is trying to rob Supernob and has expressed concern about all efforts to stop them. How did Tom Seleck and Donna Mills survive? However, the most frustrating thing about it was that there was no football in it! Avoid this one if possible.
