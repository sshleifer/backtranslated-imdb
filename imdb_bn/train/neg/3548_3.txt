Those who like frustration characters with frustrating characters and a playful tale, it's for you! From the silence of the New York City atmosphere, which is seen as a very deadly and almost hopeless place, apart from many moral values, two diverse lead characters, this film is truly free. <br /> <br /> Why did it win the Academy Award, because its brand New York was so frustrating that it wanted to celebrate the event that the Hollywood wanted to release the moral codes they wanted. The filmmakers of that time were like an unlimited cost account of a six-year-old local candy store. So, seeing the viewers of Hollywood theater (probably for the first time), rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds, it seems to be objectionable to his brain brain ..... <br /> <br /> I also hope that I am sure to disappoint mainstream audiences. Well, that has succeeded at that level. The audiences were surprised by what they said and heard, and the academy was proud to make itself proud and earn money at the same time, but could not help, but guild trash can honor this piece. <br /> <br /> Forty years ago, as a young boy, I thought this movie was very interesting. However, seeing this again in the 1990's, such a bad taste spread in my mouth and I never saw it. <br /> <br /> The acting was good, but what is it? Many movies are good in acting. Nobody ever said that Dustin Hoffman and John Voight did not work. Huffman was very good at young people playing in his little days. He was like the father of his era, playing the movie "Ratso Rijo" and later becoming "Rain Man". Yes, "ROSO" is a character that you will never forget and "JoeBack" (Voet) that you want to forget, but the story is so weird, it embraces fine acting. <br /> <br /> This movie is not "art" and it is not worthy of many awards; In 1969, it only pushed the big time of the envelope, and this is why it is so memorable in the hearts of filmmakers and critics. It's two hour horrific and ultra-lazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets the law - no surprise), and usually disappointed people. <br /> <br /> I like interesting songs, "Everyone's conversations helping Harry to make Nelson famous", which even helped make Harry Nelson famous, even Fred Neil wrote this song and it did well, before Nilsson ... and some people heard blue (which was their loss) and - as mentioned - the name "ROSO REJO" is with you! <br /> <br /> This image A landmark, but in the negative sense, I was scared: it was marked as "official" that went down to the Hollywood toilet, and it remained in sewer already from it.
