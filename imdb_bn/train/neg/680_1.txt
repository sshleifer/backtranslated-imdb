I finally caught up on the television "Starlight" last night and I can say all that. . . How nice! It is difficult to know where to start - Incredibly the special effects of Hawkeye (inspire the laser beams from the eyes of Willi eye!), Indecent acting, scholarly use of the dialogue, stock footage, or intense cruelty infuses the entire production. This is a kind of experience and we all should be grateful for it. I choose Jonathan who is the real heir of Ed Wood!
