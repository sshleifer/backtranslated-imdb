I actually saw this movie in the theater in the original publication. Peter vendors were painful to see themselves as bad. The story was incredibly lame and hard to follow, and the end was ridiculous. Seeing how the Almighty fallen was just sad. I will not say that I am a big seller of a big seller, but I thoroughly enjoyed the Pink Panther series and I felt that he had strong performance in there. But this image should not have been created. From what I read, he tried to make this image against the advice of people around him. Fine, but the fact that the studio really released the film is not really excuse.
