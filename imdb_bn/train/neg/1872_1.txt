Caution This movie is such a mess. This is a disaster. Do not waste your time with this one. I warn you! <br /> <br /> Acting, story, dialogue, music ... basically everything is upstairs, it is absolutely annoying and ridiculous. It wants to throw me away (if not dialogue / acting / story, everyone is being hacked). You would think you are watching a comedy. The problem is, that part of the supposed fun is not even funny. Acting, story, cinematography, you can feel that everything is trying very hard - but it does not succeed. Behind every shot is practically, but what? This movie just feels like a student film. They suddenly shot this image in HD, because it would be waste to spend more money to shoot in the film. <br /> <br /> If you play easily or do poor acting, writing, editing, directions, full checks, everything is in your mouth, oh I mentioned poor performance? (Well, in fact, it's not the fault of all actors - it's director!) Then I think you like this movie. <br /> <br /> I had to see it for a class. If I could, I would stop it. If you still can not say right now, I have taken this movie. It wants to throw me out and get back on my time ... at least I do not have to pay for this garbage. <br /> <br /> Jeff Gold Bloom, you know ... The man from the Jurassic Park / Independence Day is in this movie, but he definitely undoubtedly wants to take a role for films like this encouragement.
