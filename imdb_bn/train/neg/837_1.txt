I saw and really loved the first two lots. Especially the second reason is not simply trying to create another as well as the first one. And it's a story standing alone. You do not need to know the first movie. I liked the "Free Willie" movies too. <br /> <br /> Third, it's absolutely useless here! I tried it with a friend of mine because we both liked the first two. We decided to stop after a good half an hour. The movie is okay, there are fun parts. But for what? In the first two films, Timon and Pubu were the fun animals. Lion King 1 1/2 for me: It is a hard effort to get more fun than the first movie, as well as tell the story from their point of view. But for what? I really want to know. You know, the idea of ​​sitting between the first two films of them is really nice. But what comes later is mostly unnecessary. I think many people like Timon and Pumba, and so I really do. Yet, for me, many parts were created to try to be fun. No chance, it was mostly fun, at least for me. BTW. Whatever was the movie? Is this a) timon and pumba or b) an effort to get more fun from the first movie? I'll choose an alternative bot and I'm very frustrated about it. <br /> <br /> If you want to see the stories: "Story behind the xy", you can see Tom "Rosenthal and Guildenstein Day Dead". Stoppard with Team Roth and Gary Oldman It's really fun and it does not try to get even more from "Hamlet".
