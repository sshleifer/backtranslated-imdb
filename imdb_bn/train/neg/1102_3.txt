First of all, I must admit that I saw this director both films I saw without title and so could miss the point. My check is not bad, but sitting through two movies, I did not try to learn by the way. Samotri is very cool The way is very cool. This is the line of ten different stories that weave together and out. This is not so deeply unusual in Prague's size (deep, really.). The main characters are between 20 and 30 characters. They got jobs and only one study. The best character is the young boy's girl. Curse pertaining to her feelings is echoed by immigrants here. About it Only great character. Everyone else is making their own fire in their own lives. How can I sympathize with this obvious disability? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but I need another stereotype in the film? If you want good music, check out this picture. If you want to smile at others folly, see this picture. If you like satirical and dry humor, do not see an imitation of an original Jarmusch. And under no circumstances do you enjoy Homophobic stereotypes since Ondreiscen's film, Sepage (Whisper.) See.
