I do not want to go on a rant here, but ..... it's the worst "film" I've ever seen. Worse than Avengers. Disabled guides, unmatched text, and horror acting are the only consistent elements across. Sounds on very cheap video, it's like a high school project, but without passion. The light often looks like a sun-gun. The camera is slightly better than the camera's single microphone, but something else about this thing is simply awful. Without the basis or the next resolution, the plot closes in strange ways, the technology elements are unreasonable and the edit looks worse than rough cut. It's not good enough to be fun. It's just bad. BTW, packaging deliberately confusing. <br /> <br /> The lion's gate gave me $ 4.00.
