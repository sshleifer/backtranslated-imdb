This movie will be promoted to improve the mind. Read a book! It is unbelievable that anyone who thinks this movie is worth the time and investment. I saw "B" movie before but the movie "C" was discovered. I do not think I will enjoy the Power Ranger just after watching my kids, but I found myself in the "Knights" post about 15 minutes of video. High school production should be better than this and this should be removed from their resume involving acting. One of the many details that come to be embarrassed is one. My roommate, those who love this type of movie also close it. Now that's really something you have to say. If you watch this movie and like it, then I will pray for you.
