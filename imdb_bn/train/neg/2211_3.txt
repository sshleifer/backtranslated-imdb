Hahaha !!!!!! Funny - upload this image to a single word. What was this "thing", since it could use the movie? !!!! I hope directors, writers, and producers do not mean that it can be good because it is not confirmed !!! A scientist dragged his son toward a hammock shark and shark killed a bunch of invited people on the island! !!! Gooooodoodddd !!!! I hate this picture so much that when I was watching it, I smiled at all the critical part because they were so crazy and unusual ... and they did not seem shark more unrealistic, even though most of these "things" There was a bigger budget than that. I would like to say that this movie is expected to make bad acting and fools laugh at intelligent conversations, because if you expect a good movie then it will be 'very disappointed'.
