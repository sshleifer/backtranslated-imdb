Slow, slow, slow ... There is no mystery or excitement in this film. If you do not recognize "joke" in the first ten minutes, you must have brain brain. Secret service was also, because it took the whole movie to keep them together. There are no compelling characters in the film (no film). There is no tension in the speed of the film. Tenant killer is an excellent shot where he does not notice Michael Douglas, that it is he can hit the big pants of the glass. The most fun scene in the movie when the President's wife is called the anticlimatic ending code. It's ridiculous to laugh out loud. At least six people got up and left the movie. If I did not sit in the middle of the row, I would have joined them. I will not recommend anyone on this photo.
