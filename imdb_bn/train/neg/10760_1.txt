This "film" is about the end of all that bad about the modern film. Unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary flipping / jumping / somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue .... basically unnecessary. (A word that? Well, it's just invented, robot.) <br /> <br /> What happened in reality? (Such as car garage, skin spray) is the only tool that shows the combination of future and realistic functions that swip the card into a coffee shop. <br /> <br /> What is reverence for women? (That is, Smith's character does not diminish the doctor for a better part of the film, and yet he "wants". Where is the tension? I will tell you, looks good, not appreciated or ordinary ground) <br /> <br /> is a detective What do you recognize? Smith was not busy and expressed regret for himself, complained to other people, and when he said something that had spread a thought, it was closed. This is a crippled way to get the story from the point BCD-etc ... It was once correct, but not in queue several times. (Talking several times in a row, "I'm not a graduate and you do not hear jokes? Twice in a scene?) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " He knows Smith ... .. so for the course we should take care of him and he came to harm, Make sure, <br /> <br /> What has happened to the hero? Let's just forget that the robots are attacked by people, women and children everywhere and only save them selfishly. His bike had to be run through the air, it was shown that when the doctor was able to reach the same distance within a few seconds of boiling. <br /> <br /> I am wrong Ujhi No, I'm not a visitor. But I'm for the roots of truthfulness and money. <br /> <br /> I did not say I'm in a film I never laughed so hard in a long time. So thank Alex. <br /> <br /> I pray for the easy way of swinging social pendulums, simple stories and everything else in movies ... but it is mainly simple technique. <br /> <br /> Big Budget Action Films: "You Will So Die"
