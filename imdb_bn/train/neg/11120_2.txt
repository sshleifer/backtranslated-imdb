<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, for several years, I lived in most of the pictures illustrated in this film; Racial tension was high, and basketball meant everything for everyone. A movie about this "basketball culture" could have been very interesting, but middle-class medium and poor script could not be left to work. <br /> <br /> The sequence of movie events is chakraborti. First, lost money to play a game of delivery or basketball. Then he returned home and lounges around with his girlfriend; And the process is repeated. Most of the stories are made up to a climax in any way, but "climax" was another sequence of this recurrence (in this case "delivery or losing money playing basketball game"). <br /> <br> For the development of a plot, some hesitation must be resolved; And if the film is going to be striking, this hesitation must be of course interesting. Obviously the author of White Men can not forget this rule, because the plot is summarized as "delivery bill must be paid." I appreciate the change in the speed of other cinematic movies, but - sorry - it was just common. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some of the rival sports fans will be dismissive of the terrible writings for a few scenes with a basketball in them. Others, I'm sure, had played the leading role lured by the big name. It makes me amazed that if the cast is completely replaced with old unknown actors and the basketball theme is replaced with lacrosse, would anyone be bothered to see this movie? I really do not think so. <br /> <br /> I will give this movie two stars out of ten; Extra star "hazard!" The scene, which kept me awake for a few minutes. Thanks, Trebek
