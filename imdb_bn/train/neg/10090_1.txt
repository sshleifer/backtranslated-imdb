This is a joke in the movie. I mean a "ha ha" funny rig. Why? Because the only thing about it was ridiculous, silly, foolhardy and awesome acting. Wow <br /> <br /> There are many unanswered questions in this photo ... for example; Why are these women and zombies? Why is Zambaria's "caretaker" four black women and what is their purpose? Since 6 people make the "race" of the dead? And black eyes are smeared to mosquitoes, "curly" anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old <br /> <br /> and finally; Why is all of this movie made? Why? Why? Why? Do not answer? <br /> <br /> On the channel of this claim they issue the comment after the movie: We apologize for the movie "LOL, at least they had a decision to do so!
