The most awesome retelling of a great series It should not be called Batelaster Galactica, because it is the only name. There are just a lot of changes to change. In order to "attract female audience" you have all the characters from male to female, from black to Asian, all letters are transformed, while already strong female letters can become stronger. Has felt Egyptian feeling Searching for Earth The absence of cylinders to go to the cylinders takes away from the film, especially when someone creates a Femboot. Although the main event was supposed to have so much cheese, it is a big follow. They tried to follow this but did not give anything to work with fans, and basically they spit their face as their "own story". The changes are good, when they do something good, not just to make them.
