For the first time I must be honest before I fall asleep, so I can not fully comment about the film because I can not see it completely. Basically, a group of thieves, including Sid Carter (Syd James) and Arnie Brag (Bernard Bresll), plans to make a fortune to steal contraception medicines from the Finnish maternity hospital. Here is the title character of Matron (Hattie Jackson) staff member Sir Bernard Cutting (Kenneth Williams), Dr. Francis Guad (Charles Hawthorne), and more. Work with Prade (Terry Scott) and Nurse Susan Ball (Barbara Windsor). Patients and their visitors are also pregnant Mrs. TD (Joan Sims) and her nervous parents husband Mr. Very close with TD (Kenneth Connor) Freddie and Estender Wendy Richard starred Bill Maynard as Miss Willing. By the way this plan is not working by the way, because all the employees are walking the way. Until everyone can tell everyone about the movie until I see it completely again. OK!
