Apparently cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing garbage. Greenway's not even close to work. Avoid all costs! <br /> <br /> Overlapping 'split screen' effects are nothing more than confusing, the film is very dark for a long time and the 'artistic' image of the film is extremely extreme <br /> <br /> There is nothing to recommend about this image. ; Even nudity is incredibly inseparable, which becomes very annoying to see it soon. <br /> <br /> Plus, how can anyone say that the role of Ivan McGregor is brighter than me? He showed more skill in the Star War series, and something that's saying. <br /> <br /> I'm not so helpless with a movie I've seen in Darby Ogil and Little People!
