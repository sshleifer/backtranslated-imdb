Ronald Colman has won Best Actor Oscar for Best Actor Oscar, which, as popular stage thespian himself, is particularly lost from his role as Shakespeare's Othello. George Cooker praised the film critically by Roth Gordon and Gerson Cannin's predictable team. Unfortunately, the wicked tunes come off as self-aware here, and backstage business is overripe. Mickle Rozza also won an Oscar for his score, and there is a tough waitress for some fine moments of Shelley Winters (when the dramatic column notes him silently, he asks him, "Yes, what a little nuts?"). Otherwise, this scenario is quite obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. * **** to 1/2
