I'm not going to comment on it neutral, but you still have to do this to warn about the "Freddy Dead" movie. This is not just the worst section of the nightmare series, but it is there with the worst horror series of all time! It was boring, vain, and almost free of death. The horror 3-D finish and the most doable kill is enough to run this "film" on the ground. However, it does not stop, just bad acting, add a scary script, and several cheesy kaymoos and you've got this heaping pile that scatters yourself! Freddie, who always played in Freddy, has made the presence of two postmortem, no wonder. I like if I went out like that This is a strictly fans only movie, do not look at our shame.
