I am grateful for one thing and one thing - this woman will now be thousands of miles away on a completely different continent! Yes !!! This program has been completely determined how Victoria Beckham preached herself and her family in the media in the name of self promotion and was overwhelmed by 'Brand F @ Coking Bekham'. <br /> <br /> <br /> A few years ago. I really liked 'Poss and Beaks', I still feel the talent of David, but I have no respect for him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> happened in Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the truth that although he can earn a pound of pounds - he sells his soul for American speech and ends his day for a team that struggles to get publicity from Division One of England. - But you make rules in baseball and basketball - you do not football!) <br /> <br /> - I digress I've been looking at the amazing performance of 'Posh' for a long time - after Rebecca Lose's 'Frustration' it was the only top player in his crunching red carpet performance, when all the kriti * he was deserved for David, he leaned from his hands, Pound tried to marry money spinner. <br /> <br /> This full PR stunt was kind. Why can not she go quietly, her professional career supports her husband with the biggest mistake and keeps pushing her head? When he filled himself so seriously that he thought this huge fan of America would shake the rent? <br /> <br /> Eventually, I saw David Beckham's documentary last night. At least he has maintained a sliver of grace and humility. Two things can do with his wife learning. One other thing Victoria - you are constantly being accused of being hounded by paps. Little Hints - You fool off your tipping off somewhere about them. <br /> <br /> Good luck America !!
