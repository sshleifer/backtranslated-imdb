This program is really overrated Danny Pino's hat-headed character was transferred to "Robber Gun Team" several years ago. The whole squad is made up of the elite Omnionians, who judge people, whose activities lasted for several decades, according to the 2007 standards. Each Vietnam character has never turned into a murderer until it is another Vietnam veteran. There was only one black murderer, and he was placing it by his white boss. The only Hispanic killer was the "traitor of the nation" who killed another Hispanic (Naturally) committed to building a Hispanic street kid, two rich white children. What is a bunch of campaigns Hey, screenwriter: minority and poor people also kill. Only the most killer high-class white on this show. <br /> <br /> Those who committed crimes 50-60 years ago were a joke of the arrest of the people in the 70, 80, and 90s. No real life will cause pressure to kill DA, because it means that until the body is finally finished, the state will be stuck with their huge medical bills. The state is doing a favor on their family and insurance companies. The prosecutor will just make their claims for the unintended massacre and they will not serve a day. The only real culprit in prison is either organized crime statistics or former Nazi, whose high profile stances increase the career of the DA.
