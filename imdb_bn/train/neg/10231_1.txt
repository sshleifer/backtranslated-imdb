Frankly, I wasted nearly two hours of his first debut on Steven Smith's great review. Have they all been written by their pals? Along with action cluns, music is annoying and used, the script is easily terrible and the actress (except for the exception of soil) intermediaries I think our young filmmaker should support the effort, but it is not as bright as saying that it will never encourage the same mistakes, such as writing your own script and using the same actors for other initiatives. Yes, this is his first film, low budget etc. - I found it, but it is there for the purchase of public members and it's not just scratch.
