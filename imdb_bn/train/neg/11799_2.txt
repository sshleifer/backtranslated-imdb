This could be a good episode but I just had to stop it. The British representation clock was horrible. Before filming the makers have ever set foot in Britain? What is the minimum foot in England? I do not think any British person has spoken so much from the Royal Family Comedy Skit! Along with 2 English boys ... Well, I do not think any British boy played, talked or dressed like English kids in the history of British nation from the public presence of Prince William and Harry. American filmmakers have more than one country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .. 1 culture means! I can handle some stereotyping, but this was so bad I could not see it. The fire looked cool!
