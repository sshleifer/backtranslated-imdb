They have sex with melodies in Asia. <br /> <br /> OK. First, I suspected it, but after seeing the cloud disappeared, I changed my mind and finally believed that they had sex with watermelon, with dead or living people. Of course there is no safe sex. Later the lady shot the leading man (horrible ugly) in the face of her lady. Never heard of HIV? Do not guess. <br /> <br /> The rest of this movie is basically annoying, but incredibly rebellious. As a matter of fact, in some parts it was so disgusting that I could not close my virgin eyes. Sex with dead people! How is that fair? And what's the message behind it? We need water, we need melons, we have to be dead to have sex? Sorry, but these stinks!
