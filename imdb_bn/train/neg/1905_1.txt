I've reviewed more booster keton movies for IMDB than one of the biggest comedians and perhaps more than any other person. From the beginning of his career to 30 seconds each movie was made, I reviewed only with two exceptions, so you can say I'm a main fan. The reason for this is that I think this episode is so painful and hard to see. I liked the films of this guy and thought, "How are you, Buster?!" Well, now I'm thinking about it, I think why Booster Keaton played this horrible episode of this naughty area. After the filth of divorce in the early 1930s, she lost much of her fortune, and her film career as a leading figure was also prolonged. Now, in the 1960s Keaton needed this money and fell in love with her resurgence, so she wants to pay someone who wants to pay her - this episode of this episode of a great series, present in beach films and this mess. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem of the episode is that it is written very awesome and is much better than Buster. The show is considered to be fun, but instead of showing respect to silent movies, it is painful - especially Keaton with those stupid time travel helmets as well as all the poorly executed slopsticks. Make yourself a favor, skip this one - it's a pale imitation of the greatness of Keton's carrier !!!
