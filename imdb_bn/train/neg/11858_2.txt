I'm a fan of Matthew Modin, but this movie - which I imposed on the wire - is totally stupid. I have seen that the screenplay and the director were the same, so there was no one to test his worst instincts. There are no surprises, no original lines, and no original characters. Goldfish was originally the most sympathetic character. This is a waste of acting talent. How much of the film is costly in New York this day, I think how it has achieved the first place. And if you think that's why I saw it, it came after a movie that I just liked and left it when working on a computer. This is not a very demanding picture!
