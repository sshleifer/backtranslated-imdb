Love the original story, there was a lot of expectations for the film (especially Barker was busy with it in his interview), finally saw it and what can I say? It was a total MESS! Instructions were everywhere, the act was violent, the dazzling visuals and dance drama were only flat, empty and completely unnecessary (with genre music video techniques, slowly and steadily spreading slowly), this movie is not needed and MTV Mervyn Manson / Smashing Pappins / Playboy Music Video made VB cheaper T). Although some were killed quite calm and brutal, some ridiculously ridiculous (the first kill of Japanese girls was sunny and Ted Raimi's death was simply stupid fool). It just shocks all the way with zero drag and suspense, completely shifts away from the original story and then goes back to the last stage, which can only hug it to the zombie. No explanation was given, that means I knew what was going on, I would read the story, but for people who were not even more confusing sometimes I did not even know where it was going and what it was trying to do - it's full time in an insane tangent Was going God, I really wanted to like this picture because I loved the big fan of Barcar's work and the story because there is a lot of potential for a cracking movie, Hell I enjoyed some Kitturam movie as fun roms but this image The amateurs and the cylinders have been revived from the beginning to the end - I'm worried about somebody or something Not ilama, ran the whole thing was cut severely the actual source, turning it into something else entirely. It was funny and Vinnie Jones played a pretty Badass, but everything was all over, more frustrating. Burns
