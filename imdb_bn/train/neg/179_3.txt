Just returning to the cabin by the lake .... there was a lack. It certainly had very little budget because the fair amount of film should be portrayed with a regular video camera. So, in the same scene - you have some movie-quality camera shots and easy video camera shots. It makes for a very weird mix! I think they should find some ways to not influence the "home video" type! <br /> <br /> I think it's worth seeing, if you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you did not see the original CBTL ... you can not see it if you see it! It will probably feel too greasy way and even close to you from the care of the original one.
