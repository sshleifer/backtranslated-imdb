You think of the Spice Girls movie and how bad it was (besides songs), its director Simon Fuller (also the director of this band) kept the same picture of S. Club (another of my favorite bands) in their own film. S Club: Tina Barrett, John Lee, Bradley McKints, Joe O'Mear, Hannah Spirits and Rachel Stevens (What happened to the seventh member Paul Catmaughl?) Basically ask their boss for a break, they leave, and they watch their TV there. ! Three of them swap, and on the contrary, half of the invention they made was a greedy clone made by scientist, and the other half just got themselves hurt. Also played Gareth Gates as a clone of herself. This film can have more plot than Spice Girls' film, but there is no reason to see it as well as the songs "Bring It All Back", "Do Not Stop Movin" and "Never Hood a Dream at A True". For better split the band is not too long after. Enough!
