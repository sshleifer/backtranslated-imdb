My headline should be enough. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that a culture rich in literary excellence (Dumas, Flabbert, Balzac, Mapassent) will blow up tails like "novel obscure" cinematic movement. Until the 20th century, there was a great tradition of artistic clarity and clever philosophy of France. But in minutes you could transfer them to a movie camera, how I started acting like they do WooHOOO! Plot? Theme? Blasphemy or impatience sounds special! Let's ride a movie pound and a bird of noisy! At least it's not as bad as a guards (those who have an unhealthy look on the back of the human head.) Oh-Law-La, Cooy Artist. No, Truffaut maintains a degree of visual clarity. But security camera at a quickie-mart so. Both are different. <br /> <br /> Yes, your graduation film is absolutely sophisticated in school: I am coming out of your neck now. But do not go before reading the last sentence of my review. <br /> <br /> However, if you like French literature, you will hate this. Those who love this movie probably could not read any book other than Jack Karaoke's ramples or "Guide to the Hitler's Guide". Or maybe they can read the songs of Doors, and they think that it's running deeply. Whatever the ship floats the boat. I find it weird that this movie inspires Balzac to some (weak) emotions, one of the best and most meaningful writers ever to live. Nice try, Truffles But you are nowhere near to Ballpark. <br /> <br /> Avoid this image like AIDS-infected syringes. <br /> <br /> If you are like a person who you want to think about, please stick to Gene Kocetu (aka), Robert Bresnan (peakpoke) and Japanese Master Quresawa (IQuru), Kobayashi (Kedanan) and Teesigahara (Sunna Doonna ) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> TrueFoot, Goddard and Andy Warhol And ask for the stomach that your neck is relaxed. You look like a cabbage.
