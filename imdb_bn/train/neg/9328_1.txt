Lucky i I got a shiny peak from 'Brutal' Flickr of this cruel little shot-in-Texas a week before I hit the video shelf and told me ... I have rarely been so disappointed in my life that I saw this shocking megabaht fly from the railway Goes and stupid stupid full moon Fiasco Kilzoouier (I'm sure that many of us have suffered in the terrible fans N!) Stole the title of the 'worst killer shoes movie'. The DVD was shot, and it was not really looking at the worst quality of digital, but the boy failed miserably in any other region! <br /> <br /> is followed as the story (little and cliche as it is) ... an executive (produced along with K. Habbert, also director and script and director) Suspicious colleague Tracey (Amanda Watson) and horny married couple Mark and Susan (Han Fields and Chris Buck), a 'Yen' disconnected cabin from the nearest city, with a weekend holidays up to `12 miles'. On the way, they pick up a wicked / slutty hitchhiker (Melissa Bale) at a bar and end up at their destination, where one night campfire story comes true about a murderous shoe in the same dizzying area when every filthy-yakin, pot-smokin? Friends disappeared one by one, only the bursting puppets left behind telling stories of their fate. <br /> <br /> The killer cloth does not appear in the end, and it does not show anything like scattered images in the video box (as well as be morbidly obese). It basically spends around one hour prancing woods, blabbing around the woods and nursery rhymes. I can not say quite bad about Caste, especially the two and Hitachi's chick, who provide their intimate dialogue with at least warmth in the worst feelings or criticized in an inappropriate time. The script really does not help completely and completely regardless of mystery, fundamentalism, intelligence, general harmony or humor. I think how neutral I am this film, how consistent flaws are, and how much amateur I am producing, I can remember, but by raising the whole package I would say that the boy-this-<br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (Serial Insane Clown Killer). It is currently listed under GRIM Weekend (original title). <br /> <br /> Score: 1 out of 10
