Honey, I did not mention the boys franchise discipline was a huge deal and very famous. I love honey, when I was young, I shrank small boys. It was an original story and was such an exciting plot! The set was so amazing and they were thrilled like they enjoyed each other's company. Now honey, I made the child a fool, so I thought they wanted to go back to the story they liked. <br /> <br /> Generally, Adam is now bigger and mother is leaving their husbands with their children on holiday. But when Owen's favorite item is threatened for garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brothers get in the way. But when the wives forget to give their son some mood, then they are also caught in the machine, leaving the kids alone at home <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />, it was just a family movie that I think might be a little kick out. The original honey, I shrink the baby, I think everyone can agree. The third was not so bad, I would recommend it at least on the honey, I raised the Kid, it was at least fun. <br /> <br /> 4/10
