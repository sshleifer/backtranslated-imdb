My score for this shit: 1/10 is only for technical purposes. All others are very bad. <br /> <br /> Another picture that does not understand. It is obviously almost impossible to create a good script for film or television. <br /> <br /> It is easy to understand why politicians are never telling the truth, it is difficult to understand the biggest lies in the planet, making movies so cruel. <br /> <br /> We must certainly believe that people take it for granted. Perhaps it was the reason to believe that, since 99% of films crap. They are stupid and ridiculous and in very bad circumstances. <br /> <br /> When we look at the price we give the Oscars, we better understand why we make movies more ridiculous than others. <br /> <br /> And weird enough money was always meant for such meaningless money. But it was not for education and health. <br /> <br /> If you still want to hear this **, click the Super Fast Forward button (at least 20X).
