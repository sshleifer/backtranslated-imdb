I, like many people, saw this image in the theater when it first came in '97. It was the lowest average movie, not "masterpiece" in a brutal manner that this "Titanic" fanboys want to make it like this. First off, DiCaprio is no more a terrific actor, no matter how you look at it. People look at his face just like him. Her acting "skill" consisted of essentially trying to say a lot of sugar lines and to do sexy work. Secondly, the film was rather rather annoying and simple plot: The girl fell in love with the guy, she went to the ship on the ship, then there was a lucrative love scene. Anyone with an IQ above 50 must understand this in any way impressive. No it's original. Plus the manager feels required to pull it for 3+ hours. I could contract it in 1 hour block without losing any plot. In conclusion, the most overrated movie from the "Titanic" date. Why did it get so much attention and the money was surpassed by me.
