I was expecting the movie based on John Gardner's book Grandsle in the late 1970's. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the giant's perspective. <br /> <br /> Whatever you think of Gardner's book, a movie based on the Bauolf epic does not have to be owned by a grenelle, when it is not something about the giant, outside of a somewhat shy scene, CG CG is a modified hunter. Nothing is shown as At the top of the <br /> <br />, the writer should also be punished for giving the original story so badly and to contribute to the increasingly increasing ignorance of mass TV viewers in the United States. <br /> <br /> Usually this is wrong to get Hollywood. <br /> <br /> is very frustrating and time is wasted.
