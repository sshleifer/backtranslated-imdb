I can not really say bad things about this thing * or * something better. Its character is desired enough, it is properly produced and designed, and looking for professional (without that pinch giant case). However, there is no fundamentals, no ideas, and there is nothing that you have not seen in Allen, Predator, Armageddon and / or Outland. This is just another formula, cookie-cutter, "Rural Corporate Drone vs. Invisible Giant vs. Deep Places". A waste of time is quite a lot.
