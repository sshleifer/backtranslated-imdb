Roman Polanski made many films which are irrelevant. His reputation scoffs at me. Nothing higher than the high point except Chinatown (I did not see 'Water knife' or 'Tess'). Any contribution that he made to the movie twenty years ago; His work is just embarrassing, safe and / or lazy (Piano, French, Oliver Twist, Ninth Gate, Pirates). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a 1932 "horror" film-produced and fairly high concept (never seen the child) for the film. But these are just misconceived wrong mistakes in the wrong. Everything is so much that the plot line becomes very quickly clear (Um, thanks for that last and destructive title), and on a clear day you can see the package coming for the day. It did not maintain my interest. Whatever I do in this movie, the 1960s version is completely isolated by the culture of femininity. Faro is such a chronic confused, helpless wife / housewife. His misery is oversold ... He is extremely irritating. There is no real concept in it ... There is nothing other than Satan's mother to consider. <br /> <br /> Very rarely absorbed for the decoction.
