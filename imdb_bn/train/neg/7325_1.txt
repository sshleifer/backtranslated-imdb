It looks like the Hollywood actor, the Royal Shakespeare Company. How unhappy it is to see the movie. There was not a sufficient course of action to turn off the DVD player. I want to find people responsible for this disaster and surround them. I do not get back in that time. Ever. How is it possible to create a dishonest, annoying and soulless film? I could not think of any steps that would relieve the tidium. It is incredibly difficult for this disrespectful piece of film written in the required ten lines. Actually you can say no more than terrible repetition of acting. Please avoid.
