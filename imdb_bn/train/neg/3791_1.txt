I can not vote on this because I can not see garbage from these people. They got my money with another movie (Mr. Jingles) and I swore that it will never happen again. I think it's my civic duty to help people stay away from this trash. Go to this movie forum and see which members of Cast members are going to watch the film for the first time, they try to work. One person responds using even the same name! There are rocks in the forum that seem to be good for Shawshank Redemption and the citizen's ear ... not even locked (by no means). If this is the company's second film, it should be better than the first one. That means the third movie should be better. Not so, I saw it. I want to know how to distribute this trash all the time using the same name. It's okay to have fun with friends and make movies on holiday ... but do not try to market the trash market!
