(Review in English, Swedish is not allowed) <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie with very few expectations, and I can kindly let you know that the movie was only for them. <br /> <br /> As much as I liked to see Jane "Lufph" Karlson again on the big screen, the authors could have realized at the beginning of the script writing process that seven people are falling into the water, it is not original or fun. The story is very thin and used in jokes and is predictable, that is not just the usual annoying. I smile three times in the whole picture. <br /> <br /> The placement of Swedish Fenda products (oddly) is funny, why not just saying a big sign; "Findus it happened!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
