Again, a TV series like Charlie's Angels, Inspector Gadget and Thunderbirds turned into full-length movies and saw that it was destroyed for hundreds of people. Originally driving Hughard County's Duke cousin Luke (Johnny Naxville) and Bo (Sean William Scott), "General Lee" very quickly. But to build a huge amount of coal mine, Nadian Jefferson Davis 'Bose' Hog (nominated Razzie Bart Reynolds) to get their work together and destroy their family farm. They get help with their sexy cousin Daisy (Razzie nominated Jessica Simpson) and Uncle Jesse (Wiley Nelson) as well as along the way while Sheriff Rosco P. Coltren (M.C. Guyini of the Lost) and the police followed equally. In addition, Governor Jim Applewift, Jack Polkick, deputy Claytas Hogg, David Kochner to Quetter Devenport, Michael Weston, Deputy Enough Strate and Linda Carter Palin. I think that's the only reason I give the film an extra star because there are a number of impressive cars stunts and of course the body of Simpson's gorgeous body (I totally cathrine survivors on her feet, but still do not!), But this is also quite annoying. It's nominated for the worst pictures of Razzies, Most Director J. Chandrasekhar, Worst Remix or Sequel, Simpson and his "Daisy Duchess" and the worst screen couple for the worst screenplay. Beautiful poor!
