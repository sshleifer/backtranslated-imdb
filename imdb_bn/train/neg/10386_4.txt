Could this be interesting ?? The story of a Japan-set-spooky house from the perspective of a newly established American family ?? But due to the simplicity of treatment and disadvantage of both the cast and the director, the flats fall. <br /> <br /> This problem is with the same problem, I often face the popular modern revival of such a local tenant. That spirit show themselves to be bad for any real reason other than expected! As well, it scares a lot in the division ?? Is she a fool to attack a giant crab ?? For example, in general, Bhutra lives in a particular character and drives him or her to work entirely in a rudimentary way, such as Susan George, the diplomat / friend-friendly family Doug McCall and Edward Albert, a soup feeding to his daughter! <br /> <br /> At one stage, if there is an old monk, is there danger alert Albert ?? Finally, he is calling on exorcise on the premises. However, the history itself is forced to repeat itself and the tragedy is the only outcome of situation in the situation arising outright ?? A violent but curiously humorous climax holding Albert and McCullo by the spirit of their Japanese predecessors, involving a swirling Karate with death! At the end of the day, this was an innocent time consuming? Comfortable in 88 minutes, however, in any way, essential viewing.
