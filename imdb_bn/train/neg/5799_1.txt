Yesterday I rented this movie because of the essence behind most beautiful art and jackets. After popping it in my DVD player, I again tested the jacket cover and even after the cover came out of the plastic viewer, I could not read any production related information about the film. This photo was owned by Jeetet Evil, and to find a link here on IMDB, it was to be found at the Fath Films website. <br /> <br /> Filming and special effects were very good in movies. ... Then, the speaker of a line reading speech. Oh dear ... Some screaming high school like this actor was listening to the word joke, whose voice was directed to change the pitch and there was no effort to go beyond reading the lines from the script. At first I thought the bad disc was gone from audio sync, but I realized that it was a foreign movie because I could not read the jacket ... the English conversation dubbed If they throw the right person in the dialog, then this movie was nice. When I was not going to kill the bad line reader, I gave it a chance almost 20 minutes before I brought it out, but the constant remained the main stability. Yes, it's bad! Jacket cover art and film industry are great, so one star gave it, but 1,999,999 stars for corrosive dialogue. I do not recommend this one!
