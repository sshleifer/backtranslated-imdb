The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to revise the American singing and dancing person performing her husband's latest show with her contact, an American girl who creates her living modeling fashion in the circles of the society. Unfortunately, this couple has already met with them, the girl thinks that the girl is actually married to her friend, the show producer (she does not really wear the wedding ring, discourage any misunderstandings!). Wafite Fred Astaire-Ada Rogers musically finally dragged Dull Taylor and Alan Scott through the stupid script, which is full of children's behavior. Astaire and Rogers just did not meet 'cute' - they met laughingly (he tap-dance like a crazy hotel suit and he complained). The audience of 1935 probably did not care about how they were going together together - as long as they did, and happily. Today, the central characters do not seem to have any motivation for each other: they keep him with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to be "freed" in the love section) and he closes the brush. Nothing can cure that little dance! These sensual twosome as the settings of London and Venice are deliberately as unrealistic, but we are straightforward because the ribbons and ginger. It does not have those who have a fantasy ... who do not mind plotting to fool. Musical moments break the unity of narrow scenes, but fail to cross the surrounding ciline. ** **** to
