No one is in love with any kind of film making and a good compliment to the documentaries, I can honestly say that I was angry with myself to get bogged down in the whole length of 20 dates. I will not waste your time with the plot, you can read another review. I would say that the description of Baroque's hyper, Woody Allen-style was very annoying. If you wish he'd stop coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it is likely visible to Barkowitz that this movie was a bad idea, because its portions give details of his trial to finance his documentaries. Forgive me for congratulating the humiliation as a compliment, but I give credit to Barkovitz for having the ability to satisfy some stupid people for financing this awesome piece of ****. I appreciate the film's boundaries and intentions here, but when Baroque standards are set for themselves, then they attack all the levels and miss them. While closing, I'm sure that many of these female partners are not going to readily film any date, and so I question the authenticity of the real movie. Hey Myls, I saw your movie for the first time when it appeared like an episode of Cineffield or was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin Smith.
