I am delighted for the films that fill the subject of world film leaked. So after watching the trailer for "Water Lily", I wanted to like this picture because I thought I was pushing something unique: a movie which honestly portrays the love of lesbians - a female version of "beautiful things". <br /> <br /> The main character is 15 years old French woman. Marie is narrow, neutral and beautiful on a sensual path; Floriane emerging, athlete and beautiful; And Anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviourally imperfect. Boyfriend and Florentian love lovers are always swimming in this film, if not on the page, below. <br /> <br /> "Water lilies," however, homosexual love does not start at two teenagers; It is working on sex frustration, anguish, ennui, teens cross-purpose and - at least two cases - are joyful, mechanical sex. This proves that when screenliters and filmmakers are too manipulative they can create their own. <br /> <br /> In addition to DVD features, director Peter Brook said, "French fondness begins with sexual tension", meaning that the French recognize the child as a child, even though they recognize the elderly and the adults Remains. Filmmaker Selin Sayamma, a part of the fall of this film, has presented a strong dose of this brutality. <br /> <br /> "Where's the joy?" I asked myself while watching these pictures. Yes, the first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can be a fresh, life-affirming way of pleasure and win. This positive aspect is missing from this movie; There is no balance. <br /> <br /> Biologically, this film wants to be a stupid celebration of first love. But Saiyamma was very fascinated by her own foe and cleverness and destroyed the film. First, what is the point of only looking thick girl naked? I know an established tradition of delicious tin nudity in the European film, such as "The Slingshot; The Slingshot; The Rascals; The Devil, Probably; The Little Thief; Heart of Mart, Friends, Beau Thorie" and "Europa, Europa"; But this example is a small authors' confusion - "Look, the audience, I can create a movie where I will only show the unreasonable person naked." There was no honest way to go to nudity or nude distribution. <br /> <br /> There is a view of a club where Floriane and Marie are dancing. The next follow what is not only manipulating Floriane Mary; Photo creator Saimma is impressively transforming her audiences. <br /> <br /> Probably, Florian warns Marie that he warns about something "not normal", perhaps the greatest betrayal of faithfulness and biological honesty. Marie realizes, "Who care about being normal?" Scientists are belittling the traumatic movements of his audience and film because Florida's request is not a fool, derivative and alternative question - the real, heartfelt question is not worth investing in the movie, Marie's character and audience time. <br /> <br /> There are two moments here that lie on the viewer's nerves: 1) Since the French - from all the people - after bathing suit, and a turtle to boot? 2) What nationality is there - pressed on an apple coat, to get rid of garbage so that it is thrown into the trash? <br /> <br /> Three main actresses are committed and, if they find good vehicles for their talent, can be excellent actors. For Louise Blachere (Anne) technique, there can be a successful career in supporting best actress and role. Adel Henel (Floriane) may be a leading lady, or a bomb, or both. Polyn Acquiret (Marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism which possesses unmistakable. In the future, he can play a mysteriously lustrous temptation from an emotional unexpected librarian, surrounded by a warm uprising in praise of a disrespectful politician. <br /> <br /> Finally, "Water Lily" was very disappointing. A genuine filmmaker will fall in love to create a pure movie about two young women! No - this is not essential for a medieval person - but young lesbian girls may have some quality that they can see and recognize. And yes, the world cinema meets a subject gap.
