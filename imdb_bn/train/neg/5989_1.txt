I paid 3.50 pounds to watch this movie. Cunt I believe my time wasted. Acting is the most deserving cringe and special effects are crude. Perhaps the worst script in history I have ever heard of in my life is a shameful quote. I swear, 'It's far better' than that. Madonna must win and compared to this boy than the Oscars. I want one hour of my life back. Indeed, people can not see it, even children will humiliate their intelligence. I thought this picture was so strange that who would say that it was a solid wood, here the people of the original doll The applicants do not waste your time in this movie, you will regret it.
