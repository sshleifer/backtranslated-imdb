... do not have to live in Montana and especially do not have to live there at the end of the 19th century. <br /> <br /> "There is a river running through it" is certainly a good synthetic stand-point movie. Great Landscape, Redford played well. Unfortunately, the story is bad (if there are any stories) <br /> <br /> I am sorry for the author / writer who is a dry, narrow minded character like his father, preacher. Because of being driven, because of not running his life, he is left to see his brother, who lost his life in the small town environment. The author never came close to the existence of his brother's motivation, but at least he understood that he had a small amount of home / fun. All are there, like flying fishermen, where he followed his father's style as an old man. <br /> <br /> No surprise, it's invisible since the very beginning. <br /> <br /> definitely will not be seen (3/10) <br /> <br />
