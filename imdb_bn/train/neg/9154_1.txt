The Bad Film Never <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After viewing this democracy gay picture, I suspect that half-blind Neo-Nazi was surrounded by a brain and made him the greatest gay film of all time, all in gay culture. To attack I had to stop the movie and I was asked to come to the friend, so when someone paused the film due to the irritability, mistrust and inaccuracy of this movie, I had to blame someone. <br /> <br /> <br /> horror writing and acting and unreasonable and stupid plot, it is a badly created film. <br /> <br /> After reading a few positive reviews of this picture, I think the author must have half a dozen IMDB accounts. Anyone who says this movie is being seen as a spectacular, lucrative, or so much money, other than fun.
