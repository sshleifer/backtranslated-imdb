Basically, cruel motives 2 cruel objectives 1, again, only poor work done. The story is the same with only a few exceptions (even a few lines) the same. Cast is more unknown, and definitely less talented. Instead of being seductive and drawing me to see it, I ended up feeling soft because it compared to watching a soft-core porn. I'm not sure whether the blasphemy of the actors or writers is blaming ... and I always say bad things, because I know how difficult it is to work both ... but it's basically two- hours of my life being wasted It literally reminds me that some movies are made and this is no exception ... I can not believe that they will create the third.
