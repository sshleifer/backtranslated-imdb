Actual transashers are not great movies in any way. In the internal rational approach it was a huge plot hole and very small. However, it was entertaining, had done better than the least budgeted B-movies and it could be surprisingly surprising. Unfortunately, the Transistor II is not one of these. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most flop seagulls are suffering from the same problem. The plots are thin enough and are written enough to see through. It seems that the people behind this movie thought that the familiar faces of the first film should be brought in sufficient quantity and would not be disturbed by anything else. Even older B-grade actors like Tim Thomson and Jeffrey Combs are not able to drag the picture out of the muck. <br /> <br /> A short plot overview: Jack Death (Thomson) was one of the future police who was sent to save the ancestors of his government in 1985. The first transcovar incident took place in Transparency II six years later. Jack Date married Lane (Helen Hunt), the film she had filled in the first film, and both lived with Hop Ashby, Death was sent in the past to send in the past. It has been discovered that Whistler's brother (bad guy of the first film) came back in time to build a military transporter, people became silly deadly murders to kill Ashby. Jack's mission complicated that Jack had died before he traveled long ago, his first wife died, and Wilmar's brother was sent to stop, and now Jack saw himself working with him. I have two real problems with this movie. First, the process of making the trance in this movie is basically different from the methods used in the first film. Is it boring that in the worst example of Soviet revisionism, they always work as a strategy. <br /> <br /> Another who bothers me is that the trance of Love, date, Lena, and the triangle of Alice Steelewell (Jack's first wife) is given a very small screen time. It was particularly annoying because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the film. It was something that was thrown to fill the space in the film. The character of Alice is particularly unlikely that she has reconnected with her husband to remarry, she has been very shallow or very bad. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Otherwise, if you are interested in original transmissions, stay away from even this secret code.
