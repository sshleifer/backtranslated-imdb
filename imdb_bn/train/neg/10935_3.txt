I have never been a great fan of Mormon movies. As a mormon, I've always felt that this humorous LDS was very exclusive to the community and felt like a bunch of emotive Wackos. I hope this new wind will flow, Holstorm film I could finally discuss with my non-mythological friends. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I understand that because there was a B-list genius like Clint Howard, Gary Coleman, Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard (one of my dear ones), it would be a little fun. And besides, church basketball is ripe with gorgeous gags and potential for such abundance as well. But I must say, throughout the movie, no one knows what they are doing. Each joke falls flat, and every opportunity for a truly funny gog is ignored. The dialogue was very strong, and the film was something of my worst characteristic. Each single character but Wilson was less than one-dimensional. It is hard to believe that even after rewriting nine, I have destroyed trains as well, so the film still remains stuck in mind. I felt seated through this and I can not be sounding in anger. My friends and I were in addition to the final game scene, so we went to the premiere at Washington City, YouTube. Director Curt Hale was there, and I must say, after the show I avoided contact with her. She waited at the door, apparently ready for the reaction. I could not tell myself that his film has thrown away one and a half hours of my life, but it's a bad, painful stain that I will never forget. Here are some of my typical problems: There was the theorem of the little love story between the janitor and the pink piano player, but these two letters came from somewhere and it was impossible to care about them, so my friends and I were amazed We went to see why we were supposed to care about these two lame, uninteresting characters. There were many concubines that rose up every time and give the audience a chance to laugh, but everyone went to the smoke smoker and ended up before taking care. How the whole movie was felt. <br /> <br /> This movie was suddenly frustrating, and I feel bad for everyone who is hoping to be the first original Marmon movie. Indeed, these jokes are not monolithic in mormons. Then again, what was the curiosity, and in my ears aloud loudly began to say. <br /> <br /> Please do not watch this movie. This movie is ridiculous to imagine your mind. I abandoned myself to despair through myself
