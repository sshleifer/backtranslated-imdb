What kind of a documentary about a musician failed to include himself the solo track of the artist? In contrast to countless other films of "Roy" or music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the sofa) makes great songs unique. Here, all tracks are inserted with unintended characters and these revivals fail to capture Cohen's slow, Jazz Styling. More often, cover covers the bad version. Ek <br /> <br /> Interviews are more than coherent and statistically than Cohen. Film feature Cohen is rarely reading his work (not singing) - such as letters, poetry etc. The film does not really matter much about the life of an artist, or even during its years of development. A big disappointment for a big cohn fan.
