I do not know Eliad, so I can not comment on the accuracy of that story. However, as a single film alone I found this very annoying. The war scenes tried to be big and spectacular but they were only visible to CGI. <br /> <br /> The actress is poor and there is no doubt that Brad Pitt was thrown only to attract women. But he is not a good fighter, very beautiful I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Good points are designed. This film does not look good with landscape and building walls / wall impressive. I like a movie that tries to express at least the characters the truth, but this movie completely ignores it. We hear something American, Scottish English, but what you can expect for a movie of East Eastern civilization. <br /> <br /> To everyone, I do not recommend this movie to sit for family. It's too long and the youth will get bored. <br /> <br /> For adults, if you do not talk about the lack of reality then all right.
