- A small time Hood pushed the local moneylender out of a lot of money. Of course, the public's master wants his money back and does not care who wants to kill it. Punk helps to save his friend and an old brain to help save him. <br /> <br /> - If it seems ridiculous, it is either. In this eyed cloak, the dive buggy-driving pin is believed to be the only one of the most powerful public in Rome to stop the simple silly. His friend may be good with a gun, but he is up against a group of trained killers. No real help when old mobster comic relief comes little more and comes face to face with the crowd. A few years ago, there is also a sub-plot about how friends were murdered by genocide, but some of it was not created and it does not support any film in any way. <br /> <br /> - Acting by Mr. Scarface, Jack Palance. I think he got his name because he looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. As the rest of the PAX is void, what he's doing to get a paycheck. <br /> <br /> - I recently saw some pretty good Italian crime / police flicks, but Mr Scarface is not one of them. See syndicate instead of sadists or revolvers.
