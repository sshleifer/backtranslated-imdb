It's like the Matinee Serial on Saturday in World War II. I'm less than ten years old. And that viewers are designed for this serial. Now look at it, one must roar on its incompetence and stupidity. The budget can certainly be nothing short of giving shortcut and repeat. Acting? Well, this is the Republic photo, 1944. They read the lines ... and suspect someone could make them believe. <br /> <br /> One half star.
