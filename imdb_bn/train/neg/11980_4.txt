This one was very fierce by very small cut of very potentially great matches. <br /> <br /> The first match was a waste of the legion of dome, but I guess they were the only way to get rid of demolition a double-DQ. Otherwise, put Mr. Perfect Overtime. Ic champion Kerry Fon Erich has been lost here. And in this row was the third PPV where the perfect jobbed was. Remember, he has not lost a match earlier. <br /> <br /> The second match was very good, probably the best of the night. Ted Davies and Undertaker were nice, when Jim Nidhart was one of his WWF highlights, hunky pin pins. Cocoa b. Beer New Hill (First Big Bashman and Yokozuna Remember it was a prediction of Bret Hart's solo career because both of them came back and almost survived the match, he and Debussy kept a wrestling clinic, which makes us forget that the point of the match is Dusty Rhodes With Diabis's annoying fight. <br /> <br /> Although the members of Wisner's family are the first team to survive And since only four of 87 second for survival), this was not a squash match. This was the longest match of the night, and Jack repeated his '88 performance once he was dominated by four men and dominated. I could actually have pulled it off a crash. These days, the match will end almost another way. <br /> <br /> One of the shortest SS matches was one of her most wonderful ones. Perhaps the most intrinsic wrestler was probably Tita Santana night inspirational wrestler, who had set up war paint and defeated Boris Jakhov, Tanaka, even the Warlord in a final survival match. He was so curious to see him so strongly, then return to his carrier. Sergeant The killings have also been better, the Volcup and the Bushwalkars are getting released, but it was not only surprising. It was <br /> <br /> I think Hagan and Warrior will win the only match of the live match together. <br /> <br /> This show was annoying and the match was too short. Undertaker's debut was cool, but Tito Santana would remember this reason.
