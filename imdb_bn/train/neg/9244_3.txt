A historical mistake can deal with errors, but this image was too much. In fact, there was nothing in the truth, even for the era it was seen as stupid. <br /> <br /> It was published in an old talk show in Four Defense, that he is managing this story as a real man, Senel, who told him to the true Viet Erape, and walked the scene with his own way. Yard told Stazkov about the director, and how it was planned to come to Stazkov, so despite the other historians claiming that, Wyt himself said that it was predefined. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The man, and his brothers History is not right they did not. Most people want to separate their character from deception and dehumanity, but it is nothing new. Indeed, they are almost like close proximity to the law enforcement agencies near them. The men who saw it as carriers and believed in me, in the old West, you did not have much time to think about. <br /> <br /> The characters do not exist, the characters are not really corral, these are all a weak film. It's more weaker by the mature, who really is not a traitor dock. He might prefer the worst cast for the dock, but at the same time, we should remember that old films were close to the ages and near the feeling of truth. After all, got the first hand of information from Ford Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> It is also weak by all expected events involving Mexican girl. Hollywood was a very famous Nazi in those days and Hitler was ready to kill women in several possible fashion for their patronage towards idealism. This happens in most movies up to eighty. This is not an excuse, and making the industry cheaper. <br /> <br /> <br /> The acting actor of Erepses did well and brainen is always thrilling. In fact, this flick of mature can only be negative acting. Still, it is the oldest of the oldest coral films.
