The story behind this movie is very interesting, and generally the plot is not so bad ... but details: writing, direction, continuation, packing, action sequence, stunt and CGI make all the cheap and spoil the film. <br /> <br /> First stop, verb sequence. They are all pretty unexciting. Most of them stand up and get the shot, no effort to run formed, fight, dodge, or whatever, although they have all the time in the world, though formed. Sequences seem to be somewhat beautiful in 2004. <br /> <br /> CGI has very well rendered and animated effects, but they are looking for how cheap they are used. <br /> <br /> Pacing: Everything will happen very fast. For example, "Eli" is trained to fight within a few hours and can do back-flips from beginning to end. Why is he so attracted? This is no movie movie explanation. As Lillith, she will not be able to return the flip - perhaps she could not, because her wings were. Also, we have a sequence which is like a car by a woman, and arise and float in a deserted room with a sink and mirrors, and then stabbing itself in the throat, all for no apparent reason, and The audience really cared that he got hit by a car (and then felt the second impact, explosive car) ... "Are you okay?" <br /> <br /> I said, yes, I'm fine. "<br /> <br /> I saw it, even though identity gave me the promise that it would be interesting ... but ultimately, the poor execution wanted me for anything else: Blood, Vampire Hunter D, even the movie where Jackie Chan was a comic relief, because he was able to suspend my unbelief, but it wanted me to wake the director, and the author gave a good word .
