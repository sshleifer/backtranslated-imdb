I'm a great fan of Zenna James, but this movie is terrible. At that time, Zenna married Brad Armstrong, and she was the director of the film, and Zenna was the greatest porn star ever. So, of course, Brad tried to make so much money because he could stop making this big budget pornographic movie. Now I know why they do not make big budget porn movies anymore. In an epic world, porn stars may work, but it is not real world and they can not work. That is why pornographic porn star, if a beautiful woman can work, she instead tried to go to mainstream movies instead of obscenity. Just because you are not a beautiful movie star. Tracy is a wonderful example of Lords, when she was a young man at the age of 20, she was the world's most beautiful, sexy woman. She could not move her into lower budget mainstream films and work. Now where is he? Instead of heating the genera so much, I gave it 2 instead of 1, but it made a better movie after "Dream Quest". Come on, adultery, we do not want to talk to you, as much as we would like to see that you are sex. Also, if you act in generator, you will get more fans and more money in your bank account.
