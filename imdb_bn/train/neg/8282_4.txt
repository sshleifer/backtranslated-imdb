Until now you already know about this movie, Jessica Simpson "Bombs", which mostly went directly to the live video (limited, animated theatrical run). Basically, Miss Simpson's kitty travels to see her boyfriend from a small town in Oklahoma City, to surprise him, to find him in bed with another woman. He is helpless, but a friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I have often seen on film), who lets him stay. Kate ends up getting a job with two convincing colleagues (Penelope Anne Miller and always funny Andy Dick), who are simply using Katie to resign from the firm's president (Larry Miller). It is strictly a B movie, it is not meant to be deep. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress in any way, but she is quite beautiful and not really annoying. The film is not hateful, it is not a scandal, but its empty lungs. In Camo, Penny Marshall is funny (making a joke about Milko Mikuqui), and has a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (do not read too much about this). So, not terrible, but easy to skip. If your safe bet is never seen on television then it is. Again, not good, but do not have a deep disaster.
