<br /> <br /> There is not much to say about this acting and conversation. <br /> <br /> Acting and dialogue too far from honest, the story of hybrid Veraobol can not be very well explained and the whole thing is there and there are plot holes <br /> <br /> CGI is something you want to see No It is so amateur that it makes me vomit. <br /> <br /> The only good thing in the DVD was extra. Gog reel All other, just waste time and money. I hope nobody will buy it, it is not worth the rent. <br /> <br /> Just stay away from it.
