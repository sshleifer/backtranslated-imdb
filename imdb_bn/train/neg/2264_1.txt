To publish this review, I think I was curious about this movie. However, I probably did not see that my hand was not slightly curved. <br /> <br /> My opinion, this movie shows how people can be deprived. In my eyes, the worst thing about this whole Springer incident is the type of work they do in "Jerry Springer Show" (which is very highly pronounced), but many people are interested to see them and excited and heard about their life (yes, I think that Include me .. the extent to which it is true). If this kind of behavior is not proud (say something like that), we can very rarely make our mind contaminate and / or engage ourselves in such behavior. <br /> <br /> But enough soapbox (sort). Here is a rating of the film: and it can only be received (I was looking at some scenes, so I'm not quite sure), I think an NC-17 (hat critic, another critic) might be a little more suitable for extraordinary sex. (A crisis can be a comment that the movie was the only big reason to show sex on the big screen). This plot is very bizarre, together with a complete family of unfriendly family and a group of stereotypical Blacks groups, which are shown in Springer Shows. Finally, the film releases one with some determination - and the chaos of Spring is about the need to see us in the real world (often seen through its show). I agree with him there - it is important to know how the world actually happens, so that we may want to implement positive changes. Not saying, I just tell you - the worst in the world - a new newsletter or news to watch it, but Springinger is not a good money to support the exciting and perhaps sutrazial enthusiasm that we want to give.
