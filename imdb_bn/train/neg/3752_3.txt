I grew up watching and growing bigger. I recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager in DVD, which can enhance my sense of hatred with this episode, the difference between style and approach can not be more stark. If used as an opportunity to expand the character of Ricker, the idea might be good, how it might have been behaved on VOY. Instead of reproducing the old show clips, the audience may have "new" memories. The inside and outside of this episode "Monument" and "Current" start as a cliche in the beginning and the transition quickly becomes very endless to wear a tired pattern. None of the times - the worst part ever!
