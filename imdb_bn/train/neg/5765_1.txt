There was a bad idea to start the scary movie 3 (2003). The last picture was a mediatory endeavor. Place it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. Although the part two were filled with many dated comedies and cheap shots, at least it was fun. There is nothing funny about forced ridiculous. Jokes, Prattles and Sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny. Do not hurt to hit the visitors on the head with tired jokes. This movie was a comedy of people who laugh at all. When they were taking care of the crowd at the junior high school, a sense of self-respect went out of the window. Ring parody is not funny. I have seen them in comedy since 1998. They date so much. Michael Jackson's joke is not cool. Even worse, two breaks are fun "actors" whose best days have never been. <br /> <br /> The death of American movies is slowly running. These types of films stretch into his nails, dance nails Whatever the real humor happened? I do not laugh at a movie theater in long time. Many bad movie brain friction. Would you like evidence? Visit your local Mega Chain video rental store and see what look at the shelves. This movie is bad. Do not believe in betrayal. I would again see the scary movie 2 in a series loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy! <br /> <br /> is definitely not recommended (unless you have anything in the brain cells).
