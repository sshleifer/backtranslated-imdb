For the first time, for the first time, "Lipstick" has been seen again for the first time, although I've heard more negative comments than other filmmakers from transparency, although it's diverse like me. <br /> <br /> Contrasting the contrast of its 32 years, "I spit on your grave", from the radioactive enthusiasm of "lipstick", how the 32-year development of obnoxious filmmaking has become unique. Delicious management on "conviction" But "breed", although some important things are created, in reality, in reality does not really offer something new to us. No, "breed" has become so weak in terms of pictures and phrases that it can prevent from any important message - it's a message that is closely examined, not a ground break, not a break. <br /> <br> I knew I was going to plot too much. What I wanted to see was * the "seed" or the fall of Dasson's character. Due to the big fan of Rosario, I was concerned about severing layers and changing his brain slowly ... You know, Dioniro's "taxi driver" illustrates this. Unfortunately, the script and the director / author's choices do not provide any reliable conversion. <br /> <br /> The biggest point of failure is the second task. From the question-answer on the DVD to the big black Stalin Adrian (Nightmare of Every White Boy), Club-Hopking, drug use, and emotionally the objectives of this filmmaker have become clear, but Dawson's character is not reliable. We do not know exactly what he's doing at half time, what he's doing next, or why he's doing this. The poor quality of the audio / video does not help again, but the sequence is very long and dull. It otherwise eliminates any motion and investment of the lead character set up during the first lawful act well done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Although it is certainly valid, it does not make the scene even more compelling. <br /> <br /> See if you have a DVD, delete the "Classroom" view. It's a nice 8 minute plus outtake that cracks with strength and anxiety (though all verbal) and really materializing up the slow crack of Dawson as she vividly admits Frances Swift's prissy, condescending dorm consultant, vivisects the poor. If such a wide spectrum is added and the middle third is cut more, then we can research an interesting psychology of the effects of violent violence. <br /> <br /> The film is standing in the final cut, however, what we found is what we have seen before, only more graphic rendering. So what?
