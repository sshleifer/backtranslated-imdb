In the film, I think it should be more than the industry. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on the screen. This is a short story from David Lynch but one more say. I think it was funny but it seems very bizarre to be a comedy. This is a good movie but there is nothing else to do. As I said earlier, I am a fan of David Lynch, but I am frustrated because of some of his work because I have no need for this. This is definitely my least favorite thing she has done so far but I know that she still has a ton of her and I am excited to see what she has kept for us in the future. If you like Linch, check it out but do not be surprised if you do not like it.
