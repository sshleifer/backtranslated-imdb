How do I start reviewing a movie that will soon be recognized as the 'worst movie of all times' by 'the worst director of all time'? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because all other people in the world do it, and for those who like this image We like the errors we want. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> The film can cross the distance. IMDB does not allow enough words to quote the failures of all movies, and it makes the site of 'solar year alcohol' element much easier. Unfortunately, those moments of pride have been buried so far in the shadow of the painting of the film that it is a work that is not followed. <br /> <br /> My impression? I thought I was getting what I was getting, warning me to drink a few cups of coffee before sitting before watching this watch (the suggestion was VADCA cup). Despite my low expectations, 'Saloon Years of Alcohol' and even 'bad movie-level fun' even failed to entertain me. Not only bad, but Jabsan deliberately tried to make the film a poetic fascinator, but it became exaggerated and cast poetry down our throat, it is not deep but interesting. ..And supposedly jabson earnestly tried to make a good movie? Even after watching the 'Six Years Alcohol' promotional literature, I was troubled to believe in the sincerity of the day. Until the end of a few green / chocolate moments, the film is tormented and objectionable (all I'm not sure is a deliberate) and some of those components prevent me from switching off the DVD. So bad is it good? No, it was enough, 'I can not believe that this is a serious movie moment', to stop it and to do something <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> Movies connoisseurs Your own ongoing commentary is going on. That will significantly improve the experience for me. It is so bad that Mike Myers has commented on his code Scottish accent that it is run, turn this whole piece into a comic French "Ok dare ma man, pass me annader glat dat wiskey".
