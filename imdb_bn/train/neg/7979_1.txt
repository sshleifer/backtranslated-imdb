These pictures were slow but tiring and the actress often drifted to the ham land. For the love of Fox's character, the character of Redgrave was unexpected in trying to compete with 60 of the contestants with Tharman's 20 contestants. The title of this movie will be "Lakes to Lake". Actors acted like they were in a rehearsal. End of a horrible predictable boot. I can not believe this website as this comedy!
