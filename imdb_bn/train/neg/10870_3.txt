Bill (Body Rogers) was sent to New York for life before he could inherit 25 million dollars by his uncle (Richard Tucker). His uncle gave three women Jacqui (Catherine Crowford), Maxine (Josephine Dunn) and Palin (Carol Lomber) to silence him and confirmed that he is not a fake to the gold diggers. Such a woman Clo (Geneva Mitchell) turned this scene into women's frustration. As the bill agrees to carry the bill in New York for 3 months, girls are offered more money on the show instead of their mourning, when Bill Cleo and meet another woman. In the end, love for air and love for each other ............. <br /> <br /> The film's quality and sound quality are poor in this movie. The story interspersed with musical numbers but the song is bad and there is a terrible voice of Catherine Croft. Rogers is not that well. He is very happy but only true when playing drums or trombone. There is a very impressive character who played a cab driver (Roseco Cornes) and the film is neutral.
