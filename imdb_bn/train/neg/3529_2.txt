I have heard that the movie was more stylistic than before film director Guy Ricchi (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch), the problem was that it was very stylish. Basically Jack Green (Jason Statham) has been released from prison for seven years, and in two years gambling loads his money. He is ready to take revenge for the casino owner of the violence sent to jail, Dorothy M. D'Macha (Ray Leota). In this process, the doctor tells Jack that he has three days left to die from a rare blood disease, and the lash hit men on him. Credit shark jac (Vincent Pastor) and Avi (Andres Benjamin) Jack demanded their cash and did some strange work for them. The picture has been described by Jack with some flashbacks and three days before the big revelation about Jakh, Avi and Makhta, I think what it was like. Terrence Menard as French Paul, starring Andrew Howard, Sartre Mark Strong, Francesca Anis as Lilly Walker, Dowell like Rachel, and Angela Lorraine Smith, like Alan Biennez. Some animation involved sequences, lines repeat in different perspectives, and speed changes for the moment, and all of this is boring at the point of confusion and annoyance, it is a stupid crime drama. Beautiful poor!
