This movie is supposed to take place in Seattle and around and around. Why, can you see the Porteo Cove PROVINNLCLL Park? Provincial Park is in Canada, and not in the United States. Inspector Peel Pilot stuck with Styles completely using 'Read' to hack anyone into a bridal store computer. I do not know if this is possible using a database storage device. A movie is shown in movies without introduction and is never present. We learn halfway through the movie that this woman works at the office of the district attorney. Then, in the correction center, a guard actually reinstates Jens with a door and returns to criminals! This does not happen in a real-correction setting. The director really is this one mess - this does not happen in real life. Acting is enough. Plot is good. Cinematography is good. However, most of the errors found in continuation lead to 3 out of 10 votes.
