The worst movie is still directed by Burton, which seems to be becoming worse with every direct film directed at him. Loads with Cliches is a sad script that is the first in many objectionable aspects of this film. Such a movie where every time something happens, you will be sure that someone will cry, "he has lost his gun!" Or whatever it is to let everyone know. Carter is really terrible and so Wahlberg, who can not play this straight and believable. Very impressive effects and photography, but John William's counterfeit music was filmed by Burton's Cronie Elfman. Haston appeared in a nonsensical scene to find out his most famous catch-phrases from the first film. Very bad results <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br />! I have heard that this special project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as a director should question his judgment. But I think he probably allowed to slip any possible outlook before his career; There are proof films. In "Slilly Hole", he could not determine what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of the British character actor (Chris Lee, etc.) also felt that it was a giant rally film type ( Those who are not terrible, know horror fans). The film can not be successful with comedy or comedy because it was very schizophrenic and there was no style made to smooth both together. "Apps Planet" is the same and results are more like "Total Recall" or "Tango and Cash" compared to science finder. He has been gems of many "big" operators to try to satisfy potential potential listeners. Ward to Burton, if you are there - pick something and make it straight, or use it all together for a PC (such as "Mars Attacks" or "Bitlucus") or you can retire, because people like I love your movie Fans will stop that off.
