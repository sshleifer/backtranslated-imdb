Valentine is a horror movie. What I thought about it: <br /> <br /> Acting: Very bad. Catherine Heigl can not work. Others were not better. <br /> <br /> Story: The story was fine, but it could have been better. This movie was likely to be a great movie, but it failed. <br /> <br /> Music: Yes, some music was quite calm. <br /> <br /> Originality: Not very original. Did the name 'pie ige presscote' recognize priscote? <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Valentine does not see. This is really a stupid movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
