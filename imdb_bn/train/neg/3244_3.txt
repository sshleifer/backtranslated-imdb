Accepting the influence of this story about psychiatrists associated with mental artists so much that I wanted to remember that it was a deliberate intention. The set is artificial and sometime I do not think I'm watching a movie. Actors liked to read their lines instead of responding to each other. Although the film's primary film contains elements of nir (except in color), this method is so exaggerated that I should almost end up as a parody of the genre. <br /> <br /> The presentation was no appeal to me, I was hoping at least an engaging story. Generally when I talk about the story of plot twists, I am very slowly, but you can see what's coming in the first fifteen minutes. According to the time, "Yes, I forgot $ 80,000," at the moment, I myself thought it was really ridiculous. It is beyond belief to behave so stupid for the psychologist with the embarrassed experience of gambling addiction. If at any stage he behaved like a normal intelligent person, the whole story would be different. <br /> <br /> This wooden product has kept me cold.
