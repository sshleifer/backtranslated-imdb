I screaming horror movies, no secret. No plot, bad acting and blood gallon movies are not the main thing in these mistakes, and this "film" is no exception. I can not believe some cable stations actually run this trash. (This special garbage was released from direct video, as I think) mentioning any other film that would be disrespectful to other movies, I would say: Most of the movies in Phantas, All Jason Films, Freddy Films, Chaki Film, and Michael Mayor's Movies Words can be summarized: TERRIBLE !!! <br /> <br /> Ratings (Fantasium III): 0.5 / 10
