If you see the skin of living creatures, their headaches are torn, dogs are crumbling on my back, then this is for you! But if you are not a bit natural and do not see the actual footage of animal cruelty, then pass it one step. Trying to disappoint the viewer of this movie and sure. Initially, the animal was damaged and the film's killing of children (at least nets) was enough to stop it. Before watching this film, I should not allow slaughter footage (BTT movie) and horror movies of such footage. We see the clock and the horror because we know only make up and special effects, so do not sit on us, watch a movie and see the real killings of animals, for that we did not rent a movie. If there is such a thing, such garbage films should have large alert labels so that people can win. As a very hardcore horror fan, this one turned into my stomach. Need to cast the whole movie and crew check their heads.
