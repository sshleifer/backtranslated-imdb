A humble housewife, Della, with a small housewife of Kem Basing, who is suffering from difficulty in local mall while shopping in a local mall. After placing a hefty note of paper in a piece of paper and carrying two parking spaces, when he found the paper in the windshield, he saw a white man owned by the owner of the villain's Rainbow Clinton. Mexican, a Chinese man and a black. They face their notes, hold a helpless security guard, and walk behind. Hunting will be victimized during the lull in the photo when it releases its inner bronze. <br /> <br /> I found it a little exciting little thriller. The performance was good enough (except for a few scenes, "Why is God why" Bit was not worthy of his badness)? Even though it is a scary fact that villain dale has been frustrated after / after. . If they did not have any "home alone" badie, perhaps their last defeat would be to taste a little bit instead of the reactions of meh. As a director and producer, I was a partner to bring "shoot up" on the screen (a movie that was extremely fun when the window was credited) as an incredible reason to ignore both. While not achieving the height of the film, the film was good at its own rights. <br /> <br /> My grade: C- <br /> <br /> Anchor Bay DVD Extra: Commentary with writer / director Susan Montford and producer Don Murphy; Making a 25 and a half minute 'making off'; A trailer and two TV spots for this photo; And trailer for lower education
