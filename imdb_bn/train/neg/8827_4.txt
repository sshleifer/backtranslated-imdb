I like Slasher Flick of 80 and I think when "Thailand Night / Deadly Night" was pulled from our theater, I was very disappointed, so I was very excited to see some of these at Fear.net. You saw better, I have come to expect such movies. Special effects quality was ridiculous by today's standards, character development is very long, but all of a sudden the funny smile! <br /> <br /> The scenes where he lost, because Santa, Ur dad, feel his mother, and later when the crowd is actually watching the light - not like the flashlight in 80 seconds, the real torch! - Really tickled my funny bone. However, the scene where he was checking on the kids around him gave me a wonderful feeling of a different nature. I enjoyed some of these character actors who tried to figure out. It took me a while to illustrate the main character of brotherhood boy Teddy Bear.
