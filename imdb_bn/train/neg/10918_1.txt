Manmohan Desai has made some entertaining films like AAA, Parvarish, and NASEEB, but he created some crumbs like Kollai and Muras and then JGS <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst films produced by him. Mard Ko Dar is not hot but the film is so bad that you are crunching <br /> <br /> British characters have been made and the film looks so weird that the scene is stupid at the British hotel <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are many stereotypes to beat Amitabh in the film, and then the whole scene becomes worse and worse towards PlusFex. There are many more gems such as horse statues, life, masks of Amitabh Hawa and more <br /> <br /> Manmohan Desai is bad, music is okay <br /> <br /> Amitabh makes a part of it with style, isolated from kolaiya Nothing, the types of laureis are Amrit Singh All right, Satya Kapu is love Chopra, Nirup Roy again as his usual self Dara Singh is normal
