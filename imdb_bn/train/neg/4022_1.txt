This movie was terrible. I saw it three times, even the whole thing. It is impossible to see, the story line sucks, it is depressing, and completely annoying. I do not enter spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it is so annoying, see it for yourself. The only good thing in this movie was John Savage, initially his dialogue and some interesting part of the movie. The little child of this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bad. I saw this movie in movie stores across America, so I think it will be a good movie. Jesus Christ, I was wrong !!!! The acting is all horrible, and nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing, another major character, star Andr√©f, did not play in bad films in the past, he was actually quite well. The same with John Savage. SUCKKS THIS MOVIE!
