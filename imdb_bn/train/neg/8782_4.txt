John River took a kite for the worst that his wife had disappeared in life as an architect and family man and his car ended up dead after a freakish accident involving a tire change. At the time he was absent, he followed a man and told him that he had contacted his deceased wife from the other side through the eV-Electronic Voice phenomenon. Naturally he does not believe it, but he receives a strange phone call from his phone, and so he does not believe in EVP. Contact the person to know more about. Very soon John hangs over him, but something supernatural does not like him to interfere with the dead, when the other person communicates with his wife, the white word predicts events before it happens. <br /> <br /> Sitting on my holiday for a while from this DVD, I thought I could see better if it was not my copy. But even then I do not think they were quick to make the owners quick, because they did not ask me about it. Well good So I decided to give it a game, I had a strangely mood. After listening and after reading all the bad news, I was not expecting a little distant, but for 90 minutes I was given entertainment. Well, more than 60 minutes, the last half-hour was confused. Since the film was not so good, there is no time, but it is a rather supernatural supernatural thriller, although the time is fast enough to thrive. I did not have all the waste of it. In the first hour I think some of the actionable actions are rather attractive and there is a wonderful fear created by the frustrating frustration and tragedy that slowly hits you, but sadly it comes to the film's crashing hottie. And since the predictive forced jumps scares their own comes and it does not fit exactly with context. It became rather loud and very muddled with MTV Style Editing and Kinetic camera-work which gets off in action. I could not understand what's happening between the sticky and sudden climax. Detailed hockey shows how the whole picture fits into the big picture. This is a very dissatisfied conclusion because it goes for some big, but rock hits the bottom. I've worked fine up to that point with the camera-work they do with light and showbiz. Otherwise the starlight lights individually, this glimmer of atmospheric depression scores. It all works very slowly with its glossed up and fancy hardware which makes it very stupid and empty. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> There is just no connection and permanent feeling in these flimsy components. After a while, it tries hard to convince you that it falls in manipulute threads and goes into many vampires stuff from outside the grave. Instead it is repeated when someone is watching a Fiji TV screen. EVV machine was a star at the show. Well, it has more impact than the long performance. Michael Cuton is much more than capable actors, but recently he disappears off the map and here he provides a decent performance such as hazardous latent John River. Although he's really a lot better, though. Everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable. Not due to performance, but lacking their character depth. This was not bad to start with the clunker, but it goes drastically to the pear shape by falling away. <br /> <br /> I do not want to meet this again and I do not recommend anyone, unless you got interest for the topic and the latest Hollywood movie produced horror / thriller. It's a shameful shame that this highly-produced Flick did not successfully merge it, because it was more convinced than its idea and hands-appropriate cast. I hate it, but what a disappointment it is.
