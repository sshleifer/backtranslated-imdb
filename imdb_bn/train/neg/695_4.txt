I've heard so much about this movie about how it was a great slash and one of more than 80 movies that hard fans of most slash films had to die. Well, I hired it and I should say that it keeps my attention as long as the suspense goes away for most slash films like "April Fools Day", "Friday 13th" and "Prom Night", but this movie is correct May be mentioned above with only the true enthusiasm and potential deficiencies from the stories going alongside characters as well. Unfortunately, the characters I got in this movie were strange people with violent hair, which slowly slowly wanders slowly and ultimately play its true climate. Another genetic jacket could be a person looking for messy scrapha, she could play more role in this movie, which can make this movie more attractive, instead, the movie played this guy just another disappointment where she is sleeping with her girlfriend and then her The part drops and the end finally closes him, I was frustrated at the end of his part. Since the real identity of the murderer goes away, when the identity is revealed, he laughed and said, "I just laughed, but everything was clear and he really made a real blur on himself and after that he created a boring character." The true purpose is revealed. This film should be for one or the other for all slash fans, but do not spend your hard working money with some rare power to find the list of collectors.
