'Sherabi' is a painful and gentle melodrama set in Georgia, the story of a young mother who has come out of jail after fighting for the drug-related accusations and cleanliness, back in her life and especially the love of her little girl, who is being cared for by her brother's family. The only reason to watch the film is Maggie Gilenhal, the actress in her career's top, who fits very well in this role and carries the whole picture on her shoulder. But the story is very straightforward and expected, and emotionally stressed on the wrong place - it is not enough, but I can fully think that I want to be sorry for the former and perhaps the future drug adder, whether the mother as the author and script writer, or the middle of the innocent child Wanted me to. Even the performance of Maggie Guilinahal could not convince me that I should not be thinking more about a child.
