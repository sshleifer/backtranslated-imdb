Well, the big money machine has done it again! Disney very impressively uses the season like yourself, who thinks that each of our videos should be stumped with Disney Monkey (good or bad). Why am I waiting for this "Seagels" to see Don Bluth on a bad day like Leonardo Davisi? There are three story lines in Cinderell 2 (already a poor choice!) Which of the favorite Disney works is not worthy of at least one linear story? These three, are just the end of the animation quality and near the story of the story, wherever I hope. The music is oppressive and modern (i.e. it will already be date in 2 years) and added nothing to the story. Why is everything updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular due to its timeliness, why is it respectful to the original with songs that reflect the same style and not the truth? Yes, I can not wait for a sign of sleeping beauty. For the music change based on Taichovsky's theme, we will get the music inspired by Britney Spears !!! So Disney, if you're listening, remember we're not all stupid kids here. How long have a bone or two fans been long enough to learn to throw the difference between the side and shit around?
