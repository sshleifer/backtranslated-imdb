This piece may have been praised 60 years ago, but it is one of the most racist films of all time with Native American Indians run by white racist. Right-wing Republican James Stewart was a real racist in real life like his real friend John Wein. In 1971, Steve Actor Hal Williams was expelled from "The Jimmy Stewart Show" (the series of short living consistently from Flopid), because Williams was black. That was not bad enough, this film is very date and annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Pebble. I was amazed even it was allowed. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
