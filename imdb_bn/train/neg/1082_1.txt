I think I have seen all the Grisham movies now and in general they are all very poor except Rainmaker, but this is so bad that it is incredible <br /> <br /> <br /> One of the movies where the character makes stupid irrational things that nobody will ever do. He is a lawyer for Christ's request Why not call the police when their children are absent Oh yes it's because the police hate everyone, so they ignore him and let him attack. <br /> <br /> When he is arrested for his murder, let him be free, he will be locked in a cell and a bail hearing is pending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> / <br /> <br /> 0/10 ?? One of the worst movies ever made.
