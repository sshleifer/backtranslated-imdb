It gets neat because it only stars David Hasselhoff. Well, let me bash it. Compared to rubbish they are coming horrible nowadays, this film is not very bad. It has beautiful Leslie Cumming. He is very hot, but can not speak very well. There is a great scene with him when he is raped supernaturally. She looks off her beautiful body. Linda Blair did nothing as well as Haselhoff. 3/10
