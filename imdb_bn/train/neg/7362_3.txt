An average TV movie quality, full story of religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who is good "I'm not just Cycos and our President," I'm not a client.) Who gets control of biochemical virus (think of the virus from the movie "The Rock" ). It is very bad for him that he was stuck in a bank building during the earthquake with the bank robbers and government agents are trying to stop him (influential physical, operated by light entertainment Wolf Larson, supported by Fred Dryer) with which the standard "wrong place wrong place" spunky female (Forever Erika Eleniak) and "lived as a wimp but died as a hero in the last minute" Brush (Brandon Carrer) The story of the standard background can sympathize with religious humor (police and wife killed the police several years ago in police operations). <br /> <br /> Basically a decent rainy day movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rent a rental.
