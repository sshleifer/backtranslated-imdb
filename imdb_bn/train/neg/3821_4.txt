What is the most annoying movie ever made? 'Cree and Whippers' geneocological nightmares? Phosphindroid acid sycodram? The unfinished black comedy 'The Last House Left?' I'm sure that for the part of the movie-loving people, sure that there is only one answer in the bind to the good ship Buster Keaton in their brain - one of their sound films. <br /> <br /> I do not know that my soul has become more animated in this film - the basis for the intensification of the complex and broad physical art of Ketone; The painful hesitation of this major film maker with dialogue - he is not a beautiful, ridiculous voice, or he can not make dialogue fun; It is true that the studio does not seem to have enough of him, and so he seems to be trying to remember his line before distributing it, which makes him only kettle, not his character, looks silly; Or is the insult of Cain caught in the sex trap, when he gave us the richest amount of romantic despair? <br /> <br /> I was most annoyed to know - to see the biggest comedian Buster Keaton in the movie, Jimmy Durante kept aside to observe doing his schtick. It is a terrible event that annoys Yar Dante's ear infront. <br /> <br /> MGM thinks that the best way to adapt Keton's words was to turn him into a Marx brother. Oral pandentry, broad, tired 'clouncing', ballistic skeptics, theater setting, chaos through chaos, and Thelma Todd. Keaton was not just like a comic, and where this plot can do harmful grooves and comfortable features, socially inactive professors of Booster, she is very much educated and predictable. <br /> <br /> What was needed was the 'l' m ', or allowed to experiment like langers in the rainy clay; He did not try to hold the tide like Chaplin. When a film like 'General' is ordered - hate with train - the damage becomes more evident. <br /> <br /> and on the patches in the flat side, the picture is not bad - there is a nice camera when a camera of the bus leaves Keaton alone in the train station; And the denouement, if rarely, is livelier than the original, what went before. Keaton is almost a delightful about the slow pace of a plot, which requires all the zip it could get. <br /> <br /> There is a film about loneliness, mentally paralyzed orders, the impact of education etc., which is struggling to get out. The best way to appreciate this film is not to mention the post of Professor TZ, but the talented Buster Keaton trapped in the Middle East prison, confused by the new technology, maintains a stoical grace of an untouchable fate (in this case studio). Looking at it, it became an excellent composition.
