As a military officer I was deeply offended by this picture. In my opinion, it is a disrespect for those who fought in the Vietnam War. I knew that the actual SF soldiers knew that this bad word was dissatisfied. The film was presented as satirical or even a cartoon (it was), it got better. But this was especially important to many of my people in foreign countries. As soon as it is heard, I go to Europe in the late 80's, where people and me Americans generally judge this film. Unreal? Hmm, let's see. A psycho-physiologic, muscle-bound creitin was stopped in prison for a secret mission to get rid of some US pawns. In the ongoing war, he killed almost 500 enemy soldiers. M60 machine guns which will never run out of air and will never be warm. And he'll never miss, with a hand held by a 32lb gun. I could go, but I got a headache. I gave it a 2/10 only because it is a little better than the Rambo III.
