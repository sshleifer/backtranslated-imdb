The premiere is the modern filmmaker explaining the novel about the love of the shepherds and the shepherds of the 17th century, when Drauda was of spiritual leaders. Working in three ages, miracles and abusive clothes and illogical spiritual events present many opportunities to introduce immunity, which contain really bad poems. Lovers are divided by the rigid loyalty of jealousy and stupid behavior of their behavior, through which cross-dressing and harmful harmful situations arise. This photo may be sunny as Monty Python piece, which is very similar to it, but the effort of roaming is very flat. The listener is smiling at the eyes but otherwise slowly. The last one push comes all and is really terrible. It's a trivial film and a waste of time while running your movie.
