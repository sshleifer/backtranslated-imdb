The basic plot of this movie is not bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater aterm to make the adma. However, despite the good acting of Robert Young and Eve Arden, the film is a mess. For this blame I place it as Joan Crofard or both of the directors or both, its performance just horrific. Instead of being a real person, a deer caught in highlights is an extraordinary disguise. In other words, he stares off in space and has a "Golly I SOOOO surprised" expression. Just a few minutes later it really became boring for me. Now, of course, I am not the only film to dislike his Crofford, as he did more than the movies like Johan Gutierrez or more of his later films such as BERSERK! My suggestion is to try a different Crouford Film - certainly was good.
