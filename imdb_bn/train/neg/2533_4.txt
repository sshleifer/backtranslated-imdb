I do not agree if I have all of the previous commentator Tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). The series of Jyotichi is a great character, which is similar to the great sword fighting and tension. <br /> <br /> I saw astrology 1-13,15,16; I believe 14 Zone 1 (USA) has not been released. Jyotishi outlaw was frustrating. The story line was complex, and many previous Zatoichi stories began to be a hodgepodge in the line. At one point, I was thinking, if I do not see a remake of the previous Jyotichi film. <br /> <br /> This picture was frustrating because it began to rely on the effect (a head rolling, thumb, blood) and Jyotishi's fame is less respected. All previous films have been successful based on story and action, and followed a great following without enjoying the effects. <br /> <br /> I just hope the remaining astrologers will not follow the same trend. This is the first Zatoichi film from his studio. I recommend all the Jyotishi movies before - and recommend them.
