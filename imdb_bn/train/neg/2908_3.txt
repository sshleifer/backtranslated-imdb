Based on Gabriel MÃ¡rquez's books and it can be great literature, this movie-adaptation really sucks like a fight against sleep rather than enjoying some painter ingredients. This story is about an old couple, whose son died and living a life that was heavily influenced by poverty and where the main character is a cock which hopes that one day will bring some money for an upcoming cocktail. I do not have any mood to spread more words in this vague motivated piece, only you can see Salma Hayek here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen? No Gracias ...
