During this time a great film of this waste is a completely unnecessary remix. Except for Perry's backflashes, something new or original is not added, which is small interest. This is the feeling of the first film document and the raw urgency that made it work. Also added to the painting mainstream sharp quincy jones soundtrack. I do not understand any high ratings for this. It's pretty bad. Why does anyone waste this time making money or making money and why I waste time watching it?
