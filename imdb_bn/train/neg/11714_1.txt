UK police operates in the United States, all of which are operated on the teeth and you know that when CID officials change on uniform, they will stop working and go down! This "real" UK has become one of the most unreal movies with the worst picture in the police, which has never been foisted to the obscure public. I can see that Mr Snipes may require money to pay his tax bill but what a good actor like Charles Dancing is doing it in a mystery. Worse than bad budget "B" 50's film. I will never return one hour and half a day. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
