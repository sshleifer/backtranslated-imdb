I can always say when there's going to be some hits. I see or hear it, and get a good feeling. I do not get a better feeling of watching previews. I was not enthusiastic about this movie, and I'm not surprised that it has turned into 100 worst movies here. I was really convinced. <br /> <br /> The first thing that threw me was the title. I have no problem with Ibnexis (I'm a straying black), but for a movie, they can use a good title, and for this time it can use a title that does not have bad grammar. I heard the conversation, saw the acting and could face all I could. <br /> <br /> I also think the dance movie theme has become overdone. At least "you got to serve" my opinion was better than this. Even the soundtrack did not thrill me.
