All right, I found this movie in my father's old pill movie and it looks pretty like the cover but the film really sucked !! Okay, the first story was very good with swimming, but it took some time to enter, then the boy was completely annoyed! It was not even awesome! Her dream sounds like a baby's sleeping story. Then there was a complete reversal of news girls. I'm sure somebody will bring news to the people and ask him to go with you. But it became cold where he had torn her and she was in the hospital and she saw her on TV and she told all her junk. Later, there was a beautiful story about the man who brought the dead people back. He's so stupid, I'm not going to say anything about this. The last was the best. It was not scary, but the concept of the story was quite calm. Yes, the girl has fallen and she killed all her classmates or something. Then when they are telling their dreams to each other, then the victims will see the bus on their bus (Hellahhahhhhhhhhhhh) and they all see the bus from their dreams. The end
