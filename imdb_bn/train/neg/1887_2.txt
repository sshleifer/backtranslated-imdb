Today, I've archived so many reasons why so many people complained about modern film, in which I faced a strange statement: "The development of the character in the new film was almost as good or not attractive." Depending on the film (s) of the question, it can be considered for many things, especially the generic special effects and waste-driven Hollywood waste such as the War of the Worlds, but in the leading field, the social industry in this uncertain effort and the "art" in the movie For a deadly struggle, it's a movie like the days of the scuff. <br /> <br /> I get very tolerance for movies, no matter how neutral or pointless. Find them (well, long ones like Underbel Ruble and Dougel, I've had a la alpha dog and wild feel wild to sit through Wild West). I've closed this movie in 45 minutes, which is more than 30 minutes more than me. I was not interested in any of the characters and undoubtedly did not cross the thin screen of neutral deterrence. In an effort to say something about the fog of the society, this film is very easy to sense, confident, and exploitative behavior. Imagine, I have seen many annoying films on the same topic, but there are many good films about depressed, sad people (happiness, gamo, kids, singles, storytelling, inexcusable) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. There were no other than the abuse of the eighth classroom for the society on dog days, in fact, it was decided to ignore any true intelligence like humans and instead make a neutral, terrible, and frankly unreasonable effort to work in "art". It's not the characterization of unknown or shiny observations in society's fogs, it's not just boring and caring.
