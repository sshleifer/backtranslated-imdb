Just saw this movie, and what time wasted The movie was expected and slow. It basically carries bad news about Mormon which drives the Church approved basketball. Rather than watching this movie, I had a root canal. Camio performance is probably driven by sponsorship / financing. This was possible due to the potentially harmful behavior of the film when the church approved basketball was shown by Marmes, but due to PG rating, the actual nature of the philosophy could not be transferred to the film. The acting is awesome except for Clint Howard and Fred Wald. This image of Tharal Baylie was completely unnecessary.
