Can anyone tell me how a comedy in this movie ?? If I did not go with me, I would have slept and wanted to return my money. I love Gane Paltrow, but it was like a wrong set. I like most chick flicks, but I hate this one This is the only time I saw so much clay and did not start. Those outfits were way overdone. Nobody speaks that way anymore and I do not think they are even then. The dancing part was terrible. My ex-later said to me ... "Did not like that part? Or do you think it was not censorship?" I just said yes to leave her feeling. Now I know why we did not get married. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
