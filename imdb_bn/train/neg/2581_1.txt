First of all, I start by coming out of my own personal feelings to say that I hate so-called comedies where every single character is written and acting so stupid that if they are all the result of inbreeding you are harmful. <Br> <br /> Now I will say that I saw the first three American pic movies and when they were not the most amazing movies they ever saw, they were right (and three "complete subtle" Pie Presents "films compared to America) , I am still forced to ask what they think when creating this film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acceptable What is the use? <br /> <br /> Who allowed the final script (and what was smoking when that person approved it)? <br /> <br /> Finally, why someone thinks that the theater is released It is worth getting, depending on where the average cost of admission is between $ 10 and $ 15, where did you go live live, blockbuster or wall mart? <br /> <br /> There is so much confusion with this movie that M can not write a comprehensive review because it will exceed the most allowed words in this forum so I'll just touch <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> I said, viewers say that he often sits on the screen with this intelligent reminder of his screen, "I know it is the INN mango   মজার নই এবং আমি আমার প্রতিভা নষ্ট করছি কিন্তু হেই আমি এটির জন্য অর্থ প্রদান করছি যাতে কেয়ার হয় "তিনি এমনকি তার কোন রসিকতা মজার করে তুলতেও চেষ্টা করেন না (তিনি সত্যিই এই আবর্জনা থেকেও বেশি যোগ্য)। <br /> <br /> Since most of the rest I mentioned above are awesome, some of them are really great TV shows, a character from Tyrone Savage (classic Canadian series wind et on my back back) is intolerable and annoying (something that he Can teach tropical skin diseases) that you want to die on the screen, slow and painful death, Cree Stupor MacDonald (NCIS, Law and Order) screen and spoils what talent he has in this picture. Perhaps the next film in this series will be a soft-core porn with a style line so that they can get closer to the MPAA, and by rating this movie the incompetence of nudity, with obscenity and silently disables sexually explicit content The rating board has been drunk or for its rating, while reviewing this movie, Drugs Should be narcotics). It is interesting that fifty years ago when Wes Craven submitted a nightmare to MMA Street in MMA, its ratings forced the footage of fifty seconds to complete the footage (I believe it was a part), in a sericone casting it was a breasted casting There was no alternative to avoiding getting X rating or the film was not released, <br /> <br /> But this kind of non- Today's ratings of the logical offensive trash can be rated because it is all comedy, if this movie was a drama or horror movie with such content, there was a huge sting on the content and it would be horrific x rating. <br /> <br /> The last word is annoying to me, this film is written for playing twelve year old kids like a wet dream, it is very young and unusually straw, almost every exposure situation that is supposed to be transferred to the body. It's a mile away, with a telegraph of so-called telegraph plots, and the so-called characters are stereotypes.   িরিওোটাইপগুলির কেবলমাত্র স্টিরিওোটাইপস নয়, প্রায়শই বিরক্তিকর যৌন রেফারেন্স এবং অযৌক্তিক যৌন আচরণের অপ্রয়োজনীয় দৃশ্যগুলি মনে রাখে না মনে হচ্ছে এই চলচ্চিত্রটি অসম্পূর্ণ প্রথম বছরের একটি কম ভাড়া চলচ্চিত্র স্কুলে স্ক্রিপ্ট লেখার ক্লাসে হ্যাক করা হয়েছে বলে মনে হচ্ছে। <br /> <br /> It's a long and short time, while killing this series is that it will get more stupidas cross and offensive, this pie road is filled with apples.
