This movie should never have been made. <br /> <br /> What is the shame of the budget? <br /> <br /> <br /> Please recruit a believer actor and make a correct film. Very thin plot, and incompatible lines. Almost sunny, and it's a shame for an action movie ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You watched it, and it was not eligible to run again 3 or 4 times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
