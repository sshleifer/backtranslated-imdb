There is absolutely no story in this production. Acting shameful. Promised Dutch television Sophie Hillbrand Star will not add this movie to her cv. His acting is far from shameless and personally I think he has exceeded the limits of professional discipline; She relates with the way she expresses herself in this movie. This film has too many unnecessary nudity, pornographic scenes and rude language. It also shows a wrong image of the Netherlands (mostly as a film). Do not be bothered to see this movie: waste time, money wastage and embarrassing record for Hillbrand, which proved to be better with its closure on screen.
