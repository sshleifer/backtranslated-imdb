Well Hollywood is not liberal. <br /> <br /> I'm obviously lying because it's happening. I am a conservative but in politics I will be out of my opinion. This film was anti-bush, anti-Middle Eastern, big oil campaign, but why it was not bad. <br /> <br /> I give off where credit is given. I saw this movie open night because I like this kind of movie and the head of political sciences in collage. Cinematography was excellent and acting was as good as I could say <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I tested and 138 got an IQ But no matter how I've tried, there's no way I could tell the story of the movie story and what characters could piece together. <br /> <br /> The story and scene were increasingly incoherent and weakly organized. <br /> <br /> To get the full depth of this until one of these movies, PHP is a long time to see, which can be very good, I do not think exactly what's going on. <br /> <br /> Which is understandable because if you want to create a political argument and do not criticize, then your argument to criticize becomes impossible! If you can not shine them with brightness, then their bull is annoyed with the S.
