Disney's 1996 Live-Action Remake 101 is a sequel of Dammal (actually a rebuilding) Cravella Devil (Glenn Close) was released from prison after being "cured" by the psychologist named Dr. Pavlov (Ough!). But when Cruel heard Big Big Bell's toll, "healing" broke up and he again went crazy looking into duplication and making himself a perfect coat. <br /> <br /> This movie is so diverse that it was designed to sell the Dime till the end of the Disney Marketing Machine from the beginning of the "Thanksgiving Family Scroll" movie. Glen off as CraLa over-over-over-the-job. Lum script, continuous makeup, baked in the end cake - I hope they gave him a very big pitch. <br /> <br /> (It is not saying that in the world where you will find a fur coat factory, a bakery with Ruby Goldberg assembly line and a candle restaurant in the same candlelight - as you are doing with the last episode of this movie? ) Of course, the real stars of the film are supposed to be dogs. They serve the film as "Macaulay Kulkins", highlighting all the stupid "Home Alone" songs in Villen. (Brooding them in the crotch, run on their hands with baggage carts, squirting with the interval of etc, etc., etc., etc.). I must admit, the dog was fairly good actor - much better than the man <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gerard Depardieu is completely lost as a freaked out French Fourier in this movie. Two people "dog lovers" - reintroduced from the previous movie, but different actors - completely annoying. At Italian restaurants, during their Spaghetti dinner, the film shows two lovers, and dinner shows from their dogs, "Lady and Tramp". I said to myself, "Oh, do not go there!" I was expecting half to ridicule people for the "Lady and the Tramp" dinner scene - such as Charlie Shane "Hot Shots: Part Duke" - "Spaghetti Strong Kiss", putting meatballs in his nose, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Good. But they are the only good thing in the movie. It is an intolerable drawback to the rest.
