The critics and the rest of MSST 3 are the best part of this otherwise horrible movie (and only memorable scenes): The bad guys in Maria (described by Ben Gazara) have similar rape-in-the-shower scenes. Mentioned, later killed through TJ's incompetence). Perhaps a word of rape is very strong, "prison-meeting ceremony" may be more appropriate. The retreat of this opportunity, yet to be forced to meet the "Ben Gazada" hidden brain brought the hanging girls to his pool. 30-year-old blonde teaches him, but our villains should be beaten by him, because the tradition is going on at that time. His first step is to try to drown him, until his mafia don is beneficial to stop him. Like the girl who does not like in high school, but still wanted to get physical knowledge in any way ... let's just say that she got her after in the UP caban.
