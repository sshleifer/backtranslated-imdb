All the fun things happening in this season are based on the main character Jim, bad parents, bad husbands or usually very selfish. How could that be fun? Of course, a character in a sitcom must be defective, but the character of Jim is very disrespectfully defective. <br /> <br /> and why? My guess is because it "he should now be good". Jim is not a stupid guy, he can take care of things and he got the opportunity to do so. But he does not like. When she does not like to play with her kids, she does not want to buy a "conscious product" and she liked her favorite when she kept her relatives down. <br /> <br /> Other characters seem to be in the series only, so anyone can be shocked by Jim. If Cheryl was a real person, then he kept him many years ago and did not live with the death for eight years. But curious, he is just a catalyst for Jim's quirky middle class extreme extreme selfishness.
