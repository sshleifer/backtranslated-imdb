About twenty minutes in this movie, I was already bored. Quite simply, these characters were fairly dull. Occasionally, something will be enjoyable, but then things will be slow again. Thankfully, my patience was finally rewarded and the end of this movie was not bad at all. However, it was not good enough to just sit in the first ninety minutes. So, I would say that the movie was fairly moderate and I would be disappointed by considering Cast Caste's talent.
