Despite this movie's "independent" status, the stupid Hollywood version of the relationship of annoying mother-daughter. It was not bad at first, but sometime during the movie - almost the time the girl goes with that girl, I think - it becomes a cheese mother and daughter bracket movie. I'm sorry, but I do not know of any mother who has such a relationship with their daughter ... maybe even better.
