'Yes say' is a flicker that you expect it to be getting better, but it never happens. This is the 'uninspired psychopath decides to put an innocent couple in danger', so direct videos are the creators of the movie. <br /> <br /> The conversation is fierce and has been poorly translated into several places. Acting poorly played, particularly by fragments of pieces, played by Joong-Hoon Park. She thinks that she does not shine and tries to talk in deep music, she is threatening her character, when it actually does make her feel a little easier. <br /> <br /> This plot is notable, it is absurd beyond all beliefs. 'Heroines' do not seem so weird that their henchmen threatens to kill them. 'Nironie' twice managed to miss Wilell, one foot away from her. The police car remembers a police checkpoint (wearing a shirt covered in blood and wearing a bloody head bandage) by showing a burnt body in the seat of the passenger. The vault is torn off, attached to a snail and stuck through the pitchfork, but they are not severely affected by these due to injuries. And even that horrible 'wrapping' does not end up. Shish <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only plus point for this movie is for me, Mr. Chu. Who is so beautiful, but no other than a middle actress. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a bad writing to copy 'The Hittor' and 'Spurlos', but everyone involved involves failure to escape because of the lack of talent.
