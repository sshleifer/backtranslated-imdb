It was hateful and painful. A waste of a waste! I swear, the audience (1/2 full) two hilals in 90 minutes This is not false. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, okay. I feel sorry for the person (actor) if he thinks of this mess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With ridiculous and sweet, but with no purpose. "Romance" with John was completely incredible.
