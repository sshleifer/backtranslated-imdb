15 years ago, Power Rangers was a show that spread the nation, especially the youth. When I was a 3-year-old Philippine child, I would see this show on ABS-CBN (Channel 2 there) every Friday. When the movie came out in 1995, it's astonishing to see my father and his cousin. My grandfather couple also sent me a "childhood" box of electricity rangers (including easy-to-create magenta images and stapled toys of rangers). I even played video games, and liked only one of them ("MMRR: Fighting Edition"), which was really sad. However, a steeping stone was set on my interest in the robot series (especially the Enemy Mech series "Gundam") that I am 18 years old now, I think this show is now very cheesy to me. To prove this, I bought a 2-set DVD collection with "MMRR: The Movie" and "Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie" and took a trip under the memory lane and saw both of them. As I was, "Oh, how awful it is. Just another junk of attack for me." For all of my generation, this is not a show that you want to see again and again. I'm not saying to leave it behind for the rest of your life, but sometimes it's not a bad thing anymore, is not it? Instead of "Power Rangers", I will make some recommendations like "Mobile Fighter J Gundam" (highly recommended), "Nizya Sansi Tobacco" (Urna Ninja Robots), even the Original Center, which is the "foundation of Power Rangers".
