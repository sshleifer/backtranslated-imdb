This movie is the worst one I've ever seen. Pure drivel How can someone develop a connection with the heroine, or have sympathy for her, out of me I felt a cesoid person with unlimited personality disorder was watching a case history. Just terrible <br /> <br /> In its brightest light, it can be seen as production and "art" film effort - unless I find it an art for my life <br /> <br /> <br /> If this woman lived in today's world, she would have been pushed towards the psychological institution, and psychiatric medicine was treated with a few days of treatment. That, or simply stands on the street and allowed to become a bag female. Other characters in this movie were not released in any of them - and tried to help her to be an actress - she was not saying anything about her pathology that she had any useful attributes that made her very good.
