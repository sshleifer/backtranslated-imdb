Guillian Anderson is a proud, driven, carrier woman who chose Danny Diar for a fun night. After a stupid accident in rural areas, they were attacked brutally. After the recovery, and after an interview with one of the attackers, their thinking goes back to vengeance ... <br /> <br /> I thought "Strehethhounds" was terrible. Violent, brutal, misogynistic and unpleasant. If I could not have the phrase uncommon, then I would say "Strehathheld" a video that is notorious. Of course this was not a budget publication movie in the 1980s, in the dark days of the video. Actually I do not know the "Strehathheld" movie is released. <br /> <br /> I'm not motivated. I do not think of sex and violence in movies, but they must be a good plot or b) good filming or c) to be married to a movie. "Straightheads" were not. No progress in plot or character and very left unknown and unsaid. Thankfully "straightheads" went faster somewhere. It was only 80 minutes long. <br /> <br /> It was shameful, because there was an interesting germ of the film, especially the third interesting changes in the plot. How often do I say it, but it can be good if it is done properly. What a shame I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Deer, but they were hiding in the picture with this picture. She, especially, is very undervalued (and still fits specially). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a good British revenge movie, rent or rent Shane Mounds "Dead Man Juices". This is a little masterpiece. Last weekend I was supposed to see her instead of "This Is England". C Syria Syria ...
