Pretty funny, though the comedy-drama that a strange young man hopes to fly like a bird through a Houston Asteroid. Robert Oatman-directed Kosie-comedy has loaded so much with strange characters that it starts cracking from weight. Some innovators of cinematography, Shelley Duval is a sewing solder of her debut as a tour guide, and Sally Kellerman is looking at every inch of the viewpoint of a "mother bird" as a Buddhist court. (Imagine Altman and producer Lou Adler are explaining his role!). On the leadership side, Bud Cort is - again "Harold and Mood" - a real core; Not saying, saying, Michael J. Pollard, craft geeky, sloppy and irrational, managed to pull off a tough job. Unfortunately, it is one of Altman's misfires. He can combine a cast and shodges like someone else, but he should be fired with some confused encouragement and he wanders down. ** **** to
