My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which I think are quite objectionable, because I try to judge other people in this movie. Please be gentle to other people's opinions. Obviously, the nature of knitjas' work is not understood, so my comments have changed completely. <br /> <br /> I think this is a bad film for many reasons. Subject: One should be very careful about making a film about a philosopher who is still not understood by the people and brings enthusiastic discussions among colleagues. One thing philosopher agreed that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a film about his life, which certainly includes his 'ideas', is something that should be very careful, or especially, should not be done. The knowledge begins with the intelligence you do not know. Someone might think that this is not a movie review, but the film is not about a mythical character, it's about the life of a person who was around the world yesterday and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about tomato, I can express my thoughts about the story, but I can also publish the selected topic about tomatoes. When they make a movie about the real event, then it is a responsibility for the producers. Especially in such a case and this responsibility was not taken. <br /> <br /> Screenplay: One of the first things I noticed was a ridiculous pronunciation. Why? It distracts from what should be about; Nietzsche and he found the truth. It does not help putting things right in a geographical perspective or time! Come, make the right English or better; German! Even Mel Gibson got the exact same piece ... His characters have some unpleasant words in the parrot. <br /> <br /> Second, it played well. <br /> <br /> 3D, not to be an actor to portray Assange Natz. Bad cutting <br /> <br /> 4th, way off of events. <br /> <br /> and so on. It is a waste of celluloid.
