Jabber Nation 2004 <br /> <br /> Hey, I got bored. I looked at my Comcastic little box to find a movie to see. Zombie race? Hey, I love the zombie movie. There are some sort of rituals related to the filmmaker's description. Funny thing does not warn me to show this movie. I could use that advice. <br /> <br /> Like the zombie race trolle 2 it is completely unnamed. It does little (if anything, depending on your perspective) with zombies, and takes place all over a city. This movie is an infamous police, who works as badly as possible (often trying to suck it), where he arrests women for inferior bullies and then kills them. Yup, he is a serial killer police. This image is not only flawed to think of a zombie flick, it completely misleads its serial killer incidents. Serial killers enjoy murder, they live for it and they become down and private. This man finds women, and injures them with some poison. He is not even sex with the body or it is not throwing it. Talk boring! Finally, one of the five women who killed her was given Odu protection and without any apparent reason, five returned to life and killed this man. All of them buried and went into the sea, but they did not know that they all dressed in clean clothes. Then the women do very bad things and take revenge on them. Oh yes <br /> <br /> This image was a shit in every section. Strap acting, shit writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. Women do not look like a zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up across the eyes, it is considered to be a real definition of a zombie creation. They can all speak, behave, think, and work perfectly man. Gigabytes are weaker than many PG-13 films and nudity short. You see the balances of balances in the order ... then right after the same breast! Go figure Just one actress guesses are willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly designed that you can see that they stopped portraying the interior walls of where they were painting inside. You can see pipes and bad lighting and extra spell set up and even if you're not blind you fail the manager. Clearly, it's time to waste <br /> <br /> 1/10
