From the moment Christopher Lee puts a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know that you have a stinker in your hand! This film was potential. If all of Sludge is not an interesting movie below, there are residues that can be made in a decent movie. The final product, though, is a real mess. Along with undesired nudity and some very attractive women, Hawling II winds up a ridiculous excuse for a horror movie. Christopher Lee gives a mustache to his credibility, but even he can not raise it on the raised level. <br /> <br /> If any other film in this series is not seen, it will be compelled to face this critic. One part of the fact that one event is an actual series. We start a funeral for a letter of origin, and within the first ten minutes we prepare ourselves to fight for the war with a small group of small heroes in the trainwainia. The film is fairly well-paced, and there are many dead spots. There is action; It's not just well pictured. A punk band music called a brilliant spot bubble. Although their songs are mostly played, it is rather interesting. <br /> <br /> There are many more problems with this movie. First off, acting is worse than sad. Christopher Lee is good enough, but where it ends. Both Reb Brown and Annie McEnroe are missing everything you want for such characters. Writing bad, performing unexpected, and direction amateurish. A couple have excellent special effects gimmicks, but the weight of their weight is far more than sugar. Sybil Danning is nice to look at, but its performance performance is less than satisfactory. Jude Owen sees the part that she plays, but her voice and acting are uncomfortable to say the least. Most conversations are an obsolete language that can or may not be Latin. <br /> <br /> I like the general idea of ​​the story. I always enjoy the stories of true believers in the war of evil unexpected forces. One scene where the good son is traveling through a dark forest of a small party and is also shooting down a bunch of Veruwalov is even exciting kind. Kind of Perhaps a big budget or a good director can make the film a bit more compulsory. <br /> <br /> <br /> According to this article, the sensors at youtube.com are still not taking the last credits with crib dancing. When the babel is playing the song closes its top several times! When you can do it!
