Well, I have to be generous and give it 2. It was originally due to an ineffective hole in the shirt of the woman where she had breasts. I found that gentle amusing. Moreover, this film does not do anything more than a few good smiles to a friend. Interesting, if you want to comment on someone with "mystery science theater", it's not better than 2. 2 and 2 are pretty beautiful.
