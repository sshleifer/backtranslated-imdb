Photography is so dark I thought I was dead on the screen. I think I saw half of the movie. Yet, it was not weakly created and interesting. I did not get the story with the title "Black Widow". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but the first few frames do not involve enough to take care of. Especially for Wilhelm Duffer, I hired a movie and it was tragic that he spoiled his talent. I do not believe that Gaeda has researched the film for long enough to develop a large motion picture in Kolagand. She might be interesting and develop into an actor but she has done a lot in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationship does not seem trustworthy. I do not understand why another character is not even introduced into the plot.
