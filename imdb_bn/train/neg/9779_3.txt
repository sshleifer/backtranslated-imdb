Continuous stupid, "budget picture" of a budget is mainly designed to showcase the characteristics of the hello girl - not a bad idea in itself - but it should be embarrassed for everyone associated with it. Misleading "script", an elementary-school Christmas sponsor, inactive "action" scenery, usually misleading documentary director Louis Claude Stewem - is not sure if a comedy is produced, the performance will not pass, the war's futility or a learing And A (early in the 1960's, in any case, however) on the great body of Eve Maire A philosophical treatise - and a general air and a lack of wind. The eve's daughter is strung to watch her stuff strat, but that's quite a lot.
