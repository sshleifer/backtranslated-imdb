Every good story added to Broadway music should be "developed"? Apparently those who think that could not come up with their own plots have classic libraries just for looting. I admit that the Oliver Twist and similar stories are not my favorites, because it is a fact that Dickens has often written things that have vomited you enough, and it was just a great example ... so take this serious story and get annoying music Add up and camping it up with every character of mincing bobbyies from reproduction orphan boys and suddenly it is uplifting it? Oh Bring me a basin. <br /> <br /> My rating comes from four star casting, which I can compare with my fair lady. Each of these films had a story that could be proud of a game version, but they must go and sing them (see above charges). Unlike My Fair Lady, those who sing here can really do it and they'll give us the voice of Oliver Reed song (forgive if you forgive me). <br /> <br /> I'm the biggest complaint I have. Why is everyone really embarrassed everyone without really shameless by putting stupid songs in good stories? Soully this good effect has been done. Generally it destroys stories. It did this one. The jury has still come out with the fact that this story is worth saving, but it is impossible to tell with all those cunning.
