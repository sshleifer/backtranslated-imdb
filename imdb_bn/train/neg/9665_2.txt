Funny? Hardly The film's 'scientific proof' movie provides for its point (which is mainly the Jewish cancer), so stupid and hair, it is almost ridiculous (if we do not know what happened in the era). <br /> <br /> is important? No I can not imagine the Germans (even at that time of horror) to like or believe this movie. Compare it to Triumf des Willens of Riefenstahl. Now I was fascinated by the movie I was in. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Mullah and the murderer. Only a humiliating mind can do this filmmaker's eyes. Ohhhh I do not know M. Hitler's favorite movie, right? <br /> <br /> No, it's just plain stupid. Even this is why the Nazi-propaganda style 2/10.
