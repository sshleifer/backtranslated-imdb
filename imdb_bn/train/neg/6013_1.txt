I've read every book of the series on the left side of the series, and the movie rarely judges them. Of course, I saw bad movies, but it was incredibly frustrating. This movie has made a good MST3K episode. This script was a horrific adaptation of the book, and the actors actually felt reading their lines instead of telling them. The letters were tough and unlike. The effect was cheesy, and looked terrible mesh. The last was horrible. Firstly, it was not even in the way of all the way through the first book. Second, it's made in no sense. If you do not read the book, then you have no idea what's going on. The film's students, as I have ever seen in the movie, are over. I'm really sorry to pay for this movie. By some miracles, it is widely released, they should completely overhaul it and take Hollywood. The two film producers of Wang, and Wanabay's director should leave the professionals to make the film.
