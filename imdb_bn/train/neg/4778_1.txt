The worst show I've seen in the year I believe that due to its exhaustion, the TV should be closed. So stupid I could be frustrated when I watch it. (Although I do not see it because it is poor), Gupta: when Mac says that he can not eat sugar, he eat sugar in another episode. Almost everything in the world is sugar! Episode "Eddie Slayer" When Edie shouts in Terrence, she falls in Dhaka twice, she falls down on the fall she falls, she falls next to it. What stupidity I can not even say even the Foster home word I even made a song with my band about how annoying this show is. Byyyyyyyyeeeee
