The story has gone, because Nautofix has delayed me to send my DVD, so I went to the analog rental site called "Blockbuster Video" so that they could recognize you. Actually, for the sake of your viewing, they have 150 copies of their latest Lam films but I still do not want to see any of them. So I saw BT kills the killer, in his lonely interests. I like watching movies based on serial killers. This is the only part of humanity that I can never understand, so I want to see that kind of thing. Anyway I switched this DVD first and second from second to second, it sucks. I am my bf I'm sitting with And we like, "What's such a shit?" Unsurpassed camera operation, horrible performance, you are surprised by the fact that a woman is killed in any scene, if she rather gabs quietly, then a rabbit stuffed under her throat. I wonder if this is a hard-on for crap. There is nothing decent about this "film". The director should say, "Do you own a frickin tripped?" Each shot was brutally flaky. The music was horrible. They decided one day to make movies. They were probably gathering people from Walmart to meet them and "work" for them. Just plain horror If you make such a movie, then you should not have to do what you should do for your hobbies - it should not be made in DVD RENAL outlets for movie buffs like me. When you have a party of your party and comes out of interesting things to entertain with them, then left home for your home .... Then you break down your BT Kila's picture and say, "Once I want to see this vague movie ? "
