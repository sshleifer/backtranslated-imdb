I rented this movie for the first time on DVD and saw it after reading a review about it. So, after 15 minutes of watching, I noticed that something went wrong with this movie; It's terrible! <br /> <br /> I think Eli Roth (Mr. Director) thinks that all the characters in this picture were stupid, so the movie would be fun ... (So stupid, it's funny ...? wrong!) To watch and learn from horror tricks such as "Freit Night", "The Lost Boys" and "The Review of Living Dead"! Who is funny <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fovere" because I registered at www.imdb.com so I can relieve my thoughts of dissatisfaction about it. <br /> <br /> I've decided to watch the movie a second time! <And make a note for my partial "review" so that the movie can be shown to be stupid. "Living Evil" (horror) or "Dude, where's my car?" (Comedy) I can rise again and still enjoy! But this ...! <br /> <br /> How bad can any script and director ??? This is bad. Here are the horrific scenes of Chronicle: <br /> <br /> In the early scenes we see Henri, who does not understand that his dog lying on his hanging head and lying on the ground with dead-shining scenes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wood? ")" Nothing. "The script warns the person with the bearded wood only for" mystery ". <br /> <br /> Then 5-pack" smartest ", Bart, gives us an example of a forest fire start. Henry asks for help, and wants to break the record using "F-word" in this movie.Henny looks awful, because Burt starts spanking: Bart: "Do not shoot me!" Forgot to add: "... with my bbby gun!") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Burt goes back to the cabin, But now suddenly decided to go out on the walk! Mercy cleverly started the camerator Bitter before (a moment of clarity of change?) Burt does not mention a word about Henry because the fool thinks that he is a Bibi Forest <br /> <br /> Later, five Estupidos sit near their campfire, another weirdo shows with his dog. (What is the warning about those forests? It is weird ... and their dogs are filled !) They let him sit with them just because they have a lot of authentic filling bags. (Their brains are completely drunk! No doubt they are all dumb!) At the last moment we will see this forgotten letter alive ... <br /> <br /> Henry shows up in his cabin, (Note: He is always in his cabin From a few yards to laughing away!) Looks bad, almost like a zombie, covered in goo! He said he needed a doctor. But Young Einstein's refusal to help the poor sucker. He gets his unlocked truck which is in progress in his key. Henry is almost smart enough to think about the Hell Drive but instead starts pooching the dashboard, seat and blood on the windows. The Fantastic picking is going on, including armed: a Bibi song, a knife, a baseball bat (* hah? Sometimes trying to play baseball in the middle of the jungle), a poker, and a (pesticide?) Spray - a single, unarmed, and terrible sick People can fight (Fantastic script!) Burt drives the car with a shot of his BB song, which is possible only through the mind of director Eli Roth. "What am I supposed to do now?" Burt yells his defense Jeff and Paul tried to defeat Henry with their bat and poker but instead the truck's Windows missed and crashed. Henry walks towards fools, who say: "She is coming to us!" (Thanks for the info, I'm gonna see it! I do not think that he wants to harm you!) Mercy spray in his eyes, making Henry yelp! And our "hero" Paul touched Henry's hand with a burning log from Campfire, which he was shamelessly while inside the cabin! (Where's all the knowledge gone? I think Canvas has started to take his toll! :-) Henry turns into a human torch and goes away by screaming. <br /> <br /> Next day, Bart and Jeff Head out for a mechanic. And Marcy herself decides to "go for help" in the woods, all of the woods, as Paul is behind with Karen ... is not she fools intelligent? Marie could have been with Karen and Paul because Jeff and Bart already "was going for help"! <br /> <br /> I suddenly saw a canoe raising mariasi on a huge and dense river, how I kept my opinion! How did he get a canoe? He does not even know where he is going! However, he goes to the river and finds a very large and apparently abandoned cabin and, like most horror movies, goes inside the cabin and says, "Hello? Who's there?" Birt suddenly pops from behind a furniture and scares her (and my first). And as well as Jeff, comes along as well. How do they get here? They swim across the river ??? How the script is brainless! What do you see <br /> <br /> The deputy will show Paul to Winston Cabin. He somehow did not notice the blood of their trucks. It takes about 35 minutes to watch and I have decided to stop torturing myself and pop out the DVD. (Before I open my eyes! ... now, it's funny!) <br /> <br /> If you love this movie, then do yourself a favor and "Fred Night", "The Lost Boys" or "The Living Dead Return ". Then you will see that they are more entertaining than ... things. Even "poisonous avengers part 2" is a lousy film, more fun than "cabin fove".
