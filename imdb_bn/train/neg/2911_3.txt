Stop the almost lingering of artifacts around as much action and cloys as authentic dialogue. Tom Hans seems to be asleep with Bruce Willis in the Battle of Huma. Tom, you can not simply give a character depth to your mouth! Contents do not warrant histrionic acting by Paul Newman. It is a broom wrapped in a coating of atom bombs.
