This film was right, but it is obviously losing the claim of "how born" homosexuals, especially when a woman can get out of an unhappy marriage and fall into another woman's arms. It seems almost like Kate's gender choices are turned on and off like a switch, this film seems a little straightforward. Also, similar to movies trying to push an agenda, it is unfortunate that those characters on the photo had question or denial on gay gay lifestyle, they were labeled as "bigots". And there was no happy medium. It did not have Kate's friend and relatives fully embraced him, they completely shunned him. This is not usually the interaction between homosexuals and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a game of passion and value that comes in. It is possible to respect people who love people and treat them the way they should be treated. Sadly, the movie did not show any such interaction. For a movie trying to show tolerance and recognition, it hit me as a very intolerable movie! In the end, Kate definitely decides all these years that she wants to stay with Mac and everything is hunky dory - is it actually gay? Come on!
