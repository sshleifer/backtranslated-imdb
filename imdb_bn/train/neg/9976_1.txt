The first scenario of 'Problem Child' is to nibble a baby in the mouth of a nun. For this movie, that's wicked. A nasty, middle-cheerful 'comedy', it's so inexperienced on so many levels that the beggar believes. John Ritter is a kind of father who takes a child out of hell and is attracted to maintaining his status in the one-note, annoying performance and the surrounding attack of lively humor. And what are Jack Warden doing in this world? Dennis is driven slowly under the direction of Dogen, and when it is done with obscenity, it is astonished by the efforts of mentality, the film becomes so bad that it is a wonderful experience. But do not mind everything. The bottom line of the whole thing is Michael Oliver, the most annoying and unlucky kids actor to hit the screen ?? Trust me, you want to impose him on your face.
