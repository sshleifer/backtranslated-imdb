I do not have a great fan of Rome / coms at the best times. Some have been quite good (dream check for an insomniac), but it is only less but less. <br /> <br /> With 100 minute running time, I hope more than 1 laugh every 30 minutes. The only real stomach smile when men are strangers and friends oddly support Lee's character. <br /> <br /> I can say AVOID. I gaurentee you $$ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There are at least 10 other movies. <br /> 3 out of 3 (and only I'm a big Li fan)
