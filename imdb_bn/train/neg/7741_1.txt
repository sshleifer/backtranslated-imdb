Josh Hartnet's dead eyes, his thick writing, and Harrison Ford are comedians in a friend-copy! Here are 3 reasons to hate, avoid it and use 116 minutes of your life well. <br /> <br /> Funny-cop films are fun. However, their true golden age was in the 1980s and 1990s. It is a good idea to try to make action and comedy mixed with Hollywood Police, it is a good idea, but its end result is not a mockery of SubZen, but it is a reason to ask God to please everyone. Even more similar to the previous films of the same type (Hollywood Homicide). <br /> <br /> Has this entertainment form really happened? The same thing was not the same since the whole decade. You will be a friend-action lethal flow after the other. To keep an eye on the disaster, I'll be happy to give you some headlines: (I Spy - 2002), (National Security - 2003), (Taxi - 2004), (Starsky and Hutch - 2004), and the worst of them (Miami Vice- 2006)! <br /> <br /> I believe one of the reasons is that in the usual case of similar kind of cinematic flicks and TV shows after two decades already involved. Add that, especially here, negligence dealing and dull humor. Indeed, this time the matter is completely intolerable. Yes, we've got 2 trusted policemen who have a second job, and the background of sinful cities, but what was new? It's not about cliché; This is about a few renewals that match the clichés where both have been badly created. <br /> <br /> Acting, especially for Hartnet, is terrible. No comedian other than this guy (or actor!). So his character wanted to take revenge on his father's death! Take revenge on yourself, probably die outside of your acting !! Even people who have nothing to do with the joke have a small role (or what they think here!) <br /> <br /> The guide failed to present some of the comic or rigid, some parts are very blue (due to lack of black men to be arrested ??); What it would be a rare time to be action / comedy supposed to be annoying! They did not use Hollywood as a crooked place, like the ugly face behind the glorious comedy, or even the bright or fallen stars (even common ones that can give it some interesting moments). <Br /> <br /> This is a very simple movie which is only recovered by its star's glamor, and after being finishing as a Buddy-Cop film on one of two major bad events about on-screen chemistry. None of them have chemistry itself with a screen! Who guess ?!), and more than a body-cop destroyer movie! God, me or my children, do not live enough to give evidence (Hollywood homicide ?? part 2)! Finally, see Harrison Ford's performance, he wanted a good time, but at least we did not.
