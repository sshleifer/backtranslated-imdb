I can now clearly see why Robin Hood quickly flopped. Its first episode is probably the worst thing the BBC has ever broadcasted. Early scenes were intense, meaningful and intelligent, as the two monkeys fought, Robin Hood did not have any character, and the sword fighting was just ridiculous. The worst part of this episode was that Robin Hood had torn some cows at the beginning of the episode - how many people in the 12th Century wore an eyebrow? Someone The series can be greatly improved since then, but this first episode is fast expected by people, and it is basically a pile of cr * p. A great hero of England has been disrespected. <br /> <br /> "Will you tolerate it?" I'm not sure if the BBC understands an intelligent investment, it is not sure. 3/10
