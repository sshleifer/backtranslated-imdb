Imagine the worst skating on Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in a 90 minute movie. Now, imagine that those bad skits are all removed with humor and replaced with folly. Now imagine something bad 50 times. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All right, now see underground comedy movie. You would think like that's the fun thing that was sometimes fun. UCM's single bad movie I've ever seen. There were some cheesy laughs ... very little. But it was lam. If the purpose of the movie was to be lam, it was very fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not angry to waste my time, because someone else bought it. He wasted his money. Vince's offer does not dictate the written or anything else and why it is not surprising.
