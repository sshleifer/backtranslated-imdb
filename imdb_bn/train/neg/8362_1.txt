This is a really bad movie. I've ruined my brain and I can not bring a positive comment to make. The acting is oppressive. I've seen more credible performances on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. The stolen diamond, the president's secret recording, and the shark that invades anything around it, should be made to the chessy funeral at the worst time. Shark night is not even bad, it's good. It was written a few seconds before the conversation was heard and distributed. And top off it, Shark's Night has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I am surprised that anyone can not start bleeding from my 80's techno-synthesized word that is actually bored to record. <br /> <br /> Italian film industry died in 1987, from what I read. Night shark coffin is like a final nail.
