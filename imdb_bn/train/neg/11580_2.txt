If you want to see a mystery, do not see this. Although there are some elements directly from the Elmore Leonard region, it comes close to a episode of "Dynasty", because the filmmaker "develops character" - such as attention to annoying discussion among long, annoying characters. Some people can create interesting movies without real work (see "Exotica"), but it's not the same. Avoid it, especially if you like the actors involved in this one.
