When Patrick Bergin's performer faces the face of his objectionable and renegade husband Julia Roberts, the movie is a strong opening start and I'm ready to enjoy a powerful film similar to The Burning Beyond of Farhaha Fountain. Well, as the essence was to say I was the wrong lead. This image was nothing like Burning Bid, which had the power, and Farahara played the part of a woman who you really felt and felt her need for pain and survival. Roberts fell asleep with the enemy after working first in cheap thrills with her sleeping while living in Iowa to escape to her husband. Her husband first believed that she had died, but began to suspect that she can still survive and then set up. This movie is basically a cat and mouse game with which Julia has found a home in this small town in the city of Iowa and changing her identity .... Of course there is no mention of how she got the money, but at the moment I do not care about that film. She meets a guy (Mr Nice Wimie) and falls for him and her husband finally gets her, but her soup does not straighten up the cans before the rearrangement and the kitchen. This is to estimate that I provide a cheap thrill to the audience. But if I was a misbehaving wife I did not take much care because the spectators have been cheating because I said it. If this course continued, I could have felt for him and his situation. Of course, the husband dies and all is good for the little LGS Roberts. If only the real world is near it ... look at the burning bed and you understand what a movie seems to be about domestic abuse.
