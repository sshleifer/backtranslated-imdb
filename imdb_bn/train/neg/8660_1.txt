This is probably one of the worst demon killer animal movies I've ever seen. This laboratory test follows the standard premises on the wrong course and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical escapes. The giant shows a lot of ways, like dinosaurs, in which there is a large tirenosaurus-like hip leg, when it should be just like a crocodile of more than one size. Everything about this movie is unreasonable and it is continuously "cliche", minute after minute. Why is there always separation of two drunk redneck hunters after dark? Plus, there is always a guy and girl who shares a lame, are interested in obvious love when they have situations in life threatening. I have already said a lot and I feel like I'm wasting my time ...
