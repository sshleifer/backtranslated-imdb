I think the film is objectionable for American Americans who have generally lost someone in the tower for America. Last year, every director has taken an opportunity to compare old events (which do not have any connection with any terrorist attacks), or criticize American political behavior, or to compare different political situations like their own. The country has nothing to divide or share with the atrocities of September 11. On them is involved.
