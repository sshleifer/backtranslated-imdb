This show is just annoying !!! I am sorry for the actors to try to be funny (especially Bob Saguat), the sunny track tries to cover the tragic trick and the "Aall" track arrives at the most unnecessary time. There is no exception to over-theatrical kids, especially Olsen pairs. Also, this show is in clich√© city. If you are looking for a cliche word it will be "Full House". Each line of the story will have a "life lesson" which will be finally learned. A sad speech makes everything better and even the most barbarous child has the power to suddenly realize the spirituality, even the GSP is very bad, it can not be possible in real life. I do not know how I could see this show after listening to bad behavior in the face of character or a sunny track. I shouted to myself on TV, "It's not hungry / saris / dogs." If life is really such, then the world will be different.
