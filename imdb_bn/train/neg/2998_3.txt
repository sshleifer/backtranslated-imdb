Mary Garland is only for fans. The two (2) numbers are really good - where they make a number with an old clean lady (you've seen all the pictures), and very nice numbers at the very end. The line is funny where there is a couple in the scene. But, basically, the script is so bad and the movie is so date that it is not difficult to hit the horrors of life. However, it is worth 2.50 for renting the movie - be prepared to make it faster.
