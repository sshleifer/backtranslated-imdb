This mini series is actually more entertaining than some others with much big budget and greater desire. In the spectrum of SOTD entertainment, read somewhere between "Kung-Fu" and "H.R. Puffstaff". If it is not so long (about 3 hours) I think the kids would like it quite a bit. It does not have adventure, action, "Cliffhanger scene", and too much romance or other "icky" elements. When you are young, you are not very critical for rubber swords, camping roles, and repetitive scenes. (At least two scenes are replayed in the film, to bring the viewer faster at the earliest to complete the serials.) Eventually, the children usually accept American American dialogue coming from the mouth of the American actor. (The leading roles played by non-Asian actors can not be mentioned.) <br /> <br /> I'm going to give this movie three stars, but I feel like a director, producer and cast, at least some extra credit to carry through the project Deserve. This movie is not art, but, like drawing pictures of your home, it really made some time, effort and discipline. <br /> <br /> Overall, not recommended use of your time, but it can keep kids entertained while traveling on small van. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, IMDB! "Dialog" is the preferred and traditional spelling. Your spell check seems to be that the "dialog" is spelled correctly. Although "dialog" is acceptable, both Webster and Wide consider it an alternative form.
