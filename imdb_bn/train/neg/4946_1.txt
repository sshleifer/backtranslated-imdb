Of course, I already saw this piece with very low expectations. Dereter Bohlle is a rather continuous musician Pervenu, whose lack of talent is more than just the size of his arrogant. <br /> <br /> This was the first cartoon movie I saw that it is 100% ridiculous. It is rude, objectionable, redneck and blatantly anti women. For example, it is a creator Bohelan, but it will be closed instead of the average viewer. It has never been shown in a movie theater: It is not surprising that it will be a big explosion! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even without costing 6.5 megears, it was broken into pieces. Save your time and money!
