This is the worst performance of my life film. Not really. I'm not kidding All are based on "true stories / historical references", as there is no excuse for bad acting. It was a shame, because others had been posted, set and costume was great. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was usually "Asian-style" music, although I came to love about the "modern" Fernando Maria in her bed while the love song came. I do not know who wrote the beautiful song and sing, but suddenly the Nora Jones was sent to 1500. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Kwik-n-EZ war scene. <br /> But acting Oh, so sad, sad. Distribution line like a bad junior high play. Gary Strach County used to sell potatoes for County 4H Fair but she could be more credible. In the end, he did more words like Little Italy Street Thug. Occasionally, half of them asked me to shout "Adrian"! Or even "you want my piece?!". <br /> <br /> Line: When the queen is telling her lover (after repeated on the floor) "I'm going to give birth to a baby." He replied, "A child?" I wanted to retract her "No, Jacques, a chair leg, dew."
