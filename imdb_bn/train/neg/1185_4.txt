Another diversity and improvement in the story of the famous and beloved children, La Bettie (1975) tried to visualize the beak (very graphic and which may seem obnoxious and annoying, but in reality, silly and ridiculous), beauty and animal? I amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look very deep into this movie. As far as I can not say it is a serious and dark search of issues such as sexual despair, desire, complementary, or satirical criticism of Catholic religion. I do not even call it a horror-erotic movie. It is more parody of the generals that touch or have been mentioned, although it has got some moments in all the sections that are sure to be in your memory. <br /> <br /> The long (long way) woman in an aristocratic young man and supposedly awesome but most ridiculous I've ever seen the movie creator with the really impressive ... good physiological, Scarlatti's Clichovaster Music is set and violent. My husband and I both amazed to overwhelm the overwhelming detail. Philosophy is moral - can make beauty and the giant will be defeated. The question is - who is the target audience for this movie? For a erotic picture, it is very verbose; For an art film - it's got a lot of jaw-dropping views of madness and I want to say a sudden ending. IMO, the filmmaker does not mean it to be a serious drama. Art House / Awesome / Erotica As a parody, it is fun and of course original. Have a good smile and try not to look for some deeper meaning. This story of strange beauties and lustful animals is certainly not recommended for co-watching with children. The scene of a prettiest visitor's hobby may be used more successfully than the notoriously vulgar scene, the discovery channel for programs like "In the world of animals - the practice of mother tongue and horse rides".
