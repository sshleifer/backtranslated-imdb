A deadly populated person is supposed to be a common general mystery plot, actually, trying to find out all about finding a head-pain-making story (a very early actor, Agargaar Rogers, very basic role) about a bunch of characters in a fur apartment building Killer in small cast. These characters range from absolutely stupid to neutral averages. As the production of cheap or low budget, most employees Rogers and his lead people (some people, I'm not taking care of him because he's really suckling) are talking about various possibilities to solve the crime, while constantly cutting his butt with his head with a stupid detective. Actually, I did not get bad time seeing this old bi-rated movie, and I saw some real titles. <br /> <br /> Oh, and Butler did it because there was not a Butler. But pay attention to the nearest people of a Butler. Go there <br /> <br /> - Polaris DiB
