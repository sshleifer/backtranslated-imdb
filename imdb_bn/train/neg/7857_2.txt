Does anyone else get tired of the old clich√© where a dead person appears in a horror movie, gives us some information, and then blames his head for no apparent reason? I know I am <br /> <br /> The sad thing is that it can not be used in this movie. If you see the first movie (I say the first rimak), but the information given is totally worth it, because you already know it. I suppose that you are not worth it for the main character ... but then why stupid shoots in the head? He does not want to live? Of course, he died anyway. <br /> <br /> The second film "The Hills is Easy II" is titled. The first is a series of 70's original films. Where it gets a bit complicated for someone like me See, I'm probably not part of my age minority, even know that there was even one HHE 2, even less than a basic HH1. And now we have a continuation of a rebuilding signal and this signal is fixed as a real HH1 sigell ... it just makes it worse! But anyway <br /> <br /> The eyes of the original mountain of Wes Cranven were beautiful. In the end, the idea was better than the presentation, but perhaps it was a low budget. To be quite honest, Wes Craven is not an awesome director. He has only made some horror films (Nightmare of LM St, New Nightmare), a few of the upright people (screams) and a bunch of terrifying things (Brusilin's Curse, Shocker, Vampire). Oh yeah, and he swamp Thing, as well ... but the original HHE2 comes under the next section. I saw only a few minutes, but it was terrible. <br /> <br /> Now he writes with new HHE2 ... and that's frustrating! Last year, HH Reikike was even better than the original movie. It was yesterday. I had a family of main characters in it, and there was a bunch of beer and pot and teenagers crazy teens that were with this fact. It feels dirty to us. For the first hour, we were in the hell, and finally, in the last few moments, good boys took revenge on the bad guys and it felt good. <br /> <br /> This new film has no tension. There is no doubt. Violent events are happening with most fools. There is hardly any appealing presence here. <br /> <br /> I'm tired of scary movies where people die due to a mistake. Just on that day I saw "Deep Blue Sea" where Samuel L. Jackson was walking around the water while delivering the lecture, and then he was eaten by sharks, because no one would give him something that was just stupid. Here's the exact same thing. People know that people are dying, but do they know that they can not take a leak? And when you think that people have learned, someone else goes by themselves! Seriously, when characters are bringing their at-game and are still more scary when losing? I think so ... <br /> <br /> It's even distributed under This "rig" created the first remake of the remake (which was less tragic than an episode of "unemployed"). More bad guys Cave more time. More tension All things <br /> <br /> But it actually got reduced. Less bad guys Do not worry. Sure, there is more time in our cave, but there does not happen much. In the end, it seems that there are two or three bad guys. The last image seems like a whole tribe. Where is this tribe? Who keeps them watching through the telescope? Seriously, we should bring this picture to these topics, but it ends with the same last promise that the last movie has given us, with the same "right" view. Come on! I will give Satan the reason for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, there is grape (though it mostly walks in the dark), but you are not careful without tension and the characters ... do not do anything in my book! In the end, you are not afraid. You; Do not be surprised (unless you are 8 years old). Do not even think you've seen something new.
