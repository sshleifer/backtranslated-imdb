I go to a lot of movies, often I bring my 5-year-old son, I am very happy that I did not bring him. There are many references to sex and skinny dry scenes, but this is not the primary reason I'm not going to take him. The trailer leads you to believe it's a light heart comedy; Yet, virtually fun moments are all previewed. I keep looking for interesting, funny, or anything but serious; However, as I almost slept on plot-less stories dragging on. I understand that dogs can be big companies, which is being said, the whole story focuses on a bad dog that the owners were not intelligent enough to train. A lot of these people that would ban this ban would have caused much damage and delusion. The worst movie I've ever seen with Jennifer Aniston or Owen Wilson, is their waste a waste. The best way to enrich this movie is that the couple gets helpless dogs, the couple falls in love with the dog, the dogs die, the couple is sad. The end
