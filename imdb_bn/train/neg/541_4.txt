I found this film to be quite a weird. Very soon I am very sad to like this movie, and now I can identify why most of the reasons after thinking about it. Jean-Mark Barr, although I love to bite him (I think one of the best movies ever produced by Jantropa) Here is a lot of ugliness, and although I can not be fit for my life, I'm sure someone takes his place And this film can work. Everything else except a stab in a weak comedy is fine (a parent's joke is not really needed, filmmakers!) And I'm really Richard E. Grant likes. It's suffering from just one thing. Gene-Mark
