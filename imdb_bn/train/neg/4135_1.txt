This picture was so bad that I got the best bit it was mostly faster ahead. Is that a good bit? This is the only bit that was valuable, it's over. (Those who watched this movie will know what I mean to say). I hope Frederick J. Jason meets Frederick Jason on the dawn of an underworld like this from the movie, but what I found met this shit. The story was forgotten, Cast was used badly and what the manager thought when he thought. It could be a great but turned into the most annoying film I've ever seen. Ok so there was a nice bit at T and at that, I was after gore and I was frustratingly disappointed. Do not expect a movie that is good, but if you're a bad chassis, always watch it and see how a horror film should not be.
