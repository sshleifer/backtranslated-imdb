John Candy do we need to say more? The main reason that he will see this picture. Most people do not realize how talented they are as an actor. She witnessed changes in horny oxidation from poor slab. Just change a simple (fine) face and we go There is a lot of great bits in this movie and there are many dummy bits. The best moments for me are the Kung Fu You View, as well as a great moment when people go to the stage and talk about how much they love their girlfriend - so she and her genitals love her girlfriend. I'm sure you might think this sequence really crude. This, but it's very interesting because it's mainly doing this bit to John Kandy. The general story is quite long and Eugene Levi and Joe Flawworthy (both of whom have been nominated for the CCTV Ex-Student with Candy) were not given enough amount of films. Levi is looking at her moments, especially at the end of the filming of the wedding (thinks Rod Sirling) and when she is talking to her mother on the phone, the great scene. Overall, a good movie if you have difficult days and need to fool your brain. I out of this 10 out of 4.
