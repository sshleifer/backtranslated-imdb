This show is terrible, joke is all terrible and just being bad and bad. I was a man who was not a big fan of the corners, but at least I liked it first until it got almost two seats in season, all the jokes ended and there was nothing near the letters. At least the comet gas was good at first, the Priory Little Mosque was usually CBC Comedy, which was very busy, it was not for any episode 1. The way people are watching this show, I'm honest, it's old people or maybe just people who actually live in prairies? Maybe the joke for them and they work there? I can not recognize anyone who likes this shot and can not bear it myself, Jokes are completely expected and the characters are less developed than corner gases. I hope it will not be long because all the achievements of this event seem to be completely different as the main foundation of this event which is different from the Muslim and can be a great exhibition.
