The horror film of a wonderful suburban family related to the death of their parents and the "things" in the basement are okay, they continue to feed the people who are down the street. Of course, there is more to say than that but there is more to say. <br /> <br /> It does not come together for me because it tries to do it in both a family drama and horror way. Movies. The film tries hard to walk on the cutting edge in two types, but it suddenly stops suddenly, because it tries to frustrate, it is not something like that. This is the ultimate revelation that is "Oh no?" As a "Oh" is less afraid. Maybe I do not see a lot of horror movies, but it might be better now or maybe it might seem right, since I did not take much more than this. <br /> <br /> pass
