And a $ 30,000 budget and this movie is still made for 50 dollars. You can say from the first frame to the end that he is not taking care of movie continuity or plot, he could only make a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> The end result shows lazy movie makers who love zombie movies. It could be great if he had just given a care. The end result is an extremely intense Zoom Ins on Gore, and the more badly produced metal plays on it. <br /> <br /> When you combine high expectations, big dreams, a decent budget, hard work and what's the reason behind the camera is stupid.
