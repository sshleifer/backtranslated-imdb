One of our groups saw this picture was really hateful. We were willing to forgive that we did not have our favorite character Joe (it could not do anything like the author / producer). The writing was poor, the script was sub-par. What really bothered us: 1. When two people realized that they both were dating Natalie, they simply did not leave them with that stupid (and finally depressed) competition - but only because they were competitive, because they really Natalie wanted. 2. Although unable to choose between two people before reunion, Natalie suddenly decided that she really loved a man and is now ready to marry her? (And there was no prediction that he was really a good person, as the writer picked up the coin and then spit him out at some convenient moment in the film). 3. Blair creates a point of talking about how the children do not want and when her husband says that she wants to have children, she happily agrees with him.
