A wonderful and wonderful movie to see the master of Flying Giltoine in 1975. This is not because the fight is particularly inspired or the movie is made in some sense. Because the film is so stupid and so much that it is a camp classic - bad, but enjoyably bad. The film has played a blind man who has a free-like device that has spread to the chain because he skillfully threw it to his enemies! Who has thought that physics is impossible or that the film features 12 feet tall Pappia-Mash's army as a warrior, or the man was blind! It's just a force to start from the beginning - and one of my favorite "bad" movies and is great for watching with friends. Because of this picture, I was interested in seeing flat flying gilton (1977), although sadly it is not a series, but a not off - it takes a lot of ideas from the original, but neglects the film to be coherent or to see. . Of course, this is stupid fun, but sometimes it does not come near the entertainment quality near the Flying Guillotine Master. Like the original movie, these are the weird flying devices that sever head, but they are quite different - like round blades and their own mind. There is no blind person there, but instead there is a bunch of bad guys who do not really have depth and the audience does not understand what is happening in this English-dubbed version, because the plot is completely unknown. However, at the same time, the action of martial arts is some good. Although there is no high standards of Bruce Lee or Sonny Chibo, it is effective despite ridiculous and often misleading plans. <br /> <br /> Overall, it is a film that martial arts fans may like (despite many, many, many, many errors), but others might fiercely stop or laugh instead of enjoying work because it The film is so ridiculous. But, most importantly, it does not come close to being fun or spectacular as a flying guillotine master. very bad.
