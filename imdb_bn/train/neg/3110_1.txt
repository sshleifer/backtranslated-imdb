I usually go to this website before going to movies, as I want to see what others think about movies. I read a lot of reviews which said, 'The thriller is not a horror movie'. This prompted me to try a film. I really would take the problem with this 'thriller / horror' statement, it was not! I went around and asked back my money, and if you enjoyed this rubbish by many critics .... well you will be easily! At the end of the movie, the people behind me cried aloud, "what time wasted" and I returned to them and replied, "I could not summarize it better" I was waiting to do something ... but it did not. There was potential for many good scares (or thrills of you if you want) but nobody happened. Williams played well, but I felt that he made a small change with a bad script that revolves around and has never gone anywhere. Save your financiers, it's a turkey that will be very close to you in a dvd store 'Darga box' in the near future!
