First tell me that I'm not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like a law and order. The worst thing was the rosy and boss of Hog's cast. Bert Reynolds Bose is not Hog, even worse was M. C. Rocco did not sing like, if they ever saw the show, Rozko is not a tough ass police. He was also the more Barney Fif than the role he played in this film. <br /> <br /> The image is a normal error, the car is broken and nothing happens. The worst example of this was to meet with General Billy Pryct, and the general ran into a dirty mountain, apparently slowly slowly steadily sliding slowly.
