I saw this movie in this premier week in 1975. I was 13 years old and at the time I got it enough and got some fun. Then I came to discover the world of Doc Savage, through the Bantam novels of the old collection magazines. I had no idea before any of Doc's states, but I quickly became one of the fastest doc Savage fans to enjoy. I have read all the books of Bantam (and still owns), I went to comic book cons (Star Trek and Doctor Who and Gekky Fat Kid with all sorts of events) and had a nice time with every one of my campaigns with Doc and Origin Fab 5. Phillip Jose Farmer Book - The mysterious life of The Savage became a Bible for me and I have a very good feeling about my doc phase. After so many years of conversation I must admit that after many years, this picture really missed the boat. It was not a film that wanted to grow it up. The screenplay was infantile and the story of decorations bore a little similar. Since 30 of these stories were short, and Lester Dentworth (AKA Kenneth Robeson) outlined their writing, they broke the Perfect 3 Act plays shouting for screen treatments. It would have been good to think of going to Hell with George Pala and Michael Anderson. Spuf components miss the target and more serious moments are almost there, but then shortened. Although they acted in the second string character (who had only a bit player and extra, before the movie they hired), but they all very well removed themselves. Of course, Paul Gleason is going to be a fine utility player in all aspects of entertainment, and Bill Link is a television annually. The rest of everyone left the map off. I want to keep a copy of this movie for myself because it is the only movie version of Hero, but I fear that I can not see it as very painful. I will say 0 but instead I will give 2 walls out of 10 for some time. (Lastly the dock's answering machine was a nice touch) and 3rd Stinger's Cast Sun got a moment in the sun.
