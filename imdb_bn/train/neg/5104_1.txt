Now what is the wrong thing that the actors did wrong? Michael Door Star Trek should have merchandise. John Diyall, anyone remembers him in Miami Vice? Like him ... Well, whatever - what can one expect from the movie with a lifeguard from a movie? Nothing, and that's what we get. None of the characters are liking, especially lovely (but not funny). The story is a (very bad) joke. There is no argument for what is happening. I have felt that filmmakers are trying to kind of attack some kind of "killer tomatoes". Especially in a scenario where all the important people are discussing a kind of national security ... <br /> <br /> If you see it on TV then switch channels - your TV set will be grateful.
