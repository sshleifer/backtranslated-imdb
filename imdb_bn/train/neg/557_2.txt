It's hard to believe, after waiting for 14 years, we air with this piece of trimmed trash. The original is a high-impact, dark thriller that exhibits the fine art of the movie directed by Paul Verroon, achieving "godhead" status. This image has added nothing, it does not provide anything, and eventually winds up the big box of failed signals. <br /> <br /> The early sequence can create an incentive set of plot developments with a talented and capable cast. Unfortunately, we are treating 90-minute studies in the autobiography of Catherine Trumel ... or it's Sharon Stone. Probably both a crane. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a continuation of sexual stimulating stinging as "B.11.1", forget it. You carry with soft-porn borodoms, which eventually supports the old expression that any woman can be more lucrative in dress than them. It is notable that the fantastic Charlotte Rumpling was roaming around her skivvies in 1966 Gerozi Girl, when Miss Stone was just 8 years old. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of the real movie you must watch this movie and judge it using your rating system. If not, you can wait for the release of the DVD in the "rated" version of the "DVD" version, the "collector" version, the "collector" version, or the "final" version, and perhaps within 14 years we miss the "Basic" Institute 3 " Stone is 62 years old and nobody really will care.
