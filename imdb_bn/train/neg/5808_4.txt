Alike was a gentle, hot-tempered, high-powered Hollywood couple of Belvedwin and Kim Basing, when they were seen in this (almost) scene in 1972 about a fierce confrontation with Steve McQueen-Ali McGraw Action-Thriller. This often worked for the first time because there was such an important presence on the McQueen screen - even if the stone was silent and tired, you could keep its watch, understand the magnetism of its cage. Belvedev is not in Steve McQueen's league, but he has a character and probably a versatile actor - if that is so, this is not a showcase for his qualities. Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but Hammy is a silly crowd-magnetist in James Woods's artificial role. In a sub-plot '72 in which another couple was hostage by the former partner of Beldwin and the plays were even helpless here. For action scenes, they are quite old hats, which surprise one: even re-creating the original? ** **** to
