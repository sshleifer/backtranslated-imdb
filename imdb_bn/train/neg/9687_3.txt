This is a boring film. <br /> <br /> The beauty of sexual relations between men and women has been reduced by a set of men and women, who can only be described as a collection of strange and unfriendly collections. Greenway acknowledged the Fallen movie "8 1/2", but when Fellini does not have the title of world film, Greenway is not. <br /> <br /> She does not have the ability to express her feelings or feelings of emotions and emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> She said, for a few seconds the screen will not read enough by the audience, the results are mostly ignored. <br /> <br /> For women, only two characters can be described as polymers, polymers, who played the polly drama actor Walker and Giacomo Lazy with the rest ordinariness Retreat in fantasy's slow shadow from the strict light of reality and reality of both men and women. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Greenway obviously wants to make a point that sexual fantasy does not increase happiness. After offering their services in exchange for money, the woman herself is depressed. Relations between men and women are turned into commercial transactions. <br /> <br /> There is no sense of happiness or happiness or love in the film, in fact there are many scenes which are deeply unpleasant: <br /> <br /> Among the Father and Son, Philip and Story Emmental by John Pundit and Matthew Delmeye Increasing relationships suggest. Neglected negligence of two men who carry their child to Gaikonda, in fact, she becomes pregnant, first miscarriage and second time, she was sent from the flight book to a destination selected by men. Both men have sex with a woman who has no legs, (half of the female head). The hostility of animals in Bertelal, conducted by Amanda Plummer with a pig named Hunten. The father and the boys will divide the women among them. Women are being harassed by sexual harassment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It can not be any wonder that in the first premiere of Cannes when the film was booed. The more remarkable thing is that actors are limited to protecting it, and again show that there is no limit to women's dilemma, and women will be fooled by being exploited by men. <br /> <br /> GreenWay's Directoryal Style is violent, it's the style of victory over substance, film screenwriting as a film with the abandonment of the general industry. <br /> <br /> Greenway tries to achieve excellence, but only shows the principle of human relations.
