Good lord (And that's coming from an atheist), this "movie" is bad! The reviewers said long ago (those who rated this piece 3 and below) with whom I totally agree, I just want to add a few things: <br /> <br /> There are three people who have their own cook Eat the last product, cut it off with an x, raped by a boomstick, was tossed - the former lover was the worst victim of the abuse when the kitchen was in the table Whose unhealthy and vain word (like we, but at least our silence is the mercy of the button). <br /> <br /> The director cuts the point - and the endless cemetery and the opposite scenes, our misery ended 30 minutes later. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this flick at least a little overwhelming is that of Emily Hack's tits (one point) <br /> <br /> Forget it. Do not buy it. Do not waste your time. And your vicinity. My brain is so grateful after seeing that I'm feeling urgently needed to watch (Scrapbook) watch now?
