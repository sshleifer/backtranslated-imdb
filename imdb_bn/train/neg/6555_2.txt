So on the other night I decided to watch Tales from Hollywood Hills: Drama Jackson. Or power, damn, murder as it is called Holland. When I bought the movie, I noticed that Michele Pfeiffer was acting in her and I thought there was something to say about the quality. Unfortunately, it was not. <br /> <br /> 1) The plot of the film is really confusing. There are two story lines running during the film. Only they have nothing in common. I was waiting at the moment for the whole movie, so these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. But it's still not there. <br /> <br /> 2) The film's title says the film will be about the drama Jackson. Well, sometimes Like this movie has added two different stories and drama Jackson is the smallest part. So another title of this movie will not be wrong choice. <br /> <br /> I really recommend you to finish my story that no place will be seen anywhere in the shop shelf where you placed this movie. By doing this you will not lose 90 minutes of my life.
