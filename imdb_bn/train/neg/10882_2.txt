This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. From the first scene, I knew it would crash a debris. This is an unexpected bad girl starting with a bunch of butt bunch in a mission. As it turns out, it was possessed by some random zombies of humans. Well, some years later, some college students brought some pledges. The terrible acting head goes from the promise to the jock. The jock-like things were stuffing him in a miraculous way. Alonged aloud, loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly began to kiss him. Absolutely superb special effects with guns. For example, a noisy with any lip flash in the gun, and vice versa. It's a stop-animated length (why they're a mystery on stop speed), Chess music, and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is shaky. Just like many people, you can rent 50 cents at your nearest low-cost bro movie rental.
