I was raised from a "very Christian" family since birth. I was saved before watching this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to visit it in a young team of my church. This movie was extremely annoying. I saw it at the age of 12 and literally had nightmares about it for years. I used to hear awake in bed and hear the sound of the top of my mother's footsteps. If I do not hear her footprints, I was sure that she was keen on top level to ensure she was not raptured. I used to pray so hard every night for salvation because I forgot that Jesus forgot me. This is certainly not something I will show to my kids until they are older, if not. This film took me a couple of years to scare me.
