Now, when it starts with bit about the title, it will be a bit cliche, so I'll wait for it. First of all, this movie makes me wonder why kids roam stupid things inside the lab and fragile bottles. Then I realized it, it's a movie with a message, the message that kids are beaten and something like that will not happen. Things like what you ask? Grow like a giant pest monster and generally creates something harmful before death in "monster indirect fashion" death. Now, as promised ... blue monkeys ... there is nothing blue and there is no simian. Now I snot like it was cheated or something like that The cover image was an impressive bug / crab / stupid / thing behind some screaming nurse. That kind of happened but I wanted apes! Several nights ago (half-drunk on Casket and cream brandy's mind) I was in the mood to hijack more monkey 80's style. not too much. If you like this movie you do not like snow boarding apes or blue stuff. If you want to hit bugs and kids well, rent this up.
