We left it at the moment where the character of George Clooney pulled out his nails. We were not upset - sitting in this drill for an hour we felt it. This picture was unclear, annoying, provocated twaddle It would be appreciated! How man managed to sit in the corners of the corner of the hole of a film, gradually, this confusing, let alone designate it for an Oscar? I felt sick like Clooney so that we could see him. What is he thinking? Oh .. and who was with the subtitles? Did we just have a bad DVD or the original movie - the rest of the sentence hanging in the mid-air? The film was difficult enough to follow besides that. Please let me cast, who did their best with those probably available components.
