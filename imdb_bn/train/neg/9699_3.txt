Despite the idea of ​​many people about the first movie, I really like it. But this one is the one. How do you add it to one word ?: This movie (and here comes the word): CAP! <br /> <br /> Let's take part in this: plot here: Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow White has another problem: Court-Jassa, the father of his son has gone wrong, as Super, Splice, her gray hair becomes extreme for war and sold some royal royal descendants for blond and full hair. In his despair, Snow White Burberry (Otto Waikey), who first seeks to find his six dwarf companions and seek out the royal descendants, or at least try to find the names of Ramleststritskin. <br /> <br /> The whole plot was written on weekends, where the writer was very drunk but the pressure from the stripe was only due to pressure presses on the scrapple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of other actors, this is not really valuable for DVD purchases. Trust me <br /> <br /> The only thing that completely minimizes the type of film that is completely isolated, is that some actors acted So I gave 3/10 steps. Sadly, this script is so bad that no actor or all of them join together for bad stories. <br /> <br /> For example, at one moment, they have moved away from our reality and with sadness .. They do not do anything funny while staying here. However, many of the great actors of this movie: Otto Walk Case, Ralph Schmidt, Martin Scender, Nina Hagen, Kosma Shiva Hagen, (especially funny): Rudiger Hoffman as Rex, Helz Scandar and many more sad But sadly all these comedians are not able to bring this really bad script to life. <br /> <br /> Maybe it's a treat for some hardcore fans but it's not worth the money for regular movie gear or DVD rental providers or buyers. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to rename the movie.
