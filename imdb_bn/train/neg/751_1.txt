I honestly believe that anyone considering this can be a victim of this mind-boggling failure considering the creation of the film. In the '60s and 70s, Edward Wood Junior "liked" the film, why this film is why a real-time filmmakers spend so much power rewriting scripts, re-edits their movies, and finally rethink their special effects. Look right A decent argument for the pre-screening process of this movie studio If m Hines was compelled to bear the honest reactions of a neutral audience; perhaps he could cut 75% or walking / moving / moving scenes, and edit this movie in more than 90 minutes at the biriyet. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers must see this film as an example of how dangerous the filmmakers think of their work as "good enough." Every performance, every line of dialogue, every digital effect, effect of each filter, in fact, each frame of the video reveals the danger of struggling only for merit. An early filmmaker may tempt yourself / herself from time to time to think yourself "to finish it yourself" or "that's just going to be a supplement." This movie will help them understand how a movie can be bad. <br /> <br /> The critics may benefit from watching this movie before making this summer entertainment "worst movie". <br /> <br /> Authors can learn from this film how many important rewrites and perhaps the need to rewrite. Also, at the beginning, the director can respect the importance of scripts and how much tribute a writer can write so that the audience is emotionally forced through the story. The author and director who watched films for badly producing for weeks and thought "I can do something better than this", this movie can get the idea that it is even harder to average results too. <br /> <br /> I sincerely believe that this movie can serve as an educational tool at the beginning of the filmmakers. Especially those who are entering the draft in this current post-Luca and Post-Spillberg environment. Such a reason is because filmmakers are appreciated for their ability with special effects. The World of Wars clearly explain that not everyone can drag it. Some even can not even close it.
