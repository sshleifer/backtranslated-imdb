This movie is just plain bad. It's not even worth watching to make fun. Crazy Professor is just normal boring. Even allowing permission for invisibility to allow suspicion to suspend (which I do a great job for a bad movie), and to allow a stupid movie to be shot for a horror movie, the film wants more than that. If you are looking for women's locker room shower scenes and face random sex then get a porn, if you are looking for a good-looking movie but get something else. If you want to annihilate your time just in the annoying bad movie, rent it.
