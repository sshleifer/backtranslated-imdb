They sell it as a scary movie, it is considered to be a thriller, but I found it funny (humorous, do not think), I smiled the whole movie because of the frustrating acting and plot. I do not blame the actors, I think they were not very good, but O.K. I think Silian is a very good "bad guy" I like the acting of Batman Begins and Rachel McAdam. She is a beauty, and a good actress as well, try to be a little motivated here, mm mm in the story ... MM mm in direction ... It's a really annoying movie, but there's a good thing, it's a lot of mystery lacks, it's a Short movies, just 1 hour and 30 minutes (for me it was 10 minutes down the water !!!) <br /> <br /> Why do not I know this movie so high, and pieces of tomatoes, even higher , What is wrong with the good, reasonable and criticism of purpose?
