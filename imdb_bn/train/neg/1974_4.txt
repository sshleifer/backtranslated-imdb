Some people have made a point of breaking the film because they ask black people in the Old West, the Asian people of the Old West or the gunmen of the old Western era. Get a reading and read a book. There were a number of Asian (Chinese), several black (freedom fighters) and everyone outside the civilized class was ready for the gun; It's the second correction you know.

Americans had different pronunciation, used different changes, spoke at very different speeds, and used words and phrases that are unreasonable today. Do not blame the historic mistake that you do not dig it. Be honest Perhaps you are simply uncomfortable with what you see.
