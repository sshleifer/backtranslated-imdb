That's how ... You keep the DVD and the most professional-looking thing you see in the next 90 minutes is the distribution company's logo. And at this point, you know that you've just been jerked around. <br /> <br /> People generally enough to assume something has been done on DVD, it's going to be a certain level - if not creative, at least financially. But sadly this is not the case. Distributed companies are fully happy to be able to ship the amateur movies together and wait for the uncomfortable customer to drag by the old designed DVD cover and bring them directly into the stores. The weight behind this special project is likely to be known by Kevin J Lindenmouth, the pioneer of the horror movie, whose name may be known among the general fans, because he is responsible for other low-budget waveliff films "The Wrongful Wrath", "Weaverloft Tales" and The Wolffall Tales. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The first segment, "Blood reconciliation", most of the things in most cases sets the voice ... A man comes back to his home town, the girl who torn apart, only his parents Grandmother refuses to leave him. There is relationship with men, and for any reason regarding a dark family secrets. This installment is not much worse than the indicated, poorly directed, and basically you can not combine yourself with a few friends and a home video camera. <br /> <br /> The second story, "Old Blood" is probably managed by three powerful and Lindenmouth itself. It tells the story of a gay couple, in which a painter and other desires should be given this power. His will has been granted, but he is not the creature he thinks. This small film shows that Lyndemuth has more talent and experience than other filmmakers working on the film, but it is not enough to raise on an amateur film level. <br /> <br /> Finally, our "ManBist", in which some soldiers were pursued by two other faults. They want to kill him because he is pierced by animals and is considered dangerous, but may not possibly be all that seems to be. It has an interesting idea, but it has become too long and you do not guess if it's a "twist" in ten minutes, but you're probably not very bright. This is mostly the problem with this whole DVD ... some good ideas are not enough to spend on such a thing. After all, would you pay for a picture you could paint yourself?
