This film expresses concern about the story of Eddie mentioned in the headline and behavior of her home with old friends on the coast. Friends are involved in this plot, because Eddie has left a friend to deal with death in which he feels responsible. But it is incompatible, the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenplaces do not always require 'chatty', but at least they should help in the development of the story. Here's a line attempt such as "he just stopped" or "I know that there is no love in your heart" simply inventes the audience for quite some time. Also, when the author encounters any losses to go to the next, he walks through an indie mood music into the music montage of the ongoing hero. Talk about hard efforts. If you are interested in a good movie, it only provides quality and material on the styling, but this is not a movie for you.
