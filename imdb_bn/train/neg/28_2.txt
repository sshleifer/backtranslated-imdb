This picture is terrible. You really do not have to read this review. If you're planning to look at it, it's not enough to say - no (unless you're studying without making a good film). <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible ... serious amateur hours. Throughout the film I thought it was interesting that they found someone who spoke like Michael Madsen and found that it really was her! A new lesser for her <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People who claim that it's real or good, they've never seen a decent movie before. It's also a terrible movie by the Hollywood action flick. <br /> <br /> Do not see it !!! Instead go for a jog - at least you will not feel like killing yourself.
