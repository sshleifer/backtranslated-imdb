This movie was a long build up with a measurement. Those who end up mentioning the sword until the end of the sword should be out of their minds, nor have they any one. Way too often this movie got soft. I'm not saying soft movies are bad. But how much you love sugar, there is no t-bone space. This film was thought to be avenging of crimes against culture, but it became a minor barrister. And there was only one person who really knew what a sword was; The character of Team Roth (and yes, he plays them well). Rob Roy was a weak "hero", he had no knowledge of how to use the sword, and the manner in which he "won" was disrespectful. This movie was a period of drama, but the best performance would be to go to the nature of Scotland. This is a short breath of being known as "soap" in my book.
