Where did Michael Kane need him? I've seen most of the MST3K seasons, but this rare pre-1 episode K-20 is one of the worst movies ever made. Three "stars", Lee Mazzar, Chris Mecops, and Burgess Meridith, struggled with the worst batch of cinematography, which provided lines that were written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup, and tried to spend public funds by GM lawyers, transit and Energy efficiency research. It appears that it was portrayed in almost complete darkness. Probably 8 Logan runs the cinematic system with Chapel like Shakespeare. I can not imagine seeing it without the comment of Cro and Servo, because it is also unreasonable with it. What is clearly required in Hollywood is 401 which prevents the actors from taking bad films for their healthcare payments. In the end, with the theme of "Contamination and Drive Rights", I hope to see Charlton Haston CÃ©imio halfway where he gives his "cold dead hand" speech. Lee, I could forgive you for this in 1989, but in 1981?
