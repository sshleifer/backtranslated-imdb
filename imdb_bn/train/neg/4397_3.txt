A friend of my sisters gave me this game, and it is very difficult! It carries a child's presence in the game, but you have to learn many complex steps that will make you twist and make your hand in all kinds of unknowable locations and you will have to look for an endless level of 100 notes. Improve your scores! You have to find these unlikely hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces, that you need to work around them almost impossible! And I'm just three level steps! Maybe you have no life if you can stay in the house you can enjoy something but otherwise stay away! And it is definitely not recommended for the children - they will enter their home in an hour!
