"The 'Malcom' show in Fox is really killing a ... we can not make our own version?" I certainly guess and paraphrase, but in our hearts we all know it, and the 'Malcom' metric was the only thing NBC was the only thing to add. And, boy, they added sex ... <br /> <br /> Thirteen-year-old Tucker entered his skateboard. Tucker accidentally walks into her aunt in the shower and she accused him of watching him and beating off. She spies the beautiful girl in the next house from her bathroom window, and she knows that she wants to see her topless, but she gives a smile and ties her to the window. And in all these pilots <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They can count. So there is no wonder that "Tucker" has a strip club bathroom warmth and appeal. What does the network actually look like we want to see the child's immediate observation with adolescence? Does this thing people do not go to jail? If you are suspected of misuse of the show, consider this: 13 episodes were filmed, but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes; Then they rescued the episodes "fire extinguishing" by airing them at MIDNIGHT so that no child could see them. The main goal of the kids was to target visitors. <br /> <br /> In addition to its ordinary shiny, there is an ongoing voice-over character for the character to be out of character. Even in 2000, it was very scary, it was Ska Accessory Music and Super-Summary. I could not choose a character to laugh at jokes, and the jokes did not come in at least one minute and a minute ... snails in this Nasty Rip-Off ... they're better than this <br /> <br /> Grade: C-
