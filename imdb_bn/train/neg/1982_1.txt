Who? What? Where? When? Why? Acting was terrible. Very robotic, rehearsed. I saw all the actors in this photo well played. The screen was very elementary. At the end of this photo, the story line was bound up. And Claude La Murray will be tied for the moment. So he does not try to write / direct another movie.
