I have a high tolerance for the weird, but obviously the way of some movie paths, beyond the weird - as far as they hit your brain. This is a movie. Trying to understand it or even explaining it impossible, and I think the film is most understood when taking drugs - it is unavailable. <br /> <br /> The picture starts with some pretty Japanese animations that are associated with cats. However, out of the blue, frequent and sometimes annoying things happen - I wonder if I lose something in translation. However, if this is the case, why should we treat it with a magic tactic so that someone is smart, drinking alcohol, rubbing the animals, burning them in the fire etc. etc. All of these are really random and pretty scary. Curious, and I do not know why, anyone see this talent as a job. I just do not get that.
