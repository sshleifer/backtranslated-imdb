In this type of movie released in the 70's, it has been shown. And I can not remember the titles one by one in their hand that their impact is a measurement. These novelists will say 'pot-boiler'. They rarely have to keep the movie stars public. <br /> <br /> We have Michelle Kain, Peter Ustinov, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison and William Holden; More than enough name to get bums on the movie seats. The hero is catered for every taste. Although one suspect that most of the audience is still frustrated. <br /> <br /> Their gifts are easily dropped, and I wonder if they can be so frustrating or lacking in good sense with so much money and such fame. This type of movie hardly adds guilding to a CV. Sometimes the actors should choose their manager instead of the other way round. <br /> <br /> It is very clear that it will be even shit from the beginning. Interestingly, the jumbo-jazz theme music, which required some ancillary words, was also reflected in it, it was all the atmospheric firm belief in lift Muzak. Who would have imagined that when a scene was painted in the Steamboat of St. Africa, or an abandoned Sahara with a rear-headed camel and bird? Certainly a serious butt ball. Ennio Morricone had known what to do; And its results will be enough oozed atmosphere and pull my rating to raise a good two points. This director should show the problem of 'Arab Lawrence' or even surveillance of Sergio Leon; He may have learned some things. But then again, perhaps he did not. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hittak played the invisible wife theme to make a good impact on his picture 'Phantic'. Later it was reconstructed with equal pan-ache surrounding Harrison Ford. Confusion around all of its losses and backbone was durable. Here, when Michael Kain may be forced to employ some brain and barbarity, Rex Harrison comes out of popping-up like an impressive old Jenny, when the story falls suddenly, he keeps track. <br /> <br /> <br /> At least photography was good on the nice use of the beautiful atmosphere at least. But then the stupid music can certainly hit the piped-up and atom, which creates this little blanket. <br /> <br /> Action scenes were narrow and firmly bound, they vaguely with the continuation of the Korean War in which they were first-class drama classes. And, of course, players will have to fight with a jazz music - just like you did. <br /> <br /> and this item is often commented as worthy. Do not say that the script was too bad <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are even your favorite movie star, you are also sure to be frustrated.
