I just blew four dollars to rent this movie! Why Alliance will promote such a poor excuse for a film of Atlantis beyond me? But it was also surprising that several Canadian newspaper critics gave the film. Due to Canadian and low budget I only tired of our media to justify a movie. Canadian movies seem frustrating, so they give it a good review. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie: The performance was less than the average (apart from the main male character, actually quite a good). The film's quality was poor, which I could expect from a very low budget. The script was absolutely horrendous. An example, which revolves around a major drug character, that flirts with one of its clients, so that he can recruit and steal bicycles for his gang, whose sole purpose is to destroy the SV randomly. It is speculated that many of his gang members have been destroyed in this activity (I do not know why he can not afford only new purchases because he connects with this big drug from Vancouver to Toronto). <BR> <br /> However, the story of the story (which is not published almost halfway through the movie) is that drug dealers are planning to fire buildings in the Toronto area to try to make more affordable - not <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> Direct mail for Global and Mail and Georgia to give such precautionary reviews. <br /> <br /> Canadian !!!!
