Feh The film was started in an interesting manner, but the towel ran quickly from the misleading. The confusing part was mostly at the beginning, where the cut scenes were so much that it is difficult to know what is happening for the first 20 minutes. After dull, one of the two living people came after a tepid romance (both pusses). The revengeful attitude of the dead girl is actually the most vivid person in the film, which is sad. If the rest of the cast qualifies, then the film can be better. <br /> <br /> maybe Because the story seems to be really interesting for a while, because it seems that the insane priest of the corpse is trying to resurrect her 16-year-old daughter from the death of her daughter, undoubtedly with unfortunate side effects that all other dead people will return as well, taking the form of difficult people , And probably start killing everyone. A Japanese mysterious night of living dead type things. But this does not come to pass. Although the dancer in this furnace tells the young person unwilling to have a small basket hanging over his head, that if the priest ends his ceremony, he is the only dead person representing only his daughter. The number of dead is not growing, there is no body of the dead, there is nothing. The priest only takes the girl's soul back to the role of the deceased, and takes a corpse of a lover with her, because she crushed the peanut fold like her chicken. (Meanwhile I wanted to shout aloud. Foolishly ran out to kiss and said goodbye to Dad Girlfriend. , !!!). Robitusen shrimp, the incredible best friend in the last stages is a long confident shot because he left the village for the last time, and that's it. There is no real fear, no real hostility, which works much better than the Japanese film makers, which emphasizes the face of high-face faces, no shouting. I was very frustrated.
