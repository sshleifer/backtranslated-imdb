New Zealanders have better performers in this cast of Cast, many of whom I have played fantastically, this film has filled me with a deep shame from the same country. False American pronunciations are the first formulas that are being sighted incorrectly. Instead of another review, the luxury cruise ship is actually an old car ferry, which is equipped with multi-color flag stolen from the used car lot. Most of the custom New Zealand soap has been running from Shortland Street for a long time. It looks like this movie has dreamed of a Christmas party at Shortland Street, the result of many genes and perhaps a bit of salmonella. Imagine "behind the aggression" that fulfills the "love of love" operated by your local elementary school and is operated by autistic and you get the idea. <br /> <br /> If you are an actor then I recommend you watch this movie, as a research on how to destroy your career.
