Slaughter is the ultimate clutter of your symbolic 80s slasher. A gruesome horror burns out to keep a geeky guy out of hand. A few years later, the guy comes back and kills those people who hit him. Now the story may be curious and very entertaining, but this horrible movie is different from the 80-second slash Flickr, which has some humorous errors and continuous flaws. <br /> <br /> Acting is horrible, however, as doubted as suspect is not really as bad. Although with its help, every character in the film is so vague and not impossible. Leadership, Carroll Manning (Caroline Murro) is the biggest pain among them, and that is how we have shared sympathy and sharing with each other. It can not be mentioned that the gaci man is almost scary and I think that even stereotyptic gics will be very weird and how will he be neutrally disgraced by Gekikari, so when anyone gets the maulana then anyone really cares? <br /> <br /> There are many strange smiles possibilities. The lack of acting talent is very clear, which puts him in the same level as the awful cast. However, when the film is weakly weakened, Munroo is at the age of 30, as well as being the most vulnerable to identify as a teenager among teenagers. And then when it comes to the next life and Munro plays around her real age, the rest cast does not pass as an adult. It's running well with a theme song, which hits the heart of a metal thrash, with a laugh of frustration and a voice "I'll get you." Being told with that, Slaughter High is not really a very good slasher flick, but it has a bad Chess entertaining standard. Perhaps an indispensable for hardcore slasher fans, but do not expect hesitation, mystery, or any credibility from it. Awesome !!!
