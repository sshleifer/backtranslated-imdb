The National Treasury is almost as much as it is over-rated and very popular. Nicholas Cage is not a credible action hero, and the film is not "Indiana Jones". Those who compared this movie to the Indian Jones Classic Trilogy have severely lost their frustration. <br /> <br /> I do not understand what kind of target audience I'm looking at shooting this image. Maybe pre-teen spectators like it, but I think it's ridiculous. I can not imagine to find it that adults or young adults are great in a film. Simply tell: It's okay. <br /> <br /> The National Treasury is unclear and unclear, what it lends to "Da Vinci Code". I'll recommend this to wait for the liberation war of 2006 and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ("Once Bad People") Experiencing the time of fighting and "non stop action" is stupid. I liked the scene with busy announcement announcement in the middle of the busy road in the middle of the road, whizz by whom it was harmed by it. Oh brother <br /> <br /> I reminded me of the episode of "Brady Baunch" where they went to the museum park and Mr. Brady loses his architectural plan. In addition to that episode of the bandy band, this movie was much better than that! <br /> <br /> It's weird that anyone who does not believe that he is buried in a secret debris in the United States is strange. Literally, thousands of invaluable "invaluable" items in this braces trove. Yes okay !! Ridiculous !! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, Ah! Humanity! <br /> <br /> Cage, Voight and other actors acting like "National Treasure" come just as hard, woody and flat. However, when you are working with such ridiculous dialogue, it is difficult to blame the actor for its 100% <br /> <br /> The National Treasure is a good movie to watch once. I can not recommend it outside and certainly not be able to buy it in search of a fun disguised hunting above. <br /> <br /> Rent it if you see it first ...
