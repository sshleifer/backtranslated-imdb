This issue is much better script and final results for this movie. The script is full of holes because it was never imagined as a story, rather rather a string of nightmares sold together. The gap between the lines of the story and loose ends countless. The victims of the kidnappers said that their parents did not die, and they were found by taking him, just odd. It is written as the moment of a catheter therapy, when he handed over his "missing poster" at the age of eight years with the head of the runner's shelter. In the real world, if the head of the runway's shelter is seen, under his roof, a solution to be abducted, then the police would have been called immediately. This is a law enforcement problem which is not a segment of the 12-minute session. From where everything follows up to the end, it is such a small stream that I can reach the conclusion that the first 90 minutes was for pure unused exploitation. Funny, this movie is supposed to be condemned. Finally it seems to join.
