Perhaps the writers probably did not have any experience in the army, and probably did not watch in history's history, but I still give this cheaply created war film a little credit for giving a long perspective about the role of black soldiers in World War II. <<br /> <br /> The action is confused and unbelievable - no episode of the coma! There are good production standards, but the cast is interesting. New York giant Rosie Guer saw that I paid for it. Art at the fifth level - men wear Korean War uniforms, and in 1944 the US military reached Germany, when they did not show up here, it was quite warm weather and I do not think the terrain is similar in North California. . The black support troops are used as war soldiers because the script never clears. Sensitive rifles show some people instead of M-1, which is probably issued with second-rung soldiers. <br /> <br /> The concept of this basic story (the racist South Officer directs black soldiers) should then have been expanded in the production of a big budget, and it is not too late to use it anymore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There were black fight forces in there.
