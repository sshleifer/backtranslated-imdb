Old TV shows, film makers, seem to be the norm of Hollywood this day, but this disgraceful, toilet humor, your mother-in-face-face language, a rip-off, a curved middle-finger mason-dixon line and all the supporters of Hogwarts . From the first corner of Boc and Luke Duke, Uncle JCI (not to run in any sound because it would keep the boys in prison as parole violations), the smoking of Jesse smokers was increasingly increasing gradually, Georgia (catechu jersey, despite its previous silence, had moral compass), this frustrating misuse of the film. An open face contempt. In the first 15 minutes of the movie when I saw that they were terribly deceived, I could not tell how many parents I saw and removed their children from the theater. Hezad's original duck was a family show with basic moral values. Hazard's original dunkess was a child safe, hello-driven, funny show that parents do not have to worry about teaching their children the seven words of George Curlin. I have read reviews that the show and the movie are nothing but racism. Those who work may be right about the movie. Absolutely wrong about the show which takes place. Show, if anything, how to get along and friendship with someone was about. Hollywood is finally open to us, Yankee, rebel, or otherwise, who still respect, loyalty, faith, family, and even if it is not popular, believe the right thing, their disrespect. Finally, Hollywood has enlightened her belief that those who are stupid, uneducated, beer-swallings, foul mutheds, trash in our heartland can buy any piece of trash they want to sell. They prove that Hollywood Elitist is wrong. This movie does not have to be seen. Sponsor Boycott Warner Bros. Fill out the complaints in email and snail mail boxes that we do not appreciate to destroy any of their greatest TV shows ever. Save your money and buy the DVD of the original show, but whatever you do ?? This movie does not have to be seen
