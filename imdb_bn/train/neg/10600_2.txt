The only reason I can see this one on TV is that it is below the IMDB 100. And now, I wonder if half of my life was really worth the other 'check' on the same list. <Br /> <br /> Van Damm finds Lucas Deverx, who, after dragging a 'HAL' to protect his computer, finds himself in a huge battle with the universal soldiers. And yes, after all the blasts burst, shoot out and chase he stood one last. Combined with terrible acting and a boring setup, it ensures that it is the only place in the infamous list. <br /> <br /> Only the list that you like to see for the departments like me. 2/10.
