I have seen the whole film to recognize William Hart, Natzcha McLeon and Desieri Nusshesh. I am glad that I had no idea about the presence of Peter Weller. At the end of the movie I said "Peter Weller?" For a remarkable performance, Mr. Weller Kudos. Weller played a major character, and his performance was such that I could not recognize him. <br /> <br /> Overall the plot was bad, the writing was bad, and the novels and the Wellars as well as the acting, were subpar. The scenery and setting were attractive, and the wreath was amazing. <br /> <br /> 4 possible 10.
