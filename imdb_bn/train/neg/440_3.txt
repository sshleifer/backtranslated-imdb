** Repeat ** Spinner ** ** <br /> <br /> Mia (Helin) is returning home from Stockholm to Grameen Rotwakke from Stockholm to celebrate the 70th birthday of her parents. She is by the youngest child, and there are two sisters Eivor (Ernst) and Gunilla (Petr√©n). Ivor has a family and has still lived in Rathiv and Guinea and moved to a city. Mia is still single and focused on her career. There is a lot of jealousy and there is almost a conflict between sister and conflict when they face each other and it is difficult to handle everyone's personal problems. When the party (and alcohol is consumed), many more confidential information is released and more conflicts arise. <br /> <br />: It was frustrating to be a new writer / director of old Swedish comedy / plays Watch this movie to follow just the same track that has been followed over the years. There really are no new elements or ideas. This movie draws on three basic areas. 1) Embarrassing humor is based only on the character of fooling themselves. 2) Sorrow and 3) Concern. This step focused on the end, as soon as the movie is gone, the first point is forgotten. Although no harm, humor is not that fun. Cast is good from acting, although I suppose it lost all the torment and forgot soon. I was hoping to have new ideas and effects, but nobody was there. In the end, there is a better way to spend your time than seeing it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
