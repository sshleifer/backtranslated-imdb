I still have not seen this image slate and I think I can be the first. <br /> <br /> It was awful. I did not really see it end. It was like watching an annoying soap or really good one (all are soap whip). The actor was poor and the story was bad. The person who rated it has no idea about the 10/10. The script was awful. There was a rug conversation involving 2 threats to the two people and you are good guy to say some things really good and beat crap from him but you expect. He said, "If you do this ... I'll hit you" Ahahahahah. Watch your thing, comedy away. Please do not watch this movie because ... it is shaking !!! <br /> <br />: Bad acting, bad fights, bad scripts <br /> <br /> Do not see! Of course this is my opinion.
