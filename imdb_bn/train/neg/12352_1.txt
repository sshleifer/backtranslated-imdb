<br /> <br /> This picture has more than 6 stars average. This script is so vague, and it is actually humiliating to make life proud based on it. Cinematography comes directly from advertisers and talented readley Scott should be ashamed. Demi Moore, however, is not surprised if anyone participates in this movie, if someone sees his tracklist. Above all, a "high concept" style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed.
