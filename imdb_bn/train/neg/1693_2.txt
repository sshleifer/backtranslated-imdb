My husband and I went to see this movie, we are having scary movie buffs that we are. Two hours later I was seeking myself both my money and time. I was very frustrated. Teasers for this movie originally contained the best points of the film. There was nothing scary about the movie except for a good time at the startup entrance. I think most of the 'scary' parts are somewhat ridiculous. After watching other films based on the work of Japanese authors, I want to conclude that the threat of panic in Japan is not terrible in the US. My suggestion: If you are a fan of true horror films then save yourself the pain of this busyness. I can not recommend to rent it to you, unless you are not coming to a free rental.
