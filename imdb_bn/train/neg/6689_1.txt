I can only assume that other critics of this "movie" will be the stockholders of the production company, because in the last five years I have probably seen the worst movie. For no objection, from the unwritten shot of Rabindranath, it was clear that actors in this film would be considered as "B-level". Prior to starting this film, both my wife and I were in a great mood, and we were really looking forward to a fun popcorn movie. We knew why we did not hire Citizens, and we were never expected to see the most amazing movies. However, after 40 minutes of the most painful unfunny bits that I have ever seen, we closed it off instead of losing another minute of our lives. <br /> <br /> If a "comedy" with a humor, terrible acting, thin plot and annoying character is your thing, then this picture is for you. Actually, the troll 2 is good - at least I laugh at the popcorn sex scene. <br /> <br /> I can not justify writing the lengthy review of this film because I have already tried to find a comedy about an hour. .
