This image was a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> I draw attention to critics. It is not a component that does not have an actor level; Here the actor (Bate Davis and James Cagney) is not just up to the level of the element. Clark Gabybell and Cloode Colbert were all big stars as Davies and Cigoni, and how happy it was to get out of One Night - an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that there is no talent for his comedy (the best thing about him is that he's the only comedy he ever tried!) Davis's note performance overturns potulens, but there is no explanation for the performances of the Colbert. Happened. Cagney, who looks like a great comedy actor, out-sync with his cover Davis. The script offers some decent lines and gags, but seems better suited for the drama than the delivery comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is soundtrack, which sounds more suitable, like Davis and Cagney delivery, is a lightweight drama compared to a comedy. <br /> <br /> Jack Carson, who played the same role throughout his career, also operated very similar material. A fairly common supporting role Eugene Palette provides a respectable performance. A slightly different role as an old Western resort, Harry Davenport, very good. But William Frowley is quite annoying at his most amazing performance. The fictional police of his character is a poor effort to ridicule the continuous references. <br /> <br /> I really love every actor, and it is a shame that they do not get chemistry as a garment and they do not get even better results than brides.
