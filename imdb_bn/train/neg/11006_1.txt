This movie star includes "SlapCop" Vince Offer (who has written, edited and directed) and Joe Batfuco - not exactly the name that shouts "quality" among others. And "supermodels accepts a dump" (it's just like listening to), a man who spits the sperm bank ("Raima"), necrophilia with a corpulating body, is supposed to be from a jar of embryo in black market), lots and gay Lots of jokes, a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortion. Skits are painfully stupid (eg "Batman and Rhymer"), considered acting amateur amateur is good enough and the film is crude ... and just crude for stupid. I truly believe an 8-year-old group can easily create a fun movie with the same budget. <br /> <br /> This picture apparently suits "Slap Shot" Vince Scientologists. Frankly, I do not know how to root in this case !!! Obviously, he complained that the Scientologists destroyed their reputation and drowned the movie. The film is not a boring junk and 99% uncomfortable (comparatively, Ebola fun) from the beginning ... but I can say the most beautiful thing about this film. <br /> <br /> Witty, who participated in a dipper and faked fake film participant Bobby Lee (from "Mad TV"). It is amazing to overcome this in his career.
