It has been said several times - at least by me - if you see any Eric Rohar film it is to see dry color; It seems that Monsieur Row has bored it (he does not deny it, but how he can do it, he only satisfies it) so that his new film is also his last, Ina Allah, coming back so far that it is like a dry dry observer. Those who gave you the Novevelle Vogue, those wonderful people from the Kahair's D-film have already given it a name among the best movies of 2007, so you have to give some ideas. The reality is not much in the Agenda of Rome, in our 5th century France we have a extremist position that will not move from the place in the Valley of Lor, when we can see that only another residence is a rude wooden hat. This story involves spiritists and shepherds, and often he has thrown Romer with the unknown people, which only happened to pass, so that the overall effect is that in the event of an annual class play for students of special needs, it is accidentally caught in the film. One is almost tempted to say that, 'Come back to Goda, all have been forgiven', but this evil product can not even tell me those words.
