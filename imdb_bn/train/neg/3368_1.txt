For fans of the film who never listened to the book (Charlie Jackson's "Hill House of Huntshouse") and with Julie Harris, the 1963 Robert Weise Productions never saw this remake as bad. <br /> <br /> For those of us, it's just plain terrible. <br /> <br /> Bad acting (Thinking about Nisson?), improving the secret computer, and moving away from this repetition of Jackson's story. <Br /> <br /> Benefit yourself and hire the original movie. It still scares effectively without hokey special effects. Acting professional and trustworthy. <br /> <br /> For book readers, it came closer since 1963.
