Anyone who watched the original film of 1970 knows how to put a nice cast, script, and director together in a comedy masterpiece. By the same token, it's easy to see that the bore-a-thon of Hollywood can be another inspiration! This movie was kinda! If this is not for John Cleese (a comic genius) then I could walk around 15 minutes in this terrible waste of celluloid. <br /> <br /> Do not write another screenplay for this version of blue simone (he said he could not make progress at first), and after this wonderful movie he will not succumb to the humor's defamation! <br /> <br /> Jack Lemon and Sandy Dennis have done such excellent work, the producers wondered when they threw it? How did the director and editor see these scenes and any of them were funny? I do not know, but one thing I know - it is no surprise that foreign and independent films are becoming more popular .......
