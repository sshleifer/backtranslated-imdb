What can you say about this movie? It was not terrible, but it was not good! Two days ago I saw Lily and it was one of the best gay films. So this is not the best time to see this middle gay fix. <br /> <br /> The story was silly and it was okay. It was not good enough to stop off, but it was some bad moment and some terrible stereotyping. It was not very good. <br /> <br /> Do I recommend this movie? No you will waste your time and money. I do not understand why such films have been created and their financing is doing. Instead of spending your time looking at the Ark of the logo Noah. I think where this movie was trying to go but there is not there.
