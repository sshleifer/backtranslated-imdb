William Shutter can always laugh at me laughing, (and I especially love him as the Boston legal Dianeine Crane), well, this show is about glitz and girls dancing and screaming and jumping down and down. <Br /> <br /> It does not have any intelligence of millionaire, there is no deal of deal or any deal. <br /> <br /> This show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill the time. <br /> <br /> I certainly want to see it. I saw it for more than 45 minutes, then I had to stop it. <br /> <br /> The best part was the William Shatner dance. He is a hoot !!! Unfortunately, this will not create the show. <br /> <br /> This is a given
