This 1973 TV remake of Billy Wilder Classic is worse than the original. Wonder! <br /> <br /> First, the best thing. Li J. Cobb creates a terrific Burton Kiss. He is Edward G. Robinson is not as good, of course, but the only reason he sees it. Basically, the only improvement in this remix is ​​that it will cut the role of Lola Diatrix, which slowly burst slowly slowly and gradually slowly to the women's fatty lows gradually and gradually. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A lot of bad things. The director has recorded everything neutrally: If you have seen the sound silently, then you will rarely receive impressions which are especially interesting. Due to the modern bad taste, the film has to be colored instead of black and white. Due to the bad taste of the 1970s, all sets are confusing ugly. Walter Saif's expensive apartment, especially, terrible. <br /> <br /> The modern setting hurts a lot of small ways. Trains in the 70's were unusual for 40 seconds, so Mr. The decision to take a Deitrichsen train is even more important. Men's hats stop wearing, which prevents Walter from covering his brown hair, while the white hair m. Posture as Dietrichson. During mourning, women stopped wearing curtains, which repeatedly stolen the Stainwright's Samanta eggs, which used to be fantastic in an important scene. (Kinky, Lola is still in her line where she revealed that her parents had tried before trying them on a black hat and screen.) <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco puts a lot of Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler script . But he made small, inappropriate changes in the dialogue which gave the script a little flare, once it was muscle and muscles. Unexpectedly, the famous motorcycle-police explosion has gone, but look closely and you'll see how the post-production cut looks like where these lines should be. Bukko can not blame <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Richard Karena What could have made this version tolerable is a really fantastic Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we could get Samantha Igar, who came from "Barnaby Jones" as a standard-issue villainess. But can you blame the egg? How well can Barbara Stanwick come with a manager who is just interested in what is happening in front of the camera?
