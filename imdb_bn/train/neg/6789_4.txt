The plot of this film hanging on an important point: The murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. It is not impossible to be a father and a murderer. But this man is excited or killed without the teenager and without killing a teenager. This girl had some girl. I do not think that a father who cared much about his daughter could be someone else's daughter so cold-blooded. Or, alternatively, it can be so cold blooded and still think about her own daughter. And the idea that a guilty killer would actually ask his daughter's parents and take care of her daughter. <br /> <br /> Because the characters acted with actors firmly. I think Scott Bocular's eye color changes, he is generally very cold and tragic. You can not see all of her eyes.
