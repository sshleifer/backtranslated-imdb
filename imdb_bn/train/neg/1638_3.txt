I was recently waiting to see Amanda Pett in another good role after renting "The Hundred Nine Yard" - the tenant easily, on the way - but it was not. <br /> <br /> I thought the trailer of "Whip" was a bit fun and all three of New York's plot were stolen and there were about 20 shots shot by charming Miss Pitt. So, I believed these two guys to come with me to watch this movie at two friends in the afternoon. This is my feeling of review. <br /> <br /> We have three lead studies in the first action, which review their victory over the diner. What was funny, or at least not saying, but rather unfortunate comes. Were these three men and any freedom fighters to face them that should have been taken out of us? <br /> <br /> [And when I do not think of laughably lazy movies, why am I surprised? The diner turned around when studs louder about scolding and scatalogical details. Do they do this every week in the same diner? You would think someone would complain. Oh, wait, I forgot: The other two dinners look at one scene. But this is just a setup for a punchline. All other diners are deaf.] <br /> <br /> There are three studies in the second law, all of which are due to Mia and then the brain is rolling around, the four failed to ask each other about what was happening between them. . And I asked myself, as the studies continued, as well as any freedom fighter among them could stay with them for more than a day? Does he start with the friction of the brain? I hope Eric's character, married friend, do more than just boring punching bags. His role was clearly advised to marry. But they will not talk to each other, why they are even bothered to talk to them? And his advice? Shise! <br /> <br /> The third thing is to decide what a plot is, but till then I was looking at my watch. My friends told me that they are still waiting for something really interesting and I had to agree. The scene explains that all the scenes were enough and were directed to explain all the questions and mysterious dialogue bit throughout the film, but we were just testing them from a list. ("Oh, well, Brad was the reason for this incident and Jonathan said this ...") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Even the credit outtakes were not very funny. Finally, I left nothing but the desire to warn people from this movie. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 3
