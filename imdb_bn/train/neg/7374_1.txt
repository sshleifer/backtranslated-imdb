It's the worst movie Steven Sigal ever created without any doubt. And that says a lot. Do not fool by rating, it's a very good way. If such a thing exists in such hate, 0/10 rating was not eligible. <br /> <br /> - The worst action scenes <br /> - The worst action scenes, and there are not many of them <br /> <br /> - Seagull war, conversation (many of Dubbing ), Etc. etc. As usual <br /> <br /> - Seagal can not care less about fat, lazy and this movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This absolute crapfest describes 1% as well.
