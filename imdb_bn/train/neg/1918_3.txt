The TV version of "Twister" has some leaked springs but it is useful to watch. A few years before the liberation war, my sister bought it at Wal-Mart, I saw it again and thought it was okay. Later, "Twister" came out with Bill Palman and Helen Hunt (or was it before? I think it was '97) and did a good job overall. But the "twister" was more stupid fun; This is realistic with a message. What do you expect from a movie with twisters: twister, or less budget character research? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, who went "Wild America", "Final Destination" and "Slackers" here, he got a big break here. So in the same way, I was the first man to see him. I do not know whether it's any honor or shame, I do not see how he works in recent movies. <br /> <br /> "Twisters night" depends on personal taste, as I said, it all depends on what you want from a movie with twisters: twisters, or a low budget character research. "Twister Night" is next. So you decide. <br /> <br /> I can give it 2.5 / 5 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
