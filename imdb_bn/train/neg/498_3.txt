I saw this movie when I was too young and I was funny at it. I saw it again last week, and you can guess the results. Some interesting parts are very low and very long. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you ask me, it's funny. <br /> <br /> This is a good choice if you want a total movie, but do not expect more than the Alliance Duffer size.
