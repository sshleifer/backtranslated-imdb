Let's start with saying "Juan Diwani" just a sad movie. I agree with the last person that "I've missed it". Hah hah <br /> <br /> Jokes were just terrible. Performance was average. Something went wrong with the photo. Imran has got some good rights. All Cilana JAITLEY has been released. Rishi Vihara was going well. Imran Hashmi was just fine. <br /> <br /> Mannan (Imran Hasemi) is a great man who wants to be famous. Therefore, she uses Radha and loves him, because her father is a music director and she can help her become famous (because parents obey everything she tells her daughter). One day, the manga and her friends go to geo for some fun. There he met Roma (sewing ghetto) and completely fall for his face and tried to flirt with his BLA BLA BLA. Then, on that night, Roma can not open the door to her house, and the MNA decides to help her. As he does not see as well, Roma is asked for help. When he left, Men was able to open the door and decided to come in and sit on his bed in bed Bila BL. ROMA comes and they have one night stand. However, one night - Ramadan falls in love with him. In the morning, they show Underworld don (Mahesh) who saw it all. Don loves roma and can not stand what he saw. He ordered them to marry, and became frightened, obeyed MANN and obeyed ROMe of Rome. Then, the news of their wedding news ends. Later, the MAN was discovered that he liked Roma after making a music video together. She is now stuck in love and fame. BLA BLA BLA <br /> <br /> The movie is awesome. The remix version is even better, but "Sinn Nn Sinai N" songs are fantastic. "Dil Diwana" is also great. The title track is also awesome. Friends, avoid showing this movie.
