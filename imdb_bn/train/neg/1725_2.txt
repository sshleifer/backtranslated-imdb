- Open the movie with a membrane crash with a lake. Unknown to locals, a dinosaur egg is also below the lake. The owl makes the lake warm, making it a giant incubator. You have guessed it, the egg dash releases a dinosaur that makes the community terrorists. <br /> <br /> - How many garbage is there? I do not think stop-motion soil dinosaurs, it's something other than a movie that annoys me. The acting is oppressive. The dialogue is completely ridiculous. Comic Relief Comic But Something Logic is not existent. In this movie, "Scientist" and a genuine scientist, any similarities are completely narrow. I can go to the bad aspects of this movie for eternity, but you get the idea. I think this disaster "MST3K Eligible" calls it fairly safe.
