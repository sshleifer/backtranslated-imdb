My friends and I did not know what I can hope for in this movie, but I hope the best. When we came out, we only knew a little more about the movie's plot. Although I have never seen the worst movie, I certainly do not recommend spending your money to see it in theaters. If you really want to see it, it's a friend who hired it for you (it's not worth the rental price). <br /> <br /> When a movie is so narrow that you have no idea what is going on in the past five minutes, there is not much that can not really be told in its defense. Acting was pretty good, wanted to get you from this movie, and some shots were good, but it was bogged down all by a lame plot and poor script. <br /> <br /> This movie was actually so bad that as soon as it came out, I went and bought a ticket to watch a good movie to clear my mind. I suggest you just go to the first step and instead go see a good movie.
