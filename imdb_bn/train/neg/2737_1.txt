This review has no spoilers. There is nothing to loot <br /> <br /> No plot, nothing; Most clip shows try to tie the clips to the plot by at least some tedious extremes, but it did not do this either. Clip, three lines can be bound to the next intimate sequence of low clips ... All right, perhaps they were short of production time, but they were better than skipping this episode altogether. What time is the waste <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it was made. Scuba is usually better for solving tropes, but anyway .... .... <br /> <br /> They came back to heaven again through the next episode.
