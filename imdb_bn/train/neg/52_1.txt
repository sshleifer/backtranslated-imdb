I was excited to see a Catalan movie of Berlin's competition. But after the presentation I was total frustrated and furious. Too much blood, too much time, too much theme for nothing. The Spanish Civil War, like every war, was horrible. Revenge, very human behavior, is not quite beautiful, in countless movies and plays, as well as relationships between homosexuals and the relationship between the Scots has been shown in Spain. But what Mr Villaronga tried, it is an incognito tragedy that can be the worst part of film history. Angela Molina in this movie is really sad to see. I recommend someone under no circumstance to see this image.
