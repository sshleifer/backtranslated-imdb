This film has been focused on the feeling of not having any quality of movie making. It goes far beyond unbelievable to incredible, weird to funny. <br /> <br /> The incredible plot tried to rescue a third soldier by two British soldiers and a Hindu gafar who was captured by a rebel. Indians. In the next scenario, we see a full Regiment with drums and bagpipes that are running in an ambulance. In the British army, a sergeant does not order the rescue and if you get past, then he will not try only with a soldier and an Indian servant when there is a complete regiment in the hand. Indian rebels are so unbelievably dissatisfied that it is ridiculous ... there are hundreds of them but they can not retain their captive or kill two rescue workers, of course not. At one point we saw British soldiers throwing stone blocks from the rebels' hill, those who spread around the attacking hills ... it can be a harm for a brain that it will not hurt. After the shooting of Curry Grant as the rescued prisoner, he read the water around the floor and read it ... no one is shot dead in the back. The water boy bravely uses a bugle (which does not come from anywhere) to hear the alarm ... It stands on a wall so that he can see and shoot by the bad guys, and as we keep it, a tear is torn again and again. And the earphone call becomes a weak square ... instead of hiding the hide behind the cover with some half-brains, more notes Try to make it sound. This scene is parading on comedy sketches. If they want to make a booster kettle comedy, then they should rent cattons and it should be done better.
