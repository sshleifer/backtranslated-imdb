I saw one of the worst movies that used to work in camera, sticky filters, film vases, scripts were scary, I mean, how much of a great battle was expected in the end ..... <br /> <br /> Some scenes of war I was right .... <br /> <br /> Some scenes were so bad that it was ridiculous ... as Soro got the horse and finally wandering ... LOL I mean, really .. a horse? Oh, forget how bad killers can ride in the same car across the whole movie .. No one will think that after witnessing the murder of the Federal agent, they will follow..HT, ETC would not really be bothered to see it.
