Cameron Diaz married a judge who played Harvey Kettle, whose life was completely complex until it became a bit complicated for him. Seeing this movie, I asked myself why I was doing this because the film is so ridiculous and vague and badly recorded without any credibility. No matter what happened to the audience, it also happened. Even the beautiful cameron can not save it from one to ten scale.
