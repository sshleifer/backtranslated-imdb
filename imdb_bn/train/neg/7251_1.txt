Great western I hear you all hear! Bright first effort! Well, I'm not sure what image you saw, but I saw it should be something different in it. Great Western or indeed a genre of good films, you can believe that there is no character in this movie! Acting was poor to say at least and I could not care less about any aspect of the character by fooling the whole character. The story was too big for the creators and perhaps they will try to give low budget junk to you directly on TV, as you look at "fact or fiction" programs in the "Fact or Fiction" ad. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good movie, a great western or even an enjoyable hour and a half, please see elsewhere.
