An ancient mummy soul could be punished to everyone involved in the insult of his grave so that one of his followers was shifted. Transmigration of the soul makes adolescence at the young age until she makes herself a mummy. One by one, the egg in the blood is drained from the ingredient. <br /> <br /> As soon as possible to be short, Pharaoh's curse is very unlikely. Although the film has some good, original ideas (blood mummies, soul transfers, striking makeup effects, arm pavement scenes etc) and present some atmospheric moments, define aspects of direction and motion ploding. To make things even worse, the first 15 minutes of the film contains much more than the typical 66-minute runtime padding. I usually go for this slow moving mummy movie, but Pharaoh curses even test my patients. Throwing helps very little. With only one exception (Java Rhoden the only bright spot ?? this film can focus more on its mysterious character), neutral like Cast screenplay. Finally, I do not know what it was like to look for the adorable looking das trousers, but it's a ridiculous, ridiculous look to scare the audience. <br /> <br /> Despite my most negative comments on the curse of Pharaoh, I'm going to rate it 4/10. Not sure a good rating, but all the problems I have with the movie are generous.
