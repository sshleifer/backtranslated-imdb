I laugh twice. The line where the main character tells me something about the street. And then I forgot to laugh at another time. It was probably at the beginning. <br /> <br /> This will be the greatest movie of all time. Hollywood does not realize that such humor is frustrating and sad. You can only insult yourself many times. <br /> <br /> 2/10
