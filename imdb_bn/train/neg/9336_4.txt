In the early black market of the early 1970s, the "blackspleption" targeted neutralized crime-drama. Playing star in the title of Palm Grey, a nurse who becomes a female vigilant after a drug-dealing decoy, junkies coffee sister. Violent nonsense plags inherently, with canned energy and tension; Only Greyer's temperament mood gives a glimpse of the description (she is not an actress here, but she initially connects with the audience). Charles Branson was much different than what he was doing at this time, the film was sold in the market and was notified as cross-exploitation, but it was still able to find the audience of a large inner city. But today, it is only a footnote in the film history of '70, and the lack of wide appeal of other such films. * **** to 1/2
