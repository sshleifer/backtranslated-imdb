This is an unmatched series of a great action movie. Looking for the cheap, and worst of all, the action screen! The only decent thing about the movie is the last war sequence. Just 82 minutes, but it seems like it goes forever! Even Die Hard Hard Van Damme fans (like yourself) should avoid this one!
