Sad ... worse than the TV movie for a bad made. I can not believe that Spesy and Freeman were in this shock. For some reason Morgan Freeman's character continues to speak and NSIC is saying "pussy" while mentioning the boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman is telling the "fractions" to the woman is just odd ... what was the man thinking behind this picture? Many plot holes have made this movie absolutely helpless to imagine playing with a lot of acting, confusing camera angles, a lam script and cheap background music. <br /> <br /> I've hired this flop with less hope .... Well ... it sucked really.
