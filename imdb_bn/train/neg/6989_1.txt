<br /> <br /> Bad. Movie Ever <br /> <br /> <br /> What was the purpose of illustrating this remake (it turned into 90-minute informative form for the movie's soundtrack)? Zombies that * runs * ??? I think the director has never seen "dead" movies, which are fluttering / jerking towards their live hunting.
