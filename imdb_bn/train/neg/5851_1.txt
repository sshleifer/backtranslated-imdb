It was suspected that JESA was still not a hip, the entire LSD theme was married to the murder of a murder, it was a clear attempt to catch young people of the era without any burden of at least 60 seconds of Counterculture. Along with the side of the date, aggression, stupid and shameless dialogue suffers from many problems, LSD Flashback which can go on for a long time in the first 60 seconds after the house push, even if it is unable to create a true mystery, but the actual plot is a great way to do it on paper. The car, and it's the end that is very bitter and predictable (many bad televisions Not to mention the memories of the group), which is actually an anti-magnifier If this is a good movie then we may be able to disbelieve some things where it will help to enjoy, but the weaknesses are so bright that they can only ignore the impossibility viewers otherwise. I have seen an aggression on television and it is definitely late night TV fare that meets the space of the sky and passes someone's insomnia instead of actively finding a person. Very well, 10 out of three.
