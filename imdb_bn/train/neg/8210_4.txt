Okay, here it is: "Friendship of the Nazi climber, the Dalai Lama." The first thing we do is, we have got a big star without any idea of ​​how we will work as a German star, and we travel around the French, German, American and British for more than two hours. Then we created a series of wildly unfavorable incidents and moved them very broadly, so that the plots went almost unnecessarily. But if the spectators do not sleep, then we'll be sure that we throw out the details that our hero is smoking cigarettes at 22,000 feet high. Naturally, we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read many subtitles, so we have every character, even in the closure of the ban in 1943, even the lowest peasants in Las City can also speak in suspicious English. Of course, the fantasy segment can be managed in the spiritual and political aspects of the story, so what we do is: our Dalai Lama has now made friends with reformed Nazis, because later on film projectors, radios, old cars, and any other device with capitalist Western independence representation. Instead, our hero can learn from his young prototypes from a vague, undefined Buddhist religion that is not really brought out or treated as a genuine truth. We also see heroes scattered all the symbols of the protocol and the protocol, which blames the Dalai Lama, the rest of the Tibetan society, even we assume that these heroes and their spiritual leaders have deep respect and deep respect. In other words, we only believe that this person is now Buddhist, on his own path, even though we do not make a transformation or we do not think so far. Ultimately, but not least, we have hung a statistic at the end of the movie, opening up the allegations that China has treated the Tibetans fascinatingly (which is certainly true), in such a way that they have made themselves "political" films. It's nothing to sort out. So, Zat is not my idea. What zaki do you VAT? Can Zis make movies?
