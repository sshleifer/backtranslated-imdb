This documentary (or I want to say curiosity) is how ridiculous people can be, they are a perfect example of when they are full enthusiasts. Sincerely, I hate Cryptozoology. It's ignorance, it just destroyed it. However, there were some positive effects (the dragon was beautiful), but some information in this material was completely mesh and it is really frustrating because it is coming from the scientists, so it is eligible for 1. 10 and 0 An example of false information may be the idea of ​​hydrogen: According to chemstry, hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to produce in this ratio, so in that case, you really need a good explanation of what happens in a dragon stomach. There are plenty of white hydrogen in nature, but the flying flying creature is very loud and loudly aloud loudly along with loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly , Actually a bit worse, platinum idea: this element is more difficult than gold, and I mean myself I can not live that depends on how the Dragon. It's ridiculous, they present the dragonlike creatures less likely to conquer the world, but at least they explain why they have disappeared. Perhaps cryptologists call themselves scientist, but they are not. People like them lie with this humorous talk and the worst is that some people buy them. But I do not think a person who is aware of science will believe in the dragon after seeing it. Those fake scientists waste their time.
