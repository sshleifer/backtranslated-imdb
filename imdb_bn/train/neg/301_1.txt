This is the worst documentary ever to come in Canada !!!! The boys are happy to make other movies. What they want to do is create a movie and they do not have to write any of it. They keep the script switcher removed for the suite. When I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival of that year, I could not get out of the theater quickly. Please do not see this film.
