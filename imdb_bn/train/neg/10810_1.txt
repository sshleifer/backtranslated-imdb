The only thing to talk about this movie is - the scene where Shank Francis is not a musician with the character of Cap and wants to be a genie; Do not watch this movie. The story is horrific, the actress is terrible (Kiss, Shake!) And I would like to see Cappa twice in the free willi (equally awful) before watching this movie.
