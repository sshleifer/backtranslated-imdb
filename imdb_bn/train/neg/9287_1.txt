How nice! Why would someone already make a signal to a rancid film? Half Past Dead was a bad movie, but at least it was an idea of ​​what it wanted to be. HPD2 does not have any sources of what it wants. I can only explain because the screen exists. Spoiler: The whole movie is: Twich (played by The Curve of The Cookie Pound) moved to another prison where there might be a box buried with gold bricks. A riot spreads in prisons, rival prisoners, one of them is planned to flee and shoot a person named Cortez and Corzes. While married, Twitch's drunk and Burke (played by Bill Goldberg) daughter is abducted and kept in the death row. Burke reluctantly makes friends with Twitch and they eventually end up in trouble with the wicked prisoners, when their loved ones of the cottage are found out. <br /> <br /> This is the most unnecessary series from the universal soldier: The Return. The script is terrible, the actress is awesome, the dialogue is a joke and everyone in this movie is a joke. Look, I know it was a low budget movie, but this is not what these people can try to do. Some of these "movies" believe in the characters they play. Someone in this movie can not be seriously accepted as an actor. The trumpet will be ashamed of himself. His character "Twich" is most stupid Mineral Doll, who spent most of the time waking up by Burke or other prisoners. Bill Goldberg spread throughout much of the time, as he had to take a PhD (a huge dump). The battle scene is quietly dancer and kind, and HPD2 for an action movie is becoming quite annoying when it's going on! Don 'Someone will tell you that this movie is somewhat modest. It's frustrating and it's the main reason to negate the volumes.
