Naturally, in IMDB, there is much more hint than the movie's entertainment value, with the majority of votes rather than "weighted average". In this case, the majority give it a "one". How accurate they are! To begin my review, I will first confess that the title of the film "Allen Enterrador" is why I am totally stupid. It is in place and even an "alien" (I think), but there is no rhythm or cause (at least) in the long term, any real plot basis or resolution that I can not create anywhere. <Br> <br /> There are some scenes that are so frustrating (both lines, time and how to say), which are far more than the strange feeling you got when watching bad movies. I have no idea what an electronic bug seems to be indifferent about anything. <br /> <br /> "plot" includes only one area of ​​the place known as g-spot, sorry, that g sector ... and a virtual reality program is some kind of alien virus (?) infected. Otherwise, I think the image of the normal aerle is displayed as a negative photographic. <br /> <br /> For most movies, we shoot people with space weapons, leaving out of Loft and seemingly endless, "Where is Airless?", timeless shut shot of "not finding ailerle" (scarcely because most of the other shots A computer monitor is related to contact with Arial). Commander Skylar (Billy D.), in order to find this alien virus and become one with it, every fantasy of the accused program is sitting and watching ??? ??? Or maybe I miss something ... <br /> <br /> Billy de Williams took a few courses in "How to Work for Frustration" before filming. Because we know it, he moved his fingers down to his face and looking for the condescending. <br /> <br /> The docking scene with a ship's nose went back to the other that was semi-funny, and available for laughing along with the initial scenes where we see some shots of the ship because it is only shaking in one circle, the lego test is much more awful Done. <br /> <br /> Everybody thinks that they die in this movie, then why are you disturbed? Even VR women are killed, as if something is meant (especially since everyone else dies) ... helpless <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I save money on the profit That's why I'm not bothered about the money I'm missing for my DVD that's missing my money. For the sake of these critics I saved the dollars that I had saved in the Vanilla Waffer Bag. <br /> <br /> I'll just add that story, at least as a novel, and much more, probably to be quite interesting with the right author. <br /> <br /> 1/10
