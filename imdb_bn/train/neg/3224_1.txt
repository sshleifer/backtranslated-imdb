When I was a child, I remembered it when I met a friend of my "aunt" Phil. We're back! A dinosaur story is a harmless cartoon about the dinosaur named Rex (voice by the wonderful John Goodman). He told a small boy dinosaur how dinosaurs came back to Earth. He explains that he was part of some who were brought back with some friends. The doctor / professor of this film thinks that he was responsible for his return, but I do not think about him. Children may like this, but personally it is very very fatty. John Goodman was probably the only decent thing. Poor!
