The creativity of this movie was lost from the beginning when the authors and directors left a good story line, only to replace the terrible special effects. This movie seems to have focused on fun kids, but also could not achieve it. There are many small budget films that are likely to be big movies, but this movie is not near any place. Fortunately this will make another film easily, and easily forget. The actors had little chance of earning a little money until the film was likely to bring a real role in a better film. Anyone who expresses respect for the film, must definitely avoid the cost of this movie.
