I hope I can give this film an empty, or even less, because sadly it demands. I honestly did not move away from any movie, but it was a terrible horror that I could not wait for another minute. Please, please - Please for the sake of mankind - skip this movie. If you really want a hot lesbian movie that you really can enter, it is not. <br /> <br /> This is unreasonable, unexpectedly leads, sticky formation, funny dialogue, and it's fantastic everybody's fantastic. At the very basic level, it fails to entertain. Everything about "Amo Kiss" is so strong, I have seen that this is true compared to a female film. <br /> <br /> If it is not enough then the whole movie is constant (and I mean Constant) on the description. The script writer also wrote a novel, because instead of listening to everything, it emphasized instead of listening. We are convinced that Lou and Sassafras are the best friends and it has a special connection, although there is no character development developed. Also, the film is introducing new characters in the first five minutes, and not the usual, but the frames of the letters on the screen are written on them. There is no role, no development of any character. We really do not know any of them. <br /> <br /> This is the most amateur movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I'm a gay woman who saw this movie my roommate (another gay woman) and we both saw this movie as a boring presentation of Quir the movie. I have started to think that lesbian and gay movies are much like the Christian rock - it does not matter how oppressed it is, people will still be up and running, people will still be the champion, how bad a quality is. Please do not rent this !! Instead, we encourage the production of quality gay and lesbian films by hiring "a cheerleader" or "fire" or "heavenly creatures" instead of consolidating an uninterrupted triangle without being aimed at gay communities (ie quier as a person). .
