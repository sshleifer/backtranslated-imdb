Take your basic Frankenstein flick, some injectors (but not good part), and your doctor has Hackenstein. Of course, it was certainly inspired by the previous films but it does not implement anything of its own. <br /> <br /> A scientist wrongly murdered his wife, so the whole movie happens within one night when he tries to revive his wife. In order to revive the wife, she decided to cut off body parts from some women, who have become frustrated and, eventually, decided to stay in her place. <br /> <br /> I'm not really acting bad or not. Here everything is exactly the way too much. Humor is actually working (see the scene when Hackhenstein is hiding behind his deaf helper) because he will be very annoyed by seeing a woman and needle catch), but it is rarely enough to recommend this film. The music is honest, it is suitable for any blood, and cast looks pretty good. And for half the time, I was also entertained in this film. But I never thought that there was more to this than waster. Avoidable. <br /> <br /> Try instead of Frank.
