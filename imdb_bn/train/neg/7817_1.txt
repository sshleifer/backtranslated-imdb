At the beginning I was happy to know about a new Superman movie, although it would be great but it was not. <br /> <br /> A bad copy of Richard Donner's work, Lex is again a villain <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> (All things Luther finds a museum or an old lady). <br /> <br /> The story is wrong, it should be Kevin Smith script and it can be even better. <br /> <br /> I hope Brian Singer is a new talent manager and a copy for something new and not a copy. <br /> <br /> Everyone will read you later
