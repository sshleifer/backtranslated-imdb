This image is "riveting" but riveting a car crash in the same way. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing but an incredibly illegitimate experiment - and it's a vain, biased test. There is no problem with the filmmakers passing and the lowest possible index. How Ted's money is presented is pure absorption. The filmmakers were forced to intervene in TED (meeting with so-called experts), and there was a contradiction in any effort to connect with TED. Instead, it is painfully obvious that they help to serve filmmakers posters and make Teddy's situation more useful. The worst part is that filmmakers will follow Ted after 6 months; And apparently they are cut completely from the subject to be followed so close months ago. If they took care, they found more "experts" to help Ted. They really wanted to know what Ted would do, then he should have given money without any interference. This image is not the best one of the tall Jacques Stunts and Documents. It is sad to think that how many 100,000 dollars could have changed the lives of homeless people, it was kept in the right hands.
