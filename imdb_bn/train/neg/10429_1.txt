The first half was okay, but the last half is really really frustrating. It is interesting that producers have also acknowledged that there is no source for their end and it is really shown. What is really sad is that I will be able to post this to write the ten lines of the minimum comments. Since the program is not really an effort, I did not really want to include spoilers for my comments qualification. When Blaher Gallatika came out first, I was really excited about the expectations of a good remix, it was not the first season of space porn. They finally cleaned it a bit and actually had quite a nice drama, so I started to see again. But with whom to complete the series as a cyclone angel angel, the ballter and six were pretty much mobile phones.
