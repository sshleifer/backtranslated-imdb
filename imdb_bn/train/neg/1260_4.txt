Yes, chunky, this nickname tag Tom Drunk by the romantic lead of Damna Reids! So let's get this clear straight away. His last, Gates-Ajay (1941) role, as well as his last, Dallas (1984-1985) Miss Red can not be described as a chakki. This is not an attractive and thin actress. MGM's role is rarely its genius. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Reed supported by a cast cast of supported character, unfortunately this flounder through the accused 'screw ball' comedy must. Clearly MGM Making this kind of film was out of their depth. COLUMBIA, PARAMOUNT, RKO and even a type produced at Universal is good. Ernest LÃ¼bitz 'Touch' or Preston Sturges' intellectuals could not save this image. The romantic comedy rather than all the symbols of pre-war (WWII) effort. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Daylight This is a challenging family entertainer Louis B. Not fit into 'safe-zone' in Mayer. A form that can not stand up to 'deviland decision', battle theater chain, television loss and post-war, and contributes to MGM deterioration. Fortunately for Donna Reid, her best days have been to Eternity (1953) and her Oscar won the best supporting actress.
