I think Michael Inner Sides will end the acting career, if he plays this kind of starlet in this kind of fork. Surely he can do a better job than wasting his time in this trash. <br /> <br /> This movie may be better if it has a good budget, but it can be seen repeatedly through movies. There is a scene in a scene, which looks like, it was outside the front of a railway station, and I had bet on it. <br /> <br /> One view which gave this movie 3, and it shows the spacecraft took off on a lake surrounded by landing and forest. This has been done well, but the rest of the movie, forget it. <br /> <br /> Another scenario, which seems like a engineering plant, that I betting it, and it does not seem like a spaceprost, the character says it's <br /> <br /> This movie is stupid, has a poor low budget, no knowledge and God supports Michael InnerSides.
