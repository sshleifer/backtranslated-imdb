I think the least aesthetic would be beautiful. It was slowly, indulged, and boring. I almost fell asleep. There are some decent songs, but at the end of the song some people shout "Yaowwww!" When someone taps randomly on wooden objects. That said, there are some pretty songs, but it is not worth watching the hte movie. Go to iTunes (have their album), preview it, and select the best ones. <br /> <br /> Half of the cinemas are some people making tea. Well, it's a little overwhelming. But if you see it, then I can understand. That said: Do not see it!
