"Well Chuck Jones is dead, adding cheap explosions to his characters soil, an American painted anime style and gives them the director general". "But Sir, are we not ready, there are so many things in this work that are already there? Very rarely do not dump the dream of their original makers". "Yes! And those shows made us a bunch of cash, and we need more!". "But will not every woman, male and children, who grow up with lower letters at this time, be disturbed?". "Hey, you are right! Set in the future, make them all the main characters, and change all the names a little bit ... but not too much, we need to feed our classic success." <br /> <br /> <br /> This is the only reason I wonder why it also exists. If you think you see the terrible insult of our beloved Looney Toons, but it's OK. But then there are Team Titans, which are the same bloody things. All characters are equally like Batman, they roam with the super-villains filled with any sort of vessel, they have the Director General, only the difference is that they talk like luni tunes and have the same name and character traits. <br /> <br /> This type of thing is included in the category "It is very ridiculous to make it better". Think of Super Mario Brother's movie and Batman and Robin. If you want to laugh at all the wrong reasons, check this out. If you can pass the young generation (this thing is really intended for what purpose), and greedy executives can pass the brutality, then go with it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy this cartoon then I have a problem with you, it's like people who count this thing together that I'm crazy. You know how smugglers are like stealing cars? This show is like robbing the grave. They can unlock all the people involved in the original cartoon, remove them from an exhibition, wear their clothes, wear thief clothes and charge money. If this exhibition does not use characters (those that are not similar to the lonely tonnotes) have already made millions of studios, then it would be fine. But no! For the shameful Warner brothers for shame ... <br /> <br /> If I saw this thing as a 30 second GAG episode of Simpson or Family Guy, then I would love it. It's not that I can sometimes believe it is believed. I bet that anyone who works in this dispute will hate it 80%. But whatever it is not really important, in 10 years this event will be forgotten, even though the original people will live forever? Or at the end of the world at least <br /> <br /> "Coming to 2008, Swanpi and Peanut gang have come back, and now they have laser lasers and can disappear!" See Charlie Brown, the evil alien wardard wizard, and see. "
