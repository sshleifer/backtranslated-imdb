This picture was terrible. Although the script is completely unrealistic, it is written for real-world execution, editing and photographic effects are worse than most first projects in the film school. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone: a) Know any information about the police or secret operation B) Know any detail about filmmaking or gratitude <br /> <br /> I recommend this film to the average or lower average mind, I think it would be enjoyable if I enjoyed it. If you absolutely look at this movie, I recommend a lot of restrictions <br /> <br /> Total waste of less production value.
