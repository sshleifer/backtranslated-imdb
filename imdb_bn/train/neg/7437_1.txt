This movie is not worth the time or money spent only. Clich√©s are completely and a plot that makes absolutely no sense! I can not believe that so many people have given this horror movie 10. My guess is that they are movie producer Stuats. <br /> <br /> If I can give this film zero, I want to. Very bad IMDb does not allow that. <br /> <br /> The only reason I saw because I went with a friend who wanted to see it. What is sad is that I did not have great expectations to start from this movie and yet I felt small changed. Take my word, this piece of trash does not waste your $ 8. I got the only entertainment from the cinematic movie. Not all, highly recommended!
