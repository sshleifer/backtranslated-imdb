Cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'Monchis' Another Greymin clone coming out of the 80's <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Indeed I found it more recreational than perhaps 'Ghoulies', but I like her dark tone thst. From going to get it plays its fooly nature (which is good for it), but because of that nature hammy acting (Alix Elias and Charlie Phillips), rather you just see amok running munchies. Where the fun happened Although the most light-hearted Fleph is the story behind the supposedly ridiculous encounters (some moments work) behind a small desert city in the desert, mainly in deserts (who are hungry, horny and destructive). It's stupid, but oddly zippy pacing is so compelling. Animals look rather soft and badly detail, they are being chucked about basic dolls. Where their personality came, they could actually speak ... and with attitude <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Two aspects of Harvey Karamen were acceptable. Robert Picardo also pops up <br /> <br /> Amusingly less cut entertainment for unwanted.
