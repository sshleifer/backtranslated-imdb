Going into this I really had some good hopes, but after damage this inflexed on me, I'm just happy to think straight. The filmmakers (HA!) Have trouble thinking that it was a good movie. The story, and I constantly use the world, is inconsistent and can not be done in any sense. There are just stupid things that happen random. Acting, acting can be called horrible I saw playing in the toy ad! I know it's a low budget video bin junk, but they still do not like it. Just after thinking I will fall asleep and still #Yayu # # I will lie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Any other feedback may lose any or all of the metal functions.
