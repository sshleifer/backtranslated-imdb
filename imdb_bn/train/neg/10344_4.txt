I saw this picture ran in TCM in view hours. I have seen several problems in the film. First, the age of the adult is not for 10 years. There were continuity in several parts of the film and for some reason the cartoon played the youngest boy at the age of 10. <br /> <br /> The copy I saw was about 20 minutes or more absent, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. This is very bad, because the script is left to prefer something, but both Bergman and Russell have made their film subtle in their role. It is a shame that the bigger part is missing, but what can be seen here. <br /> <br /> I just had it all intact. This script is based on Bugman's character as a childhood boy, but later he was brought back to adult care. Some time lines are not knowledge. There is a stock market crash like 1929, but the kids have grown to fight in the First World War. People supporting this movie are acting. I was surprised to see what the 20 gap in the film was that it was missing.
