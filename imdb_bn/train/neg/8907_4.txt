I hired in the DVD yesterday and did not understand that this is a "character study" movie genre, so I struggled for an hour to hit it before hitting the stop button. <br /> <br /> The theme, even with the study of characters, I could not just get all of these films. Perhaps it was my mood to see something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but to keep it away, I tried my best to try to see, but I gave up. The actors have played well in their role, but do not put together my interest in global coordination. The only interesting thing was to serge the sergeant's gun and he quickly buy another one soon, and spray painted it appears black as police problem. I think the film should have been entitled, "Who stole the sergeant's gun?" The scenes were well done but to unite them I felt robbery for some solidarity to see me again. <br /> <br /> Since I could not finish it, I would say that there are some advantages to renting this movie. .. may be. To me, it's time and time of good looking effort. I would give it up for you to try it, but I'm not the one to strongly recommend.
