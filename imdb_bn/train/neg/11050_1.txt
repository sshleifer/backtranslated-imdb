Scary use of cutting scenes All continuity is lost by terrible scripting or neutral point of view. The Volleyball Robot ... was definitely a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst word tracks I've ever heard (monologues usually drown by music.) And ... where do they get their props? That ship looks like a carton of milk ... I have a special effect on 8 mm of age under 13! <br /> <br /> I will see this flick of any film student (5 minutes at a time) how to learn not to produce a film. Or was it the editor's fault? <br /> <br /> This is really bad, because the scene was really a good idea ... only weakly executed almost all the executions. (Sorry Malcom.You should be sent a "double stunt." You are an actor very good for a stink-bomb.)
