I've seen my share of Woody Allen's movies, and although they are not always cool, you'll usually be sure that you're going to entertain. Probably good at the end was Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Affroth ('95) - Then what I saw was patchy but worth seeing. And so when I was invited to watch the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, I was still not aware, I was still happy. I really did not hear so much about it so I hope I'll be happy. <br /> <br /> I certainly found out that most Woody Allen films. The authoritative explanation is, throwing scares, the script is slow and lifeless. Many scenes have not said anything and are still stretched, otherwise I can fill it if there is a 15 minute short film. <br /> <br /> I do not think the concept behind this movie - how two directors discuss how a general situation can be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and of course the film plays in both situations, that is to show us the income. No problem with these two pictures is no good. Comedy is not funny and tragedy is not very sad. It seems that Allen came with a good idea but actually came out of steam or time to complete the film. <br /> <br /> The ordinary level of acting is also significantly worse - Farrell is the only one who brings something to the table, and it is essentially a Woody Allen Impression. Previously, good actors like Seveni have just become annoying and the worst part is Radha Mitchell Melinder (which is embarrassing, because in almost every scene of her character!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fair to actors, they The script that is working with is missing if it does not exist. Of course there is a long way from Allen to know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.
