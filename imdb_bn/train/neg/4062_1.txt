Some movies have provoked such annoyance to me, and it is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (how it ended, I could only be surprised). It was a 90-hour disgusting, derivative trash, this main impression is something like this ill-fated "Do not answer the phone" - but bad. All its addicts, rape and all, are shown without any distances (in contrast to hard things like "last house on left") and perfect? Unfortunate voyeur At the end I felt like taking the shower. Director no credit
