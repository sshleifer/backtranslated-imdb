This movie miserably fails at every level. I have an idea, let's all be involved in this movie and send them to a hot region in the Middle East. Maybe if we're lucky, all of them will be shot and killed and we will never waste their time. Did I say that I was not so nasty about the cottage in my whole life? My God, I can not remember what I saw that it was bad. I would like to see this sad apology for a photo of Ishtar in 25 minutes all night rather than sitting in 10 minutes. If I ever go to meet someone who is involved in this film, I spit them in the face and then beat them stupid. It's my two cents
