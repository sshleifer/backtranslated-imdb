Do not be afraid to tell me that I'm not a fan of horror movies. I do not ever see them. <br /> <br /> I tell about my experience ... <br /> <br /> I saw only one reason for this movie because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see Happy Fit. <br /> <br /> ... I have never seen happy feet, but I am sure that better than ... movies? However, we did not actually expect it to be good ... we actually went to laugh at it. Be calm with me ... I have a problem in destroying the movie for other people in the theater, but since it's just talking to other couples and making it, it's not a problem. <br /> <br /> After 15 minutes, 2 others wanted to tear down, a movie I was happy to see this again. It was funny that the movie was not scary and was not stupid ... it was just boring. It was terrible that "Baby Jewels" was not terrible, it was terrible ... not entertainment at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I am not an expert, but the problem of horror industry seems like this day is that you are a pg-13 horror that is not annoying and scary, or you can get an R . Terrible horror movie that is very bloody or very hateful to humans. <br /> <br /> Are you a PG-13 awful that sucks but funny? See "fault." Avoid this movie as a plug ... because it can literally put you in the face of death. <br /> <br /> 0/10
