All right, the 13-year-old was old for this movie. It's about a rat who pumped this pumps into a palace. Then a tow rat rushes him down a toilet! She ends up in this rats town and wants a gourmet frog from a jewel who meets this girl rats. He will do something for this jewel, he sent the whole army after these two rats. She plans to buy jewelery and plans to flood the city of rats! The cooler part about this movie is slugs. They do not affect all sound. They sing, the word, its awesome, it's very funny. OK at the bottom line, it is targeting 7-year-old. Otherwise, see a small film to see a small family member. I do not think the actual dream of animation was like art, Wallace and Groome. I think they slacked a little bit. The film was honest, although sorry for spending $ 9.05, sorry.
