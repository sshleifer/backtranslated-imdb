I just did not rent the creep and was at all affected. I did not feel anything in this movie. I felt sick because Gore was alone alone. <br /> <br /> <br /> I went out in my living room somewhat frustrated with this picture. Have not we seen this before all? I did not like any of the guy barr characters in the sierra cage. I felt bad for him. But then I could not think again why he was still alive and did not kill the cripple? So many questions will be answered. <br /> <br /> Someone mentioned the reference to the Ps2 games Silent Hill and I see imperfection. <br /> <br /> Not bad pictures, not good. Judge for yourself.
