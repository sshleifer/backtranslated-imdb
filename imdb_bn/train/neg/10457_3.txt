Can i say I'm a secret fan of 'over top' action and horror films. Especially when it comes with lots of humor and exploration, but I'm not a snake fan on a plane. <br /> <br /> There are three possible draws in this picture: ?? Situation comedy; ?? fear; And ?? The novelty of a flat hundreds of snakes. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not written as a tongue or comedy, and the movie only has 1 or 2 points where you will laugh at yourself. If you want to get the feeling of film then the trailer actually represents the movie, a horror. <br /> <br /> Secondly, if you meet any movie expectations and shocks you will not be disappointed. It's not standing on other movies, but it always keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> Third, although the novelty of a plane snake is not worn, you were the film's "mess of everything". <br /> <br /> I know this movie has a high rating, but it can not be added. A) The film is written before it is published, where many reviews and b) user ratings have very little diversity compared to normal, 77% of the movie's rating, of which only 7% people 9/10 - why such a huge gap?
