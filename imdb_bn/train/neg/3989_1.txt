At the same time, a playful song is played on their right, where they reveal a mental picture of two people? When Flipper took his wrong wife to the dressing room, the lyrics of the song with the lyricist jumped loudly aloud, as well as pushing down loudly. Anababella was so curious to beat her father with her fist, beat the lamps and then belt, that cartoon was there. This whole movie is a cartoon, severe adversity against Sadda is literally surprising. After the wife of Flipper, black women have discussed that she has cheated her with a white woman - as it is discussed by the Oxford debate team, ridiculous. It may be possible to tolerate racism, but soundtrack and music during this 'movie' are very much mixed. It was a technically badly made movie. There is no idea about filmmaking, soundtrack, editing and the great masterpieces of great artists trying to continue this great movie. I'm really sorry for Anthony Quinn, why he took the role in this glitter - his appearance is painful. The first movie I saw by this director and it would end me.
