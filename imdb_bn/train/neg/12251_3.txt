Oh, CGI When properly used is a blessing. It is used by a sin who has no idea what their job is. Sadly, this is not the only thing that is rarely used in Jawahar's rip-off. <br /> <br /> All right, anyone who reads any number of my post reviews probably noticed 2 things. 1: I like low budget horror movies. And 2: If there is a cute guy in a low-budget movie, I would usually order them. So, let's find this way right now. This is a low budget horror movie that I do not like. Acting, in most cases, is terrible, laughable impact, and the script rival saw the world as the worst in the world. As far as the intelligent son is ... Dax Miller (BOG) won that reward down the hands. This boy is hot! And, surprisingly, she does not have a toned body with beautiful eyes and a beautiful butt ... she can actually work (well, in this lazy film as much as she can). Now come out of the way home-owned activities, go with it. <br /> <br /> In the Cliffe Notes version, here is the story (do not worry, I do not want to give anything) <br /> <br /> A movie crew travels on a remote island, which is two surfers (a beautiful boy and his Friend) is a documentary film that surfs with sharks. They have a large salt water crocodile hidden around the unknown island. The angle shows, the helpless ensues, and the people are eaten. Roll End Credit <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, this picture is quite beautiful. It started quite well, but soon devolved to be stupid and stupid. A major character takes lunch (in a rather ridiculous way), and our remaining heros hunts hunting one liners utter. Also, if this crock is on top of both food and water in both the land and the water, what's with all the sharks around? This thing can eat 40 feet feet, I think some skimpy shark will stick around. FX is the worst I ever have to see some of the dissatisfaction. CGI is awesome, and they have even managed to screw up animatronic crocs. Attention, filmmakers National Geographic Discover shop Crock Hunter. Do they look like a crocodile? You obviously did not mention this trial by the psychology shown at the end of this movie. And what is the pirate / drug rack gang? Do you need another reason to just move the top of the women? <br /> <br /> It's interesting how we get a little sub-general of the movie world. With the Alligator and its Seagels Lake Placid, Crocodile, and now Blood Surf, it now seems like "over-crocodile / ammunition" movies have their own section in Blockbuster. Allies were good. Lake Placid was good. I was also well-known as a hybrid crocodile. Blood surf, suck. <br /> <br /> My grade: D-
