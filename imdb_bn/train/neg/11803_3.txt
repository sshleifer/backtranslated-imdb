Also, there is a chance that the remake is so different that it is very unknown to the audience. <br /> <br /> Well, the 1973 TV version was almost identical with "Double Handmoney" and the conversation was 1944 original. The main difference is that the remix does not seem to have any strength. Fred McMurre was primarily a lucrative, livering insurance agent like Walter Knife; Richard Krenna looks just world-tired and tired Edward G. Robbinson Macmoor's boss Burton plays a great role in his role; A fine actor, Lee J. Cobb, the proceeding is shown almost annoyed. All of the parrot Eger is wrong, like the cheated FÃ©lis Ditrichson.

In particular, Weber did well to revive Norton's role in the context of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, after the movie began, the whole thing is left without any life or electricity only. It is a film that should never be rebuilt.
