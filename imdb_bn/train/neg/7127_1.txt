This movie was bad to say bad !!! Excellent cars have been disgraced in abundance in this LAME movie. It starts with a race from LAA to Las Vegas at 1 HR 45 minute ... Ferrari F430. I did this at the Honda Accord in a small 4 cylinder 140HP 1993 in 1 HR 50 minutes. Seriously ... this movie does not judge these cars. Obviously these authors just drive under their speed limit and maybe 10 and 2 o'clock. Remember how I remembered Eddie Grafin with $ 1.5 million Fennie Enzo 30-40 MPH. >>> youtube.com/watch?v=cNVrMZX2kms <br /> <br /> ... Director Andy Change is the biggest salon! !! He brings shame to his own nation. I'm just amazing how many people verbal people break into Hollywood. He took part in a film that depicts the Americans of Asia in such negative and false ways. Asian women >> cheap money grubbing whores. Asian men >> Beat all the time that forced obedient bets and thugs. What's the fear of all about Asian hacks ?? Why always need to draw them on a negative definition ?? Hollywood is always a negative and false phenomenon in Asia, I am so sick that I am so sick
