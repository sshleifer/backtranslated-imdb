Accept, this version shakespear shallow disgrace! Someone could work without a nurse who could not do my job! Juliet had good skills as a teen but he could not give emotional depth to his line and we could not really connect with him. When he is thinking of drinking to fall asleep, the scene is bad ... God will cry! I could have closed her mouth! Anthony Andrews ... yes! Considering his other great film (Bridehead Revisited, Ivanha, Scarlett Pingperle), he is such a shock And do not start me in Romeo ... Phellessescse! It's still a good idea whether you are looking for any Romeo and Juliet to show in the history of the film. The version of Olivia and Leonard is still the best, Leslie Howard's version, and then the current Leo and Claire!
