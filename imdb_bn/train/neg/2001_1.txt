Why were so many people crowding in the evening showing Roberto Morira's "Up Hungest The Amm" ("Controversy Toads") at the San Francisco Film Festival? "It's about a hitting man," said my friend. "Well ... and it's brazilian," I added. Beautiful multitudes, tropical weather, lovely rhythm, and a hip gangster plot? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> So how did the world "Controversy toados" Berlin, Melbourne, London, Manila, Stockholm, Cairo, Chicago, many small local festivals, and now created the rounds of San Francisco? Apparently, on the way to the promotional process and film festival circuit work. <br /> <br /> First, it won the first prize in the Rio Film Festival, where it is the best Brazilian movie of the year. It must have been a bad year; They've done a lot, too many. Later, plus imaginary playing crowds with catalogs lead to the crowd auditoriums and - since the film is not featured anywhere, it is avoiding closely watching from critics - it's running round. <br /> <br /> Festive Blues: Sometimes it is a lot of lord at targeted promotion. The Chicago Festival referred to a "speedball cocktail directly shot by Brazil", known as "Contra Toados" and Claudia lover referred to as "slum-like stud". Sonahea "radioactive young girl like Tiadoro's radioactivity." The film "often shoots with the handheld camera urgently" and the director "creates a true and clear sense of anxiety and frustration from native disappointments and losses." The effect is "helplessly raw and honest", and the film hits "a conclusion on the way to the end of life as a display of death". Not the best text, but it certainly pumps the tension for a possible potential audience. <br /> <br /> "Controversy" is an injured person, two injured people and a wife and daughter and a born again Christian girlfriend. It has been shot - in a poorly deprived poor suburbs, where "Black Arpius", "Picosot," and "God's Town" were created, compared to slums in Brazilian cities like "Fewells" or "Village" - in the ugly digital video without any talent behind camera-action. , And not at this time in Rio, São Paulo. <br /> <br /> The family is suffering from family problems with Giulio Lopez and partner Waldomiro (Ailtan Graça) with a drug problem. Both actors have a little TV experience, playing Teddori's bitter blonde wife Claudia (Leonardo Cavalli) and Sylvia Lorraineko, who played Sonya of acting-rebel girl. This actor could do it through the back corners of a few telenovelas. Who knows? - In a well-managed film they can be even better. Along with them there are some young men who have been confiscated from Tioro, or when they are busy, the mustache gang. Although the camera can enhance their holes, principals do not appear too much. <br /> <br /> One observer at the Berlin Festival and a London observer watched the film's failure, but they 're burnt again in the web hinterlands. Henry Shehan has mentioned from Berlin that "film" (its quote) has been shown "the worst of the video". Shehan wrote, "It seems that the filmmaker simply chooses to choose the video," Shehan wrote, "did not create creative use of the new medium" - no, he added, made others creative. Shehran has written the first major mistake of the film: "It starts as a domestic drama, when it seems to be doing half-an-hour action, Mori says that the father and his friend are a professional hit men for thirty minutes Waiting has added nothing to the movie; It seems like a fairly neutral decision and in very short time, time is lost. But ratcheting up is not always the case. Like a little child who got a tool kit for his birthday, and without rhythm, reason or skill, sight is almost banging everything. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Everything else that is so bad. Alsankar acknowledged that "the lawless, violent and voluntary accounts in Sao Paulo are a favorite character and hence the lack of expectations Yeche. It is very dark and embarrassing about human condition, the film is not helped by poor subtitles. "Contra Todos is not helped with" Dogme "and Mike leggie with Alsangk. <br /> <br /> In addition to the meaningless first half hour, which does not reconsider our wait for the first acts of violence - which, when they come, Just "rhythm is screwing everything except for reason or skill" - Morira tries to leak his monotonous way, after which it comes out correctly It seems to come, then there is an incredible satirical conclusion where a letter gets married.Doubtless that the director of labor wanted to show neighbor lower-level Hitman "the welfare of evil", but the letters which do not see in general, can not be alive for us. The film's structure shows that he can not edit his material. <br /> <br /> (April 28, 200 5th in San Francisco International Film Festival.)
