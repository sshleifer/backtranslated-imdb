The sun's light does not burn, it was very wet, so I went to the movie, the cold, cold, wet date day. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie was "Hit in the Hat". , And when it ends, my stomach was sick. <br /> <br /> Mike Meyer played the cat, his humor was hair, and the kids did not need to see it, there was no humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> The acting was bad, the plot was heavily imposed, and was surprisingly very weird. <br /> <br /> It starts with Conrad and Sally, a rule break and future Sheriff. When their mother has to work, she lets Mrs. K. wan take the kids away. Perhaps Mrs Kwan is a Taiwanese court room, the only interesting part in the movie when watching a `LaCa Span. He's too sleepy, and here comes the cat. <br /> <br /> The film starts to spiral out of control. Cat kids came to try to have some fun. He got Things 1 and Things 2, who suddenly started trashing the house. He improved a TV infographic and accidentally closed his tail. And when the cat completes Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Perhaps her only funny disguise as a hippie worker. And there is a fish trying to warn the kids about cats. <br /> <br /> Very bad, she did not warn us that this photo was very fun like yeast milk, or stopped your tail. <br /> <br /> Soon the children are out looking for family dogs, who have a piece of key in their collar. If the piece is not locked too soon, their house cats will be at home in the universe. Here's a little more interesting, but the film is not enough to save. <br /> <br /> acting, overall, awesome Mike Mayer brings his cat's Austin Powers cat to the cat, saying things like "you're messy ho" and imagine yourself as a woman for your own life after examining postings as a pin. Spencer Breslelin is as good as the trouble-making Conrad, and interesting as Dakota Fanning Sally, although this academic orchetic discourse is not enough to wait John Ritter (waiting for an accident) to wait. Alec Beldwin's sticky and drunken lawrence queen is boring, sometimes trying to trace the mother of the kids, who played Kelly Preston. And Shan Hays is the mother of Humpharub, the mother's boss, and the voice of the fish. The next three are also soft. <br /> <br /> Overall, if I'm a parent, then I will not take my kids, because there is plenty of it. Save your $ 7.00 and see something else. The late great Dr. Sauss once said, <br /> <br /> Have fun to have fun, but how to know. Really, Universal, stop! Theodore already introduced into his grave. <br /> <br /> Like always my mother, "Curiosity cat murder" .- Cat in hat * *****
