This image is so great that it is a terrible clich√© 'ruddy film that is none of these actors Has played the worst. It really makes me wonder that many of these lists will agree with this outstanding movie. Worse, the state is actually about 100 million! To show that big stars can pull into money, even if the film is terrible. I'm sorry for everyone involved in this snore-fest. Billy Crystal tried his best with what he had given, and he walked through the motion of the rest of the stars. Anyone can be saved because you do not fall for nice cast, whatever.
