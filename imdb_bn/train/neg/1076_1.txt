This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Brango felt so distraught in remembering his transaction that he could not supply his line. The plot was definitely not worthy of John Grisham's name. It is not released as a book nor released in theaters. I do not even see the whole thing. I decided not to care for it, then realized that there was no "Hoodune"!
