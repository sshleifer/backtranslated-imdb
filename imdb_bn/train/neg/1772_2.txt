"SlipWellers" is the first movie that a script written by Stephen King wrote. Given it, and Sintu and Johnny songs that they use as a movie theme, you would expect an odd and ultimately complete viewing experience. Unfortunately, you're not getting what you got. Thing, they could probably make it a better movie. At the beginning it is a curiosity to do with the small city spooky atmosphere. But in some strange pictures it takes 20 minutes. The film turns fun for no apparent reason! From that moment the "sleepwalkers" are destroyed in the entire atmosphere. For those of you who have seen it, who could ever shout out the old John "COP KobOB!" Pencil jabing after a police ear? But do not get me wrong, Humor has no redeeming quality. I hired it again and saw that I was wrong for the first time, how the plot was originally given, but I was right. Man, what a waste. I can not believe that they got the rights of Santo and Johnny songs. I have given this a 2.
