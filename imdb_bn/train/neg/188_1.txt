This movie has beautiful scenery. Unfortunately it has no plot. There must be a conflict in which there is a plot. There was nobody in this movie It spent two hours in painting a beautifule scene and it failed to establish any activity. The film tries to be artistic but fails to pay attention to the basic elements of the story. <br /> <br /> If you like Montana scenes and want to fish, you will get some value in this movie which just does not expect a story. There is no one.
