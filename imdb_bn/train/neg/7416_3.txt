A fashion designer travels on a cat and falls into a pool, floating on the surface hit some of her head. Rather than the effect of the Chess (it was a TV movie) he floated from his body. He floats orange fumes through a tunnel of playing rings, and black strong figures are pressing his view (they look like the mansquin of his apartment). I almost thought I was watching a Jess Franco movie .... his friends revived him, holding him with a black hand wrist, and struggling to loose him. When he is resurrected, he remembers everything, and there is a nasty punch in his guard. After a while <br /> <br />, he was hit by the control car rising from behind him. On Halloween, she decided to go to Mexico for a holiday with her boyfriend. When he goes there, he is amazed at the day of death. They are disturbed by other American tourists, who follow them, and they almost drown. <br /> <br /> Designers are encouraged to join a group of people associated with death experiences. They all enjoyed the tunnel, but not nearly running away from black figures or deaths. One of them, and he is very worried. He is encouraged to meet with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> A doctor tells her about "Walkers" (named by the name of the novel). They are a person who has died in conjecturally, because when they are tested, they die for another reason. This way they die until they die until they die, but blame it for keeping poor records. <br /> <br /> I saw it in 102-minute video, and it feels very long. I can not imagine that the 192-minute version is actually! Perhaps for more than two or more nights on TV it shows that it will be seen better than sitting together. <br /> <br /> I read a Gary Brandon novel, Flatter, and if it is the representative of his work, he is not the most original of the authors. Flatra's general plot was: The person picked a child had to be vengeful. Even the diversity was quite common: children of the child, children and children, and died after many years of retaliation from the grave. And in fact it is a common point of view with this film, that the child exercises a strange projection and when he gets drowned, he comes out of his body. I do not know by following his close Walkers from Dead of Night. I understand that Hawling films are not compatible with their novels. <br /> <br /> This movie is quite slowly, and special effects and the film image is probably made in a low budget and probably - TV shortcomings. It has a lot of easily recognized character actors. It is very dated in the mid-1980s as compared to 1989. I think it's annoying. A very low budget movie that covers the same thing, I do not think that is Solly Survivor (1983) (controversial 2000's final destination movie inspiration). It's far away from the point of death.
