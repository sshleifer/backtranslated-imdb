This is a picture that takes some digestion. On one hand, we have a solid external shell, which is a story that not only receives the Catholic Church but is so foolish and unidentified. At an internal level, an orthodox story is given on our orthopedics, and when people blindly follow such beliefs, they do not understand that they do not understand. <br /> <br /> At first glance, it seems like it's a comedy. If so, then Mr. Darung needs to open a dictionary, because he does not know the meaning of the word explicitly. Jokes are pale; Humor is distributed weird and weaker. In particular, Mrs. Keaton's performance flight and above, below the levels of her Annie Hall and the slipper. Jennifer Tilly again with her high-bump voice and whining style, seduction model. It can be forgiven if it is not for the last 20 minutes of this movie, which was obviously a controversial game created in 1981. <br /> <br /> Careful, ahead of the spoilers *** <br /> <br /> This is the beginning of four ex-students of sister Ignatius (Ignatius, by way, a male name, and noon under any circumstances). It did not recognize it after his oath, only to show you how much relentless research was started in the project.) When they all acknowledge that they do not live in church teachings, the sisters became illusory and like the audiences By o. Faithful when he returned the way when corny, all-too-clich√© sepia-tone flashback. When one of them is admitted to have two abortions, then the nun becomes more abusive, until the doll can pull the gun. After wresting it away from him, the salt probably killed the doll, in self-defense. Then he shouted slaughtering his impressive homosexual alumnus. The last shot is like the dead female student, the shadow of Christ crosses the cross. Can you say 'heavy elephants?' I knew you could cross! <br /> <br /> I know the past is a shameful nun, and I know that many people have been mentally damaged, but this image is eating our throats in almost every shots. The ruins of a movie on this train. I have heard from the writer and the director that this film is about violence and why one should not follow religiously religiously, not intended intentions. This explanation is difficult to swallow, although it is simply not given to us a governmental view that is not biased against Catholic beliefs. This image is simply a Catholic anti-Catholic trip called "Justification and Equality," which means self-confident and hateful. <br /> <br /> This is a film that I would recommend for Catholics, namely, to wake him or her what they face today and the reality of ignorance. If it 'Robi Ray explains it all' or 'Imam Muhammad explains it', there will be riot in the streets and will lose all membership of the showtime. But, sadly, it is a film that is considered mostly in the field of strike, against it, it is acceptable and even appreciated to share the same acceptable aspect. <br /> <br /> I certainly hope that everyone who was a Cast member was a practicing Catholic, so this ignorance did not just bring them to create this film. <br /> <br /> I am not giving it 1.5 stars out of 5 out of it, but because it was badly written, poorly managed and generally just a bad movie. Do not waste your time even
