This is a horrible reunion of a marginal, but better than 70% of movies, good choices. I have seen the original at least 6 times. The 1997 version of the 20-minute movie 'Crammed', no matter what the 2 hours or runtime. The story of Chess, by which, is completely different from the original. The main government involved was far fetched. There is no further flow from one scene. Basically you can get a beer or hit the bathroom and still go up. <br /> <br /> It took only a few hours to change the oil pan in the car. It takes a lot of time in real life. The car guys notice this thing. Also, the fools or fools of 1968 should be shot in ankle with a dull bullet to cut the charger and to select the 1970 Challenger abuse. Actually they are not 'car people', it is painfully obvious, and their pardon will not regret. <br /> <br /> Actors have no emotion, everything is cut and dry. One step above a monotone. A breathtaking arm is more exciting and energetic. At the end, but at least not necessarily, Radio DJ gave the statement that the Challenger 180 or 185 (??) hit the bulldozers. That's total trash. Can you tell what pneumatic physics, or its lack ?? Hahahaha !! This is a joke in the movie. Do not waste your time watching this one.
