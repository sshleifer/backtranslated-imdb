At least I could laugh the movie which is amazing because I was just able to sit through it. All fidelity, my estimate DVD cover costs more than the entire cover. And saying that it's the same director like Boogman, when a new version of it just came out ... Nice touch guys, it was quite confusing to suppress me. The only thing that made me feel more frustrating than acting unnecessarily. Copyright was cutting her hair. Usually you see a ten year old boy as a hairdresser and the character plays like him. The film looks like it was shot in a film school by a D + grade student, who was excited to use any film technique learned while participating in the class .... sometimes a few friends. Through out I was lost somewhere or unclear that the random plot would be lost by twists. It produces a bad film, but with the end of it after the end it creates a great bad movie. Without any doubt it's the worst movie I've seen, and my friends for high school senior years include French final video, but perhaps I'm a little favorable, I'd say I get an extra game. Freshly I even deserve this one star ... not even half think. Not for you !!
