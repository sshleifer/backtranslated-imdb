Canon has dragged the real visual beauty of a medieval epic, which seems to be attractive (except Dragon Propaganda). Now how is the long-term studio known for Chak Norris films, the first complete lack of knowledge? Case at the point: The amateur acting and the horrific plot that marks a revival of medieval legends is not a remedy for some harmful executions. They actually created another cheap drying container with hundreds of lively bimbos to make it even better. For the two "Barbarian Brothers", they are definitely becoming so strong and brave of brave fighters that they will not be brave enough to save their own country. This is probably the only one of the very greatest waste that can be seen from a "costly" low-budget movie, and is good enough to hit the ax through fantastic prints without any mystery. All of these follow an advertisement campaign, based on Barbaryan T-shirts sold! Alone the movie creates a great souvenir!
