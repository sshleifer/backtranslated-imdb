Unlike my fellow critics, I have always tried to find something to redeem in a movie. Yes, the quality of dipping and lighting reduction, acting difficulties and those tempting women, with the initial confusing blood flashes with lesbian vampires. The title of "Italians" in the title should be lost in translation; Often the producers were originally going to a Gothic Vampire story, and then changed their minds, but they could not release their dramatic opening sequence, so they operated it in any way. <br /> <br /> This movie was recently released in 1975 and comes with its own theater trailer, which is bolder than movies in some cases! Now anyone who has purchased this film probably knows what his index might already read and what to expect - from the Italian softporn in the mid-1970s. Because I was attracted to Christa Nelly (most often referred to as "crystal nail"). In the absence of a cast of characters, I found the most frustrating of many Eurosome films in the 60's and 70's. Hopefully the cast will show cast of the names when they hear their name but it is very difficult to associate the respective actress without any cast list. I think Christa Nell played "Kora" but under the hair of huge hair, dress up and make-up it hard. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Music is atmospheric and of course you are beautiful The lesbian has soft porn. Used exotic location was good and I want to know where they portrayed the castle on its island. Is it "Ireland" ("Ireland" in North or Republic?) In 1902, so everyone dresses piece during the game. Some scenes I found strange sex scenes, especially funny !! Anyway a usable romp. I rated it 4/10.
