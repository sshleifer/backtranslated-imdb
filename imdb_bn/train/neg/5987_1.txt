I really did not like this film. The plot was very expected. General American plot, I'm sorry. Guy finally gets things like girl. And does London have a monorail? London bank ??? What is the bank of England really! - But I saw Tracey Island and Thunderbird's own appearance. And was Bright bad? (Except Parker and Lady Penelope) What was with that? Oh and they're not saying stuff like "Come here thunderbirds" - but why not in the series is it known as 'Thunderbirds'? I would like to see this re-made for 20 years with more British cast. I like the original series Sorry!
