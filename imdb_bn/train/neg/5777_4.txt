It's funny, when you stop it and think about it: awesome movie fans tend to have deep and lasting affection for everyone who are afraid of the dailies from them. The Texas Chancellor may have nightmares for us in the Massachuset, but who among us (trusted) Brutal Massachusetts-Gunner Hansen, or too much of a love for anybody, did not hesitate, forever and ever, the strong hero of the original donation is dead? His cameo in remix asked me to stand up and laugh (like Tom Sawini's camio); I'm not joking with you. And Brian Halloran and ... well, you get my drift (unless, just stand humble ...). Some of the heroes of this hero. Many of them have gathered in solo movies almost unknown (at least in this degree, in my knowledge). If only the author (s) was up to such a magnificent job. Maybe someone else, along the line, will try again. Until it is a half-hearted endeavor (for example, a blood virus).
