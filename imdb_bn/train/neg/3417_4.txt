Wow, my first review of this movie was so negative that it was not dropped. I will try to make this one tone. Be real Nobody wants to see Choke Norris, where he is not the main character. Ultimately there was a good fight scene, but the rest of the movie was frustrated. I have no wonder if the old chalk just could not hang with the better. Did he loose such junk so slowly and hope that his fame would carry him through the whole movie? Chuck is an extraordinary martial artist, and we've seen Waker, a good actor from Texas Ranger, but the strategy is the strategy to combine both of the qualities in his film, and it's not one. Extremely frustrating for our Norris fans. Chalk, stay as the main character in your movies, because it does not work for you ... Gary
