Unable to read novels, I can not tell how faithful this film is. The story is usually mystery element: the target of the killer targets the bride; The female investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosing a deadly disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and it just runs it out. The first 2/3 lazy to save for murder and return to the last 1/3 part because it increases speed in radioactive conclusions. <br /> <br /> Actually acting sub-par, though it is a difficult actor to blame: Screenplay is violent. Last 1/3 time you think the movie is interesting, but it is only the last 1/3. Director Rasel Mulkahi is much more in his content, but behind him, he can do so much with the TV budget and network sensors. He was quite limited to fast cutting and distorted lenses, although he was able to grab a couple under the "floor" during the murder of Club Clarus. Unfortunately, it has been made for TV, it does not find great composite details that are very well used with a great image. Note to the producers: When you hire this guy, give reasonable budget and an anaerophile lens. <br /> <br /> In short: This movie is bad by the film standard and intermediaries (see CSI instead) through TV standards. If you are in the mood of such a movie, then I have some excellent suggestions: Dario Argante's "Deep Red" (My highest recommendation, fantastic movie), "Opera", even a copy of "Teben". They are strong in every division.
