I did not like this picture. I'm not sure It is a film that is exclusively made for Oscars: Music, music, almost no filth, set in a long time, sepia-ton illustrations, motivated headlines, no SEX, and a talent that he thinks about music in almost every single frame Explains and decides on SFX / CGI so that we (stupid audience) get it. One thing that made me impressive has really made the Nobel priceless spell! Instead they call the Nobel prize (a real person named "Alfred Noble") called "Great Values." Such a big story, based on a true story, is supposed to make such a mistake. What shams! What did you and others think of Ron?
