Horror film About an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. Annoying Tatam and Blue go through the motion of his part and there are many rows in the film history. Richard Burton looks closer to death in this film, and we believe he is "good for sixty". Acting bad, as the plot As the story, the characters are horrific. In addition to Latin Evans, it is really hard for anyone to feel in this movie, who plays a man in a theater who hits the tatam, he is funny This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a fan like me - so I rent it first - please do not see this movie. He would be surprised if he was really bad, and perhaps you had a disappointment in the printing of paper. It was not because it could play well because of Bad News Beer and Light Darling but still do not rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, it looks good and there are not some fossils.
