I'm still looking at the video store, how Steven Siegel may still fall in one year with the film's track record of his worst action movie. For the ever-expanding Sigal of the Sci-Fi Generals. The scenes of bad movie entertainment spread to my blind eyes. It does not really come in if it is not bad with any entertainment and a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> However the attack force can be its greatest film ever! Do not argue for a murder, ticker, and even black people. Here below the septic tank. <br /> <br /> Anyone who returns to Steven Siegel's form by saying that he must be forced to write a 100-page composition in Tests. <br /> <br /> <br /> Another agent / I am one of the greatest bad ass, yet again, Lawson wants to take revenge on the assassination of his group, which leads him to a wolf conspiracy to deliver the real bad drug unexpectedly. There is no mention of the public. Do not come from vendors here. <br /> <br /> Playing from the whole movie is poor to play directly. Is this movie shot in the dark? This will be the most vulnerable illuminated movie after Holling 2. The action is terrible and very badly done. <br /> <br /> How the producers decided to hate most of the fans: Double stain doubled stunt and horribly dropped double steven sigall in double stunts. Who thinks <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> I said, it has become more consistent in the project's disguise and Segals looks more bad. I feel bad for director Michael Keesh and author Joe Hal, just as they will be judged forever for the rebuilding of ill advised. <br /> <br /> Now, in this disrespectful place, Segal will have to do something for this mess. Bad attack force do we really want to make him another movie?
