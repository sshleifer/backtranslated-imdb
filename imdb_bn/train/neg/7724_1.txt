Seeing all the negative reviews of this movie, I think it may still be the best performance of any other comic, which is not generally understood. I saw the first two battle scenes, listening to the widely distributed dialogue by Lungaran and everyone else was cast in Oriental actors, and I saw the movie so awful that it was fun. Then Brandon Lee enters the story and begins to catch one-fish, the plot is different, the script writers start drinking and welcomes the movie, because it sometimes turns into the worst action movie. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The film has the worst performances (see Tia CarrÃ©'s face in any scene with Doff, it's ridiculous), with the worst dialogue (comment about Brandon Lee's little dolph is the worst line in a film) and one of the worst teams in the film (full Japanese Dress dolph). The picture meets the "Tango and Cash" with bad acting, "Commando" meets "Friday 13th" (because of the stupid nudity and lunger performance too much like Jason Bhurhis), one hour and fifteen minutes of fun in a movie. br>> <br /> Good (how not awful) performance goes to the bad guys (that seems to be still bound by its full performance) and the carrier (anyone who breaks his smile as 5 lines). Brandon Lee is just being a street carpet in Langgren, and doing its terrible work <br /> <br /> <br /> A horror, horror movie. Fear it and avoid it. Even though you see it, ask yourself why water shots are twice as fast as the water shots. When talking about water shots, watch the Warm Water fight scene with the worst battle-scene-end. This movie has every version of the bad nude with short attention spans and to fill the nudity of the nudity <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > One Bid Bond Movie !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
