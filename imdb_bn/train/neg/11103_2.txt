All right, so I saw this movie, even though it appeared last year ... I thought it was usually a decent film, except for the story which was stupid and horrible ... above all, we do not know anything about animals, why they appeared , They are doing in our world, and indeed, they were not on earth before they came from the place? Secondly, the role of the slaughterhouse for maintaining order has been made so clearly ... how big can the underground be for a sub-station? There was a lot of animals, so instead of killing innocent people, instead of killing vulnerable people, they could make some strategic bombs, or perhaps clean it up and do a nicer job. I know it sounds funny and it is, I can not see people like killing ... Thirdly, Superman acts as a jumping on Leon's train and Vinnie battles with Jones, which is taller and larger than size. Then again, when he encounters the conductor, he does nothing and acts as a great man, he has seen all hatred. I'm fine, the conductor suddenly helped (Lol), but if Leon was so brave, he would go all the way ... I wanted to say that he took the first risk of his life, then there was never anything like that. He could die as a hero but life as a coward ... may be in this case, but not so much before showing braveess ... then, the police thing ... come! It was a city that had a city, I'm sure that the woman, other than other police stations, was certainly a fool. Of course, Vinnie Jones's performance is remarkable, interesting idea for the reasons behind this is not really built. However, what does the signs of the chest mean? Vinnie Jones can not make it for everyone ...
