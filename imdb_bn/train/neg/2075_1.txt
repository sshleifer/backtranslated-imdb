I had to admit I went to see this movie, I did not really have high expectations. But with my low expectation, I was totally and completely disappointed. <br /> <br /> Luk Wilson is a hot shot that goes out with little crazy girls. The girl has a girl behind her, but it's pretty cool for that character. What I think is not the reason of the mind, perhaps it will be treated like the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> When Rain Wilson (I actually prefer this movie before) on the subway, then he agreed to talk to a "hot" girl, to Uma Thurman. It's always weird to say, since everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman is not within the "hot" category. <br /> <br /> Rainy Wilson's performance is far from "hot". Usually I do all for his performance, but even he can not retrieve this movie. His character was violent, unreal, and rather annoying. You can not say if the writer is trying to make him playy gay guy, or just frustrated with a playful token. It was almost painful. <br /> <br /> However, someone stole his chest while leaving the subway, and he is run after robbery, because Luke Wilson is an impressive savior. Now we all know that Uma Thurman Superhero, or "G-Girl", since they want to call him in this movie. It still bothers me what it says for "G", but we will release it for the debate of the message board. <br /> <br /> The sex scenes I guess seem to be funny, but I asked myself, who has sex like this? Because of the "emotion" of Uma Thurman, they almost dropped the bed through walls. It hurts my head, but "I feel compelled to understand this method" is not the same. <br /> <br /> When Uma insults Anna Faris, I do not have any debate about calling her as "slut". He can not choose movies properly, yet he can not act and he can not depend on the golden and ideal. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll leave the theater if I did not pay $ 8.75 to see it. Character is ideal and absolutely no chemistry, especially Uma Thurman. Someone will let you know that you do not understand much about moving your head, you're acting. <br /> <br /> Also, scripts and storylines can use a lot of work or matches and some light liquids I'm actually starting to feel embarrassed for the actors, and their death career. Overall, if you value your money, and your self-respect does not waste your time with this great effort of your film.
