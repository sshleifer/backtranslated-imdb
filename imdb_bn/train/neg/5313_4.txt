Intergalactic Criminal Offender (Ross Hagen) has been sentenced to death and is waiting for the death penalty in a planned spaceship for such purposes. But tonight a prison is going to be blocked, and the coil flees a conveniently blocked turn and flies toward Earth (which is located near the apparently near). There he encounters a group of "teen" (thirty-year-old) and a play warden (John Philip Law), who helped him to protect him from his worst nightmare ... The monster hunter and the executioner Android (or more precisely "genoids ") Alienator <br /> <br /> From the cover of the box, I was sure that it's going to be a horror movie. But, it was as awful as it was, it was a ton of fun (probably at least partly because I saw it with a person who is becoming wildly wild). Director (Fred Olen Roy), who played a special role in creating hundreds of less grade movies (especially "Hollywood Chanceo Hawkers"), he does what he does well and brings together a plot that understands half sense and gives us the primary effect. Bonus: P. J. Souls (as his "as"), apparently below his career <br /> <br /> There are certainly plot holes. In the center of California there is a Red Corner in the center of the hill (if I understand the warden correctly, then Los Angeles County). What are the spaceship spaces with a spaceship blouse? Why is the ship's captain trying to conquer this heart so loudly why a theorem? What is the "Quad 5" hack? How does the chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will shorten an Android, even though land mines are virtually nothing? Why does Cole look like drunk, American americans football player amphisema? And the man of the moon (Robert Clarke) ... has a character even in his character? Is there a point to play with Captain? Does this movie have a point? But the biggest mystery is that the Android (or genoide) alienator, has been played by Tigan Clive. What is an "alienator"? Why does it look like "Blade Runner" to Daryl Hannah? Because, see, if there is a cyborg, then it is a part of people. But it's an Android, it's all machines. It was an Android, so it was no reason to look at people. It may sound like something. Yet, the person who designed him has created a linebacker with David Bowie's hair and a lithurd, which shows me a little more. If you are going to create a female android, then its purpose is to seduce him and the enemies will not be raised? Mission is not completed. They say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, but I think I've found a huge exception. <br /> <br /> If the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" was still near, these movies will be in a very small list of movies <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps a lot of stories and probably the letters are not really very interesting. And perhaps the deer scene is incredibly adorable - does any killer robot use it with a deer? But overall, I actually liked the movie. I will not be able to pump it to my friends or come out of my local video store, which is to take the latest DVD copy (which I am sure is packed with amazing special features only). But I've seen this film spend well and look forward to similar events in the future.
