Awesome, awesome TV show! In the comedy center, I decided to repeat the old episodes of this event. It sucks really! I'm, of course, talking about the season after the first two. The first two seasons were golden, and if I used to talk only about those seasons, then this show had eight planets in ten. After the first two seasons, no comrades are better than not being part of real cast. They were, and, awful, awful. Comedy is not all fun. These !!! <br /> <br /> The original cast was like very gifted comedians, such as Art Lanz, Phil La Marie, and Mary Scar (or whatever their name), they all could get a better deal after leaving MAD TV . This show is highly overrated, and Saturday Night Live, less capable than surfing your surf while compared to another awesome show. Go out on Saturday night and have fun and leave MAD TV dry and die, it claims.
