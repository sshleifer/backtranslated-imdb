It is a shallow rally and / or social commentary in a sad story about a jealous girl's scheme to distinguish her father and her granddaughter. Does it look at the eyes of a girl with echast or electra complex? Who care? All of the characters except Ana (Deborah Care) are empty and vain. SÃ©berg is poor (I agree with the previous level of comments "boys with breast"). Plot plodded This predictable material was enough for a 30-minute film that unfortunately extended for one and a half hours! If you want to see Raviea's gorgeous gown and jewelery, I recommend "catching the thief" - this will give you an entertaining story and additional bonuses for desired characters. <br /> <br /> I like movies for entertainment. I do not really care where I personally set a film Whatever time or place, I want a good story - comedy or drama. I want to see some usable characters It does not hurt if I relate to them. The poor Deborah gives a good performance and so David Nivan plays a disgusting role. <br /> <br /> "2" rating for Cable and Carene and for movies - Rich color scenes and dark, black and white scenes foreboding. Unfortunately, the world's greatest cinematography can not recover a poor story with characters we can enjoy. The ears of a seed are still ears of a seed. As a result of my watching this mess was a serious waste of time.
