Humphrey Bougert does not want to remain in this film explicitly and was forced to participate in Mexican or postponed. Believe me, he made the wrong choice! Perhaps after the success of "Dodge City", Warner tried to make a follow-up with the list of his friends like Iral Flin and Allan Heale, Guin (Big Boy) Williams, Frank Mc Hughes, and all-time current Little Lille, As an interest in love for Randolph's sketch, Miriam has made huge mistakes in presenting Hopkins and trying to make something really bad as a singer, because he has proved one thing, and he can not sing. The story was not very bad, but the compartment made a mistake, it became a poor western, which was very chasing, and in a low budget, but in fairness, the color could not help.
