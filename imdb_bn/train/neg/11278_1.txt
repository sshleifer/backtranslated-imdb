This film is mostly one of the worst movies, and it is not only a British film industry, but a deadly charge on unmanned hacks today. The film not only delivers mainstream, but it also features a great cast of British actors, so what's wrong? I do not know and I'm not taking enough care to get involved in the debate because the film was so horrific that it is not considered worth it. Be careful and stay away from this garbage. But apparently I would write ten lines of this review text so I could get the details as well as the plot. A friend of a wicked person is setup by his dad's mate's colleague and his colleagues and thus is a clash with the Russian mafia and fool-speaking and fool, very stupid plot twists / devices. I should have wanted to return my money but was probably shock from experience. If you want a good crime film then what is the usual suspect or godfather, lock, what about stock .... The peak of contemporary British crime film .....
