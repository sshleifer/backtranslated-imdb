With the title "Caller Tomatoes Attack", anyone who is going to this item is a) a bad science fiction film or b) a comedy spoiled bad science fiction. Both of these can be mixed, parody levels spread. Unfortunately, it soon falls into the flat. <br /> <br /> You're never supposed to take this movie seriously, I understand, but you think it's funny, okay? I was just a couple of jokes or situations (i.e. phone conversations, Russian Olympic spy steroid serial, Lowe's walking superman etc.). "Killer Tomatoes Attack" tries to be a classical classic, but it does not make it. A classical classic film that is so different that only a selected group can understand it (or similar description). "Assassination of the killer tomato" can be enjoyed by an 8-year-old cute fool, so it does not qualify as a civilian film. <br /> <br /> There is a good actress here: Sharon Taylor as Louise Fairchild. She is a thin, gawky reporter, but has a loving personality, loves to overact, and a natural comedienne. Unfortunately, he is using bad here. <br /> <br /> "Attack of the killer tomato" is not funny, like "moon manga women" or "kentucky friday movie", but it has a few sunny moments, so I would still recommend seeing it once. Stay away from the director's cut, it is barred by the producer of the movie and some inferred "lost" footage is dubbed in the African dialect (It can be found in English beyond the print tape).
