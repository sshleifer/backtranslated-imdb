My opinion of Snow White is a bad movie on an artistic point. The plot is quite far sighted, characters are stereotypes, the edit is very overwhelming. However, the film does not seem to have many artistic ambitions. <br /> <br /> Instead, I think it's a direct commercial thing. A character from the French part of Switzerland (including the director of the band, who is traveling with this movie - the band's name Sense Unic) looks at a larger audience. A direct German-Swiss film was not sold in the French part - and the opposite. What really got on my nerves is the placement of all products throughout the movie. Sometines views clip advertising! <br /> <br /> I also think that "young people are taking drugs without any other goals in their life" Therefore, it should be elaborated with more care. I hope Samir will get enough money with Snow White, so that his next film can show his true artistic skills.
