Are you talking to me (1987) is a great bad film that plays some people, who I have never seen before or before acting like a man trying to be an actor. There are heavy heavy jones for the taxi driver who tries to use the shotgun to make it big. When he learns difficult events in life, he does what he does, and changes his image! He goes from a surf's dude to the well fella to the night. His friend could not believe the change (but he believed to score with Ford and get a cool gig gig). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Who knows, someone will pick up the ball and run because the filmmakers of this time have destroyed this ball. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this movie. You do not want to see a hot faith Ford and a young bubble from Fest Gump. <br /> <br /> xx
