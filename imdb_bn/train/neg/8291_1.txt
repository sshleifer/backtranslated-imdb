A stupid dentist has discovered that his wife has been unfaithful. So, here is a new story line. However, the authors managed to create a stupid, annoying film. If you look at the opposite of children, or see a dentist who is dragging his or her teeth out of a bloody horror, then watch the movie (or rent). If not, go to something else (my best lady, someone?)
