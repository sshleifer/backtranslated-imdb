I found this movie to be a great idea, that does not provide. It seems they found a way to build up terrorism, but could not accept their salaries very well. In one case, to watch the secret place of the abductors, the police watch. They painstakingly visit a dentist's appointment to go to the dentist doctor. At the same time, the kidnapper escaped through the elevator shuffle. After making all the buildup, the police arrive at the same time whenever they are free, which is least anti-weather. There are also big description scenes that bring our terrorists' husband and wife "thinking", which is far from suspicious instead of adding them. We are fully aware of their tension, and loot a viewer of a personal experience with voice-over humiliation and fear, such as Hitko has been repeatedly proven, it's more effective. The greatest frustration is to sit through the entire movie, and quickly, rather to the soft end. I mean it's just "end" in a snore ...
