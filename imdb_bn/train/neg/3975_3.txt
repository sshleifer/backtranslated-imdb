First seen 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10 (Dew-Steve Purcell): Marie Kate and Ashley Rentals with a few kisses. The girls seem to be getting tired from this stuff and if they want to split and go their own way, it will be interesting to them what will happen to them. In this episode of their episode, they are in Rome for fashion designer, which keeps them right in the mailroom for their hard work (I think ..). Normally with the boys, there is nothing except the scene of Rome except for the flirting, and the movie ends up almost Â¾ the way when it is finally revealed why they are being fired, then rented, then fired again and again rented. It is certainly made by people who can not understand the corporate world and it shows them in the explanation. Perhaps the real world will be their next adventure (if there are). Even my children do not believe in this annoying 'adventure'. Let's see they probably have a few years until their legal adults. We will then see what will happen.
