I love zombie-movies and I love amateur-production. And the matching market 2 really starts flaws promising with a great respect for the classic "Zombi" classic. <br /> <br /> So I leaned back and waiting to be affected. Okay, some makeup stands out really like a budget movie and great actors (vampirelady and cooking), something great for anything else. <br /> <br /> I did not have a new hope here in Romero but there is not a sequence in the whole film which also has little surprise or shock value. The director definitely knows the level of how to practice body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it's time to learn more. <br /> <br /> rhyme with gore bore - MeatMarket2 is not enough for me - sorry. <br /> <br /> ** ***** Outside
