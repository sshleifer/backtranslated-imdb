The rumor is true: girls like girls are more than UGLY And as soon as the plot is given the reason is obvious. Jersey girl went to New York as a song writer. And after the initial disappointment of any fate, they saw some girls sharing about $ 300 a few nights. He works on this and gets a myth in the surprise bar! This place is completely full of "two-year-old kids." While the boys were dying in the dance scene <br /> <br /> This story is not bad and some characters are likable, especially cam ("Fashion Coordinator" was pretty cool ) And bouncers, but let's face it, the drama is terrible and was ridiculous from the beginning. Violet and his parents looked so ridiculous when they were related throughout the movie. And check out that much jamming on the keyboard with that breaktake dancer! <br /> <br /> For the first time I can remember, how can production be so terrible? For a short moment with this movie, Hollywood can stand on its two feet and saying that "You were warned!" That looks new in the midst of a big public pain Instead, there seems to be a motive motive for trying to kiss every major back of the quayet. Show the ad to kids at a bar, but showing a slim paper "Follow Your Dream" story has disappointed the plight of every man you are targeting! <br /> <br /> And finally, music. I did not find any music in this movie, especially when it was needed (hospital scene) Each view is felt like some small music videos that you want to stop until you open the bar. But Climax was the ultimate hilarious: like the 80-second song you'd like to go to Jamie with the Cyndi Luper station and Jollett. Hack, I personally thought Forest Jovi would go out with long hair and jam <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> COYOTE UGLY is something almost purely embarrassed. If you've watched or made it, it looked like nothing without killing at the time. Or depending on whether you look at it or lost it.
