This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays white and other nations, which are not as bad as existing evil in our education system. How fast he forgot that this same education system that created it and failed in it. The character of the Ice Cube is a symbol of a provoked black man responsible for most violence in this movie. Singlton is trying to reach each other to touch the relationship between white and black characters. When Omar Aves says "I have to live with my people", racist comments give lecture. And John, do not worry for a minute that Thomas Jefferson's picture in the tower's stairs did not get my attention. Nice touch!
