I saw a number of scary events, such as Nightsteller, who had met with Winig's legend, so I was looking forward to the harmful attitude of adding to the smell of the Halloween season. Man i was wrong The whole film creates the concept of event that would be scary and horrible, but some property provides a very simple story of revenge and murder. V-ery awesome - no! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What stupid payment for such a fool movie? Go back to the creations of the drawing board and apply some of your millions of greenbacks.
