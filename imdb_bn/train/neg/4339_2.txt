This photo was not entirely what I was expecting. <br /> <br /> If this image is called something else, then no one will notice the difference between them. <br /> <br /> This is really strange because I can not see the point. The estimation and the cecil does not just speak, does not even sense, does not even match. Maybe I meant to be naive but not a volume 1 and Vol 2 did not match. <br /> <br /> Carlito was first in prison and died at the price and on the eve he lives and does not go to jail. <br /> <br /> The plot was right, but some of its actors and stories should have changed the name of the line and film and it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> I really hope the other end it like the other end. <br /> <br /> If somebody has this opinion in this post please.
