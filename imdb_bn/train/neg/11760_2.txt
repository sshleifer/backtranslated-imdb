Amen to Magsel. There is a lot of confusion going on. First off, how do you know which movie you are buying? Henry Cele stars each of them. I bought this movie, it was miniaturized ... what happened !! It was a comedy but the young girl was raped. David Hesselhoff (spelling?) Is perfect for Popcron TV, but he was not credible in the film (where was his English pronunciation?) And what about the story of love ??? This film was thought to be a young man who was told to increase military power - the ship's captain did not juggling his father with the English looking for him ... <br /> <br /> If I paid more than $ 7 for this, call me a police - It's a crime!
