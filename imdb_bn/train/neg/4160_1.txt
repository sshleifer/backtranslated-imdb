This was probably the worst movie I ever seen. I saw it with a big group of friends and after this we did not understand one intrigue. In spite of lack of plot, the act was violent, "special effects" was not so special and the writing was absolutely horrible. The only release factor for the film is that it's pretty funny that it's pretty funny. You can not help but smile at being run on a zombie when the actors are spewing crappy dialogue. I would not recommend this movie to find a good movie, but it is something that can be combined with friends and laugh about them well. It's an ongoing joke between my friends and now I'm out of 1.
