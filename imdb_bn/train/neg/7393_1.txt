I'm a huge Steven Seagal fan. Hell, maybe as much radioactive as he does, I still do not have street credits for playing fridge-mlett-ponytail. My favorite biases and affection for American heroes and screen heroes is a heavy heart, which I must declare it as the greatest film of all time. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is painfully obvious that the film was supposed to have a different story. As a result, Steve's voices do not sync with the dubbed voice of frustrated voices. The edit starts in Pispos and overall it gets worse, even worse, and eventually you want to re-start the Da Vinci code instead. Yes, it's bad. <br /> <br /> I do not know what I can expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me to listen to his CD What to do when checking out some of the Van Dam in DVD nutrient logs directly? If you are tempted to see this movie, then tear off your eyesight and flush them in the toilet. The life of darkness is better than 89 minutes.
