Based on a small story of Edgar Allan Poe, supposedly a terrible Mexican movie, a reporter is informed about how it works and wants to go into the boundaries of a hidden hide in the forest, etc. ... When our hero Gaston is asylum chief Dr. We see this huge exhibition of Millard, we see all such things that can be dangerous, as people often hang in a dungeon, and hanging like a joke, as soldiers make fun of our hero. He climbs down a stairs hanging beside a building. Then there can be a perspective which can be both: a man wearing a chicken, yes, it is just a chicken meat that is around the ground for chicken food. This scene was a ridiculous highlight of the film, however, at least for me, it was the low point of the film and indeed most of the rebels when you considered that the old man and the woman thought it could be even remotely entertained. Ah! This is really a horrific horror story, which Dr. The name of the string and its name change. And this brings me to the true truth about this film, which is mostly a serious problem, with most of the films that change many titles. Yes, this is obvious, but some of the distribution problems and others, in which it is one, has many title changes so that one can buy similar garbage at the same time. This is definitely garbage. It's going very little for it. Claudio Brooke is the only actor to be seen as the head of Eelam. He has a huge slab of ham, he is psychologically cheerful, ordered to order, eternal with arm swords, and praises chicken. I was very tired to hear about the "miserable system" as a way to remedy psychological illness. A bunch of ludicros (hey, such a script with such a script deserve this type of film). To find out what's going on in the shelter and it will not be interesting anymore. Cinematic chicken scratch!
