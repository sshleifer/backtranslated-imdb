First of all, this film is slowly running slowly, and I can see patience with most visitors losing patience in the first thirty minutes. <br /> <br /> I think the film will make it a wonderful film; The most lacking here was a plot that would move the underlying themes. <br /> <br /> It's unfortunate because a writer (Lanford Wilson) (like), in the hands of Lonford Wilson, I think a mountain-like lion is attacking symbolism. School campus can be big, tragic proportions without heavy tool. <br /> <br /> I think, with a good script supporting the film, the same filmmaker, the same taste, and even the same actors (who did not even have the opportunity to influence me), perhaps he was such a powerful "crush" During development, a boy will be able to demonstrate meaningful and sensitive images of pain and struggle. <br /> <br /> However, I found this foundation Unsurpassed, and armed with a vague, ornamented, and widely unintentional script, without any kind of plot, and sorry for any kind of silent sense of intelligent structure (for example, after seeing it, I believe that you will see that you can see in the climatic scene You can not point out, and instead, you will find yourself in a nutshell "Well, maybe that scene, or so It was Climax ... ") - The result is about 95 minutes of Tadium. <br /> <br /> Without a good plot, we are never interested in any characters; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For example, I can never believe That is, the creation of "Leah" and I think most of the visitors will be completely annoyed in their conventional way through which their telephone calls are drawn. <br /> <br /> The film is standing, I'm afraid I can not agree it. I have never been able to understand why such a movie is not rebuilt by an entrepreneur film maker ... instead of reducing the middle of the movies instead of the best films of the first liberation war! All of its good writers are well-written by a good writer, and I think this film can easily become an unforgettable classic about an aspect of the arrival of men in dramatic behavior. All the elements that are so tiring and in the film (that is, the words of the child's belly, "Leah" scenes, television-screen fantasies) can be rich after underground with good stories. <br /> <br> I have seen a lot of comments that people are saying about this movie since a "gay" is saying something about the subject, and I think it's wrong. Obviously, the picture "Crush" is the youngest boy in an adult teenage age, but the character of Logan is very young until it stays on a certain sexual orientation, and in fact, in his illustrated manuscripts we can see all sorts of stimulant, sex and non-veneer, as we Like him, expect a boy at a very young age. I believe that "crush" like men's logos are grown as a customary choice for common man's partners.
