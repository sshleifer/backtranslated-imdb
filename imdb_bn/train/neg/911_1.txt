It will be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made. It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to be made into a movie and in 2006 the movie was recently shown. <br /> <br /> One and the same movie I've never seen so much visible sponsor products. It does not have to be that obvious. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why such a famous actor can be visible in such a movie. Before I could see the film, I had no respect for some of the famous actors in this movie, but it is now confirmed. <br /> <br /> I heard that there will be such a follow-up movie and I do not understand how possible.
