I, Joshua, did not enjoy the film. Perhaps I saw it because I was seeing another good movie similar to the title of Orphan two days ago, but it was probably because this film was not very good. I'm going to the stairs. Of course, the plot of an evil child is not really original, but that does not mean that the film can not be successful. It was unclear and could be entertaining and cool but instead it was slow, annoying, strangely and when it was really full it was not that 'something that was not too good' had left me thinking something more. <br /> <br /> At the end, Joshua's motivation was revealed. I will not let that happen, but the fact is that he did not really achieve his goal, because despite his mother, Abby, about 3/4 of the Wharf Farmgah through the film, the arrows would soon point out to his house. He was committed to the psychological organization because he forgot his mind, but then Joshua's father / husband had been charged with interfering with his medicine, which told the audience that the organization was not actually mentally ill, but was clinically dosage. So she's not coming home soon? Will not Joshua fail? Will not her mother and her sister and probably live soon with her father? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was still annoying when the storyline gradually moved and picked it up. Suspense fall flat on every single time. When it was over, I could not believe that I was sitting with the whole thing. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Because parents were especially good with their parents, especially from sheep, but if you want to watch a movie about a bad 'child' see Orphanage. Now it's a movie that has adopted an incoherent idea and made a brilliant film.
