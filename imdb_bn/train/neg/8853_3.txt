In the first hauling, we got acquainted with a world where Verovov was present and was somewhat organized. The plot of the movie has gained some knowledge; A TV reporter investigates this and exposes the truth. She ended up killing her boyfriend and killing one. Then she showed to the world that they live in live TV. Special effects were only ridiculous in the first film and they did not have any good at this one. Whether it's the transformation or cheesy computer graphics showing bad dolls or magnificent power. <br /> <br /> The plot line is not all bad; They must be killed for some reason the leader of the Verhuvels. It will not destroy all the useless and it will not end the threat of VERWVOLS ... They just want to kill him. I think there was some cloudy reason for this, but it's really lost in movies. <br /> <br /> After the movie is "finished" we have 10 minutes of the film's montage which we saw and all the other scenes where the female Verobol leader had brightened his top breasts and played with the crowd of some Deco-Esquiera band Veruve. <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes this movie even more observable is that of Christopher Lee.
