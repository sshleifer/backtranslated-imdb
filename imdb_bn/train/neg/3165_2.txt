This movie was terrible. I thought with some good actors, it would be good. Do not waste your time. Eva Londoner Parker was terrible. She should disappoint the housewives. Paul Rudd actor is the actor! I can never tell the mess that he made in the movie that what I was saying was your woman. And the lake bell he was cute but definitely needed some more acting lessons. Look like Heaven with Reese Witherspoon ... It was a good good. Or any other ghost movie. You will be grateful to not waste your precious time. PS I love you beyond the romance of the grave!
