"House of Evil" Ukka 1968 "Dance of Death" is the first of four notorious and weird last films, named by Boris Karloff and Jack Hill and Juan Ibnez. After the death of Karloff in 1969, "Sack People People" (1971), "The Incredible Invitation" (1971) and "The Fear Chamber" (1972) were released in addition to the "House of Evil" released in 1968, when Karl was still Living The "House of Evil" is considered to be the worst of all four movies, without any doubt the creator, but certainly their entertainment values ​​are as unreasonable as the curiosity. I personally like "The Fear Chamber" and "House of Evil", only because the lack of the least argument is more extreme, and since there is no doubt about the movies, the logical fun factor increases. <br /> <br /> Strange stories (I do not know whether I can really call it a 'plots') are set anywhere in the 19th century Europe. After some women were murdered and caught in their eyes, Mithias Martel (Carloop), an enthusiastic organ player, invited some of his remaining relatives to his malicious palace, which were full of dull toys. Among her youngest, Luki Durant (Julissa), who is involved with an inspector of police for the murder investigation. <br /> <br /> I will not give more story, but I can assure you that it is very wicked throughout the movie. Some very funny moments, especially some things say Carolef's character. Boris Karloff was one of the most brilliant and important icons of the genre, without any doubt, and he was able to reward this weird movie with a tiny dot of his majesty, and although (or because his role of a poor script and instructions) is not terrible, Looks like he deliberately plays it with humor. The title of the film's successor "Snake People" and "The Fear Chamber" is again managed by Julesa. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not quite understand. This poor story and dialogue, however, makes this movie so much fun to watch. The movie "House of Evil" may be a very sticky attempt, but it is certainly bad as it is (unknowingly) funny. Supporters of the film Ed Wood should be very happy, I personally feel it's fun. Bitter but still entertaining, and it is certainly worth seeing because of Boris Karloff and the fun factor. 3/10
