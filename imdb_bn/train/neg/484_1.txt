I was hated by this movie. No, this was not because of graphic sex scenes, because it destroyed Artemisia orphan's picture. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It is a part of an artwork that she did (the title of Judith Holophones) but shows that she did not depict her first Judith one year after trial when she entered the testimony of rape. <br /> <br /> I If you understand this from the movie, you do not know, perhaps Tase was not a great character. He Rapid Artemicia It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to take false allegations of rape to abstain from torture while torturing him. According to the copy of the rape, she claimed that she never knew Artemesia (sexual relationship with Ur) when she repeatedly said, "This is true". <br /> <br /> I'm encouraging everyone to go out and learn about real artemisia and see what he really is about. This imaginary movie does not base all of your knowledge. I encourage you to do some research, Artemisia actually has interesting stories behind her and some amazing artworks. <br /> <br /> Do not see the movie, but find the real story of Artemisia.
