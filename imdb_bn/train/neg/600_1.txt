...... that's a horror movie. Okay off first, let's start with kate. Its main goals include laid down by George Clooney, looking good and ending but screwing at least all. Love him He was almost sick of these 3 great positive prospects but ... he ran instead. I mean that he does not want to bring Gai for 10 minutes and when he's too late. I said that the man tried to rape her. I can not get into this movie where the main character is a sad stupid. I mean, there will be sincere sympathy for a man, that night he would end up all. The movie continues. And as a result, he lost all his trust.
