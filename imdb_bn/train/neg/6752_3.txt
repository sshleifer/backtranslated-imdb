Sadly, more downs than up. The plot was quite decent. I mean, nothing is anything from the ordinary, but it is a story, opposite to other modern horror flicks. Other good things were to throw. I'm not saying it was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and compelling. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> minutes or so. The rest were quite boring. Another down (or if you want you could consider it up) too much nudity All 4 girls were helpless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for long time. I'm not against nudity, but it was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'. <br /> <br /> Unless you see some people walking around their swimsuit and walking around, it is not very disappointing. A few minutes, or for some reason, no girl gets naked, or you are the hard fan of Debbie Rokon's body, this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good awful movie, stay away.
