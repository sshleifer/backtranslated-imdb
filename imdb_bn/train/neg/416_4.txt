(Some spoilers) - If you do not know how it will end <br /> <br /> My expectations for Holo Man were high. A very good commercial, actor like Paul Verhoeven and actor like Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth Shue, plus a very interesting theme - the invisibility. Every compound for a great movie is done. Unfortunately this thing does not matter at all. Very very week in the movie, without mysteries and without scary forecasts. <br /> <br /> It's about a bunch of invisible discoveries. After the test of animals was successful, Kevin Bacon decided to test himself. Once he disappears, he is fully seen, seen the advantages of the benefits. There are very thin lines from this killing. <br /> <br /> Holman Man is a sick movie. It is suffering from diseases that many new films: special effects From a challenging theme that can lead producers to a great psychological thriller, Werhoven focuses on special effects, without any guilt about the actual value of the film. I must admit, Fx is extraordinary, most likely I met from Matrix, but not enough to make a movie better. Actually that movie is today's problem. Just like Verhoeven, most directors care only the spectacular scene - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the matrix is ​​the only film that combines perfectly superb special effects and great plot. <br /> <br /> After the starships fowlers, Verwoenen again was frustrated. Along with a great movie, HM Cr * P. There are only two reasons why you can see this movie: 1. Special effects 2. Comedy with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not waste this moment for you) <br /> <br /> OK, so what's wrong with the movie? Have been? Everything. Let's see, what can I remember? <br /> <br /> --- It's not annoying at all. It should have been, but it's not. <br /> <br /> --- It is very predictable. From the beginning you know who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- In addition to paying attention to the psychological part, Verwoon is simply concerned about its effects. <br /> <br /> - - Many clips. <br /> --- Certainly bad people wake up several times before they die. <br /> <br /> --- Just like the worst fears of low quality, the first rule is to separate the characters as much as possible. Every time there is someone in the lab, perfect hunting for Bacon. <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: At the beginning, he had to scan his fingers to enter the Bacon Lab. How can he do it after he disappears? <br /> --- --- Finish: Absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> --- After hitting the head, the bayon falls down, the ground falls. Then leave quietly and slowly, without looking back to Shue and Brolin. Is it normal? Then Bacon stood up, attacked them, and "murdered" him again. And then Shieu screams "I heard an explosion" (happened minutes ago), and they suddenly run inside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Vereovan, I hope more from you! <br /> <br /> So, about Hole Man. What was supposed to be a great movie turned into a bribe. Vote: <br/> <br/> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for special effects)
