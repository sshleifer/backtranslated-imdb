- A Mexican priest became a wrestler to save an orphan or something - <br /> <br /> I went to see this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and so I think it might be fun. It was not. It's hateful to watch Embarrassing Any chance and opportunity for comedy is uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> I acknowledge that I do not like jack black. After that I started thinking my brain to play a good role. The only thing I can bring to her is where I came with her. In 'High Fidelity' John Cusack was a necessary foil for the character. Jack Black is such a terrible continuous flat-out ham-up knockout boys (like Abbott and Costello or a little fat of Jerry Lewis) who should say that it is not funny to be a supernatural fool. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's just annoying. <br /> <br /> I heard something good about Napoleonic Dynamite, but if there is anything like this then I'm not going to find the DVD.
