This is not a comedy but mainly bad taste, and is not intended to create a smile in a distant image. The film is trying for a child for a couple, and in those circumstances, those people will actually be worried about the illustrations illustrated. For example, the views of a reproductive clinic are not least fun and it is totally embarrassing. Male leadership who comes across a poor excuse for refusing to reject a village worker by playing a construction worker and his hard hat. The female lead is trying to see younger than 20. Both lead come across as unappealing, unattractive and completely unconvincing. There are many ridiculous and completely unrealistic fantasy scenes in the film, for example, with budget airlines, which is without any humor. Instead of 1/10, this 3/10 is the only reason why a sign for the Sherly McLain, a class above any other in the film, and a sign for half the modest (though old) songs.
