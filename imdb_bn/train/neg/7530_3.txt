I think this movie is boring, annoying and fast, with the intense "passionate" end, which is a bit annoying, the overall story does not seem to be true. Due to these horrific events holidays, unreasonable attitudes and bad news are not just a visual, attractive movie, and I was very tired of its "one note" theme and I could not wait to finish it - actually I was about half Close through The whole film seemed uninterrupted and horrible, and the letters were mostly depressing and unpleasant, although the acting was good. A small film with small ambitions and small appeal - sorry, but it did not make it with me, and I love good, small movies! Although this one was not just prison, I hope to keep it and keep watching it that hope. I was disappointed, especially two local critics left them in their "Year of the 10 Best" list. I strongly recommend looking "sand house" instead - now there is a good, small film!
