What more can I say? Acting, without exception, amateur. Instruction and consistency were cruel. Sceenplay was expected very down the scene and tiring down the dialogue. One of the DVD's features was labeled "Gag Relay", but it can be a description of the response of most movie viewers. <br /> <br /> One of the funest things in the director's comments was the DVD He said with direct face, he was set out to create a movie with high production value and throwing a name - and he had been successful. It is easy to understand how the film has become confused with such a confusion. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the most frustrating aspect was the monster. The Darkfoot Suite was a suite of modified apps (according to the 'creation' feature in DVD) and looked at it. Masks and nails were a little better than closing the shelf work from any costume shop. CGI effects were painful and quality like a cheap video game.
