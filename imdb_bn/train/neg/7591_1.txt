This picture is based on John Fante's novel. Someone tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in such a way. If you want to produce a romantic melodramatic Hollywood with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, how can you possibly connect with The Dust (novel)? And if you want to make this story in a movie, why would you want to produce romantic melodramatic Hollywood with Colin Farel and Cema Haik? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the movie you might end up casting a bit, acting bad and cinematography just a little more. But hope for the best for you. I really hope a lot of time during this film. I actually wanted to be good at it. But it gets worse, and it's as simple as: If you read Fantas novels or not, then this is not a good movie. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood produces bad roles, lack of structure and matching - certainly - Colin Farrells's huge shot of naked butt. <br /> <br /> I can complain much more about this movie, but why is my time? I saw it. OK. I wanted to see it because I loved the book so much and it was weird. And I'm very frustrated. <br /> <br /> 1/10 For the little bit of Colin's sweet little mosaic at the end of the film. So sweet ... if he could wear the whole time, then I could have given him a little over 2/10.
