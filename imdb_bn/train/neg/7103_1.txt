The best way to describe this movie is to hate a bride couple who hates the husband's first wife, who dies in mysterious circumstances. That sounds good and well, but what's playing out is a pure holiness hour. Indeed, one of the fun things about this flick is that there is a warning in the beginning of the movie that any person who promises to die for fear of free coffin. Well, believe me, if someone is afraid of running those plastic pillars, peacocks, weird gardeners, and the door, but no one accepted that proposal. And the music is the worst, it has constant Tuber music that sounds like a few six graders. And you will be exposed to the horrific secret information you are wondering about what people think of this movie. Someone died while running and hit their head and the police were not called for investigation. Yes, it is a slow motion (which is considered to be really bad considering the film is just over an hour), annoying little stories, which can be easily found by the average person. Apparently this flick letter was the average person.
