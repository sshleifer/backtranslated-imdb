I was excited to decide to make a movie in the language of Caesar Montano Cebuano. (Most 'Filipinos' will not incorrectly mention this as 'dialects', such as Sibuanano and Tagalog, both French and Spanish appear to be interconnected with each other.) But when I saw this movie, I was very disappointed. Being a Canadian of Cebuano parents, I heard about this movie when I was optimistic about the revival of globalization film industry. I was more excited to hear such Filippino films as not being like another stupid action movie or melody. But well, I was a little changed. <br /> <br /> Egan travels to Panghouo Caesar Montana. Montana must have played the hero of the film. And when I say 'hero', then my most appealing behavior means; Her job is to win the heart of a girl and lead the winning ball-nance against the Japanese. There is no depth or complexity in its character. He just fits the hero mold. The rest of the letters are one dimensional; They all fit the role of their cookie cutter. <br /> <br /> I was all for slow motion / meditation movie but this movie was just moving slower. It really does not meditate on anything. Since a movie is historically themed, only a drama and gradual moving does not make it a well-made film. <br /> <br /> American actor Philippe Nithni is particularly annoying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If Montana wants to revive Vysyan's film industry, he really could have thought through it. She said she wanted to create a Baishakhi film that could compete in Kansas and Toronto, but in reality, the film was encouraged and fostered during such festivals. To get the Vision movies in mainstream consciousness, at least one film should be created which will attract the audience, even if it dedicates quality roles. Obviously, he did not get any idea or information about providing cancer rewards in a film, so the audience-oriented film had at least one foot on the door. <br /> <br /> I am not afraid of this film due to the fact that the globalization film will not be created for a long time. If I ever told Filipinos that I want to see more visible movies but I want to get the answer, "Do not make a good movie on the visa. Did you not see Panghai Saba?" Of course this is ridiculous because it is an example of a Baishakh film and perhaps the only example that anyone can see nowadays. <br /> <br /> An example of slow-moving movies is the straight story of Tagalog film Blackout or David Lynch. I hate the promotion of Tagalog language because it is promoted continuously and inappropriate, and non-Tagalog Filipinos push the throat down, but to spread a hole, I say that Blackout is a very good movie. These films called Hitkoc as 'Pure Film'. Pictures without the words are expressed in the story. But for the sake of these two films, I have narrowed down the definition so that these movies use pictures without the words to express the mood of the movie. And they're very good at it. Pangohi thinks that if they only take shaking shots of the landscape, they have established mood. <br /> <br /> And what with a dead mother or grandmother Filipino movies ???
