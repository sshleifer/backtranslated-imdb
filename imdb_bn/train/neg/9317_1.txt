I bought it from Blockbuster for 99p. The man behind the counter said that it was so cheap because the disc was scratched at sh * t, but it was so cheap that it failed to mention because it was harder than Paris Hilton. Video at home in a hotel room. After talking about home videos, when it was a good game to be released as a movie - it is to say that movies are used by actors and technicians and writers to recruit movies - and nothing else - just gather your friends and lumen-concepts for the weekend. Enjoy the production with £ 8.00 budget, and someone with Cassie Keyboard (Soundtrack) Riguli drop down - and then some poor snakes (I), the loneliness of the house for the disappointment. But here's the clean-up, I've quickly moved through it, and dragged it towards each other, ready for hammers ... The next night, look for Darren Day's awful 'Hellbread' (£ ​​1.99) and stay away from home a different blockbuster). Now this film has created 'Grim Weekend', like The Exorcist, so I reverted Grimm Weekend to watch some of the listed moments in the wonderful IMDB boards, who are shocked by the viewers. After the grief, pain, and horror of Grim Weekend, I cut into pieces a lot of torches, I can enjoy, taste, and get down from fun things. And it has a lot. Check the board. Then check the flick. Hell, it could even be worth it. AWW!
