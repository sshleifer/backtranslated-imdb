When Rodney Dangerfield is in a roll, he is delighted. In my 5th wife, she did not have a roll. One liners are closed during the time, but they are the best things going for the movie. Five women who play with wives do not add a complete actress among them. The plot is very weak. Even the compound is quite weak; There are some jokes about having more than one wife, but there is little room for something else in the film. Although Rodney is the only wife of the character, most movies can play similarly, so the image of the old man's imagination seems more like a comedy than it is. Another old man's imagination: We accept that the role of Rodney is an athlete's skier. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jerry Stella seems to be calling a friend in his role to please, and the rest of the names must be frustrated by the actors. . <br /> <br /> The peculiar lack of political majority after the movie is nothing for the movie. Non-PC humor is still there for those who prefer their films politically correct, and forgiving forgiveness for it still does not get the point. For those who hate watching the movie cave in political analysis, PC add-ins are just boring degrees. <br /> <br /> It should be the smallest rated film I have ever seen. There are some warm jokes and bedroom scenes have created frustrating TVs 40 years ago, but this is about it. Maybe it was helpless men (fun). <br /> <br /> DVD shows interviews where cast members find depth and importance in this movie and their roles. I keep wondering if they were serious or midding. They seem to be serious, but I was thinking, "They must have fun!" An extraordinary disclaimer also suggests that the film does not actually name the church of Mormon or Latter-day Saint Sans, because it is not about them in any way. The film does not feature Utah's versatile religion, and references to Bridgetown Young. <br /> <br /> Small, my 5 wives were frustrated. I was waiting for a roller roller, but what I can say for the movie is that Rodney was very good for a man who was pushing 80 times at that time.
