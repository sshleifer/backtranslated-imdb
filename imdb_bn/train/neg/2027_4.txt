Endemol: Contrary to two other current sports shows in the United States (deal or non deal and 1 vs. 100), this show is very slow for what is happening on the screen. <br /> <br /> DOND and 1 vs. 100 may go away with pacing gradually because the games can speed or end - at any moment. Every player has the risks involved, the prize is completely variable, and it is difficult to give players a significant amount of money. Suspense is usually used well. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, show me money, very slow. When a question is revealed and it is clear that the player knows the correct answer, you can be sure that in the next few minutes nothing will be exciting. Instead of talking about what will happen if the player gives a reply instead of wasting time instead of wasting time instead of shattering the player, we all know that they are right. Fillers that seem like random dance actually filler Lots of time is lost when not enough time ... and those players can not choose to guarantee the game in advance that it will be wasted much time. <br /> <br /> Oh, and I do not want to flutter in my room. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of the game show throughout life, but even after an hour I had a lot of trouble. This is either a big change or a basic retirement requirement.
