Films usually rated on a firm cast and some clever dialogues and certainly dean martin songs that boasts. The problem is that there is no chemistry between Nicholas Cage, She and Cher, and they are central love stories. Cher almost relies on the transfer of the cage and controls body language for this with its response. The cage simply settles into its role. He tried everything he could think of and added an actor to the real person instead and he needed a love story. In the case of ZG Stewart's type character, there are similar performance problems in other key roles. Cage is playing this role, perhaps he likes that kind of movie, but because of his own strength, an actor does not give him his debt, though he is better than he tried repeatedly. He will leave such roles to the less attractive personality who will be fully committed to the film and spend his strength and the terribly rude role and the movies where he can be a crazy voice.
