If I could give a genuine rating to this movie, it might be probably the number of minus numbers. Although I'm going to continue this terrible "horror" movies, I respect the importance of this, buying a ticket for this movie means that you waste a lot more money than your time. Despite the horror film, there is nothing terrible about it, unless you think of how horrible the clich√© can fit in a movie. If ratings are high, it would probably have been made for a better film for a longer time. <br /> <br /> Anyone who created this version of "Prim Night", you are abusive. Actors probably did a decent job if the suspect is not for scripting. It was a terrible waste to travel to a movie. I want to go soon and see "one missed call" again, at least there was some plot.
