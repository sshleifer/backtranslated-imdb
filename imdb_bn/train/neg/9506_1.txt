Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the top. It has been said before, that half of the crew in this workplace gets you half as bad as the game gets you. Do not make me wrong, it's fun, but you get tired of mashing buttons. For the summit of the plot, Ahhhhhhia ... there is no plot. At the end of the man wearing and winning! Eh, who plays this drama by self?
