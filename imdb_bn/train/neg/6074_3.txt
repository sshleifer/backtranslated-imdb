What a bad movie I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes will be associated with something like this. You're going to create a movie involving baseball, and shows the baseball scene, at least the actions look somewhat realistic. Why were the crowd always standing for a specific reason during the rush? *** Possible spinner *** and the last scene in the movie .... what was that? We believe that the diner has found its way to the uniforms of the umpire's uniform, and this game is also playing in a snowstorm .... One of the worst scenes of a sports movie. 10 out of 3 stars.
