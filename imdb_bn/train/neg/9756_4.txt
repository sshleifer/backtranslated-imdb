Despite the title (English), it seems that there is little to do with the Devil and do more with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Phylophosphor stone and seeks gold (and blood of virginity). Playing Jacintto Molina Gilles de Lancre and facing face of people seems to be a little problem when he thinks they threaten his position or need virginity for their blood. He originally loved his lady and impressed by a missile that he is engaged and it seems to be more of his greed and madness which is his problem than the giant property (unfortunately). There are parts that are a little bit exciting and trying to prevent each other with big and big sticks, and at least the film has a good look for it, but otherwise there is nothing to suggest about it. There is no fear in the way of the street, and most unusual, for a molina / snake film, there really is no strange humor. Therefore, 10 out of 4.
