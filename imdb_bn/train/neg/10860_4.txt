This was a frustrating movie for me. It came to me, came through a box titled "Classic Film Nirir", which anyone knows that I usually enjoy the film in that style (I say that silence is not a genre, not a genre). I do not think it's a silent film. From 1947 to 1955, there is a trend in black and white B movies labeled as silent and in these days, and labels are not always fit. An oppressed male playwright, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the film's activities happen in the house. Those who could only see I was almost the only noorious element. There is no internal paranoia or no real reason that should not be sympathetic to Ed Coolen. Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale. I do not want to spoil this movie for potential visitors. However, I would like to hear that any other adviser in the film has to say about it.
