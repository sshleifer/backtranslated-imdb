Before looking at this movie, I hope a fictional drama based on the book's ideas. Instead, it interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating books, various "illnesses". It did not bother me much, but it prevented the joy of my film. A story involving a book or even two or three long stories by the film was better than my opinion. If you are going to base a movie on a psychology text, you've found more interesting (and preferred) text than this one. The film takes part in the 19th century sex psychology video more than Encyclopedia and it can be completely helpless if it is not sexually explicit (because most of us are "gender = attractive", even me). Thankfully, there are many stories with the development of real character that attracts us. <br /> <br /> But frustratingly, Craft-Eibing's sexuality theories often get stuck. I was optimistic how this would show how many people have had incomplete views of psychology in their old scene today. <br /> <br /> So, what do you have in the end? With a detailed catalog of some fetishes and orientations, with some gentle playful stories they show a few "sex deviants" before showing healing and showing the clip. For most movies, the film comes with moving speed (and mood). And, perhaps as a low budget movie, cinematography and acting are not just the upper level. Although I was happy with music, costume and interior design. <br /> <br /> I think this movie was right in my lane, and still it seems to be the average movie below. It deserves a 3/10; A 4/10 I'm very generous. I can not imagine enjoying this if I do not have an interest in sexual worship.
