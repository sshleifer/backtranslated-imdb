The idea of ​​Oman 4 on page was good. Beautiful to see that the child of the devil may be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as exorcist, when girls are possessed or are in the devil it is very effective. But at the 4th omen, stunk it. <br /> <br /> Delia does not think that she might be a devil child, rather she is a child with a problem. The problem is that only a therapist could help, rather a priest. He does not look scary or devil. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture was possible and if it is made of the same person, then it can work by making three previous films. But instead of creating a sequel of the most enjoyable horror triangle made for TV movie special, it is insulting. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not bring any sympathy to the letters, and you do not have the root for them. I recently saw it again after bringing it for me for Christmas, and it has been a scary date. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend you if you are thinking of seeing it. See one of the others, or see Exorcist, or see the good son. Do not waste your time just this drivel!
