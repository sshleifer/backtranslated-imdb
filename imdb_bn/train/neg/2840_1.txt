At the beginning of the film, two old friends were sent to Japan to return the results of the genetic research of the video that was stolen by the black-edged ninja. At first they have to learn some ninja skills, because "only themselves can defeat Enja." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " Before different changes have been seen, the letters are very short-drawn, the direction is soft and the script does not offer some surprising offers, even in the last scene, which reduces the price of the trash itself. <br /> <br /> Even 80's Nina-Flick-fan, who understands the bridal of trash-films, this movie is rarely enjoyable. It does not offer anything new to the viewer, nor is it at the level of the plot or the plot. The intersections are thrown and the katsanas are shot, but it is not enough for film direction, and it is not like repeating the same scenario of war, after the first 30 minutes, even the most corrupt spectators are perfect. <br /> <br /> It is hard to recommend that anyone cinema. The strange performance of the "Front Enro" "The Entered The Ninjas" behind the American-Nunus of Sanur murderer. There is no ball even in the visual-level movie, and time is lost in finding a great fight scene in this movie: There is no one. After all, the neutral Ni√±a-Flix, I've ever seen. Curiosity is not even interested. Trust me one of these <br /> <br /> 10/1
