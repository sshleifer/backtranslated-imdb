As far as I'm concerned this is the worst version ever of this silent version of Mary Widow. There is no softness or love or spirituality about this version, it's all Macar, Germanic, sinister fool. It reminds me of falling love of Nazir; Who care? <br /> <br /> This silent version of Van Straheim is not a reliable adaptation of the original story. At this moment, we are confused with John Gilbert and his perfect relative Prince Maya Maya, the stupid American actress's boring, bored with a modern permeated hairstyle and dishonest feminist method, which throws me repeatedly. I like the light and beautiful my romance, with the slow build up; Do not be rigid and sadistic like this one. And let the bees touch the lips, get rid of them, girl! <br /> <br /> If you want to get the original idea of ​​Franz's original topsoil confection, see live performance of this event. Lehar That fail, wait until TCM Jennit McDonald shows - Morris Chevalier word version. It's a lot better.
