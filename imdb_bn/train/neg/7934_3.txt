A family traveling for their daughter's Softball League decided to take a 'natural scene' and finally decided in the middle. Dad is a bright photographer, and when he hears the old abandoned side of the city, he decides to take another snap to take some photographs. <br /> <br /> Of course, the sidebar is filled with inbred fads, which immediately kidnaps women and releases the child to save his son. <br /> <br /> The only cool thing about this picture is that the family actually wars against their inner prisoners. Still, there is nothing good about filming.
