Come, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or Knights Templar, which are often said, were not even in the early 12th century. The story is so ridiculous that it is merciful Dolf Lundgren looked just positive bored. And besides, if you want a real-life Templar why not just use Night of Christ, who still exists in Portugal. At least they should take history in history. In this movie, I can find the quality of redemption only that handmade was proven enough for medieval or Gothic fragments. The acting was bad, the stories were fantastic, the action was awesome, and the props were just right.
