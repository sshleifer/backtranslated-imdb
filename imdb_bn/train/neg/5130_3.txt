In her dissatisfaction with this film, Gen. Gareffalo has publicly expressed it, among other things, in the anti-feminist He told his radio show that he hates to create a "romantic comedy" because he does not believe them. I sincerely agree with Zenane here. This image is the best one trifle. He did his best, but overall, this is just another annoying, incredible "romantic comedy" which has no basis in the real world. Some will say, "Stop your unbelief", because some people will get tired of postponing it almost every time to get romantic movies from Hollywood. For some reason, the character of Zion is usually depicted in shades and darkness, which seems to be irrelevant to her appearance, when the character of Uma is depicted in lighter tones (which is probably dissatisfied with the genesis and probably hates the film). If the general seems to love these two, then it will be truly bought. There are many and other comment threads here that are not bad at Zenana, but actually very nice. Nobody said that she feels happy. While I said, I believe that Ben Chaplin's character is not likely to be him, not knowingly. Many men do not really love intelligent women (and many women really do not like the smart men), and sadly, Ben probably probably looked up. And despite trying to make the director general unreasonable, it does not work. <br /> <br /> I think many genuine male fans who are obsessed with this movie because they love to think about the character of Ben Chaplin and actually score with Genes. Generation is much more complicated than the character that played here (real life is far more complex than Hollywood), so take the cold shower gentlemen. This role of Genine is the first to be known, and it is a shame, because it is not really good for a movie.
