How can a major German TV station broadcast a mess like this? The main actor is amazing how to avoid each acting talent - even the well-known Gothraff is acting very poor - especially double killings - how amateur ... ..! The screen plan is very, very stretch - perhaps to fill 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to sleep while watching! The set is definitely a blue screen, f.g. The real sea ship scene in the background ...! Words in the German version and sinking are very poor - probably because of the different languages ​​- but: other international productions make it more professional. Tip: Do not See - It's A Diabolic Waste Time!
