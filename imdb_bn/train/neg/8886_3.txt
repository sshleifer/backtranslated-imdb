Not too impressed. It is difficult to offer any spoilers to this movie, because there is almost no development in the plot. Everything becomes clear in the first ten minutes and dry paint is dry from it. The acting seems very poor, and sometimes reminds me of the film of the black and white Maoist era shown on Chinese television. Although it is difficult to say the role of women, the story only requires walking circles like timber mannecine. It reminds me of pale star Gong Li, who once earned fame as a good West actress to play her behind. <br /> <br /> Tien Zhuangzhuang's picture 'Blue Kite' was a great movie. But in a small town Springtime is not fooled by the fact that the '40s were set to be fooled by. Unlike Blue Kite, this movie is set to be fun, irrelevant to this plot, the city's ruins are nothing more than a beautiful backdrop. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking Taiwan is trying to move on the popularity of Chinese movies of Xuanjiang, and appeals to foreign viewers who are 'pretty' deep 'or' hypnotic 'and which are only tedious and incomplete. <br /> <br /> If any film fits over the description of 'overrated' There is no reason to stop thinking about the Chinese film industry.
