It's the worst brain-damaged, extremely cheaper, super stupid, stupid, ever-seen trunk-pointing piece of trash, incredible trash of instant countermanders among bizarre fans. If you think Ed Wood's "Plan 9" is bad, well ... I can tell you, "Citizens buy" than it seems. ¿Special effect? ... again, "Plan 9" is "Star Wars". ¿Acting? ... Thor Johnson Al Pasino ... So it's worse than bad. But if you are looking for this incredible movie, it's for you! I am a fan of American International for many international glory films, Price-Karamen-Po Saga and some great blackplumbing stuff, but with "Star animals" they just come down to Z level. Of course, if you want to watch bad movies for fun (one of my main players is good), then one of my 10 out of 10 works so hard and enjoy ... if you can.
