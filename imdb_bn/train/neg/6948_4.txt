An interesting concept (four African American women under Boot Hill of society takes vengeance on them by plundering banks) and is viciously vulnerable to F. Gary Gray's vicious slide and a vague cryptic script full of funny moments (Risky Baffard and Kate Lanaria). Instead of giving insult and humiliation of urban women, instead of giving a significant comment about the role of urban women, Gray, Bowden and Lenan's unexpected tragedies would like to pamble their obscure audiences with the notion of high opinion. It's his worst melodrama. Gray refuses to take on his tired line of each of his actors and takes John Carter's lazy performance slack, instead of keeping him trained on the camera's actors' bemused face. And they are confused: Although there are some raw talent for actors like Zacky Peckett, Kimberly Ellis and Vivica A Fox (Queen Latif's fourth and a wonderful rapper as an actress), they need a handy hand to give directions to their grades, because they are sharp and uncomfortable in front of the camera Close Steer clear
