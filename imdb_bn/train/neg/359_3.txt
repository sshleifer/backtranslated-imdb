I badly thought and saw my fair share of final twists on movies, but I do not remember any film that has done a complete suicide like this. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers were obviously hoping that a great twist would 'surprise' us all ... and it did, but perhaps the directors did not have the expectations. I was amazed that Conree, Harris, Fishbrouge and Cappsor did not have to do anything separately or jointly with this turkey. <br /> <br /> The final thirty minutes of the film was rather compelling and I like the way the story is unfolding and overall the nature of the movie. But once the door was uncovered, the holes and inconsistencies of the plot were extraordinary, the original motive of retaliation was a misconception, and the ways of working so well for Bobby Earl were ridiculously removed. The worse thing is, once the twist is published, the remnant of the film becomes suddenly predictable. <br /> <br /> Harris has given a terrific performance and just like the Connie Morgan Freeman that she never gives bad performance, even if the movie is not so big! So above all, it starts well and keeps visitors interested in publisher. The most memorable nose dive in the last 30 minutes of movie history
