That's really a movie bad My friend rented it because he, well, a stupid. But then again, I too could be stupid because I saw the whole evil thing! The actors are running the place that high school plays geeks who were equal. The only place that they are going to do is wait the table in Lube again. All I could think of was how I was watching this "gem" was actually how it was made. I mean, some "photographer" actually thought that the court was fresh, original and profitable. Then, with the money in the script, some Moroccans believe that he decided to make some cash money that he was going to return to him. The actors were cast, the places were scouted, make-up artists were hired, computer animators were brought back from the Al Colinis Graphic Design School and started accepting this Turkish form. <br /> <br /> There was probably a ton of things that I hate about this move but one thing was to overuse the music that happened to me craziest. This flock is scored every single minute. Music was not a single break. And sometimes it was more mixed than dialogue, it did not allow you to miss any important plot points or something. <br /> <br /> After it's over, we have decided to visit the Mystic River. It was like driving a BMW 740il then driving a 1980 VW diesel rabbit. You can not get two more reverse movies in terms of quality.
