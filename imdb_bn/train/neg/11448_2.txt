In no way is this movie bad as a 'perfect stranger', but it was not funny. It has not been able to stop in a comedy - it's from SNL, Adam Sandler-Esquieu, from romantic, from small to big, from scopic, to 'lotus' (movie) comedy. Although some pretty funny slopstick moments (fall down the hill), no one was very funny or outstanding. The 'Scandal's List' was funny (and felt less). You never knew that Andy Sambar should not have played a bad role in a high school, college dropout, or a man living in his home with his mother-Sisi Spassk. And poor Ian McShen, if the serious actor only had to give me the name, he was given the whip of the camera. The story is dragged and expected with end and end (Adam Samberg's mother wants to see it here, no spoilers). Do not spend any money to watch this movie, and perhaps Lorraine Michaels will be hinted and will have to make quality (yes, Wayne World and Tommy Boy quality) movies.
