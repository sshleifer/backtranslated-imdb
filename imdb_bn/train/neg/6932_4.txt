I waited long to see Dr Turtle Torture and after seeing this I was really frustrated. It's Baroque film I'm not expecting it to be. The trailer (which I saw a weird strange DVD) is much better than the whole movie, which is unusually forgotten. It does not have a visible view and the appearance and feeling are interesting, but it does not even come from movies like Fallini or Jodorski to other Baroque-style movies. Characters are not neutral and often play dramatically, although we can see rape, crucifixion, madness, etc. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> D. The main problem of star torture was in Dongozan, it was a talk-time more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book. I just wanted the movie to be silent or mood or for some time, instead we can see the main characters / lazy chat chats about silent things. <br /> <br /> A missed opportunity.
