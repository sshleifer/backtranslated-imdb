There is no awesome lot with this movie's predecessor "Robot Jox". Its most common name is "robot warts" and the alternate name "robot jack2: robot warts" is not. The reason for this is <br /> <br /> "Robot Jox" was originally a fun movie because it was watching. It was a nice premises on the monster robot battling each other in the near future. This idea has been abandoned for this movie, and instead it is a completely complete story, in addition to which it is not very original or intelligent written. Shame It has tried to be really very different from its predecessor, otherwise it could possibly be a more fun movie to visit. Just like "Robot Jox" it's a B-movie but it's a very good one that's a big difference. Perhaps this picture was created as "RobotJox" in the 80's, when B-movies were released in the 1990s, even some of the common and classical movies on different movies, it will be said about this movie, it's just lame, poorly made, poor Looking and not exciting enough.Is it a finishing touch that you leave 'this is it all?' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Is the story of this movie really low? A good main villain was a good idea and some other stuff was such as a real point, some action, or the main character of the favorite. <br /> <br /> How they thought when they liked the actor for this movie, all of them only Not interested in the introduction, and especially Don Michael Paul is annoying as the main character, who behaves like he is God's gift to women and Mr. Perfect <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They will take some more and big steps in the film, the film was more entertaining to watch at least. Instead of now we have a movie which is basically failing to reflect fantastically. <br /> <br /> You can see the episode "Powerful Morphine Power Ranger" for some more actions and favorites. <br /> </ br> 3/10
