This so-called "documentary" tries to tell the United States moon-landing The year is right <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who actually studied this case, all know <br /> <br /> Firstly there is evidence. Astronauts were on the moon, they brought a lot of stones back to the moon - for geological research. Hundreds of labs spread across this globe, who tested them. And they all concluded that they came from the same planet, not the earth: because the internal isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found in the world, but the same as having the moon. That is, conspiracy theorists never read anything: they just fit their theory and ignore the rest. Another wrong claim from them is that they were in Hunter wind in the air, where they landed the moon, the Ii flag came in. There is a logical explanation: the astronaut moved it with his hand, so move it. And this is what proves: Well, conspiracy theorists even study the footage, they will see that the caveman does not leave the flag after leaving it, Ii. Conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study properly on any subject or until they come, it only studies it so that they can fabricate and gain from it.

There are a lot of e over. <br /> <br /> tattbabidara deny conspiracy, big time. They only see that they want to see. I think it's important that they all lie - it's a fact.
