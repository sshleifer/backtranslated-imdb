I'm going to agree to a last comment and agree with Maltin. This is a second rate, excessive harmful Western that creaks and groans trying to try across the central theme of the Wild West while trying and being alienated by permanent march. It would be the tradition of "Butcher Cassidy and Sundance Kid", but there is a lack of ruthlessness and attraction of the film. The length of Andrew McLaggellen's length, and the final 30 minutes or more actual Batches, with some vague strategies of hero Charlton Haston and Chris Mitcham. (Somebody will give me a walk if you can explain why they burned the mountain.) The treatment of rape scenes was somewhat uncomfortable, and after that the reaction of the woman was not true. Half the breed escapes convicted for revenge, because Coburn is quite nasty, but all of his colleagues escape is adopted (they move on like a bowling pin to one another after moving the churches). Michael Parks gave it a generally intensive, neutral, tragic performance, but in this case it was appropriate because its modern style Sheriff was a symbol of peace that could bring technological progress.
