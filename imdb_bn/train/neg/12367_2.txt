Loony Tune (at least) has ventured twice in the future. The first time was with the brightest fun "Duck Dodgers". The next time this was with ?? Um Effort "Loonatics Unleashed" is not without merit and it can be considered a good product, it is not the Warner Brothers quality. WB cartoons are known for their proud humor, at least appealing to adults as children. On the other hand, these pedestrian superhero episodes may fail to convince adults to pass them. <br /> <br /> The initial 6 ordinary people of the series (2nd Bari, a Tasmanian devil, a duck, a street and a quote) live in "cosmopolitan" acceleratris and in 2772 a meteorite hit the planet when the spacecraft Achieves. So it is confusing that the title section counted these people from 21st to 2772. Cute, but stupid fool <br /> <br /> Each episode, Super Sextet ?? Gently but interestingly in the barbarous banner ?? Various super villains fight. In most cases, each such medieval superhero is shown in the adventure series and better. Like many medieval superhero series, its villains take it very seriously in this context. And of course these guys laugh that the only character ?? The obvious evil, obviously, smile. Why is that expected Superhero Adventures always villains ?? Always ?? Naughty smile at every opportunity? These animated elements seem to be laughing in the province of Vilhen and sometimes in their hinchipal and / or the province of Henching. <br /> <br /> In fact, the creators of this series go straight to get their best bit missed. Character moralizations are sometimes based on their previous normal power, but sometimes not. The problem here is that we do not see enough WB looniness Lexi and Ace may have roughly common biologically generated power weapons and can virtually describe any personality characteristics as "bug-like". What we are here is basically stupid and drekish "Teen Titanos", including its "overly" modern "animation" animation, but with animals. Feh <br /> <br /> Another mistake by programmers manufacturers is wrong (or is) the villains. As mentioned before, this is not terrible fantasy and evil-smile is not too much. Curiously, the author missed the obvious strategies of creating stockpiles as well as the Wiki with the stock WB characters. Can be added to the fun, say, Sam Jupiter ?? Fad as well, still hunting birds ?? As well as Tech E. Quote transformed into a really neurotic villa ?? And so Ah, sorry missed opportunity? <br /> <br /> Sadly, this whole product has exceeded its time (ie, second season). Yet, we can be happy that there are new things for 14 people-9 people. The rest can expect Dock Dosage for the 3rd season.
