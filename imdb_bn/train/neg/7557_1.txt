This picture was terrible. All right, my favorite movie 'The Wicker Man' (1973), so I was always obliged to be a little favorable. <br /> <br /> Essentially the ingredients of the original ingredient is that the plot is spread as soon as the word 'remake' is highly suspicious. (He is not a virgin, but bee's allergy.) WOW!) There are many things that do not understand and are unclear, which I'm afraid Mr. La Boot does not create a horror film. (How did we clearly show both of the living and well in a car at the end of the movie?) Cage feels disgusted and embarrassed throughout life and his character is "Rowan!?" Call it. In the least words Basically 'nods' are irritating to come off as they are drawn rather than intelligent respect. For example, some events mirror the original form (when searching for a fly / cage island, the girl is coming out of a fiction pretending to die), and several lines of dialogue are removed directly from Anthony Scafers' original screenplay. <br /> I am sure others will provide better and more detailed analysis, I will not be bothered to write more about this movie. It lacks any kind of substance. Drop them into scrap hips with all the other remixes that have removed the good names of those films that were 'oriented' (in this case too loose).
