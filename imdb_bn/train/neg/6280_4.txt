Have you ever felt that you feel like having a good picture in your mind: there is a great image in your mind: some detective surveillance with the gap in broken house of some abandoned house? Or a woman who is walking down the street watching a cold and intense warning? Yes Extend the picture to the whole film, you've got the idea of ​​breaking mostly, although this movie does not have any intelligence, but I'm using it as a visual example. However, the intense looking woman is here and she fills up 99% of the time during the screen. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I can frame the scene of this movie and hang it on the wall, it would be great. Let's be honest here, acting superb. There are some expressions facing the actor who kept watching me. <br /> <br /> Now the problem of this movie is. Apart from the mood, there is nothing else here. The director basically took a precipitate of an idea and was far more than what it was worth. I say the expression "mirror" if I do not consider it to be a spoiler. Let's face it, this single idea is to work with all the bloody places and those directors. Guessed, there are a few twists and turns here and on. If you pay attention, you can not be surprised at the end, the clear plot holes are simple. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm not choosing bones with this style because I enjoyed them most of the time. I still believe that we should judge our industry based on the way we use it to express how the artists want to express. Film music, or a picture, or a painting, even a poem, and of course is not a piece of a cool image in your mind. It's all that well a good story and character development. I consider cheating the lynch style making movies. It is illegal and inexpensive and medium waste. We gave a 2 hour movie running during the movie for a good reason. Therefore, it should be judged differently than judging the single frame of the image, like our picture or painting. <br /> <br /> This film is not entirely Lynch style, thanks for the goodness. It has a linear development and finally came to a conclusion. It does not have many stories or character development. It represents itself with the character of creating ordinary people, thus, at least from the surface, distance itself from at least other fables. It does not offer any explanation of the fantasy material and it almost has tried to build a consistent world around it. Curiosity came from somewhere and seems rather isolated and sudden. Maybe there is a solidarity in the film's mind, but I did not do much to understand the screen from what I could see. <br /> <br /> Where did he try his efforts? It seems that he made many efforts to create mood and increase music. The music often formed in tension which eventually turned into a teal. <br /> <br /> I finally felt that, okay, I know what you're trying to say here, but the one you're trying to spend, spend two hours creating these tones? It's rather irrelevant to those characters and what kind of life they have. And we are given very little about those who are letters. We all have this situation that's OK. Frustrating but I have many elements to work with and guessing.
