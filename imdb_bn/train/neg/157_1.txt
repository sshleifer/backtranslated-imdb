It seems that the first of all videos seems to have been pictured in the 80's. I was amazed to be released in 2001. Secondly, the plot was everywhere, the story was misleading at the right of the bat. Some short suggestions or roles were well-documented. Also I admired the fantasy but this film was too much. It was seamless and badly pictured. The scene did not flow smoothly and the letters were not odd. It was difficult to follow and perhaps it was translated but it was difficult to understand. I love Chinese epic films, but if you look for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I will promise (notably the stunning, intriguing, interesting and good character development), not the film. Be careful that you will be disappointed.
