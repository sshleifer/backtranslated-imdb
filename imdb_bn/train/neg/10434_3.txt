Am I getting some step or bad odor from Daybreak 1 + 2? Allah was behind everything? What should be done with sabi-fi? God is not the only answer when you can not think of an intelligent explanation for anything. In fact, this is the problem with the end of the series - they did not clearly understand the intelligible explanations for the big questions raised across the series, such as a brand who came back from a dead person in New Viper, why Bletter was a fictional figure in his head, his old hybrid and How the end of the body of the charred 2 ends, 6 is why its head has a legendary baller, etc. The. So they do not explain it with "angels" or just explain it <br /> <br /> <br /> It was enough to fly a buster through the plot of the last two episodes. For example, why did Galactica and her crew approach a suicide mission to rescue a girl (Hera), especially Adamama said that she would not try any remedies? Because they found the position of the silon base? This is not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's life. And how does the endors know? And before the war, what was the point of the flashback of the main character? In this way they forgot as before, so they put something in the last moment. <br /> <br /> Those who wrote the last two episodes could not be the same writers, who have become so far excited.

Instead, an insidious person actually receives his power from Jesus. Then they take their spaceships to the nearest star and live in the forest with eocos. Will this be a good end? No it will not be frakken '.
