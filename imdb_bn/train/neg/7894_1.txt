If you are not an evangelical Christian, then be like an Egyptian and avoid the Bible's plague. <br /> <br /> Fearful - Why does the IMDB list list the most favorable reviews at the top - this is one of the reasons that I'm going to start this evening at Goodbye Claptop, it's over. <br /> <br /> The plot proved strong enough - I was dragged into the picture and I was interested in the exact point. Where the Bible took the sermon. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture has provoked me so much that I registered with IMDB for the first time - I hope that I will save someone else's evening. <Br> <br /> Oh - what a part of my Christian work is ;-)
