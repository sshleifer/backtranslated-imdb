This movie is your biggest steaming pill which is known to rise and grow in Wichita Kansas; I know that 90% of the movies were bogas. There was nothing besides the name of some hunting as well. The film looks like it was made with the handmade of the father, it was a footage that I believe came from a slaughterhouse with stock footage from another film. I usually enjoy watching bad movies for it's fun, but due to poor performance, poorly prepared or unincorporated sets and very neutral and short completion. It was ultimately a struggle to see it. I suggest you do not waste your money in this movie or you will be sorry. Crunch
