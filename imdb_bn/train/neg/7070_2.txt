Boy oh boy, gali gee, <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie is the joy of the bluescreen effects used to create wax "invisibility". They saw that they shot in a cheap video, and it looks completely irrational, even when it's so funny that you end up loving the movie ... <br /> <br /> I'm not finished until the end of this movie is loving. The attempt "steadicam" shot was really unfortunate as well. I mean, hey, if they have a low budget glance, it's okay. You can still make a great movie with a low budget. However, a BAD film and low budget and impact. That makes for a bad combination. In this case, such a devastating combo craptastic film, created "invisible mother". If you have kids, and your kids do not have any taste, they probably will stay awake by all of them.
