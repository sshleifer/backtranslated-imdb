The first 30 minutes of the Sands of Oliveon give me high expectations. I think I was in the cheap version of Mummy. The set up was in 1920, Sicil B. Demille makes ten commands his opus. It looks like using real Egyptian artwork for the film set, they have revealed an ancient and terrible evil (they are not always?). Being aware of how he was eliminated, the whole set was buried instead of breaking the entire set. Hopefully it will be buried with evil all the time. Then we switch on the day where a team is trying to dig the site (the first mistake of the film, but this period is expensive and it is a science-fiction film). We have done well in the first scenes of Anubis Giant and it is a costume that they put in some efforts in the normal Chess Cgi effect. Then the body count begins. This movie went south for me. The response that people are going to die in terrible and strange ways gets a weirdly subdued response. Once they realize that the old recession has been re-open and a murder has happened, what is the problem of men and women's leading stock? They put their normal stop on "who knows the truth but never said to anyone". After getting the important information they will share with comrades on the Dig site? No, they stop in a hotel for a refreshing shower and some delicious little talk. I'm not really the most sent person, but if I knew that a monster was open from ancient Egypt and everyone was losing sight of me and came after me, then I would laugh at my step to solve the problem. After this excessive and unstructured middle division, they usually reach nearby to destroy the Anubis giant, running around dive cavities and shooting it with rocket launchers and standing by a rope of phosphorus grenades. For a sai-fi film, it has gone out of the usual whip, which is not saying much. Does anyone disappoint me, if someone writes a suitable script for it but there can be a lot more.
