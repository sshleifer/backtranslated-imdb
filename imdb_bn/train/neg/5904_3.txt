With the grace of "God's Army" successfully, every Mormon with the camera seems to be trying to make a movie now. In the recent "On the other side of Heaven" case, it was not a bad thing. That film was great, not great. "Single ward", however, not so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Very similar "off of the Ferris Bueller". However, the duplication ended there. Although "Ferry Bulelaer" is a fun, original, and well-played (until such a stupid comedy), "The Single Ward" is quite the opposite. It tries hard to be funny. However, 90% of the gags are flat or perhaps you have heard millions of times in clips and jokes. Another 10% seems to be thrown to fill the time. And acting, though not horrible, is good. <br /> <br /> Also, if you are not dead, or too, very familiar with Mormon culture, you'll rarely find all. Whereas "God's army" and "on the other side of heaven" attracting viewers of both the inside and outside the appealing church, this film is mostly a fun inside and even if you get it, but it's not that funny.
