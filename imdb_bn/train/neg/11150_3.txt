I saw this picture alone, in the dark, and there was no moon out! I did not aim it, it just happened this way. So this element was all the stuff for me to frighten hell! Well, actually I wanted to close the DVD player after 8 minutes, but I thought it would be a chance, unfortunately I did it. The acting was horrible, Armstrong was the only one with some good acting. The plot is not real, if you are a horrible fan, it is the same thing that you have seen many times before. There was no idea in some scenes, and you got the feeling that the director wanted to make this movie even more! The giant movie was the biggest disappointment. (Scary) Scenes It seemed that they belonged to a horror movie of the 80's when there was not enough technology, but some good movies were rebuilt! At the beginning of the film, I was surprised by the name of a big production company, I thought they would not pay anything and make it beautiful? I could not agree more with movie ratings, this is my rating for it, 3 out of 10
