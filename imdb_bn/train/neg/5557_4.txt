OK, but did it make a good movie? Well, I have no opinion. There is not much to recommend it. I found it very slow, slowly, really. Number one and number one were somewhat predictable, but not much. I think this movie was quite a few times in the camp, which I really did not fit with this series and the character. I think the main bad guy played Jeff Faii in this series. He is a decent enough actor, but I think he's played his character too at the top. I suppose that fit with the tone of the movie, if I had liked the movie was great. Plus, some pretty bad one liners came back to the title role of Arnold Weiss, but this film was given very little to work with. This character did not really originate, as I expected. Well This is my opinion. However, for me, this film is not unrealistic, it's quite bad. My vote for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5
