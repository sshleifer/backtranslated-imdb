I'm going to see the movie in '78's summer with my parents, and at that time it was beautiful. Of course, I was seven. <br /> <br /> Just before the release of Jackson movies, my wife and I did not rent the movie because she never saw it and I felt nostalgic. Through the animation process for this movie, Ralph Bakhshi went out of the Middle East, and was forced to spend heavily on this production. Since this movie was primarily done by Rotoscoping, Animation strategy for the people in the budget, it's saying something. Most of the film is animated only in a very short sense of the word. There are some scenes that are very clearly with the people standing in front of the screen, some of the effects of the animation are top of them. <br /> <br /> Because of the budget constraints, the film has already been reduced to "The Floppy's of the Rings" and "The Towers" - much more. What you get is like a film-strip version of Clifty Notes for books. <br /> <br /> Although it is not bad, the animation brings warmth, which I found lack of Jackson movie. It's good to imagine what might be happening with beautiful financing. <br /> <br /> It is also worth mentioning about a seagull coming out of this movie. Several years later, a half-hour half-hour long TV special was preached, which meant that things would be wrapped up. All I would say about that was that it was a musical.
