House of the Dead is the worst movie I've ever seen, painting the 'Matrix' 360 camera Angle and quietly played I fell asleep. I do not think that the manager and set manager can decide whether it is raining or not because the boat will not rain on one side or the other. I'll rate 1 of this movie in 10, (10 best, 1 bad). Also the scenes in the game from the movie were really annoying, it is frustrating that they are not only made to lose time. I request someone to read this, do not see it. It's not worth the time.
