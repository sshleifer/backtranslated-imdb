My girlfriend has a habit of going to Blockbuster and choosing movies, no one has heard anything about it. Sometimes, it has led to some interesting discovery. Most of the time, it can be said that they are running one and a half hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She came home with "Catpillar's advice." The box was funny because he was excited. Lucky for us, promotions in boxes never lie. <br /> <br /> This movie was a practice of patience. This is one of the movies where you are an atheist and shallow person, who likes to watch movies about yourself, but you will hate every character in the movie. Until a beautiful character is introduced. Which will love the main annoying character and act in such a way that, in the real world, anyone who will turn away. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A group of emotional buff, powders, ugly artists closed the love and found success of their workers. Then, they meet a wonderful, intelligent, passionate mature and loving character (an almost perfect man). We then look at that woman, she is in love with an annoying induced artist (between her 30?). So she tried to run away from a nice, intelligent, passionate mature person and lived with a married man with whom she was big but bare sex. He makes disrespect to the people and his ability to defeat him. In the real world, he has been quite successful. I must have escaped from him and I was not even in a relationship with him! <br /> <br /> Although he felt that the man who fought for his love, I never wanted to stay with him. (Not my girlfriend did) she did not deserve her. And, why am I thinking, the director feels that 'almost perfect man' should punish him by winning his relationship with him? When the artist was leaving 'almost perfect man', we were shouting for him to leave. When filming heroin is so annoying, child and stupid that you want to fail, there is a problem with a movie. Outside of <br /> <br />, tell me that Andy Dick smiled me a few times even though the boring point of his character was also pretentious. About other characters, they did well, morally bankrupt and boring characters. <br /> <br /> This is a comedy and I can say that I smile a few times in film. Unfortunately, there has not been much fun until the last 10 minutes or so. But till that time I was praying for a lot of time for the film, who laugh. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
