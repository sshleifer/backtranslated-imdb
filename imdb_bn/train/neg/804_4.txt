The plot is incredible incredible because I rated it 1 rating. Judge for yourself. Be careful, the following will not only give the plot, but also spoil your appetite for watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Computer virus designed by a disgruntled disarmament sends a code through the television screen and a computer monitor. When the code - in the form of light - can enter your body 'electrical system' when it enters the eye. This is how the body cells of the calcium emission forced. Within a few seconds of the infection, the patient reaches his neck, develops the tunnel vision, his skin becomes white in calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scalp cracks in the cloud. <br /> <br /> This virus is very intelligent. When it comes out that a blind computer expert is trying to isolate the code with a braille output device - hand-operated - the device is set to a very high voltage, which creates severe burn wounds on the expert skin. Virus also refers to remote control and aggression against an ATM keyboard. Fortunately, it can be disconnected from an old desktop PC, and electrocuting the gutter on his broken computer, and filling some feet with his legs closed. <br /> <br /> Oh dear ...
