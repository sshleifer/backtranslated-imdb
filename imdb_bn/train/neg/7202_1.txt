Since I liked Inspector Gadget Cartoon in the 80's, I went to see this movie. I wasted my money. The plot was very thin. Also, the film could not keep me interested for a long time. I was glad it was over. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Inspector Gadget, see cartoons instead. It was much better than the movie.
