Guernsey (Maria Krakmann - Belgium / Netherlands 2005) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no courage to deal with him. He sadly avoids any confrontation with humans, his parents, and his sister, so one of our characteristics is a major character in the movie which does not do much. We only know something about his background or his motivation. Just a woman who seems to be trapped in a blind lane, is just during this difficult episode of her life. He is definitely suffering from some, but why do we listen to the audience? <br /> <br /> I left the movie after seeing this unexpected mess. This was a very damp and painful 90 minutes. Usually I try to avoid power dissipation on making bad films. I will take the hit and roll with the beat, but in this case a fair warning is in place. How did this get the benefit of Nouk Leopold's money (from public funding) for Turkey? Obviously, there was no script to speak. It can be compensated by cinematographic ideas or a cast by a small film maker only slightly more application. Whatever, just a vaguely defined concept, "I want to do something from a woman's perspective". As a result, life is a shame as a tribute to a woman's perspective. <br /> <br /> To make it even worse, there is not an interesting shot found in the whole picture. I can not think of a cast that spices it, but Johana's story is a small light in the dark, if possible, with the terrible lack of this element. I'm trying to imagine how Leopold tried to manage Maria Krakmann: "Maria, look at the horizons, we'll film you for three minutes, just show me sorry". A perfect remedy for insomnia. Get a copy and look late this night, sure you sleep too. <br /> <br /> Camera obscura --- 1/10
