If you do not remember being toyed with your passion, then you will not feel like this movie. On the other hand, if you enjoy the mystery of British crime, you will be very disappointed by following the formula and seeing how they all logically end. <br /> <br /> There are some logical inconsistencies in which to move towards the depression: <br /> <br /> The police started using CCTV cameras to collect data about secret mysteries, that closed the huge track and its disappearance Camera does not stop the look of the camera just before. This is a critical piece of mystery. Children are incompatible with the car stuck in the camera and there is no such big truck for mystery. <br /> <br /> * The movie goes to great extent to showcase the sophistication of the toys, but it reduces the chance of using the same sophisticated equipment as a part of the development process, which can enter the crime scene from camera-visible position in front of crime scene. Tracking vehicles. <br /> <br /> * In England, driving is left. The director came out of the driving path in the right-hand crime scene, a few meters away from the flower kiosk, when it can be easily parked beside or beside it; As a huge truck. <br /> <br /> * The Police Forensics team is so alarming that a retracted cell phone can be found in the Sewer Drain, a few miles away from the crime scene, but there is no evidence of blood from the head to the right, even if they disappear After a few hours and just a few hours after visible rain, the scene was protected. <br /> <br /> * Search dogs were not used to find missing children; It is well-known for making and creating enemy dogs for hunting and hunting from this country. <br /> <br /> * It is highly unreasonable that such a publicity story may not be able to stop a closed truck driver. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, similarly - when she just could not get out of the unnecessary mobile home. Her daughter had enough money to get a carpet fiber under her nail, she easily asked her daughter for help, or even to leave the mobile home in the residential park in the house. <Br /> <br /> * The suspect that the little girl was kidnapped was mentally slow / slow down - without knowing her mother's sinking? However, he was not smart enough to use his rights to cooperate with police and not to commit suicide completely. <br /> <br /> There are more inconsistencies that will lead to the sadness of true self. 'Five Days' is a very weak British crime story.
