Do you know the letters "Father Christmas" and "Jesus" that are sent every year? Well, it shows that they are not actually delivered, but do not roam the half-forgotten corner of the post office until some bright sparks find ways to post them. Go as malicious settings, it fits perfectly funny movie "Office of the Dead Letter" which is a winner and one. Said that this is probably an Australian film to oppose the British. It was a Royal Mail, but most of the letters can be treated like this anyway. I have not been in this flat for two years and we are still receiving Mr. Wang's letter, some female pastors of the Church of Latter Day, I have never addressed many catalogs for hair-off-u and industrial equipment. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> "Dead Letter Office" Writing to his missing father, he only learned in adults that his letters were not distributed for one reason or another. So, logically, he is a DLO. Get a job in. And Chile's immigrant Frank Lopez (George Dale Hoyo), along with other social rejection, works himself as well. Gradually, he pulled himself to him, but his father could not bring his dead body to the self-regulated world of the dead journal office? <br /> <br /> There is nothing against this picture but it was reminded me of this movie when God "commit" the horrible Heather Graham film However, this horse shit is much better than that pill but then again, that's not that difficult. At the beginning, this film is much more logical. True, the metaphors are somewhat vague and degenerated symbolism quickly turned into flood. But at least this is not burying and quirky being full drivel. It is well played. Both Auto and Dale Hoe are very good, lovers looking for something they do not know they can never find, and other characters are best like peripherals. The part of the trouble is that this viewer seems to be wrapped up very quickly, leaving some disappointment. The other part is that when you are in Australia's anti-corruption immigration policy (i.e. if you do not speak english!), This story can not really happen. Other characters, sadly, prove a little more than the stereotype of the weird ball, and help to destabilize the reality. Even after the <br /> <br />, "Dead Letter Offices" are certainly slightly different. It can not be the taste of everyone but I like it. Yes, it is hackneyed and predictable, but sometimes it looks nice to watch a movie without gun or violence or heavy-duty oath and nudity (there is no possibility of Australian film). There is no big smile, no bullet time, and characters are usually one-dimensional. But it's a story that's counting here and when it's not glorious, it's a great way to pass the time. This is a Sheryl Crow CD equivalent movie - now and again nice to hear, but if it is not there you will not miss it.
