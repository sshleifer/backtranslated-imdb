Here is an interesting little movie that strictly gives the term "low budget" an awesome name. Our physicist teachers, who have about nine children, create a strange serum that creates "molecular reconstruction". Students were frustrating to kill submarine sandwiches and fake school supplies from fake events. Looks like the classic B-movies have a resurgence in the 50's, is not it? No! It is not an example of high camp fun, which means, Way Off Signs. A glamorous showcase of breasts and boots will make our wish for joy by opposing the horrors that should be 99.44% higher for the first time. Above all, with the help of ants of the best entertainment of the cable, red blood and dead girls' organizations. Such torture films will eventually create disaster guru Guru (1970), an intelligent talent who has earned a bachelor's degree in the film! This is an automatic "F", so easy to rest!
