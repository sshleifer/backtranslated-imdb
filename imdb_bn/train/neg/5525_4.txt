The problem of family dramas is that unlike TV movies in channels like Lifetime, most people do not want to see them. And what appears to be sensitive and current or recent issues or news (or recent news) issues Explain or explore the human condition that the movie is not popular Miss Lohan's fan base or young crowd that is easy for filmmaking, but is not financially successful for studios, especially with young people. <br /> <br /> The specific problem I had with this film was that some of the characterization of cartooning. It was a little too much to blame all the actions of the role of iron (breakdown of cars, drug use, etc.). Although not impossible, it is just a little more than expected to swallow the audience. Then, on the other side, such as a young Mormon boy, oral sex, or he really will make a good assistant to the vet, which, in turn, has to do something for his mother, etc., all of these elements are really only with this movie help. This has made the situation a bit more comedy to try one of their "special dramatic episodes", it's a perfectly available, well-written feature for the movie. <br /> <br /> When you see and listen to the DVD, especially for the various options end, you can really see all these sharp focus.
