This movie was made for the Asian / Chinese market, especially Joe Chuera's biggest music star in Asia. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> J. He was moderate as an actor, although he was present in many big budget productions ("Elementary D", "Curse of Golden Flower"). Surprisingly, he won both the Golden Horse (Taiwan) and the Hong Kong Film Awards for "Elementary D". <br /> <br /> Supporting Castes is very well selected, which is largely appealed to everyone from China. Cast including many famous movies / TV actors, singers, even sports commentators (Huang Xianxiang from China). However, not enough time to show their talent. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake is that Chu took the position of both directors and writers. He has a reputation for making shallow and unwise movies based off of non-consistent scripts. With its poor instruction and Lam story, the complete gifted cast, fancy aspect and production tones were used to waste money. However, this terrible movie has successfully cashed over $ 10 million, maybe even more Asian which is one of Asia's biggest box office successes. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is: You can only see this movie if you want to see how money and talents are destroyed, or if you are only Jay Chou fans who are accompanying your kids.
