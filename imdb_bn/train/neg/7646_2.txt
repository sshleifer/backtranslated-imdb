No party supported actor Kris Klein in a film that follows a struggling actor. He struggled to make some memorable performances and flashes through the shallow script of the exhibition management, which can only be described as a great leading man. The story exists, but it is all, and fails to show a basic start, middle and end, and the spectators have touched the shoulders of their shoulders, although nothing happened in the last hour and three quarters. <br /> <br / A brilliant light of Fred Durst, who manages to stand on top of his seemingly gorgeous co-star and serves back-to-back character of Legde's character in a semi-decent job. While working with Cast's higher qualification, Fred will still be able to recreate it, but I will wait for him in the future.
