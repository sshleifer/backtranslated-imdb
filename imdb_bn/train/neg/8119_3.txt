First of all, this movie was not really something that really took me. It was not a bad movie, and another movie where I said "Well, it was not something special" I saw it. Perhaps the drama and stuff were, but it simply did not grab me, but seamed more semi-dull. As I said in the title it seamed in a way too cheap. The film's quality (images) is as rich as less quality and reminds me of anything more cheap for TV-movie than a well-respected English filmmaker. My views on camera angles and shots were very amateur. There is not any close-up shot or similar effect to produce really interesting scenes. I have not seen many English films and what I saw really did not affect me more than they did and they did the same thing as the camera work, color and so on. "Game" has tried to be more cool, hip and smart (see my review of "Lola Rent" if you want it), but I did not succeed. Much of the film was not just something that was a little indifferent (Best, I'm afraid) and basically unfortunately two hours have been lost.
