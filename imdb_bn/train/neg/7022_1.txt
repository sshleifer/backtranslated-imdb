For more than 70 years of watching movies, it will be one of the worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Mears, and some others have created a very bad comedy, but it's the absolute bottom of Barrell. <br /> <br /> It is strange to first open <br /> <br /> I usually like Diane Keaton, it will be very bad behind him. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Not playing his role. <br /> <br /> Mike White has to find another character, he did the same person several times a day. <br /> <br /> Cain Howard started the year as the first-rate actor, he used as well as well. <br /> <br /> On this attempt at the movie comedy I can say there is nothing modest. <br /> <br /> <br /> Ratings: * (in 4) Point 25 (outside of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
