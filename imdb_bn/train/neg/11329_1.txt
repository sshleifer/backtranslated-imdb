Elizabeth Taylor could not work at all and she had her usual annoying, breaking self in this film. Before it became so thick it looked very small and gentle. Rock Hudson Beck was just like Benedict, but apparently better than an actor William Holden. James Dean definitely proved how he would ruin his path through a movie. The whole film is incredibly slow and goes for a lot longer. The actors were very young and lightweight and none of them believed in poor make-up. Hudson thought it was just a sunny day and Dean and Carroll Baker were definitely of the same age. <br /> <br /> 0/10.
