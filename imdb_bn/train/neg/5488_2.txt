Why is Colin Firth on Earth? Was he really guilty of cash? <br /> <br /> The picture is not clear about what it wants to be, sadness, exterior space, ghost, a car for Mr. Dresi? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Want to return to yankland. <br /> <br /> There are uninterrupted episodes in the legal streets, churches, busy roads - but what are these, why should it be easy to care for anyone? <br /> <br /> There was also a Yank woman in the film. It was not clear what the job was here, but she was present there to comment on the girl with a bad, inappropriate and addictive comment. Was it supposed to be about padphilia? <br /> <br /> A superb awesome mess, all in all. I gave it 2 instead of 1 because it was not a whimsical film.
