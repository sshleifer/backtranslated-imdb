When you go to the low budget Indies you will get what you get for whatever you get, and I just have to say, I did not pay much for "freeware". Writer / Director: David R. Williams brings us to the story of a abandoned entertainment park, surrounded by the soul of a abandoned serial killer. Do not have a bad compound, but low budget mistakes executed with a bevy. The camera's work tries to be very cleaner for viewers, continuously using fast-cut shakes, which is really nothing important or awesome to show us. It is clearly proven from the bat, as we introduced the killer and soon realized that the most horrific incident (acting) ... is a painful title sequence that has been brought back to us in modern times. "Freewart" creates a somewhat unique painting while showing visibility from the funny room, but with a very long running time it can not save the film below the bottom average indie from hell. <br /> <br /> Some middle nudity, but not much for Gore, which is usually the preservation of such films. <br /> <br /> Fans of bad movie can find something of interest here, otherwise, do not spend a lot of cash.
