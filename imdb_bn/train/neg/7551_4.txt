Well, finally I found the reconstruction last night in London, without being ridiculously ridiculous, sexless and without any real humor. I did not really know where to start, when I was humble by this strange tribute, it really did not move me. There is no real music, no music, no clothes, much more 'Disney' is a ridiculous 'six months later' Nick Keiji's burning after entering (which would not have come too soon for my preference) in the Beat Beer case, the crowd imposed the grief with the cue, as comedy Hijacked from various 'Baddies' on the island. It's a weird feeling that I could not believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that completed comic strip gifts in eighty days, some of Honey Strike's interpretation of their Hollywood is very weird!
