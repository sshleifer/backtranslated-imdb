To be honest, I got this image that was surprised by the positive vote. The movie has been dragged only through the lifetime of 81 minutes, and the audience was hit by the whole way. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. He was given some complimentary conversations and he managed quite well. Scott Valentine (on the other hand, Marriage Bet on Family Relations) is a beautiful watch. I witness the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies highlighting his performance .... give a break. Also, Valentine gives us the harmful and kind of tragedy of such a sad vampire that missed the day (see Dennis Duff in "Bleeding: Symptoms 4" to see a more strong genius of sorrowful vampire). The film came so slow and only became positively paused and Church Spadling's dance scenes can be honest. This film can only be recommended to hard-hearted people of Charlie Spradling's (which I was, and I was exaggerating while still watching it!).
