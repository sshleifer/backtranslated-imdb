I wish to greet the best wishes of Bo Derek and draw attention to the UK (especially the fortunes of the lucky sun and world news) - Dudley Moore follows her small role in "10". It is understood that his photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and much more controversial bouts of his perfectly composed enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, acting, and never, its fault! I think they should try triple disk collections together that you always find in the essential DVD points - Orca, Tarzan Ep-Man and Ballero. These movies may be nominated for "so bad stars". <br /> <br /> This will be my "guilty" guilty! If you ever want to read your press, or miss this comment, please do not be bothered - ALWAYS was a soft spot for you and something more important is happening in the world to think about your acting ability. lots of love
