This film is fun as social commentary, when it actually seems ridiculous, which condemns racism. The basis of this movie: African American = strong ... any other nation = weak The worst part is when Rapper is throwing guns on Omar Apex and the Jewish people. The Jewish man starts to tremble in fear of stereoical fashion, and blames him for his life ... but the big, powerful, disrespectful Omar Epps are stronger without any fear. Our classmate has condemned as cruel preppie drunk or rapist. The raped white girl must start thinking about homosexuality, because she is a weak white girl after all. When the nerdy white guy is discarded by virus members, of course there are incredible cowards who fall immediately with skinheads; Especially the big muscular guy who is beaten quickly by powerful black men. Wait ... Boish Rehimes is standing in his shape two minutes ??? Yes, all right. <br /> <br /> Black people do not accept their own people and Omar Apps easily go with them. Ice cube threatens his white roommates and puts them in their lines, they are only stupid - of course he is the Almighty, when his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and go to the end. This movie was just terrible and after the end I started laughing loudly. The long-term long-term pace between apps and banks makes them smile with their faces - to see my nephew and cousins ​​face each other (and they are under 5). Avoid yourself and avoid this crapfest.
