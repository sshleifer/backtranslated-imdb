The idea is going to be something interesting in the first ten minutes to keep the hooked audience. The late night shop managed to avoid much interest than that. When we can reach a point, it is incredibly stupid that I was thinking that I must have misunderstood. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! Her friend asks, "But what is the weekend?" There is not a sufficient explanation. Shane then tells the story of his own problem, which he confirms that his girlfriend is still living at home while working at night and works on that day so that they do not meet each other. It's been running for three weeks. But his friend does not ask: "Yes, but as mentioned earlier, what is the weekend? Then you will see him, it does not understand what you are doing, Shan? Are you doing medicine or something?" But we would be generous and Guess that they work seven days a week. <br /> <br /> We tested soap and saw that the soap and towel were used. (Actually, oddly, he began to carry soap with her.) But what about her girlfriend's conditioner and shampoo, sanapro and moisturizer, toothpaste and toothbrush? Let's go to the kitchen. What about food and drink? Is missing? Has anyone bought? Did the bedroom be shared bed? Is her clothes used and exchanged for clean ones? Is the laundry basket full? The toilet seat up or down? I mean, good sorrow! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His captain, Why does not he just call him? <br /> <br /> But it gets worse. In the end, though no one told Vincent, where the rest of the party is going, he manages to find them. Lenny's love interest and Shane's girlfriend can easily be the best friend and manage to find the group. There is no minimal effort to explain these uncommon unforeseen events. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is OK to be fair but not good enough for stories of weaker characters or annoying hair. <<br /> <br /> I heard an actor interview and he said "There is no gun, no medicine, no corsage." I thought, "Great". But after half an hour of tadium, I shouted on the screen, "I want a gun! I want drugs! I want corset! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br But the director of the official website claimed that this image is not script-edited. You need to know all thats.
