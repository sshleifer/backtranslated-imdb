This movie claims that the film was filmed by NASA, recently compared to historic weather information for Apollo 11, and a good match was shown between the video samples and the actual samples of cloud rain. The whole argument in this film is that the "whole world" picture is actually a small part of the planets made of space windows. <br /> <br /> I'm now waiting for Bert Seabrael to have historic weather data focused on NASA, though there is no doubt that it involves replacing the copy of the archived magazine with the weather map and someone still has a problem with it. . Ah, a response: "Nasa is trying to disrespect the film's weather, trying to disrespect this movie, I would say it is a charming, but weak and disrespectful argument. The footage and the evidence in the film? Some say mosquitoes and swallowing camels. Do you feel in any way that this might apply for what you are trying to do here? :-) Mark This movie, which was claimed after the success of the moon mission, was packed solely with incredible proof and that person is now the true master of the universe. Things are not what they seem almost. Just watch the movie, and I say you look a bit different earlier. . <br /> <br /> For the first time weather data does not come from NASA. Secondly, weather information is a film Dr reducing demand. Third, "the evidence associated with the absurd" is far from being, claims on the rest of the film has been canceled. Picture a piece of the secret, so he edited it and added his own interpretation. Unfortunately for him, his source film is a universal domain, and opposes his claims made by Bit Siebler.
