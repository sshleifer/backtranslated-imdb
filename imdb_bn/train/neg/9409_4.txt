I like this show! I think it was not anything wrong with it! Just do not sued that show that only spidy punching someone! Some people just think that this show is bad. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like X-Men, The Paus√≠sia, Daredevil and Iron Man! Bad Sandman is never seen, but I like it! The best spied show ever !! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobbblin 4. Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda <br /> <br /> But there were some episodes that were really good: Rocket Rasors and the watch are embarrassing to watch Spot And I do not like Morbius and Hydro Man. Morbius sucks Plasma instead of the first blood and I do not like the vampire. And it bothers me that she was almost the main villain in the season. Of course I have to mention Hydro Man! She was terrible! I rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible. And I do not like Spidi as Man-Spider! <br /> <br /> But I guess something worse than that!
