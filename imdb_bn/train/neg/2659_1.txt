I'm sorry but this is just awful. I said something about this movie and some of it has played bad and they almost do not believe me. There is nothing wrong with this idea, this day Japanese soldiers dragged Bushodi fighters into days and their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the soldiers first understand something strange, do you need to say every single person behind the "O my clock is closed" behind the transport? Imagine a 15+ repeating line before saying something else, and you have an extraordinary lack of concise in the movie.
