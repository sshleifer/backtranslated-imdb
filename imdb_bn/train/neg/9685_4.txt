I do not know about you, but I always felt drawn to the 'art' movie. The first art film was known as Peter Greenway's "The Cook, The Thief, Has Wife and His Girlfriend", which throws my mind and creative spirit into overdrive. The film was both excellent and wonderful, it was the 'art film', exploring the intellectual ideas and the purpose of screening the screen. Life, real life, can be like living in a crazy home, and shows it for what art expresses. I love all types of movies, but especially if there is something to entertain and say, I agree with his position <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " "Clinical 'comedy' where a father and son collect a harem to filling many of their sexual fantasies. Fellini has only been given a brief signal in the film, unlike what the previews suggest. The main focus of this film is on the 'close' relationship between parents, which are gathered after the death of mothers. In the early scenes of the picture, Father's suffering is trustworthy, you can feel his pain. Later greenway standards, collection of harem, observation of love and death, and flesh for meat are displayed ... Someone may argue about this, but I think the film may be shallow and vain. And the idea that it might be a comedy is perplexing for me. If the fine is played in most cases, especially the good ... Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer (though poor Mandi will wear her clothes) What is the lack of films? It's so amazing to see an engaging story and its extra other movies in the usual Greenway. <br /> <br /> While insane, and occasionally filled with forbidden moments, "8 1/2 Women" is very cut and considered to be art, considered to be very funny and feels fun <br /> <br /> < br /> Save your money ... I can only recommend this photo to help you sleep. <br /> <br /> <br />
