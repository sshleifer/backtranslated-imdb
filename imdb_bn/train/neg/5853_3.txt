IMMORTALIZER was, well, interesting. It certainly does not kill me during my hour and half-time, but it does not affect me a lot. A group of kids are kidnapped by a musclehead mutant in a lane (a crushing head of the movie in a scene featuring crushing sound effects) and passed from a fancy house in the suburbs. Here is The Divine and his team are replacing the brain for its rich older patients so that they can retain the remains of youth. Hey, this was quietly rebuilt with a big budget as a frozen few years later! Who knew that when you transformed an old person's brain into a different body, their new voice would be just like their old voice? With these conversations from the pianal gland and the use of a burning green symphony, you can see re-animator dancing scenes from outside to viewers and producers' heads. But the production does not literally have the courage to pull it off. I did not understand why someone is making a horror movie of low budget, so that they do not pack it on the edge of the neck. Acting is terribly awesome, as well as getting good performance as Assistant Dr Price from Clark Lindsley. She has a beautiful evil smile. The only thing in the note about IMMORTALIZER is that it features many old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast old people have some serious obstacles.
