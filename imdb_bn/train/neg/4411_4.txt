Michael Rumar is a moderate actor, but he has no leadership except a low-budget movie. He does not really have many charisma. Ryo Ishibashi has many screens in attendance, and sadly she is not really the main character. Most of the time the screen goes to the brick-face rover. <br /> <br /> Daniel Harris plays her daughter (from the Halloween 4 and 5 movies), and she is beautiful and entertaining but she is not being written smart and her foolish one gets one of the main characters killed. Comedian Fred Willard, Bobcat Goldthwaite and Stephen First playing an interesting role here. Just see what is happening in these characters is invaluable. <br /> <br /> Vincent Schevieli plays with the conspirator of the local Mafia Godfather, and it is difficult to know whether the movie is acting as a trick. Tim Thompson is also in this movie. She seems to be a very low budget direct-to-video action movie. Thomson has some low-budget comedies. This comedian and comedian in this film seems like a mockery. Is it a parody of a Yakuza movie? It's hard to tell some points. Of course there is very little Yakuza action. <br /> <br /> throwing supporting thugs and goons is menacing and well cast. Some of these movies have the toggles that they work like in the local comic book store or in Piglioli-Wigley stock boys. Overall this movie is very uneven. In some points it seems like a comedy or a parody. Then on another point it works as a good action movie. Then it's a last sputters. Without my contribution to Daniel Harris and Roy Ishibashi, my humble opinion of this movie will be a zero rate.
