How good Gwyneth Paltrow! This is the right movie for her ... very bad she's out of full role. I did not read the book of Jane Austen, but I can not believe that it is very sacramental and the characters are not much more than the characters. It was not easy to reduce the book by about 600 pages to 2 hours, but I hope to see more of the old furniture and the old pieces of the tea cup. I have seen every actor that even though the competition did not cross the mark (additional times), I was relieving every time.
