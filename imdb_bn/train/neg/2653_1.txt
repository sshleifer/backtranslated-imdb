I could not believe how bad this picture was; I rarely see commercial TV, but thought "Well, Deane Keaton is always valuable". I am amended. Everyone should be involved in hanging their heads in shame. <br /> <br /> I understand that there is not a big role for a particular age of women, but this script is so perfect, cluttered and annoying that I am wonderful that it has never been developed or Mrs. Keaton thought that she was the ear of this seed You can create a silk purse from None of the characters had a severity of credibility and were so incredibly unlike. Acting looked like an exercise in a BEGINNING class - I wondered what most of these wonderful "what they think?" Through open headaches stared in horror. Very, very sad that it came out. Do not waste your time.
