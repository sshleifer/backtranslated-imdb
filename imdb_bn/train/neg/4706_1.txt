All right, you heard that this movie is a disappointing 'objection'. First off, the band, which is not going to watch or listen to a band called "The Necked Brothers Bond"?!? Not only the name is terrible but they can not even play musicians! Also, the lead singer sounds more serious than GD Lee, even her voice is even more terrible! They are not only awesome musicians but they are terrible actors. Led by a crappy director and thin plot, this has ever got to be the dumbest movie. I hope this website will allow you to vote for zero or Belo 10 votes, because giving this slap 1/10 is too generous. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure that you can call it a comedy film. If you are looking for a comedy with music, then go to the "strange al" Yankovic guy, because he is a whole lot better than this untalented tweens.
