It has a very bad performance. Bad story line. Bad characters. If you see it, you will not see this show. Turn off Or you'll be cringing for the next 30 minutes. It should not have been broadcasted. It's not great. You will not see it. Never So now, if you want to see this show, please do not do it. Turn on CW for Smallville. Or Hannah Montana, the Disney Channel for the designer's channel Weverwy Place, or Drake and Josh's Nick Channel, they have many good family shows. So believe me about this, I saw it before. And it's honesty, and I'm telling the truth, the worst show I've ever seen, and I've seen so many TVs. So do me a favor, and do not watch this show.
