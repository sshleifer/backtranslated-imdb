Then the longest dance sequence and closest to the characters that dragged the film - the film was better served to explain the stories and motivations of the characters. <br /> <br /> The movie created a lack of real depth at the back of the dynamic and important competition between Noor, Minister, aunt, mother - and HatsuoMo and Mamah and Hatsuo and Surei. If you have not read the book, then you can not really understand why the Chief Minister likes the chairmanship and why Mamata becomes her mentor. Actually this movie was stunning - and the actor made everyone the best. C rated script they were given, but that was good about this movie.
