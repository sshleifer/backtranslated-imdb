The verb, violence, sex, and fat language are things that are characterized throughout the film. And they are all without reason. Mark L. Lesser (i) known for his violent (non-production) films (Commando, The Base). The story is weird but stupid. Actors play their stupid characters very well ... I'm not saying they are stupid but I mean they are very bad actors. This is another low-budget action movie of the unknown B series. If you've seen something like a bad movie like Operation Delta Force, Drive, Patriot, Sanctuary or Misbegotten ... do not hire it ... and, anyway, do not hire any of the movies that I have mentioned .... I'll give it in one and a half thousand.
