Anne, a dead Jewish mother named Bancroft Eusthall, who once asked her real son (Ron Silver) together to find the movie star Grey Garbo and gave two identities before the good check out for Estel. Actress has been entitled to "Bancroft Talk" as her ambiguous comedy / dramatic / sensitive element attack for the time being. Hot-or-cool director Sidney Lumeet can not turn compatible lathe and the filmmaker can not scale again the continuation of the bandwatch - on the right-hand side: cute, lusty-eye and gems Estelle has become a tension on this scenario (that is not going to be much in addition to the thin-concept plot). Silver and co-star Carey Fisher and Catherine Hicks rarely work but support the star, and each one is spread by his hammer. * **** to 1/2
