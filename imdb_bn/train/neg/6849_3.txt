This little J-Hara film follows a young girl, when she returns to her childhood village, sells family homes on Shikook Island and meets old friends. He drowned the daughter of the village priest a year ago. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend), then the mother of Shiori tried to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bond between the dead and the living is weak and friends and villagers are watching ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Like stellar Jay-Horror movies, Suspense is not really created, the result is not too much threatening and does not seem to be the end border of strange borders. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Long so it is mushy borders. Sometimes you get at this poor Asian restaurant or cook your own white rice a little more. Because you end up eating it because you need it with food, because without Chinese or Japanese food rice, but it is almost gluey, gooey tastelessness because it consumes all the food. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
