Hunting, if you have seen the original, you know a great ghost story, it's the film's perfection. This is a violent story that goes into a ghostly house and with simple techniques of sound and movement, it is afraid of people. Although praising the film, it is still effective So when Hunting was rebuilt in 1999, many people had the same reaction, "What? Why?" But if my opinion is enough to respect a rimak and just want to reconsider the story of the new generation, I am quite calm with it. This is definitely not the case, this is an insulting boring shame that will waste your time and I will provide no scares to guarantee ?? pfft! PG-13, where are they thinking? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After the arrival, meet Mr. Nell and Mr. Mrs. Doodle, a strange caretaker who does not have the property after dark. Shortly after this, the study was attended by two other participants, Doctor Marrow, The Wild Theo and "Bad Sleep" Luke London Sanderson. Unknown to the participants, Dr. Morro's true motive is to study the psychological response of panic. Every night, the gate chains outside the supervisor Hill House, when anyone open the barrier, the caretaker lock from outside or outside until morning. There is no telephone inside the Hill House and the nearest city is a few miles away. Hill House story The room was built by Hugh Carrine, Karen made his wife home, hoping that he would fill the children's entire family, but the children of Kerin were always killed during birth. Before the end of the house, Karen's wife killed herself, and Karen once again became completely engrossed. On the first night, Theo and Nell began to enjoy strange phenomena in the house, with strange words and irregular temperature changes. The main hallway faces the nail after breaking down with the words "Welcome Home, Alanar" and it turns out to be very annoying to prove that the Karen cruelty roamed the house by the ghosts. He learned that Karen had made his fortune by exploiting the abducted children and killing them while killing them while using them for murder. Then he burned the bodies in the house fireplace to hide any evidence. He learned that Karen had a second wife named Caroline, of which Nell was born. Everyone thinks he's crazy when Nell is definitely related to him. <br /> <br /> Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this movie, it's really stupid and vain. Acting actor Neil does not mention, Lily Taylor completely annoys me, her performance, her appearance, everything about her, I started without seeing her again in the film. Catherine Zeta Jones was not well on her role, and Liam Nisson, once again wasted a great actor talent. The effect is on top and very computerized way, I just can not believe this will be a wonderful classic trash with crud. Believe me, if you are going to be afraid, how can you become a spooky fool, fool, fool, fool? Oh, this picture is already hurting me, just do not see it, it's bad. <br /> <br /> 1/10
