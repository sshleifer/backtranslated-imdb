This movie will be the worst horror movie I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, awesome and cheesy and talked about a prospective plot! I will never see this movie again and I will not recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie started, I realized how I got myself. What they did for this movie copied many other horror movies and made them all in this movie. Fantastic phone calls, Halloween nights, a psycho, and a knife! Absolutely ridiculous I did not get scared of the movie, which thought that the horror films should have been done. To make the film, they are all very funny about how this movie is so awesome and so scary. I mean, how do movies stop the cheap rage of "scary movie"? At least there were some good actors to get there and then perhaps it was pulled as a good horror movie.
