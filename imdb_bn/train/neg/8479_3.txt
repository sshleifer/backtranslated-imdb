All right, when I came to the board of this movie, I was really waiting for the fun of people. I was surprised to see the likes of 7 year old people. I enjoyed the movie ... but only my little sister (who actually did 10) had fun with the whole thing with me. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for Jordan, but the acting was horrible, terrifying. You know that a movie is operated for the toilet when lead can not work. And it was not even a good script or the plot to release it. I also thought that the Pamela character was too long ... the border-palace was shocked. <br /> <br /> Even with that saying I thought, some good actors such as Fantastic Spencer, Hollywood, and Ronnie Still, not enough to free the film. <br /> <br /> There are two things about this movie that I can not finish: <br /> <br /> 1.) The Spencer will fall for him. All right, oh I saw the dates and, in reality, his age was more than four years, the difference between "GO image" was very big. Jordan is a very beautiful girl, but in GF, she seemed like 10 or 12 ... she seemed to be a little child! Jack Hubble (Spencer) felt like a college student. <br /> <br /> 2.) In any way Kristi Yamaguchi will only come to skating for a girl. I mean, I know that catechins are good and everything, but still think that Christian would go to boarding schools where there was no scholarship for skating, or a school would appoint skating coaches with these connections. <br /> <br /> <br /> I told everyone that this was not the worst movie ever, but it was not very good by the DCM standard, which I think is very little.
