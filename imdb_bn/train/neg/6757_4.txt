Kinky Slasher movie from producer Charles Band. The full moon successor said that he would never make "real killer film" because he thought that little dolls and big monsters have added a fantasy element that makes movies even better - thus people kill each other and make fun less . Destroying the full moon studio through a potentially poor business transaction is a wonderful sight of the band and the real shame, has become so frustrating for home cinema that he wanted to fix the choices of Blockbuster and dedicated creativity and fundamentalism to it. This back group also delta delta dead! And 'birth right' - the value of both the moon and moon is equally equal. Debbie Rocon has decided to create a story about 'The Hill Club', which is topped as a newcomer to a group of dude and dodds. He - as clearly - he can join and then set up the panic because it was not a real story and a stupid M. Rokon believed it and now everyone can cover the blood and kill each other. No There is a choice and with this movie it is not recommended ... but not completely bad.
