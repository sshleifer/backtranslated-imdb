There was nothing wrong with acting, etc. The epidemic for this series is closed for the series Fantant or any fantoom. It was 42-minute waste to see Martin Man Hunter. You have to know that no matter what happens in the middle of the 6th series is not true, and it does not really matter with the serious story, Marshall does not meet Hunter again and it needs to be done for 30 minutes. In another case of poor writing in Chawlivili Soap opera. I really like the show but mainly for cast and for 3 good episodes every year, but those who work for writing or working in soap, they need to be canned. This was one of the worst one. In the first 4 minutes, you know what's going to be stupid and what's happening is a dream based on Clark's wave that was caused by the character of Spont Fomtmose Zone, and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah so the authors will not do it. Really this one week will make a villain that progresses the story line. Another villain can be added to die in the last episode, who was in Martin Man Hunter and he flies back or forth and can tell Clark that he has forgotten his sunglasses to look like this episode and this is a day
