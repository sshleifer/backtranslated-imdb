As South Africa, it seems that someone really paid for making this fool! <br /> <br /> Directed by director for the Director Zuli Miner, writer, this "addition" series turmoil! The original series was based on historical events about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A person playing a major role in converting the history of South African local tribes into shape has become a major figure. <br /> <br /> The plot of this film is nothing but Hitwash, it is scraped by a writer under the barrel. <br /> <br /> Good actor in Omar Sharif and Henry Sale, what is David Hasselhoff doing here, his red boy and smiling smiling slaves? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not wait for soft, busty women to get out of nowhere and in their small red bath suits for any visible visible across the screen. It was not even more bizarre than the photographer plot line that was followed by a 10-pinter beer at Fantasy Dress Party, where one of the cave's costume writers inspired her to return to the African theme for her next "blockbuster". .
