... or an audience. A quick recap .... <br /> <br /> So you've got this doctor who has been examined for some vague reasons with the body part of the theft. He wants to replace the perfect, but thinks he must do it in his basement. WTF ??? And then suddenly, unfortunately, and conveniently, his drunk cut his head in his traffic accident that he was responsible for. Sadly aggressive, he is stored in his head with a Lasagna Pan (or strudel?) And keep it alive to keep it "adreno-serum" (sic) full of pumps. Then the voice shook his voice clearly, although he did not have the lungs, so he woke up, stopped his head and talked. Inconsistent b * tch does not appreciate all that his fiancé has done for him. Just like a woman ..... <br /> <br /> Then her grief came back to discipline because she saw the possibility of glistening over the body of her fiancée's head, she could go on the road. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a type of dime-store Igar, turned into a philosophical argument with the head, who hit the telonetic friendship with "monster in the closet" (every mad scientist). Finally the screenplayer can realize that he can not maintain the fear of the subject of his misogyny and intimacy on the advertisers' infinitum, so he will probably kill everyone, then probably have the opportunity to stop the payment of financial banks before probably start checking bank checks. <br /> <br /> I think it's a bad movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> With the help of the assistant, the eyes are closed, often without blood, very valuable around the house.
