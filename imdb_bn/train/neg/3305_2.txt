I absolutely failed to see what's funny in this movie. Humor seems scheduled for the body. It's slow. The story is very easy to be true. Characters do not raise much sympathy, some non-important characters aside. Nothing surprising happens. What does this script writer think? "Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Let's make them cry ... ... behave like little boys! Oh, yes, it's absolutely brilliant and original! <br /> <br> This picture has been very annoying to me from the movies I have seen in the last five years.
