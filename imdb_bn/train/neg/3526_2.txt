(Spoiler included, something to say) <br /> <br /> This picture can not take seriously. In some parts it is so terrible that I can not only help it smile at all. Try me for a continuation, where Stallone's character goes to a height of 20 meters (or really my favorite) with the whole climbing gear, destroying the bad guy by stuck him to Stalactite. Yes, did he get irrational power to achieve such achievement? I'm submerged, but he definitely gives a run for money money.
