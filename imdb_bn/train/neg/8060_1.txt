What a bad, bad movie! I tried to see without fast forwarding ... that failed. After about 30 minutes I closed the movie, went online to see how long this disaster was. (Only 84 minutes, Whew!) This is a confusing, annoying movie. I do not think anyone can breathe a lot with a fluorescent bulb. One interesting thing is that I saw the movie's "The Killer Cut" version. Box brave "more blood!" "More sex!" "More Terror than Dramatic Release!" Dad! If this film is horrific to all of these claims, then I wonder how the "United Nations-Killer Cutting" If you want to see a great movie about the living world and see the Night of the Living Dead series in the world of the dead !!
