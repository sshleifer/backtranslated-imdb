This movie is like the title of Blue Queer's title 'Billythree Spirits'. A ghost wife and a medium conspiracy firmly attached to the text of the poetry. I am surprised that the films of this nature do not accept the idea of ​​the original author. I understand that the public should not be aware that it is a fake but it is a fake <br /> <br /> sorry. This movie production is expensive. I do not perk up when a screen is original. Even perk up when I have an innovative way to produce a job that has been released even before. There were some specimens mentioned (such as Topper, etc.). <br /> <br /> I understand that movies are still relatively cheap. However, I am not happy when I do not accept the favor to grant the taste of the people. In this situation, the taste of the people is ignored. <br /> <br /> <br /> I see rather the game.
