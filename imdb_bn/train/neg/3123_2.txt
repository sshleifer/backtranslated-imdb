I was a bit scared to see this ... but it looks like this movie is the reason for the madness running into the family. As others point out, as otherwise mentioned, since it does not make much sense, it was one of Karl's last films, and this is simply his screen presence which gives it any credibility. It is unfortunate that all great legends of the sound films of the sound era were finally reduced to acting in lower grade rubbish. Partly, Boris became a little better than the poor poor Lagosi but not much. <br /> <br /> Boris does his best job and gives credit to him for trying to keep this mess together. Stylish background music does not help and distracts from any obvious moment. Apart from Boris, some of the other Mexican casts have been dubbed in strange, clips, English monotons, which are memorable in the usage of pornographic films in the late seventeenth century. <br /> <br /> I think Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Ossar' is taken from the idea, but in the last article you will be under severe pressure to find a lot of PO. However, with Boris Karloff there are many good films of cinema, find them and give it a sparkless sperm, unless you want a 'curvature of a shrinking brain'!
