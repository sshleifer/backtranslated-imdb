I went for this movie to believe I had a good rating. First of all, it is ridiculous that they are publishing a film in India in 2008, seven years later in 2001. The movie shows everything dates. Even for 2001 it was made in a shoes string budget. There is a scenario where you can get a low budget by hitting a taxi a person. What does Anthony Hopkins think he is doing in this film? He end up giving a long monologue to the end. The film was a bright spark during this scene, I was sleeping in my seat so I missed it. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hevitt is like a devil. She wears sick clothes and scowls sick kids at random kids. Do not miss the scene that Alec Beldwin is about to meet with Westerner for the first time. What a waste of money! Anthony Hopkins correctly said, "go home and write more well!"
