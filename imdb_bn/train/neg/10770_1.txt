Perhaps there may be potential spoilers (in this movie nothing new or which will not be very gripping for you) <br /> <br /> Why are the things Disney made, why it needs to be reviewed? Surely this is cheaper for them, but after a while, you do not think of overall quality and how to stop thinking about them. The Villains House is a disappointing display of the cartoon crossover, which gives absolutely no idea. In the meantime, there are some signs of total contempt of the previous films: Voice does not match remotely and Yao again becomes evil (since?!) I know that these films are directly to the children, but there was a time when everyone could enjoy Disney Film. Even stunk in the musical numbers of movies (which was Disney's specialty for years). I will not recommend this picture to a very young person. What I can do is, if these movies of the same cable are released more then it is only a matter of little animation studio before it exceeds the overall quality Disney.
