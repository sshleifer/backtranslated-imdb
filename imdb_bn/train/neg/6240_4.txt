I can collect a hint with comments on this thread. <br /> <br /> I want to like this picture that wants to make this video "compulsory" or "compulsory". <br/> <br /> I think it gives us some insight because of this film and the problem within it is so constant. <br /> <br /> For those who want the global warming issue, many applications are forced to "correct" others. This applies especially to more liberal "liberal" people because it is not related to bedroom morality that usually transforms you that wants to force you to "be good". <br /> <br /> Problems with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And that's a very successful one. He can not help himself attract people to whom they want to force others to do so. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, "OK". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how can the environmental movement be hijacked this way?
