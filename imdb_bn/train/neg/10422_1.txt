First of all, I'm not afraid ... I have some other than Phobia, but this movie is absolutely awesome. This is not suitable for children! My face was open all the time, it just pushed me. I could not believe how important it was to children's children, the warriors were cruelly killed! It should be very worrying and unnecessary. I recommend it for more than eight years. But if my mistake was not, I would not have been mentally disappointed as children if there was probably a good movie. I can not believe that a parent will be allowed, let's say, 4-year-old baby to see it. It's just intense and complex, for young kids, do not forget the gory. I deviated for 4 years and I was shocked by the violence. I do not recommend
