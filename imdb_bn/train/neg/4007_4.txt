I hope folks who have coached this logo on their coaches are fired. Some of the letters supporting only the high points, at the end of the season, 3 out of my 5 were killed (and one of them kept it from the perspective). <br /> <br /> The whole storyline is centered around sex, nothing else. Sex with vampire, gay sex with gay vampire, gay sex with vampire directly, vampire blood score, vampire blood, sex vampire sex, vampire sex, american sex, sex because we fear vampires, because we are in vampire Crazy, sex because we just became a vampire, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There was a little more subtle with. There is probably a storyline and then it has some sexual shoehorn. But they did not even bother to do that ... And Anna Paukin is a toxic gaps-tooth bitch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> someone like Sookie interested. Flying off the handle for him he can not control continuously. He gave up for two days and he has already decided that he "is not coming back" and suddenly there is a feeling for the dog? Give me a break. He is not a 25-year-old daughter, not a 14-year-old girl! People close to him are dying of life, and got a smile on his face because he gave his V-card to some people because he could not read his mind? As the main character of the story, I hope the show will do more to understand him and someone will invest in your interest, do not kill anyone who secretly hopes or enter the coma. I can not find anything about his character, and even he can read the mind, that is also incredibly vague and at least not a bit fun. <br /> <br /> I'm not wasting my time watching Season 2. Come June
