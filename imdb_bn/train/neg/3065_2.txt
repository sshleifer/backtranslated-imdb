The movie was made as real, I think. Which is really sad, because at a deep level, the title 'Vanishing Point' is the original, so ironic. I'm not sure that this was done in such a way, but the original was filmed in the 1970s and was released in 1971. The real 'Vanishing Point' was the end of an era which ended in the early 1970's. <br /> <br /> In this rebuild, all counter-cultural elements have been robbed and more PCs have been provided in efforts to reach potentially larger audiences. "Sanitized for your protection" <br /> <br /> Inserting American Indian scenes was unreasonable, and was a tragedy in addition to the concept of 'noble purpose' for travel. I am glad, although I have seen it, but it has appreciated me a lot. The original is a classical and golden. This repetition is horrible.
