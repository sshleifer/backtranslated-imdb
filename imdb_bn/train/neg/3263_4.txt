This is the second British Rank Film to adapt the film to Soberset Mostam's adaptation of the film. But a story from 'quadrilateral' does not travel well in all contemporary ages; And the actor's speech is "clips" perfectly, only the British pre-1950s actors may be distributing. In any case, Trio is harder than the first movie adaptation and feels more cinematic. <br /> <br /> One of the problems that can overcome these two films is that their source material was written 25-30 years ago in movies. As a result, the 1950s Maham (pre-war) popularist "little morality" story seemed fantastic but not a curious curiosity.
