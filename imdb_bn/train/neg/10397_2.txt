I'm not the only expected quality from Morris (love brass eye and blue jam). It's very like a very bad student film. What concerns me, all this is why it was a BAFTA win ??? Morris makes fun of his work (Nathan Barley) 'Enidine Medadoco' (Law Rand) and is still pissed under the back of talented people and is talking about our rainfall! <br /> <br /> I hope he has chosen a subject that I would like to deal with (the humanity of terrorism - four lions) that he is not going to make that cock, this emotional and heavy spun is spoiling the opportunity to make a statement Farce of the mainstream ignorance and opinion of the incident
