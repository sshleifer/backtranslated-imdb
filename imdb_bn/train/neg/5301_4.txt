I bought this movie because it was Shahrukh Khan's first picture. And I also want to see how he will do it. I must say that he is very nice to play his role. In this movie, the goddess Bharti Fantastic. Rishi did excellent work. Sum Sethre is well supported. His role in Alanknath was good. Amishish and Mahishnis were also very good. Dalip was also good in his small role. Acting in a medical movie. Average of the direction The edit is bad. The story is annoying. It tells us about a famous pop singer. She has many female fans. One of them is Kajal. Ravi and Kajol fall in love and get married. The Rabi killed his cousins. Kajol married a widow. Ravi cousin brothers escape from They went to Bombay. He came across the king. He loves her and is married. Ravi returned. The story is predictable. The end is predictable. First half boro. It drags a lot. Protected by actors and music. Second half entertainment. The music is interesting with some nice songs. Although cinematography he is the first half but it seems impossible. Song pictures are "Sohnge Toom Pierre" and lazy except for a rain song. The trick is old. For any of the actors and music, please see Ratings-4/10
