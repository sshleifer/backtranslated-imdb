I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I think this movie can be pretty cool. "Guaranteed to insult everyone!" The trailer said. Well ... it insulted me because this movie is really bad. This is not a comedy because I laugh about the whole movie in about two seconds. And what does this movie do with all gay? I'm not gay and there is no problem with me, but what's the point of adding so many gay-scenes to so-called comedy movies, when these scenes are not funny? I think the director is a refusing man, or something like that. So my advice to you is: If you want to waste good money, rent a good comedy that you already saw. Millions of times, you'd better be than all these lousy comedies to see this mom. It really is a total shit.
