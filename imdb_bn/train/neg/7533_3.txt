The film had some favorable aspects. Probably much for my taste. It seems that the author / director is trying hard to feel the internal conflict of all his letters. Not once, a few times ... but all the time. <br /> <br /> This is not a television, not a movie. <br /> <br /> The location of the train station was well selected and I enjoyed playing as Sassa Hurler's pregnant friend. <br /> <br /> I felt like Justin Clark's performance. His response is compulsory for things, as the director tried to film the sound of the film through its hero's expression. I can not believe that the director can make wonderful Daniela Farinacci in an incredible presence. <br /> <br /> I do not understand the choice of pop music on full signals. This is a lazy device, especially where pop music comes from the diagetic from any place and / or where the song lyrics seem shamefully sincere. <br /> <br /> There is a diverse quality about the image that stimulates Australian heat and local sentiment. It creates an atmosphere of heat and sunlight. Especially with the use of wonderful animation sequences that retrieve the film from the whole mediator, it is inserted with emotions and hand-made glasses. <br /> <br /> I am so interested that why dialogue is so much felt. "Who knows whether there is a god or what we should do like some people sitting in the sky" or whatever line there was. <br /> <br /> In an embarrassing moment, a friend returns home from cricket and announces his wife "I'm going to quit smoking." <br /> <br /> A smoker smoker is a commercial? A Tech Advertising With Some Transparent Animation? I had to go out of the movie in the 50-minute mark - it was too much.
