Weak plot, unlikely car weakness, and helpless fumbling characters. At first I think this movie was made in the seventeenth century, with the quality of the film, the story and drama were taken from the old Kojak episode. When I checked and saw that it was really surprised-97 I was surprised. I have ever seen any of these bad and least (thriller) movies. <br /> <br /> If you read this, please consult, if you see it, you waste time while you can do something more exciting like dry paint drying.
