Well tell me that I've always been a Steven Sigal fan and his movies are generally cool but it does not just measure the rest. My opinion this is too stupid I do not like it at all. The biggest reason I do not like it is because it is very defective and I do not have much knowledge. Acting is very bad, even Steven Sigal is not performing well, I can see the rest of the actors because they only work directly on video movies. It does not follow a direct story that can happen all at once so that does not give much sense to it. There is no action in it, and you usually need it to make an action movie better. Special effects are very bad and you can say fake. So for all this, everyone will have to sign the worst movie so if you want to watch the movie Steven Sigal, then it does not exist unless you rent it. So just avoid this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall score: ** ********** <br /> <br /> * ***** Outside
