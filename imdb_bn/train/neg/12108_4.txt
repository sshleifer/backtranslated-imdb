Just had to write a liner, but it really is. I like gangster rituals and it's the weakest entry I saw in recent years. I have the most important one, praise for everyone involved in most aspects without scripts. This is a weak story about a small criminal. Any amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can be made for a total lack of substances. I love Kevin Spacy and I've heard he'll make another movie about the general. My advice will not waste your time.
