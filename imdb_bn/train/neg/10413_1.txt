There is no reason to watch this movie. If you win and earn a great amount of money and spend your time discovering every pleasure of life and have come to a stage where you will end up lying and get some time to kill (as it happens) then get this movie from the Video Shop If you can find it and laugh with the assistant, then ask for this movie Be prepared, you should be absolutely absolutely played by a wooden actress (actually did not say anything to those who had played the best) Oliver Reid closed her grand carrier through drug game but wait, I have a reason to watch this movie - Claudia Woody There is no other reason than that!
