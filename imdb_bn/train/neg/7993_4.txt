This 'human versus insect / echo-awful' feature is another one. A theme that was popular in the late 70's. Only you can not really call it awesome There are zero mysteries and no horrific events. In other words: This movie is quite hair. It's not really bad or anything; It's just very annoying. A construction site near a hotel uncovers a big horse at the ants. Later we learned, perhaps due to various types of pesticides in the past, their bites became poisonous. It takes ages for some people to bite and reach hospital and tell what is going on in the hospital. Robert Foxworth first mentioned its name and then you can see it with a mining machine for a few hours as you think. Then they were waiting to flee from the house. And, people will have to see what they try to rescue them. I will not loot too much, but at one stage they use a big helicopter. When I saw this, I sat there and said, "Come on, man, you all got shoes, just get out of the building. I am sure insects will not be caught with you." <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Fork in the trash. Fork in the kitchen. Ants on the roof Fork in bedroom. Sink in the sink. And the best part is: When the actors are breathing through the strokes, crawling on the face of the person. But when you see the ants group in large shots, they actually look like the Black Rice set designer glued to the wall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One small surprise was finished. No, there is nothing to do with a turn in the plot. It was Brian Denhey who made a look as a major fireman. What else can I say? This movie is called Loudude Manor IT, but my copy starts reading Box-Art Ents and during the first opening, the title was Panic's Lakewood Manor. There you have it. Now, it's a film made for a movie made of 70, so I'll be very light on my final rating again. Now, Savage Base, another 'man versus insects' TV movie since 1976 was much better than this. I will also go back and see the ANNTs after adding some points to its ratings. Suspense, lack of action, thrills, flashing and emptiness, there is only one thing left behind after you see the ANNTs, an annoying annoying.
