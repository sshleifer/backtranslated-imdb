Guy, like a gay man in New York, I can say with gratitude that I have never seen the underlying scene of Gayle culture portrayed in this film - and I'm happy at it! The film was broadcast on TV in the US, there will be anti-gay reactions and I can not say that I blame them. The people of this movie do not represent the average gay American or even the average trendender Americans, what they represent is mere and nasty nightmares. Obviously clear and less pronounced racist attitudes (anti-white) are frustrating and uncertain - society's blame, unemployment and "cast" in the movie can not be held responsible for the rejection of education. These people's actions are not frustrating, but rather their personal ambition and refusal to do something different.
