Critics of the film will fall in history in the history of confusing the general public in 1999. At first they sent us y shots. Then they expanded the Blair Witch project and now Magnolia is the worst movie of the year. What about this Who knows who knows. Self-engagement loaded with full and bad performance. I always want to stay and see the credit, but when this thing was finished I could not find the movie theater fast enough. Most visitors participating in the viewers I showed in the same way. The dates were debated with each other as well as strangers. This is a ugly and hateful movie that you think would be ugly and hateful.
