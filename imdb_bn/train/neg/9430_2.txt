I was fooled by packaging, too, too. I also read for poor packaging and DVD casing, that "every copy was dragged down from the roof as a sad fate". Although it was cheap ($ 6.99), it was not really worthless - there is no fear, and very limited Gore The end was too sugar and it does not provide punch. I do not really know how it has become "video nasty", how shameful it is! Drag the story, characters obvious amateur actors ... it does not live up to the promise. The DVD bonus feature ("interview") is very strange because the director is very helpless and is not there. The main actress who appeared in Shakespeare's production discussed. This is a great smile.
