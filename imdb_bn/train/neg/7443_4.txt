There was some scary scene, which I always loved more than straightforward, but otherwise the film was rather weak. There were many questions here, and when they tried to explain something in the movie, it was still unclear. I went missing in many ways even after watching this movie. It reminded me of Silent Hill a few years ago. The movie that was unhappy, but was even better because it tried to work and understood the story really. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said above, there were some vague scenes, but otherwise, This movie was a zombie. Sorry, I can not recommend it.
