At the beginning of the movie, beautiful photography and fox scenes were amazing. However, the stories were very slow and annoying. And then the little girl began to foster the jackal, which led to tragedy. We live in the forest, and see Fox frequently. Nobody wants to know that you go wild to make wild animals and enjoy them from a distance. This image is trying to create a wild animal among a pet, who will see it set a scary example of children. I do not know what the story was supposed to be. Even after the terrible events with major Fox, little girl still would like to play with toys. Will he never learn his teachings? And Fox has other scenes featuring predatory animals, which only adds to the children's inflicted trauma watching this movie. What a disappointment this movie is. And that's what a terrific story tells. The final dialogue was so stupid, at that time I and my wife were shouting at the TV! I absolutely hate this movie, and nobody would recommend it!
