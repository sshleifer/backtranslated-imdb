Remember to enjoy a movie in the past that does not fit the same feelings as adults? When I went back to school, national incidents took place. National Lampoon class reunion. The film has a perfect opportunity to smile, but as soon as we get surprised we can collect strange characters that see a woman who sells his soul to Satan and can fire from his mouth, who thinks he is a vampire, and Dressed as a woman, wearing a crazy killer and sack on his head. The president of your class who believes that he is the best thing to eat from the bread (but we see in movies, he is a coward and a joke), a few smokers who do not even know how to reconcile their class, and Gary, a man, who knew that he had existed ( And nobody can remember his name. It's a running joke that I enjoyed.) There is a rough distortion that shakes the woman, the deaf and the blind woman in an inappropriate place, and the dog (you know her from "Ganoos" and "Train from Thro Mama") who loves to keep human plate food in her hand! This movie is mainly about a brown who (then tries at least) to take revenge on her classmate to bring her (she arranged to sleep with her own twin sister!). Movies follow letters, because they search for the murder of the killings, the search for trashed highways in old high schools. Their murderer was told that he thought that his brain was somewhat strange. The film has several good gags that work (mostly starts), but the film gradually becomes worse every minute. The real problem of the film does not really know where to go. The film is mostly a fun one, because it is not guaranteed, if it really does point. Cast is passionate enough, but they do not have the ingredients to make fun only to keep any interest in the quality. This is a queue for fans of the 80s comedy resort fans who have forgotten (this is exactly so).
