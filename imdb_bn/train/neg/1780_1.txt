This movie is so similar to a mother and boy cat that is sexually gay, they are afraid of little cat cats. They get set fire by them. Mother cat kills a man with a backpack on his shoulder back? They are bullets proof. Invisible. And do not The star of the movie, Clovis, police cat, led Clovis to lead the police to find the mother's escape and after killing the mother's copie, Clovis killed her mother and killed her and caught her in the fire. This movie sucks. It was the fun way of way out of terrible, it was not even scary. The girl hit the alien on the camera with the camera, it was a fake. Then she goes and hug her. Then grabs her and begins to rape her. Again, Clovis comes to rescue
