I remember, when Golden children were released in 1986, critics were universally influenced by it and I ended the amazing career of Edmie Morphy, so I think this movie is going to be something <br /> <br /> It's a bad start Where the Buddhist monk goes, knees in front of the child with a blank expression on his face. Bad guy entered the temple. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> br> The bad guys drag the monster bird to the cage and stuck inside the baby inside ... guess? They seem to be taking him to sleep because of Michael Jackson's surprise on the ground, but he still gave the same empty expression, the title of this film would be better than the title of the Flying Child <br /> <br /> The title sequence began and in the 1980's a A pop soundtrack is widely featured as a film. It was obviously cool and awful at times but now it seems to date too much in 2004. Not only but with a slightly bloody opening completely jars In fact, the main problem of this film (and the boy is serious) - the whole mood seems apparently changed from scene to scene so that it sometimes splits together to see scenes of completely different movies. I personally blame the director but it should also be noted that both the scriptwriter and the producer should share the same fault. Before shooting, did anyone know that such a movie would be? It is part of fantasy, part martial arts, part friends movies, part comedy and it's all boring
