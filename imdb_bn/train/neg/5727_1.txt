The only review I did on net is this first review. I felt the need to warn people about this movie because it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. After reading the interview with the director, he said that he respected constructive criticism and so I will try to avoid disappointing the film for him and I will give my opinion why I think it is so disastrous. <br /> <br /> 1. The actor I know that the budget may not have been granted for Thespian, but working with Nicholson for more than ten years, he certainly knew some of the average actors. <br /> <br /> 2. Incredibly crippling and special effects. Again the budget was clearly intervened, which was originally intended, but after working for so many years there really is no excuse. <br /> <br /> 3 The hostel is obvious match. Surely it is not trying to cash off the success of the former movie being a chip off. The only problem is that Roth knew where she was going and how to go there ... <br /> <br /> 4. Music It's not just strange or unsatisfactory in all odd or hunting. <br /> <br /> 5. General script All the dialogue was compulsory and terrible! Also the sub-plot about the theater and the person who comes to save them are weak and often thought-like. <br /> <br /> 6. Edit WTF How well, and not a good way to Nof said, <br /> <br /> I would like to seriously listen to my thoughts on posting. (He has no doubt that his pages are often frequent in IMDB.) Friend ... what do you think. Surely at the time of shooting or editing you have realized that there is a Turkish umbrella in your hand ... sorry, I do not want to be harsh but you have more talent. I hope your next feature is gooder movie or wihitara, hope that progress is made. <br /> <br /> But at the time, avoid it like a plug. I want to return 81 minutes to my interest. (At least I do not pay to see it.)
