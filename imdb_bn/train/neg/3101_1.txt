This rip off of the 1984 hit "Gremlins" is probably the biggest train debris created in a movie. Even for a 'B' grade movie, all the other cheap horror movies in the same platform dwarf this movie entirely in terms of plots, acting and godfearing. <br /> <br /> It starts with a random old security guard and a small punk security guard, whose name is of no importance. Why? After a few minutes of the film, he went to a 'banned' safe place and died while living outside the imagination of being a rock star in a cheap pub. <br /> <br /> This is simply a harmful final major course for skits. The main character, Kevin, struggled several times to prove himself in comparison to total pussy. Probably he was successful in the film, but to the audience he proved himself as something worse than a bad actor. Kevin is getting a job with an old security guard, and his safe transfer (wait for him) is run through abandoned studio lots. Yes why you can use the studio itself when it's bothered to make a set. Return to the film. Kevin somehow banned safe open and released Hobgoblins. Hobboblins emphasize the people to imagine their wildest and then kill them for some reason. They will come back before sunrise or otherwise? OK. <br /> <br /> Kevin's 'macho' military friend Nick, Nick's 'Woman' among other characters, Daphne's character has no ax-abusive behavior and no other substance than prostitution groups. Kevin's manipulute and 'reserve' girlfriend is AMY, whose deepest wish is apparently seen as a bad character - such as blue knuckles with a pair of shoes, topped with fishing stockings. Do not ask me how it works. Perhaps the most entertaining character is KYLE. As friends are making such groups up for the question. Kyle is a distorted crystal that can not go for an hour without self-enthusiasm. In her hobby, call on sex-chat lines from other people's homes, and probably make the underwear soft. <br /> <br /> The story is revealed by searching for heroes for Hiroblis: Knees-high animals (Ur dolls) which, for some reason, try to travel around the local surroundings and travel. Each character eventually finds their wildest fantasy that does not have to be with millions of dollars ... or the movie has a big budget. <br /> <br /> WARNING WITH WARNING: Except watching this movie astonishing "What?". Hobgoblins return them safe ... their own free will. Perhaps they waited for the sunset to lose patience, or perhaps the authors of the author received the hypocrisy and decided not to think about the end. After returning safely, the old security forces published "what they had learned in the army" and exploded explosives, which destroyed safe, ended the end of evil havglin and ended the roller coaster journey. Fit a ride on an escalator. <br /> <br /> This film's cruel badness is enough to send tears. If you plan to watch it, I can think of the fact that for some serious consideration of the film it should already be drinking some alcoholic beverages.
