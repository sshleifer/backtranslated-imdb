In the title role, Bate Middle star starred "Stella", an unbroken Tierjeker. Located in Upstate, New York, Stella Clayer works as a slave in a salon and repeatedly dances to dance. One night, Stallone Dallas, who hates Stella, and starts her neurological treatment during her relationship. She spurns the proposal of both marriage and abortion, sends him an interesting medical career packing, and her daughter raises poverty around herself. Flash-Forward 16 years and the girl has grown into a superb, loving, young girl. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, is still intelligent, but has the care of his daughter? .. I'm angry and still bad, making the movie a little more interesting. Acting and screenplay will make you groan out of almost every scene so ultra-top. The main criminal is Bate Miller, but as his alcoholic friend, John Goodman is behind. Each view seems to be more converting than the previous right, which is actually a hot. Taken as a dramatic piece, this film rates higher than the grade D, but as the camp, it is an unexpected B + score. <br /> <br /> <br />
