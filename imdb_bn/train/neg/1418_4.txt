I do not know why this behavior was never tolerated in movie business! This movie (short) total (at least say)! It is 5-7 year old kids wearing diapers with bigger pins, acting like adults (and more!). However, it is interesting because it is a good example of how "good old days" might not be so good after all! (Thank Allah, we have laws now with this type of material!) <br /> <br /> {This is a short story from the Sheryli Temple Festival}}
