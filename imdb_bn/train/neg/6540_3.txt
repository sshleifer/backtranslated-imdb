I can not believe that this movie is compared to Argentine. His work is far more imaginative and harmful - and much more fun. <br /> <br /> The director does not just have the ability to create real tension. The scene of murder - and face it, this style is not all - interesting. The killer was not hard to guess, and I did not really care when it was released. Cinematography is not memorable, and the acclaimed Gothic atmosphere of the 19th century has not only attracted me. Most of the actors are quite good (especially the headmaster and the poor girl who depend on young students), but they are <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a good awful movie, look elsewhere.
