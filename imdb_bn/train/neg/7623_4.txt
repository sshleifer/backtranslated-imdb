This little show is probably some stupid little prickle / spin off in the original series. <br /> <br /> This show is a complete shit compared to live action series. Live action shows were intelligent jokes and story lines. Although the animated series is basically a ton down bitrsvitt version to digest young viewers, but I think the kids can hate this shit. <br /> <br /> The story of each episode is basically just a few stupid and dull monkeys in Sabrina and she uses magic to fix it. Thats baslly every episode of the idea. Sabrina was the most bizarre episode when using Sabrina to become gem and sorrows magic. So James became a witch and hypnotizes harveryotizes to become his slave. It then started a wicked but rather interesting scene that said, "Now just worship for me" and harvey starts to get down on her hands and knees and kiss her feet like a god shes. (Which is quite accurate as his slave's control slave) but this stupid spin-off time or effort is not worth it.
