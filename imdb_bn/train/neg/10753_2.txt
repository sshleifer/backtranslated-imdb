Dell - "You are the least intelligent person to meet me." <br /> <br /> Kevin- "Well, I had a brain, but they could write again." <br /> <I think I am most excited about the loss of Asimov's work, which is how Susan Calvin's character was portrayed. In books, he was one of the first powerful female heroes, who was able to remember his path through problems. Here he is just waiting to be saved from the power of Will Smith, a daughter of trouble. <br /> <br /> Robotics has received references to Asimov's laws, but they are a concept for CGI and action scenes. <br /> <br /> Smith is preferred, because he is in most of his movies, but really, the story is not good. You figure it out before many years before this genius character.
