Oliver Garner Jackson played as a student of a foreign exchange college and was handed out alone and wiped out this ridiculous and racist film with a Mexican street gang, which is so ridiculous that it is ridiculous. Bad acting, bad conspiracy and bad war dancing photography make Angel Turkey a Turkey.
