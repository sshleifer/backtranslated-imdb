I searched the video store everywhere to find this movie, I'm getting a huge Elvis fan, and I found it a huge disappointment. Most of the cartridge Russell's "Elvis Patch" was down and the voice was great, but the voice of the song in Elvis did not work for me. It always worsens me because the voice always does not match with the face of the russels, and it was difficult for me to lose the plot. Also, there are many confusing differences in the film, those who do not know much about Elvis may possibly have their information. The songs sang songs compared to the previous lives. While his first guitar was wrong, I'm sure his brother Jassaar Gauron was buried in an ornamental grave, not a huge heststone, Jesus Garnon. I know it was just a TV movie, but they avoided important events such as back-back-specials and dragged some scenes in a very long way. If you want to see a good movie that shows Elvis his main renter, it's the way it is, or another LV concert. Seeing and seeing the real Loves preform is the only way to truly see its talents. (Brilliant statement I know, but still ... go out and hire good Elvis Flick.)
