The picture is severely terrible and rape victims are raped. Sponsored, it can be a brave movie about rape, but if you dig down the surface, there is no positive message about rape. Aishwarya is shown to be a helpless victim of rape, who can not cope with all because she is a woman. He needs a man to help him. When the society creates a jiban about him and comments on his comments, he does not stand for himself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The key to be more effective Could portray a powerful woman, who bravely rebelled against her enemies. The director is famous for being chauvinistic. His films are usually filled with weaker women, but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. This role is to be learned because it is controversial, that does not mean that the character is strong. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating scenes in this movie are when it cleanses itself after the rape after the conspiracy. She makes her father happy that she is now dirty. Though Shah Shahbagh accuses him of such a great deal of rape against rape victims, he does not show us that it is commendable that whether Esha's father was wrong for doing so to his daughter. In this way we have given a confusing message about rape. <br /> <br /> There is no need of comedy in such a strong subject. Even more, the comedy is not simply funny. Ashil kapoor does nothing except his wood in his role. The music is medium without title track, which is beautifully portrayed (the only bright point of this movie). The role of Sonali Bendre is frustrating and vain. Overall, what might be a great movie to remember is that it is going to be a horribly mixed-mash that gives serious audacity to some viewers.
