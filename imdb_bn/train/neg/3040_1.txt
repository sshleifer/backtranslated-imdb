With the title like this you know you get a lot of junk Bad acting The script is bad. The director is bad. Grammar is bad <br /> <br /> The movie creates a lot of noise that is not really music and many people shout. Make the movie a bad ethnic stereotype. Why does every movie with black heroes addiction? Why would heroes always be successful to dance? Why would the famous rapper always be in the dance movie? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, do not selfish and do not see.
