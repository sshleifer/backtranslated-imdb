Vedka Lemon is a delightful, yet extremely disrespectful Armenian film that will enjoy and encourage others. Although reasonably well-formed, the film lacks a real "jing", rather in many scenes it will seem ordinary to the industry-oriented industry. The film is only in the few moments of light of the movie, unfortunately, they deserve a talented film. Being too dark to be a dark comedy and stirred to be a serious drama, Vedka Leman would be very heretical and eventually displeased. You can laugh, but these moments of snow-filled natural landscapes will be a little bit far away in the middle of the ocean and slightly distant bus roads. A great effort, finally completed by lack of narrative coordination.
