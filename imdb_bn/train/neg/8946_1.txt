I think shots and light were very poor. When I first saw it, it seems to be an old version (1956). I was shocked when I found the real year of the real movie. I do not know that a bad movie can be made recently. Thats I really wanted to say. However, there was a good plot in this film, but if you could not read the novel that was written only by George Orwell, you could not miss it. I really want to say that with the exception of this it has already been said: I can not believe that this film is probably the most rewarding and nomination. I gave this movie a horrible, because I thought it was very bad. All that is good So long
