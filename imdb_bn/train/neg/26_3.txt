I will always reject this title because it will not be finished publishing strongly on the video. You are well, well executed movie, that is not bored either. I saw this last night at the AFI Dallas, and I left the remaining 20 minutes, because I did not take care anymore (about the plot, not to insult the manager ... it's not painful). When you can only film 5 minutes (a shot out, a shot is snatched before the shot explosion ... and then the window breaks with the first shot), then everything is getting worse. Let's just say that these things are just a guide ... unfortunately <br /> <br /> I'll give you all the details, but it's sub-par in every way, even half-ass acting when you Hopefully half-donkeys are acting while frustrating by Michael Maden. And the scene of rape ... Christ! "Stop and take it" should not be used in a rape scene. <br /> <br /> 3/10
