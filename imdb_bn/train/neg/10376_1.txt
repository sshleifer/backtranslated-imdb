I have seen this movie at a pre-release screening in Beverly Hills' Writers Guild Theater. I think the producer and director of the film was present, perhaps to strengthen our response. <br /> <br /> Many scenes stirred laughter from viewers, if it was a comedy but it was great. It was supposed to be a horror film. <br /> <br /> If the audience is not scared, it seems that the filmmakers were there. They are delayed for release for a year. From curiosity I can see again whether they will cut it again; As far as I can tell, they were not. It was one year old same movie. <br /> <br /> It's almost "bad, it's good" but it's slow and annoying.
