The main clayation Rudolph: very good. Original Frosty Cartoon: Need a little work, but may be bad. But Frosty and Rudolph together on July 4th? Come on! Give me a break !!! It was a movie that should not have been made. It was bad. Especially a holiday is not specifically for any holiday, except on July 4th. It was particularly bad because Frosty and Rudolph generally associated with the Christmas season. And no movie can be destroyed by singing too much. Frequent songs The film seems to be much more than this. The film attempts to mix two familiar Chirstmastime characters with American American Traditional Holidays (which seems to be "limited" in America), with many pointless songs and a shy platoon. The result? A bad movie which can not really be seen at any time of the year. I would suggest you to leave this movie even if you prefer Frosty and Rudolph.
