I did not see the whole movie. I could not see the whole movie. I stopped the DVD for half an hour and I think that someone trying to look at himself stopped before accepting the case's case. <br /> <br /> I like both mafia movies as both adventurous and ridiculous but Corky Romano Cans will only be described as a tragedy in a Mafia comedy. <br /> <br /> The problem is that Curky Romano is just trying hard to smile at the audience, this plot seems to be an excuse for the removal of Chris Katan (Korki). From one scene to another. The Corky fully expresses itself and lacks the reliability or credibility - all his strange methods are transformed - instead of taking the role of Chris Kattan, 'Acting' - rather than taking the role - it raises you beyond the story. Every scene is completely predictable, it is clear that each scene is launched as soon as it is 'comedic event'. As a threat due to the role of character Mr. Beyonc√© comedy is fun because you can express feelings with letter motivation and initial event, and the situation of the character is not telegraphy. However, Corky thinks he is deliberately making a great effort to draw a humor from the audience. <br /> <br /> If Chris does not play such an alien character (who really does not connect to other characters) and whose behavior is completely unavailable (without trying to smile) and comedy scenes were not so much expected and stereotyped - all jokes Much more known) this movie was worth a visit. But it's not. Do not see it.
