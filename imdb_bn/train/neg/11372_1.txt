I've been using IMDB for a few years and I never wanted to be involved in movies ?? until now. There are so many problems in this documentary that I know little about what I want to say. I'm not a Muslim, nor am I an Islamic Studies expert, but I know that this documentary is enough to focus on a clear unilateral viewpoint. <br /> <br /> The problems of this movie are actually starting with a documentary. Most of the documentary that I saw anchors around some valid points and then surrounded those points with controversial explanations and wrong information. It is of course in the case of Islam: what the West needs to know. Yes, fundamentalists around the world and some of them are Muslims, but basically confusing to create a documentary about Islamic Islam, a number of Islamists. This is a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing else. <br /> <br /> Here are a number of points that can be helpful for those who want to find some of the issues raised by this documentary more neutral. <br /> <br /> Something about the documentary was not positive. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on the Middle East, but more Muslims live outside the region. More Muslims live in China, believe in Saudi Arabia or not. About 40% of Muslims live in Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Indonesia. <br /> <br /> The translation of the Quran used in the documentary is a question. I saw the documentary while watching another translation and the difference was interesting. I have been warned about the translation that the documentary is using and now I know why. Surah 98: 6 is a good example. The documentary indicates that the Surah says that the unbelievers will go to hell. But instead I read this translation: "Those who reject the truth between the books and the polytheists will go to hell." The difference is that those who reject the truth are those who know about Allah and the truth of Allah and decide to reject it anyway. <br /> <br /> The movie mentions that there is no morality in Islam, but it is not true. Although it is true that a lot has come from the Qur'an and Hadith, Islam recognizes a concept named 'Uruf' or 'ideological behavior'. Clearly how the ideology can be interpreted in many ways, but 'Urafti' can be a "good" behavior, an average person will consider right or wrong. <br /> <br /> Documentary Sharia (Islamic law) represents. Following all the Muslims, as a unified body of knowledge. This is not just true. There are many Islamic schools in the law and they explain the law from progressive and modernist to fundamentalists. <br /> <br /> Hadith tradition is the same. There are thousands of hadiths and each school accepts some of the laws and refuses others. Using a hadith without serious occupation to determine which is correct, practical and applicable, what do you want to say chooses the citations in appropriate history and select quote? Which has been documentary. <br /> <br /> I hope people realize that fundamentalism is not Islam, not any other religion. Christians have abortion clinics and so shoot fundamentalists. I know it is not like a suicide bomber, but only the problem of fundamentalism is understood. If you think you have the answers, then everyone else will be wrong. But if you think you have any answers, you can work together with the opinions of others, whether politics, religion, God or whatever.
