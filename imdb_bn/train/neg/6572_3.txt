In my opinion, the title of this film should be changed from "just brave" to "everything else". I went to the screening a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the results. Acting in some parts of the film - most of the time, a film director of 442nd male - is a subject for acting in the film industry, which I am grateful to most of the movies. Mark Dacosos, Tamil Tumita, and Jason Scott Lee's performance were all great. However, the director was never supposed to put himself as the main character in the movie itself. Sorry Lane, you're not just a movie actor. You're well-versed in the stereo-theater. The actress of Gina Hirajumi was also awesome in this film. She should not have had a conversation role and her appearance was misquotable to Miss Miss Queen. In the film there were other young actresses who were naturally beautiful and whose performance was extraordinary ... why they were not thrown for that role? Another big problem with this photo was its verb sequence. Japanese-American soldiers do not think they are fighting against German soldiers ... let alone be alone. It was a low budget feature, but it was a war-based movie, is not it really important to show some war? This image was an appropriate effort, but definitely not a major distribution price.
