I was really frustrated with this film. The first Waters movie I saw was Serial Mom and I liked it. Then I saw Pecker and I liked it. Then I saw the polyester and really hate it hated. What I like about that movie was the Divine. He / she had many hell in the talent. I was really surprised. Absolutely, I would not recommend this picture ...
