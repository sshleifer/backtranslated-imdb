The original show was so much better. They should give up on a good note. Kill the whole idea of ​​this movie. It was too far to reduce annoying, too dramatic, and funny parts. This movie really seems like it is trying very hard to get serious and that certainly I did not want to do with this seagull. Not to mention, that for a long time it was boring again about the same thing. So, sorry, Tyler Perry, but the next time hard try. This movie is just dust, and that is not funny. Sorry 4/10 They have it <br /> <br /> J Edison
