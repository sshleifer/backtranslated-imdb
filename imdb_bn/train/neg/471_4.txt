A barbarous "Missisfis in the Army" singer, who strives to try both semi-heartfelt surreal (foreign subtitles) and vulgar (flatulence gags), but ultimately a mixture of many different types of comedies, ends very successfully among them. Bond Girl Barber's Bach, from "Spy Who Loved Me", has only two or three short scenes. What a waste! (* 1/2)
