This film demands another bad review. Consider a critic that the qualities of this movie are appreciated, which includes 'no gender, violence or violence'. Oh, forgive me. The very set-up of the movie is watching us as Kady's young comrade, with the love of life and for whom there is everything to survive, having a stupid, bloody body, leaving the cd and biting it. And, about the nature of the war, we know that codei has seen horror almost every day. For those who watch this movie with these pink glasses, so much so that the code that defines Cody's personality is removed from the audience memories. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Traveling a long way to the United States of America at some places, known as Nevada City. There is no mention, it is clear that the codei does not realize the product is damaged. We know that his CEO effectively declares him so that he directs to keep Kodi away from "some of the death" and order the destruction of war. This explains that, as anyone seems to notice or care, the obvious 'plane' effect of codei. It's not bad acting. This is the flat effect of post-traumatic stress disorder. It can not be guessed here, remember that his CO ordered him from the battlefield. <br /> <br /> The 'accidental kiss' as mentioned by another review. Fall was an accident, there was no kiss. How well did Cody know about how he spoke with respect to faith by hitting on him? Now that a family had invaluable moments. One moment that was immediately announced to the universe as it was posted on YouTube. Of course, as well as the status of faith, Cody has come to 'plan' for a wedding with someone else, constantly getting the spirit of the season, everyone cheating their hearts and lips <br /> <br /> <br /> No one knows little about faith Except he expresses his love, he does not take much time to accept his proposal (rather than wait for second thought), he is generous, he The death of a loved person, there's nothing really against his family, he believes that the marriage did not discuss the basis of consensus, and the post-wedding plans. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, codei. And 'Brother's Band' lecture where the phrase was most not intended to appeal to the virtual strangers of the battlefield. <br /> <br /> The following line: This film is cotton candy chromus lungs which believe in the main way. . Cody's disrespect for belief by physically his completely intelligent hit when most of the fairly called for it is called. By redefining the family we know it as intelligent: to take virtual stranger as a full-fledged member of the family, because we all love you 'love'. You know how many people have done or who did this. No
