I miss the start of this movie, which may not be what I like so much. On the other hand, I've studied the fall of the Roman Republic for many years, so I know the story. Then again, for this reason I dislike this picture. <br /> <br /> The picture is more historic than the extra cost. Although it is so wrong that I do not think they have made an attempt to correct it, in this case it can be forgiven. The strange thing is that they sometimes go towards a huge length to become historically accurate, which becomes confusing. Antivirus was about to throw in the marriage, and then tried to remove two scenes later. Even if it does not make any plans for the plot and even if Octavia does not meet, why should it also be brought? And in some scenes, Antonian calls his real name (Marcus Anthonyus) and his strange English name Marc Antony in other scenes. <br /> <br /> Apart from historical mistakes, the film was still an entertainment watch, it was not for the leading lady. There is no ounce of dignity in him. He is violent, dramatic, and completely lacking in self control. Instead of a clever and composed Queen Cleopatra, a bad case of PMS becomes a shocking teen. Of this, 95% comes from poor performance, but even 5% write poor scripts. Yet many stupid dramatic scenes are written in the script. Sometimes you are not seen in Antoine and Cleopatra, you are watching Dawson's cricketer Dawson and Joey's incomplete editions. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something about this time, see ....
