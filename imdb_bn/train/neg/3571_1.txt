Super Box B Cinema Actress This box office bomber is part of another bit as the future of the "GoodFellas" star Ray Leota. He played Marion, the only line in the dialogue is, well, a word in the dialog. He shouted, "Joe!" The verdict of the verdict is violative of Zodoras with plastic hanger Hole Sprinter. This movie is so bad although it gets fun, sometimes ridiculous. Mystery Science Theater 3000 will love this! See Pia's nervous breakdown and all specs editing and effects to try to show how bad Pierre's character has been seen, and finally see violent scenes. Pia played an aspiring Hollywood screenplay. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yes right Pia can only speak, write alone! This stupid role of Pia is perfect and absolutely miscast. But who? The original star is Annen's hot and fresh majesty in his bit part of this cat's opinion! Rock on the majesty!
