I absolutely hate this program, what kind of people sit and see this garbage ?? OK my dad and mother love it lol but I'm pretty sure from the room before I come to it. This is very sad and horrible, but the worst thing about it is that intelligence programs like detective programs can not stand because the detectives are so hard and heartless. What happened to the detective program with real mystery ??? I mean, we want to know what happened to those imaginative characters, we did not know anything that died more than 20 years ago ??? I want BBC to place more comedy on BBC1 now, there are many more places to end with WB's vicar.
