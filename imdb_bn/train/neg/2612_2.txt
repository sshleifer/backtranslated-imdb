Only 101 Dalmatians have nominated for the original song and the costume design for the Oscars. I must admit that I was less than this picture. In this continuation, Crubella Deville (this role closes well with Glen's closure) was released to the hospital due to his good behavior. He likes all kinds of creatures and all his furs lock away. From that point on, we only wait until the crisis starts. Very soon, she tries to make the best coat of fashion in fashion, from herself and fine Dalmatian fur. Along with Glenn Closure, I narrated all very silly but found out from the eye of a baby's eye. It is enough to target that its target market, I guess, children under 12 years old. Good entertainment for the children and the family, but did not do much for me. * Out of *****
