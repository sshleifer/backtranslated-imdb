Unfortunately, it has been shown in Star movies in Thailand last week. It's acting in full junk. Another member said that this film is a good example of how 'do not work'. I did not see a movie played so long bad. Actors (You Can Say Their 'Actors'?) Completely flat and can provide their line with a dead dog passion. I would say that you will see the film to understand how bad the act is ... but it will be like torture. <br /> <br /> I supply her line as the main female, and the left of the net with their pronunciation (fake or contrived) is equally shocking. Another actress with fake British accent was fantastic, yes, but his utterance to the Lord was terrible. Mix that with his (acting) lack and you have a disaster. She just did not say anything and I could take her as a beautiful girl. Oh my, we saw the scene where the lover of the main lady said, "Really I?" A forced tears from her after the scene. Ridiculous No, really, I just laughed ambitious. <br /> <br /> Set and art directors please save some pictures for the photo. Some color sets and some scenes are rather beautiful (actor minus). <br /> <br /> The old magic Potion lady? What ?! Another member mentioned the 'modern' love song in this picture. Completely inappropriate for a time piece set about 500 years ago. <br /> <br /> I was considered as the 'Biggest budget' in Thailand during its production time. If I were the producer of this movie then I would be very annoyed. Not only does the meaning that the meaning does not necessarily make a good (or even medieval) film. <br /> <br /> I will give King Maker 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets thus save the film and a rating. 10 out of 2
