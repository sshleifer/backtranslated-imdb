It was just awful that the plot was okay, but the rest were bad. I mean the dolls come and then they even try to make the movie digital even worse that it is! Usually I want a low-budget movie but it was just a waste of time and it was about to return the set that came about. I have a movie set of ten low budget films like 6-8 films and I would say it's the worst movie of all. The term is also closed and they use a fake plastic matte which can not look like a reality, they can use one which can even be seen even closer to the real, so that you save time and money and can not see horror movies.
