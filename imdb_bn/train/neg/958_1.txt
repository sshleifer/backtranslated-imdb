How does it become a blockbuster? Dear God, I do not know why this movie sucks too much. The film was predictable and there was no originality. The only thing I can appreciate is to play some characters. The movies were very bright, they should do something with the light, for example. Make the environment even more intense. This movie, made on certain dead characters, has been shown to be a horror of 1970s. This 2006! People are not afraid of heavy heavy clothing. Most of the horror scenes we take from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total Rip off! This is why I do not see the taglog movie. The only reason being that many people are "in shock" in line with the purchase of this movie. How often do we have to copy the scenes from the ring and instead of getting the girl out of the TV, coming from the window next to it? No matter how you keep it, it's still close to a rifle.
