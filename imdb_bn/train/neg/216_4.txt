I do not like the love as the image is sick. Finally, this picture expresses Alex, Kick, Sandu's sexual relationship. Their triangle love was full of intensity, frustration and jealousy, until finally Alex got up and realized that they did not have any results. The future was sad. <br /> <br /> Director Tedur Giorgiu watched the film together with us, at the AMC Theater from 12am to 8/10/06, Sunday. After the film, he told the audience that the purpose of creating this film for the purpose of revealing Romania's sexual relationship was complex. <br /> <br /> Sex life in my perspective is always complicated everywhere. Do not feel any special impression and impact from the movie. In the context of Alex and Kiki's love, and the story surrounding the next side of Kiki and his brother Sandu. <br /> <br /> I do not like this movie, the two main reasons are: First, the movie was not told how they fell in love? After Alex entered the building in Kiki's house, it seems that, then the two girls fall in love. It does not always take place at all. How would a girl be in love with a girl instead of another girl. Too many pieces, you need the images and connect those stories by your mind. Secondly, Alex and Kick did not have sex scenes in the whole film, what were I waiting for? However, it still deserves some part of the recommendation. Part of "ear piercing" was kind of interesting. To understand the love of kick, Alex agreed to bear pain due to piercing. This is a touchy scene that gives you a little idea of ​​their love. Also, they were lying on the football field, their expression of expression revealed truthful and enthusiastic.
