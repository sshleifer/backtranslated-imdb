I think so well titles. To me, it was the Flora Robson film that supported the role of Olivier and Vivienne Leigh. And Vincent had his voice behind Messi's voice. Good Flora Robson was great. The next signature will be "Pickering 55 Days" for me. With the same role but also various rich gown And the same voice. As Armada it was a subtext. I like black and white pictures. What was all done at night at Elizabeth? It was difficult to fathom conversations and at times. I could not say what was the love interest. Was it Spaniard or Vivian Leigh? And I do not believe that Elizabeth I want to be a bright strategist that fire ships will be sent against the armaments. Apparently it worked for empire, but not for the script. It may be historically more accurate, but Bate Davis had more attractive scripts. And I miss the light of the day!
