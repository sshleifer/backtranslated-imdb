I believe in the theology taught by a Christian who is generally left Behind. That's saying, I'm left behind Behind the worst movie I've seen in some time <br /> <br /> There is a good movie, you must have a well-written playback. Fall back woefully short on this. One thing, it basically deviates from the book. Sometimes it is done to compress the 400-page novel in two hours of film, but in this film I see a change that does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Another thing, develop zero letters. When the characters in the story are saved (which I will not say), the book makes it clear that it is a long, soul-searching process. It is fast and artificial in the film. The book is well-written, where people like Rifford Steel, Bak Williams and Hattie Durham seem to be real, but the film scene is consistently given quick treatment without any significant. In another scenario where one character gets angry about the backing (again, I will not say who), it seems artificial. <br /> <br /> I dislike this reputation that it is unified for me, but I can not recommend a good conscience to a movie which I think was horrific. Perhaps the first book was good to be made in 2-3 films. In any way, Christians must understand that filmmakers should take seriously, we need to start filming them together with a quality. I went through many effort attempts probably left Behind, but the way I see it.
