Try it hard (it's not a review of good intentions, it's about final product), this movie is badly written, moderate, and poorly operated. The story was probably possible, but that story is not present anywhere in this film. <br /> <br /> Clara Barton was a man. He was feeling like ours, desires, love, pain, embarrassment, weakness and self-confidence. You do not have to know that actress's performance from this film. Actually applies to each character of the film, but in the case of Barton: each sentence is a lecture. An epic on top lecture though from an inhuman robot. Actually the only scene that played at the board meeting, and I realized that he is giving a speech! His idea is incredible in his context, and he comes up with ideas that the words live vigorously while searching. For example, when he sees a wounded man, he will become worried about the needs of the battlefield and protect the soldiers and blow the white flag etc. There is no way to act in the movie that he is thinking of such details in a good second, Concluding <br /> <br />, this film robs Clara Barton of his struggle. It spoils its humanity, and it spontaneously makes everything cheaper, because the script is written in the clich√©s. The author does not know Clara Burton, and thinks his encyclopedia is written in Britain. (Yes they were back then who were) but, excellent technicolor! (Care)
