For half an hour or more, I think of myself: "Hey, Bill Reben's best success can never be good!" The surplus sequences have atmospheric, there are some scary moments to enjoy and our director even refers to his own infamous stinker "Attack of the Giant Spider" in a playful way. William Cassell's "Hunt for Mounted Heel" was stolen shamefully, three old and very annoying millionaires won $ 1,000,000 to eliminate nine people in an isolated palace. Naturally, participants begin to disappear rapidly and after one and the other greedy bones take too long before they realize that old people are sad ... or there is another murderer among them. The film begins and starts with a weird narrator with many intelligent things that are not relevant to the plot or even interesting, but in the first ten minutes there is some nice T & A for the sake of praise and that fool Bumble (Shelley, I believe I am told that he is called) is really enjoyable. After the first half an hour, naturally it would be inevitable and "cold" would become a textbook rebhen-production, which would be a closed plot twist, catastrophic conversations and a total lack of tension. There was no budget for bloody murder sequences, but many of our talented directors (?) Tried to compensate for an endless footage of disco dancing girls and an amateur rock band. The film has four or even five different climaxes and none of them is a little bit satisfactory. Maybe it was an inspiration for the LOTR: the king returned? Avoid this picture, you'll be long and happy.
