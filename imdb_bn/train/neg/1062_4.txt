Seek! To sit through this one was a little painful. It has a cute and fun premise, but it goes from all to hell. Matthew Modin is almost always pedestrian and annoying, and he is not disappointed in this one. Deborah Who Engender and John Neville were surprisingly well-off performances. Alan Betts and Jennifer Tilly, among others, were at the top. I know how the parts were written, and it is hard to blame the author when the script and the director make those sculptures. If you're taking disreputable characters, it's okay, but you have to have good content to do its job. It was not here. If possible, run away from screaming from this movie.
