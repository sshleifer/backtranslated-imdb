(David H. Steinberg) had some real smart points at the beginning of the script which could create a romantic comedy, but, dear, dear! How ever happen ??? !!!! <br /> <br /> I'll tell you what has happened. Basically it is (Animal House - 1978) and (Pokers - 1982). Although it was a long time ago, but the new generation of new generation of watfathers: Crude Teen Comedy Then came 1990's. The important events are such as destructive hits (I am addictive), (Problem Children - 1990), (Doom and Dr. Master - 1994), (The Newtie Professor - 1996), and (there is something about Mary - 1998) that I did. It seems that slackers are influenced, the era of the era and the era of the Prophet was the only one, and only: (American pie - 1999) which is undoubtedly impossible and the icon of a section. Then I think that every such comedy can be highly brutal, or not loaded by the nasty, young man otherwise it can be fashion! <br /> <br /> I believe that (the slayers) was a smart plot as the first script, its makers had to add some real amount of: irrationality, dirtyness, creating curiously shameless sexual relationships - that day - easy as pie! They like to fill each scene with the release elements like: masturbation, oral sex, urine .. etc just to see a la mode. They are totally unnecessary elements of the story, but of course, they can find the latest trend in making and making teen comedies for profit. How the problem has already been replaced by a potential comedy <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, The appearance and performance of it all (Jason Schwartzman); Memorablely very hateful. So ambition did not change from the creation of what was done before that romantic comedy from pure shiny images. Be more like a horror where you ask all the time; What would be atheist? (Flip, farting, .. etc); <br /> <br /> If you hate, you have to love something (mostly to be brave), for me it was only a scene from Gina Garrison Camio. However, they were fully designed to achieve untimely misery as adolescents. Although most of it was close to someone's nightmare. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Remember the details of the theft of thieves (the first 2 minutes), remember the original plot of the film (the girl loves the girl and the girl loves another boy) (the cold boys are trying to blackmail a girl by trying to reach a girl) because it is a candidly schllock Nothing except. It will work hard to mess with the dirty college boys with its ingredients, who make nothing but nothing out of making mawkish quip. It's ending up, and I'm sorry to say it, a sunny sh * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> impostor or slack win, like this comedy itself completely. It sounds perfectly good for another good movie; Which can make my opinion about me as a smart one .. once! And these filmmakers are not really needed to realize understanding real slackers! Maybe to be stupid is a way to be smart in Hollywood, but even if .. The ultimate result here is that the word was not least malicious by any sense. PS: Its Script Writer (David H. Steinberg), who wrote the story of America's pie 2, has a main page in his IMDB where you have the "extra details" of his usual "plot keyword": sex / Indecent / strange humor / ... 70-year-old women have forgotten to write urinin only during shaving or baring!
