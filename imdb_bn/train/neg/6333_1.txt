I actually saw this movie in a theater. As soon as I handed my money to the cashier, she said, "I have never heard before or after a theater:" There is no return! " As soon as I heard this word, I just waved my cash bye-wed and should go home. But no, fool, I went and saw the movie. Do not make any of this movie theater smile. Not even once. Not even curious! Mostly, we sat in silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone "SUCKKS THIS MOVIE!" Shout! The audience will worship enthusiastically, then there will be stupid silence silent for ten more minutes there.
