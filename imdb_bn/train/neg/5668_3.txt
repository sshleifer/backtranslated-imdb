First off - there is no flirting in this movie - with Anthony or anyone else. These people do not flirt - they just do it. The first test of patience is to overcome more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual disturbances. It will not be too bad - Hell, I like the violence and distortion as the next critics, but without reference to it in context, it's annoying. So you put it through torture and illusion. Then we see Donna and the film turns everything together - not good - just different: road pictures without heart. Lum's efforts to thank Comody's comedy - Broadly written and broadly, have acted extensively, such as Judy Tennata and Mink Chor (and a few hookers and drag queen). They all deserve it well. Photography is deliberate incentive, so if you get speed sickness (or really some kind of illness) - this flick is not for you. Come to think, I'm not sure that this Flickr is like gay and bi-sexual S & M fans who like bad script, badly Indian films about themselves.
