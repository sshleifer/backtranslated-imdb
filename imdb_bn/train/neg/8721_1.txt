I'm sorry but this is just the background. The little girl was a brat, they had no enjoyable characters and sucked the plot. Besides, the film wanted to believe us, but it was not a gate. If you examine any complete guide to reptiles, it's actually a crocodile, it's not a gator. Obviously they would not hire a real animal expert or they would know that animals have a croc This is a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the end. I almost fell asleep with this one.
