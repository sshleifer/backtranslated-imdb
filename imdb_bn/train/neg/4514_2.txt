The problem with the book, "A Gisher Memoir" It was the Japanese surface but below the surface it was the way to think of an American people. This book is like a nice ballot to read, which is still wearing beautiful clothes, sets and clothes, dresses that are dressed in a dress dress? Later letters were intact from Japanese thought. <br /> <br /> is not about Japan or the real GISH This is a misconception of some American men about Japan and Geisha is a story filtered through their own ignorance and misconceptions. So this movie is not Japan or Gaisha? Such true fantasy is so many people? Yes, but why is it made in an American fantasy? <br /> <br /> There was a lot missed opportunity. Imagine a culture where there is no old hand-up, there is no sense of sin in sex. Gender is natural and natural. How sex is handled in this movie? Right It's like dirty. The closest thing to the movie's scenes is that Saariyah trembles his nose and is stuck for five seconds, so that people are trying to mount him, he has a little bit of cockroaches in his car. <br /> <br /> Does anyone actually enjoy sex in this movie? No One character is considered to be superb, but all of what he sees is pushing his lover because he does not want to do some dirty work. There is no place for ordinary American puertinism in this film about Japanese jiisha. <br /> <br /> After taking her cherry auction, did seuree enjoy the first fool of his old codger? No She is located in a grain block of meat like a cold slab. Of course he is not supposed to enjoy it. And this is what I mean about this movie. Why they could not enjoy anything? Why should all sex be sinners and wrong? <br /> <br /> Mahea was the secret sponsor of Chairman Saeedi, and as such she was behind her virginity auction. He could be auctioned auction and won himself. Nobu is not even bidding. So why did the chairman have to win that old codear and look back at the old man's cribs, get his fingers on his naked body? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Chairman Sayedee Gaisa has borrowed loans for training. To pay the loan, Dr. Saiful Sell ​​Crab. Through Mamrah, the chairman sold Saeedi's sex talent to the old Gijar so that the chairman could earn some money from him. The chairman was not his sponsor. He was his pump! Some romantic love stories Yes, this picture is quite beautiful but it's like the beauty of a very attractive, alluring transvestite, whose voice, appearance and every touch are thrilling. But that is very sinister lie under the very feminine surface lies. Under the film's wrong-looking Japanese page, the heart, soul, soul and core of this movie are completely hidden in the American secret and mysterious secret. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> refined, elegant simplicity. MOAG style ?? Peking Opera <br /> <br /> Japanese ji ?? Hair soup up Moag Gius ?? The white hair thick paste must have all the awkward hairy hairs. <br /> <br /> Japanese Shampoo Ice - Japanese are rigid about seasonal celebrations. Sheve ice is strictly a summer behavior. MOAG Shampoo Snow - Chain of Chairman Chiyo, performed by the gorgeous Suzuka Ohgo, bought this behavior during the young Sai, cherry-flower-watching season. Thought to shiver my whole body with colds. <br /> <br /> Japanese jing ?? Trained and skilled entertainers. MOAG Gaisha - sluts <br /> <br /> Japanese Wind Chamber - Used in the summer because it sounds to the word, thanks to the air, Japanese people feel a little cooler. MOAG wind chamber - a door bell! If a person stands in front of another's house and makes a noise with the wind storm, he will be considered as crazy, will not enter. <br /> <br /> Japan ?? Human relationships, emphasis on group-based. MOAG ?? "I want a life that is my" American personality. <br /> <br /> Japanese traditional dance ?? Refurbished elegance A nearly geometrical and mechanical precision. MOAG dancing ?? Wearing Marth Graham on LSD while wearing an extraordinary white Japanese funeral dresses. Performed by a geisha down a star in a place like a strip club? Ha ha ha A strip club where they worked on most of Gisara's studies? <br /> <br /> Japan's house fire ?? It is worse than putting out fire-fighting or even firing, because it poses a horrific threat to the community. The woods, cities, and cities of the woods destroyed hundreds or thousands of homes and could kill many people. MOAG house fire - There is great addition to a battle scene but there are zero ramifications and it does not need invisible reason to control the need to put yourself out of the fire. Technically, the film ended here because the Sairei was rarely stabilized and never heard again with his sister. Both Arthur Golden and Rob Marshall should be exiled <br /> <br /> <br /> Enough. Movie stinks.
