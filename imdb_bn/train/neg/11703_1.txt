You will notice that the chemists, who appear in both scenes and can speak, are played by Stephen King. The standard thing to say is "do not give up on your day job", but it's not fair. Raja married himself right: he is worse than any other cast member, and the best one. On the other hand, the story is pure garbage. Please, leave your day work. <br /> <br /> I have never seen such a terrific performance - in which the main actor (Lead ACTOR's!) is probably the worst - gathered together in a movie. Everyone works strictly, but not in a recreational way; They all manage to go all-around without any expense, or exposure, without power. I blame the screen writer / director Tom Holland. It's not that all actors really can be bad at this. What is the opposite of that? Confession, I have never heard of them before, but still, I do not think that I can walk in a talent organization, and if I tried, I could go with a very bad performer: Despite my best efforts an actor turned out to have talent out there. So what's more likely - Tom Holland has a dozen snake eyes, or he wrote a lousy script and then it pointed out weak? This image will explain why the script is bad due to the direct proportion of their specialties. An actor got more direction, worse than he performed. ("Do you want me to bend like a Hanback, talk from my back, show my teeth, and get bored all the time at once?" <br /> <br /> The theory is definitely Holland A lousy script is confirmed by co-writing that is written here, with a number of authors commenting that Billy Heleck is not an impressive character, but it is a misleading way to put it. Before we start to experience the occult, we know that he is fat, and that which he thinks is food. ("I think all things are food," he tells us, for help.) And to the end ... <br /> <br /> (I think) I must insert a rebellious warning here ... <br /> <br /> He eventually gets worse, why? I can only shrug. Probably he Under some kind of intelligent yes, perhaps it is probably "mysterious" by "evil" - it's not so bad as the socially irrational suspension of general-finite psychology. However, there is no idea of ​​its actions until finally, some of them have a lot of work Not sensible, and these letters are very little to explain their motivation for the convenience of viewers. <br /> <br /> I'm nominated for Hamest Line / Delivery: "I do not think you want to like it. FACT ..." [Big dramatic pause] "... I do not think you like it want to do. "
