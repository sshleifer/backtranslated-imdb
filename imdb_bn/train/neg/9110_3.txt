I saw this movie at 3 o'clock in the morning, a time when I was usually very open during movies. But still I think it was not good, this movie was not good. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I mean, handcuffed situation, and the poker situation among the servants like situation ... so this movie was definitely based on the first one, and OK. But if I did not meet it first before seeing it, it became worse. Finally, it came very suddenly, and I felt that I have no ties to this day ... Sebastian has suddenly changed, and this film seems to be completely explanation of N1 and was not like any other time or effort. Is used. The score is like the first one, and it does not look like a movie ... <br /> <br /> They could handle situations with more style and class, but they did, and so, this movie has turned bad. .
