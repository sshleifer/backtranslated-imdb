I read Henrik Herrera's book "Tibet in 7 Years" and fascinated it. Then I immediately grab the DVD and start watching movies. I think I'm back in 98 for the first time, I like it. Well, now I saw it full knowledge of the book based on it again. And soon I realized how it was wrong: <br /> <br /> When people entered Lhasa, people started coming out of their mouths and Thuisis and Pitt think that Tibet is the way to say hello, so they return. In Harare's book, it explains that by closing the tongue is a sign of perfect humility and loyalty in Tibet and they can do it in front of the Dalai Lama, but of course these two European Not for you! Not only the mother, even the Dalai Lama was wearing glasses herself. Harare's book mentions that anyone in Tibet did not wear glasses (sorry, forgot the reason, but explained it in the book too). The young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and no one could see him! And how did he destroy the Mandal in front of the living Buddha by looking at the Mao Tosh? Baby ... and the designer did not create the Tibetan clothes of Harare and Aufschaitar at the door! Why has such a thing happened that has been removed from the real story, only to have time to fill the imagined love interest (female trail ...) which is totally unimportant? Just boys, like the whole story about Rolph. There is no mention of one or more of her books about Hera's family. But it was right for me because "Tibet has 7 years" is not a book about a lost person. About him Tibet I am very disappointed by this "adaptation" of the famous book. And I was betting Henrych Harrer, too ... 3 stars, for cinematography.
