Yes, this movie is bad. What's worse is that it does not take advantage of its title! In full movies, Jumbo and Vampire fight each other or both. Above all, we are never sure whether the main character of the movie is a vampire. Someone might argue that they are trying to "tone it" or "realistically", but it just became annoying. More than half of this movie was held at a car. It is not proud of the scenes that can happen anywhere else. Also, there is no clear rivalry and ultimately you have no idea what happened in the last 30 minutes of the movie. However, I would say that the production cost of this movie is low, soundtrack is surprisingly well-suited and equipped (with an ornate score or sample music somewhere else). <br /> <br /> I am for independent film, but it does not seem that it was for the public audience (if any). <br /> <br /> "Worse than Schenker Slayer".
