A complete waste time <br /> <br /> HalA Ball is a complete waste time. Scripts and conversations are poorly written, lack of direction and hammer acting borders This film was apparently aimed at Color De Springy people, but it was far less than a sign because it does not have any material in it that its listeners -graduate script, awesome acting, good direction and a strong social message that has never been broadcasted but it is shown to be connected Do it. Compared to the closest superiority of <br /> <br />, Halah Ball enjoys the scenes and moves one step as a hero, Villain has taken a leak on Persians anger and the hero's counselor is throwing bullets at a truck! In the 80's, all of these could be acceptable when movie quality slowdowns, and bad films like Divya Shakti and Phool Kanti become big hits, but the film has become more subtle and it's getting delayed. <br /> <Rajkumar Santoshi is a qualified director and I am grateful that he wants to give a social message among the films he is making but maybe he does not know how to do it! In order to understand what he is trying to say as an audiences intelligence, he resorts to not care. Maybe he has to pay attention only to the entertainment and social messages should be left to Rakesh Mehr and Amir Khan. <br /> <br /> Even if you do not agree with what you say, you agree that you were very good at the screening of Rang De Basanti and thought that Sree Shantoshi gave up Om Shanti Omk's deviation. Industry-bashing? OK !! Santoshi portrays the industry as a back-baiting, beaching and casting sofa, which the hero happily is involved with a starlet named Suniya. There are some people who think that these parts show the true face of the industry. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
