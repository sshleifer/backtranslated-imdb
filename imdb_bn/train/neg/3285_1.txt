When a movie like "Hugderd Dukes" comes to $ 75 million, it gives some incredibly sad statement about the state of our own society. Or we are too stupid together to stay away from this kind of trash or perhaps I do not understand how many people will appeal to appeal to this kind of appeal. <br /> <br /> Good movie if it trashes out, people will see it when there is nothing else on the screen. this is. I went out despite getting a free movie pass. Conversation can not be a dumber. Stunts can not be over-the-top and harmful. Perhaps this is the "big big" image that Texans appeals but it does not appeal to anyone else in the theater. Except Burt Reynolds, "big name" was not the end of this career, which you all have to hear. Jessica Simpson - do not laugh at me <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie for the video, even if you are frustrated. It was about making fooling the public after working better than spending the day on equal or open marketing. They did the public despite their ancestors. The foolishness is wide.
