* A great moment of Christmas survival * which has often become painful: James Gandolfini cracks a snail on Ben Affleck's stupid head. <br /> <br /> This movie works as another unfortunate example of James Gandolfini, proving what a great actor, who played the film, enrich his career. <br /> <br /> Young and wealthy advertising editor, Drew Latham (Ben Affleck) believes that no one can live alone on Christmas. (And from the beginning, the underlying issues involved in the suspicion of disbelief in the film: In 2004, how many people in the social status of the draw has really taken care of one or the other, or whether Christmas alone or half of the family or a $ 50 prostitution?) Christmas spending through the story Due to buying a family, Drew was bought, on condition that They claim to themselves that they ignore their own emotions, that does not mean that they did not buy the money they wanted. <br /> <br /> For $ 250,000 dollars, a very sub-truck truck driver, Tom Wallco (James Gandalfini ), And his disgraced wife, Christine (Catherine Oahara), is regarded as a family of draws against the protest from them. Boy, Brian (very rarely Josh Zuckerman) and daughter, Alicia (very soft-focused Christina Applegate). Drew then restores the rest of his youth - spending the rest of the film. Messages from this movie are dry and irrational as its dry mobile phone story To turn his attention to the brain, Drooo posted a fake smile on his face and finally denies the denial of each neighbor that he finally exits that he thought he had bought the Wallco family to save. <br /> <br /> asks this question: If the person is giving this money to the druck to meet some of the pleasant family emotions, how should he show happiness in his presence of psychology and mental torture on their presence? The Walko family conceals their true feelings and is not a case that does not pretend to be happy around the draw - three out of four members hate it and make it clear. Is he so surprised that he can not see that his money did not buy the "family" environment that he had turned into faith was really true? One of these overwhelming movies, four * how four screenliners may be so confused by their dream of being present in the Credits sequence that they ignore any aspect of feasibility, or intelligence. <br /> <br /> Director Mike Mitchell, who was responsible for * DÃºs Bigallo: Malegigolo * - stop there. 'Said Naf. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Guildfini and Wahra, in some way, shine brightly, prove their mood in this mess. Christina Applegate grasps in the most accurate places in the most intense and playful and dangerous, pink and fiery, mostly harmless little strips of film, because of the love she faces, because the script tells her. <<br /> And as far as I can not say that Fleke is bad actor, but John Scandar looks better on his shoulder. The city has a whole new level of talented gifted genius.
