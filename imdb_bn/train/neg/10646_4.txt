Johnny Weasmuller's latest tragedy film and a good thing, because it's the worst of the 12 films made for 16 years. No epilepsy is shown here, as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the hatred of her people, who worship a god and try to force her to be a bride. He is the Tarzan and Jane, who tries to protect him. George Zucco is probably not present as a potentially villainous high priest but his full advantage is not used. Also hands-free and worthy of mention is a very annoying guitar player / singer who often goes into the song. Even the "great" Robert Flory could not help it. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (four)
