What was this supposed? Fisher King is a remix? Why are we concerned about Sandler's character? What a slow, dreary, annoying, who gives-a-treasure-about-this man movie !!! Just busy through just painful, I turned it off before it ended. It is very clear that Chaddell needs as much help as Sandler needs; I said: Can you say "Fisher King"? And how does this psychological character work in his daily life? We are not supposed to think deeply, I guess. Why does Chadle give Sandler the chance to take back the violence? If they are good friends, how do they grow apart? Why Chadle is in control, why he seeks the narrowed road advice? We are never called. So Fisher King is so good a movie and so why it just sucks. 8 out of 10 average scores? I do not agree. All the time Even the top films are lucky to get a high average rating and this shit can not be with them in the same universe.
