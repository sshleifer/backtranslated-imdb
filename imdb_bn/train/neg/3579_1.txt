A few years ago, after renting and watching the movie, I immediately decided that it was immensely zero on the film scale. There was nothing about the movie that could be worse than that. On this day we still rate far better movies than "Lonely Lady", even the worst things. Many years ago I saw an interview with Alan Perry, who wrote ScriptPlay among other things, "Last Summer" and "Mad Gauffe's Diary", and a script for Harold Robbins's "The Lonely Lady" book. Asked to write. He said he sent a treatment and it was rejected because he did not think he could understand the problems of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. Then he said, "I think they've got someone else to write it." The interview was depicted before the film was released. He died in 1981 and I am alive that he thanked God for being the first thing to come to heaven personally involved in his outcome.
