It's one of the late nights "it's there" I saw it. Sometimes they are great. This one was terrible, but it was not really supposed to be there. <br /> <br /> The movie was really a good cast. How Can You Fail During Charleston Heiston And Jack Palenas? We're talking here the Oscar winning turf. It had good special effects. It was even some really good tits! And I showed nicely, full breasts with full nipple and even some beaver at one. But it does not compensate for a missing element - a story! The plot was ridiculous. I did not mean sun exposure material "solar crisis", but that was bad enough. It was left to stuff - Oh so stupid and completely anticipated evil corporation element. People that just stank! Good acting or cool space can get near any amount of the ship or near the war scene. <br /> <br /> I saw members of the same cast incredibly well. I have had wonderful fantasy and budget was seen in wonderful science fiction movies. All the differences are written.
