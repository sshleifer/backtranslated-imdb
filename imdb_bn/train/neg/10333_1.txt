What was an exciting and fair original series by Fox undermined down the disappointing tripe. In the first season, Dark Angel was on my weekly "Must see course" list, not just because of Jessica Alla. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Fox had the power to decide that their "fine-tune" plot In the 3 episodes of the season's opening, they completely lost me as a visitor (even seeing Jessica Alla!). I found new characters which were very ridiculous and amateur throughout the second fun. The new platinas were expanding very thin show continuity and credibility. In one of the second season episodes, they also saw the most sleeping and dream - where the first season said that he could not sleep in biology. <br /> <br /> The moral of the story (never gets Hollywood): it works, do not screw it with! <br /> <br /> Azjaj
