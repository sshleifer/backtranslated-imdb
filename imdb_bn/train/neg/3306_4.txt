A very "straight" beautiful old lady, frustrated to save her home and property, raises "pot" at her house, tricks up some old friends and then sells them. The story of this low-key comedy emphasizes the irrationality of the situation, and some comedic events happen. It works for most of the film. Humor is not a sunny variety, but it gives you relaxation for one and a half hours, so I think it uses its purpose. <br /> <br /> There are fun moments there and Brenda Blethyn is fun to see the lead role. But in the end, it has finally destroyed a "tricky" film with the humiliating bad messages, which only the ultra-liberal people of the film want to see. <br /> <br /> Like most people, I like a happy ending, too, but those who blatantly break the law should not be all warm and vague for them. There is also usually (1) children outside the marriage ceremony but it creates a problem and seems to be OK; (2) portrayed as a secular moral man; And (3) even a medical doctor threw stones! <br /> <br /> Hello? And here's the critics Hollywood blasts? It is demonstrated how a secular society has generally reduced the standards of the UK and Europe. Hey, man: At least a trace of morality has a trace without the message "It feels good if nothing is better," without a Timothy Leary.
