When I first started watching this movie, I was looking for a finer metaphor, but soon it came to me that this film is about the train people. Interactions between people can be seen on the street any day, and when a little more interesting situation becomes a dialogue and annoying. This movie is not trying to illustrate how people interact, but it is only very annoying in this movie. If you want to see and analyze these relationships, you will be really good to go out and buy train tickets and look at the train people with you. It's realistic but you will not go to a movie to watch a movie about you watching the movie.
