Only two taka for buying VHS in this movie, I lost my money! Hey, I dig Adam "Batman" West and Tina "Gilligan Island" Louis, but hello! This is a rehash of dozens of other biker films producing third rate; Biker's brain paddle travels to a hick town in the city, beat everyone and everything, and then defeats the humans with the disappointing heroes. Adam West looks part as a hero, but he is missing Cape, and his Batman uniform. Sorry, not exactly the same. Tina El really is totally nervous and afraid of full show, but at least we know how he "Aida" happened after the rescue from the island ... LOL! Bike is a hottie group, and their acquaintance should never be played again or at least. Hell riders Hell to watch!
