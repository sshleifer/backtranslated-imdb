... even even, even they can live without seeing it. To be honest, this movie (if someone refuses to call it) is the only real interest for mortgages. Betty Page fans will not learn anything new (and I do not understand *), nor will they enjoy warm lungs of familiar, loving or indifferent experiences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " This is definitely "Hey, kids, let's make a movie!" The minimum order made the movie. I think a person may be grateful that at least they knew how to run the camera.

This is not a worthy movie. It is a fetish piece that deals with the greatest pin-up attraction of all time, and without category, without style and without any real feeling to understand the character of the betty page. No true betty page fan will be something other than a disappointment, I guarantee that Avoid all costs <br /> <br /> If free, remember that time, too. Your price may not be too high, but I fully appreciate that you'll be sorry that you've lost time with this time. That is, I'm done, you've been warned.
