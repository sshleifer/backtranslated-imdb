Unfortunately, this movie is so bad. The original out of the Towns Manic and was very funny, of course they used the script written by Neil Simon. For some reasons Neil Simmons script is not used in this movie, so it's time for flat time and time again. Even the audience I was not laughing at. The direction is very slow and tedious and when it is a joke, it is given so that the joke can die. This couple is sex in the park. They announced a talk show for New York, we all know that the lights are coming and we'll be able to look beautiful and steal a few chips from Golf and Steve. The whole movie is going to be like this ... a joke has been set up and given away. Why Goldies Hair is never messed up in the movie. You will notice every close up of gold (they use a very intense soft lens). I advise you to rent real estate with Jack Lemon and Sandy Dennis, if you want to laugh.
