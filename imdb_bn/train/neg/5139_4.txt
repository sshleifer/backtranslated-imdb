Many awful fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I did not find it very popular that found it to be rather annoying. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to be a lot tense. The main problem I think is that it is set in the dark. Sometimes the horror films set in the dark (such as Humans), but SquareCro are in the dark for the whole picture. It is difficult to determine what is actually happening most of the time, and although some horrific shots were scary, most of the time it was difficult to see. If a little more light was used, it might be better. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Dark Knight of the Scarecrow, there are not many horrific films that kill the killers, much better. I would recommend on Scarecrows any day.
