As a fan of Noticias BIG, I was waiting for this movie. Unfortunately I see it a terrible movie. Jamal Woodward is not proven enough or realistic enough Nutrition BIG Many stories follow the intriguing BIG's original son, Christopher Jordan Wallace as the infamous BIG. As a kid Unfortunately, he is not confident enough to pay tribute to his father. Derek Luke Shawn "Puffy" is just as incredible as combs. In short, anyone here is confident enough to play their role. The big problem with this is that they are real people coming. It was boring, and did not give any information about the notorious BIG. That fans and non-fans did not already know already. I was particularly disappointed with Angela's baset, a very good actress like Volta Wallace. Movie Slugs and Slugs are thinking about the Notices BIG. Fans will spend tons on it. I'm unfortunate that happened. It's nowhere near a good movie. I had much hope from it, but unfortunately I did not get anything I wanted from this. I think you must definitely avoid this one.
