Oliver Gruner is my completely unknown. My friend showed me this picture because he had seen Grunner In, which he said was a pretty scientist-film, Namesis. So we saw it, we just got to speed through the parts of BS drama to reach incredible action sequences. Gruner loves to jump and jump and jump. And kick! Haha <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br />! Mexican gang that keeps tormenting her family. Instead of joining, Grunar asked the boy to fight (against a gang? Very crazy). Gurner manages the character of Van Dam in a common van which kills everybody (or makes them worse), and these gangmakers work to get rid of his block. <br /> <br /> This plot was very impressive and easy to think. Perhaps Groomer is not very familiar because of his script - if this movie is anything to compare with potential choices then select it. This cave is authentic hell and I have a chance against the character of Grunner as the motley crew of such characters enjoyed seeing through it. The music was usually action music (Themingpin Pianos and Tempani, the guitar of the lungs), which was not as bad as it was. The director had to take steps instead of a 5-minute break for a monstrous family moment. Finally, I gave it 4/10 because it actually tried to act as an average action film to play in Oliver Graner, but the overall feeling of the movie is that you want to have more closures on what you saw.
