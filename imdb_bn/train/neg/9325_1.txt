S.I.C.K. I really killed myself so incredibly stands for crappy. There was absolutely no acting to speak. Box cover artwork was the best part of the whole production. This movie budget was enough. The filming was on the sub-sesame street. Featuring like that underground filming for the hit crowd hit. Props used in this movie were stolen from the clothing store. The finishing was so expected that you should fast forward and smile 5 minutes forward. If there is a book for this movie, I'm sure it's good. I will avoid at all costs. I enjoyed it in close view, they paid the whole movie. Just kidding.
