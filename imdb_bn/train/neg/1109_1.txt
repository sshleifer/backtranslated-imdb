This is the worst western I've ever seen about. This story follows a source that is particularly common for Western and martial arts films - The hero tells that the family / friends have been killed, the hero comes out for the right revenge, kidnaps the ineffective law enforcers, rescues the abducted boyfriend daughter and murders the expert Arch-nemesis in an atrocious conflict This formula has often been successful - otherwise it will not be a formula - but the Gunfighter is the highest sophomoric execution that you'll see on it. Scripting is supernaturally simple mind and humiliation; It has written a high school-like conversation because it lacks depth, maturity and reality. The word is bad; It sometimes shows W. Cinematography, lam and set are sometimes facades. Acting is kind; Sure, the actors may blame some scripts, but others can not use that excuse. I hope Chris Liebert has no role to say again; Every time he says an angry or meaningless line, he does not do much more than tearing down his voice, and he's just talking like a child trying to play Muro. And talk about Chris Lewart to play Hoppling, if you see the courage to watch this movie (he dares to see this movie): He wears new clothes of this brand that shows him more like Roy Rogers than the hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy . . You can get it only if you enjoy only the modest cinematic rentals to worship the fabulous majesty of Halingang Qasidi, but if you have two more neurons then see something else.
