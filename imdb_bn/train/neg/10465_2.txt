I'm really willing to write this review. I'm a Christian, so I wait anxiously watching this movie. It looks great - some famous celebrities and a plot that seems to be provocative (I can not buy the Bible code myself - you can say something that you want to do, though I believe everything inside the Bible). So I'm sitting at the edge of my seat while enjoying the previews, when the movie comes in and minutes are managed to destroy my mood. I had to bite my lips to comment on the horror writing and to refrain from acting while playing in the theater (I was rather shaky but basically fragmented by the happy people in the upward scenes and the extremely obvious and expected tension scene, I'm sure). After starting the final credit once, I may reflect. I like many parts of the movie - some of the most unexpected plot twists, some effects which were indeed special (I'm not counting Vision. They have done badly), and some interesting technical tasks - set fades, that thing type. Unfortunately, I've got a unique impression that if I read the published sentence from a monkey and set the monkey in front of the typewriter for an hour, I got a lot better script. And the music was outside of Chess (even a bond fan who likes some Chess songs in action and conspiracy scenes). So I could be like everyone else in the theater - just as people were coming out crying and stroking, how incredible it was - but I'm not the one who can be delighted by a writer who tries to throw some words into a Bible shell and it slaps a Christian stamp. Before I can enjoy most movies, I need a good plot and trustworthy dialogue, and it was not. I'm sorry, but I will not recommend anyone on this photo. And that tragedy When will we see some cute Christian fiction? It should be somewhere ...
