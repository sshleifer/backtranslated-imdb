Have you ever wondered what will happen if some characters of Beverly Hills 90210 throw in Thai Thai prison? If so, this is your movie. This is Midnight Express for the MTV crowd. That's ok, but the story is badly executed. Controversy plots twists, poor dialogue and outstanding problems wide This little film does not have the right to become mysterious as soon as it finishes. Potential spoiler and unlikely isolated plot line - When the hotel staff discovers when the girls have a room and are wrong to jump them out, the wrong tension filled moment (At this moment when they are being arrested on gunpoint, neatly played with the same seriousness and gravity). Afterwards an employee is found in the same hotel - and Bangkok is a big city, remember, I was there - and testifying against the girls, so that some Free Tieyas gave 40 years of jail. Come on. Instead hire another day in paradise.
