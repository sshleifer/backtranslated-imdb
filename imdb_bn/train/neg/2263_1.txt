All right, tell me that I do not expect a film from Jerry Springer's cinematic Sona, all I wanted was a cinematic ... and it was not like that. It looked like someone's bad home movies. I've seen sometimes the most unnecessary people played cruelly with nudity, scripts, and poses. <br /> <br /> The film's "plot", which focuses on a lower-class family, "Jerry Farlell Show" discusses more than one topic between a mother, daughter-in-law, and girl's fianc√©. From there, film fizzles and develops into a unique experience: white-rubbish pornography. Redneck sex, interactive sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Yuk!) This image encouraged me to get out of the theater and get the second Sarinian. At least it was short of appetite. Hateful and humiliated African Americans and working class America would be offended. (Howard Staron should be satisfied, but he did not waste his efforts for the film's Stardom, was smart, fun and entertaining) <br /> <br /> My grade: F. (Girl was hot)
