This film was made for people who made Grimlines very fierce and hard-working. This movie is just as bad as the 80's Critera / Trolls / Gramlinys movies. There are no punchline comments that are sad part. <br /> <br /> The problem of this miniature giant film tries to be fun and is successful as you walk like Honey Mandel and it ends in success. People What were the horrors of the 80s in the classics that they were trying to be really scary, but they were frustrating because they were so weak. Someone before speaking about this film, Bitinnika Hirosh (Yes the Betina Hirsch) spoke of comedy for comedians. Unfortunately they were wrong. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> movie. <br /> <br /> The most annoying part of the movie is Paul's character. His Paul Reiser Winbite Schittick is enough to get enough formatting to start fast forwarding in his first scene. Until the credit can stop a person to see a scene that throws a pool pool ... I do not do it <<br /> <br /> So the bottom line is going on, do not walk, go to your nearest blockbuster and shake hands with the manager and thanks for placing this garnish on the shelf.
