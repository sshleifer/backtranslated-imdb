This image is loaded in a giant pan. Paul Schrader has completely lost his own bad screen. And his guidance is that it can often be as a comatose in addition to being asleep during the process. <br /> <br /> The worst is Woody Harrison, whom I usually like to properly casting. She "Walker", DC, is a lesbian who plays as a social partner of the lacking wives of the Washington elites. If he was cutting a magazine and a popsicle sticks bounced around the camera in front of the camera then he could not be more one-dimensional. His "southern accent" is the "rack-off" version that ends from the beginning of each line, starting from the beginning, as the south's heat and humidity still exceeds its energy strength. It's monotonous. However, he did not have the worst word on the film. Her "boyfriend", played by Moritz Blattert, tries to influence some mid-Mid-east accents that she can rarely provide bad lines written for her. In real life he speaks German, and speaks different languages ​​- because he is an Italian, he is unable to roll his R! Do not think it is good to throw someone else? <br /> <br /> From the story, from the screenplay, to the direction, to the camera work, in leadership acting, this movie is worse than it was from the beginning. The only tolerant moment in this movie is played by three actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lorraine Buckle and Christian Scott Thomas. Only these three actors managed to do it through this movie with their dignity. Indeed, three fantastic, despite being stuck in a bad picture. Unfortunately, any errors can be good enough to break this endless series. If you like these three actresses, see them in something else. This movie is not worth your time.
