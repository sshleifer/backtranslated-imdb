** SPEAKER ** I hired "Tessi" (or "thesis") on "The Other" energy of the next attempt by director Alejandro Amenbar. The film that is based on a brilliantly scaled and horribly effective crypto, I would have had the same quality of her previous efforts and I had some good mood for horror. Instead, I was struck with the most tedious, overwhelming excuse for a crippled brain slasher that I saw from the German film "Anatomy" (which reminds me of this one kind). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is possible but it is thrown in the first 20 minutes. It revolves around the thesis of innocent psychology department Angela (Anna Torrent - the death of a Jessica Harper) on the subject of violence in the film. In some remote situations, it becomes very stupid, she snatches a 'snap' tape, on which two tortures, hijacking and killing a young woman for the camera. Angela, and her horror-friend-friend Shema (Fei Martinez) are both still encouraged by tape and who have been responsible for who has decided to go down. <br /> <br /> As a result ... well, they do not want to find out the killers of girls why they do not really give any reason (since they firmly believe in police in any unlawful incident Refusing to communicate, even at the risk of their own lives) as cruel as Graham Norton in a room of money girls in the mystery itself. Only a correct 'imprint' (the kind of camera used is discovered) and it is a) a weak one and b) the wheel comes out in the first 20 minutes. The so-called 'undesired' is chucked out of the pad only while running only on the fate of fate, rising ridiculous plot twists and terrible, transparent and thoroughly vain red fountains running through a SLEW. <br /> <br /> - Sincerely - Amenabar may know his things about the ghost story, but he definitely does not read the book of intelligence of his life. A good whodunnit key has a large cluster of potential suspects and for clearing them one by one with the growing authority of clever authority and multiple evidence before removing them for the final bend. Assassin's identity is often correctly estimated by the amateur 'detectives' and then we tried to fool the 100-minute author that he threw us off until he goes out of his thinking, his hands up and saying "OK, I got it, it was after all"! As an argument or purpose behind the crime - there is no kind of luck. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some curiosity, satirical 'point' about violence in movies. I have no idea that it is trying to take any action on the subject, but it appears that a ton of confused, confused psychologist has broken into pieces, the remaining is in the rest and saying, "Look at me! I am political!" Final scenes, where the movie is considered "point", it is very stupid and vivid, but when the Amenabara is feeling embarrassed to see it, then no one will be surprised. If he does, he must certainly. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I have wasted a whole two hours (at least six felt like), hopefully something can happen. Urban legends of 'Snape Films' (and, basically, all of them, how they try to make the movie that they are removing the world from any kind of criminal incident!) Areas that can be exploited in a terribly cruel manner, in films (someone like "WideDorm" ?) But like a line, step by step to step-by-step step-by-step! The region (i.e. "My Little Eye") with it ... "Tesses" hits the lowest minimum for the 'sniff movie' genre. At each stage, this one is better left dead and buried. I will give 1 out of 10 prizes for some excellent discussions, but this is what I got.
