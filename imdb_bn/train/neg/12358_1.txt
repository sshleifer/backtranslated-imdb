Demi Moore's character of the film was selected for SEALs due to her appearance. It started a bad start and went down to the movie. The plot was completely incredible. A solid military unit is not enough willing to do it. This film does not satisfy me about the physical skills of a woman for any kind of work. <br /> <br /> Women and men try to insult the same intelligent intelligence. The difference between sex makes life interesting.
