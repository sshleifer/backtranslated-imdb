A reasonable effort is a short for this film. The lack of a good sixties film but no sense of credit. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance that was credible enough, but as much as she was not good enough, other actors were just terrible! A terrible illustration It was not very funny and it was not particularly fun because it did not really achieve its fun features, and it was not dramatic. The only section to achieve at a satisfactory level was the romance. The target audience did not hit and the movie was sent a confusing message. A very basic plot and a very basic storyline did not take off or performed and why the good people were not so good, and why the target audience was left to confuse etc, but Maggi was quite good and storyline was right at the moment of power. <br /> <br /> 4.
