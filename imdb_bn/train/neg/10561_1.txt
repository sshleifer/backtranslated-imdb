I saw this movie in my own time, when you marry a child in a marriage, it just does not ruin your life, but stamps as your child's jerk. The 'single mothers' may seem very distant in these days, but it was very true. And I'm stammering, someone is crazy about laughing at someone. Among these two problems I was finding it difficult to find the movie. At that time, I did not know who it meant or how wonderful it was. I knew Betty Hatton, and she made me so annoying because she bothered me. I like to "bring up baby", but I think this movie is just embarrassing. I was sure that the punch at some church functions was probably spiked, but I needed a drink after watching this again. To be 'married', the girl must be drunk and the pregnant should be linked with sadness only. The result of this movie is really fun part so an entire town can turn you into these situations. Of course, shoot me, I do not like it "It's a wonderful life"
