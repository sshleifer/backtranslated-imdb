This movie was fantastic great movie through scary as hell. And I mean that it makes me joke like Pauls, IT and Omen, but a bad movie comes with a great movie? Right! This last movie was a merciful staff. I mean, a ghost, a girl has returned home and I think I did it now, that means I can call her and it may be the right time because she thinks. OK? Wrong My ass If I do not care Satan's devil, it's not right. It is a movie Yes but the worst movie or admired like this is meant to sense the movie but it is not. It just showed us what I said right and people do not mind it. Would someone please tell me why you did not notice that kind of part. For me the movie has ended in the hospital and all that. Number 3 check out his many more rod ass
