The film is a little tiring. This is mostly a silent film, which is distributed through a series of voices. It is not a bad idea at the time of making a silent film like this, it is a movie where the lack of dialogue and repetitive initial scenes make it simply tiring. You do not understand the reason Tedium is good in the film, and then by it it is too late. The first 40 minutes of the film is a soft slice of Mexico's soft screen, and some of it is also inferior soft pornography. Later, the first 40-minute style of film began to be sensual, but it was too late because the viewers were lost. Shooting at Mexico National Autonomous University has some excellent location. I often wonder why more films are not shot there. The campus is built on the edge of Lava area, which lends a very unreasonable feeling to the campus. My biggest problem with the movie is that the director / writer has created the film in such a way that he wanted to see it regardless of how a viewer could see the story. When you tell a story you can not ignore the audience.
