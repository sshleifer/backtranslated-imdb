The film could have been 15 minutes long if it did not have all the trouble between the father and the father. Highly anticipated. Both men "big" face need a good slap! Are you that "whine?" Want some cheese with? Two chocolate ... and a headache. I understand why after 47 years the mother left her husband ... I do not know how long she has gone! In the first 5 minutes I want to close the movie, I never paid $ 3.99 to see it! The movie did not flow well and was not painfully long. I keep watching watching my clock fly faster during the watch ... it was not there. The script was so frequent that it was easy to fill the author's space. A positive note ... the scenery was beautiful, my favorite season to grow. Cars, 40 Ford too were beautiful. This movie gets a de-rating an F approaching
