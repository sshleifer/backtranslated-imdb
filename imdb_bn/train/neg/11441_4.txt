After making a commitment of the first 25 minutes that you feel inside all the warm, you are quite convinced that it will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie takes a turn for the bad. <br /> <br /> There may still be warm feelings, but others say: The plot is so incredible and artificial that it is almost intolerable to watch. The film goes on and you get the idea that you are fast moving through it or the producers have decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and you will have to spend a lot of time. <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> plus, some of this movie Despite the nice interior and despite the bad script, I think the performance of the actors is quite good. I could only rate the first 25 minutes, I would probably give it an eight. As it is now, it gets a four. ... and that's nice! <br /> <br /> If you are chic for romantic jokes, you probably have a great time. If not, I would suggest you see something else.
