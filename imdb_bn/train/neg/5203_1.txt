I saw poor movies in my time, but this really takes a biscuit! Oh, why did this picture be made? There is nothing here. Put your trust in me, press the off switch and destroy your copy of this picture. There is a plot ... It can take about 5 minutes to show in the camera. This is the main problem, the story does not allow itself to be padded out for 80 minutes (depending on the true story) (mmm ... whatever). And so we have to sit around an hour watching people walk around. Yes, that's it! Within the first half, one hour does not happen at all, others walk through the shop and three people walking along the wood. This time probably has been spent developing characters ... but not so. And so there is no connection with the person on the screen, and so when they started to get shot, we could not keep less attention! Actually, I became fake for the kids so that the film would end! This camera work is really awesome! This Director / Editor / Writer / Producer, Tee Way Way Trash. I hate to hit a guy, but really, his job is to pants! These uninterrupted close ups are continuing, and then follow the long single people follow them - I'm sure he thinks he's cute, but the result is so low that I just wanted to stop the film and tear my wrist! How is this man brought to the next cabin fever movie! To finish, the acting is frustrating, ... which goes entirely for the movie. Protect your softness, this hip cleaning rod of total extraction!
