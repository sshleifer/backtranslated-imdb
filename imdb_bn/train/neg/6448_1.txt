Animals are accurate words for this movie unknown. Or maybe it should say an unknown movie. This movie is a piece of right from the beginning. It's really a stupid "plot," really unfortunate "acting," and so-so "special effects." <br /> <br /> Some thirty-year-old "post-thirteen" is trapped in a jungle hiding place with a crazy, reptile, rubber-suit animal. What you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and valuable little steps. You have to walk through the wooden talk of the girls, and then you guys walk through the talking wood (with heavy mascara). The whole thing is so annoying! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < When it is shown that the film is distorted to reveal a mask of a rubber suit and the movement shows that it is a case, the reason for the ambiguity and distortion of the image is due. <br /> <br /> Since this is not a good film and those who have appreciated here probably are people taken off the road to "act" in this truly stupid movie! Leave this one for specific!
