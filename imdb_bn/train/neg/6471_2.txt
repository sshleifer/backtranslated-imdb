This is a movie which is bad in every fantastic way. Sure we want to know what happened in the last 12 years, and it works on some level. But new characters are not just interesting. Baby Melody is horrible terrible! Alas, the people who can not sustain water forever, are also maintained, other basic physical logic is ignored. If you're in the Ark, it's cold if you do not have cold weather clothing. I do not know why most of the opinions here is worse in Jafar, I thought it was a terrible one.
