This movie is one of the worst comedy movies I have ever seen. I hate this Napoleon dynamite rip off. The only laughing smile people have already encountered. Do something new for once. All these new tricks are just awesome. And there is still no role to come out of SN and Andy Sambarg. I hope I can bounce back from this scary movie. And Character Arnetts will only be plain bad. Hey, you have to read the script. The plot is really the worst written. Now you tell me it's weird. (This movie) is the step of Rod Kimbal, Father Frank is dying and the family needs 50,000 dollars for cardiovascular surgery, so Rank Frank plans to make a huge jump to collect money for Frank. Only so that Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manliness. Yes, the movie is that, you tell me, you will spend $ 7.00 to watch that fragment! <br /> <br /> 3/10 terrible <br /> <br /> <br /> - Adam
