I love special effects and witness the new technology which is a science fiction genre. Special effects of this movie are very good. I've seen most movies, since it's coming to HBO for the last few months. I have to admit, I missed a few scenes, but I'm usually dragging in movies, and saw a few scenes. But every time I see "Hall Man", I feel frustrated, almost like "Film Nir". I'm not sure why; Probably it is that I do not want Kevin Bacon to be bad, and he has frustration. But I think it testifies to how he gets bogged down silently. However, I can recommend this film for excitement (although some parts go slowly), but I do not recommend young people under 14 (probably 12, if they are mature).
