A movie about a bunch of filmmakers who want to create a new type of surfing of shark-infected water. As a full fan of films with some harmful creatures or monsters, I thought it could be my opinion ... it was not !!! It should be more of the instruction on how to do it! It has a lot of comical humor and the evil creature is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the main character * Rolling *, the legs are definitely going to air! It looks ridiculous! Although good for a smile If it is simply embarrassing stupid conversation and ridiculous stupid crocodile for the lack of talent in the actors, it will be at least tranquil, but it will get worse: I guess the film's captains have noticed how poor it is, so although they "sell sex" The old concept of this presents ... In effect, I mainly show the main actresses of the animal their breasts No And at the beginning there is a meaningless "make-up". This last element is making the movie completely rubbish to me. How incredible it is that people actually spend time producing such garbage! If you want to find the real waste of time, watch this movie !!!
