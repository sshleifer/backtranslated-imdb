This movie was serious horror. Acting was the worst! It was worse than a student film. Super Chess, and I think the worst actress is the old lady. At first I thought to myself, well it's an old movie. Then I have to remember any excuse! I saw old movies with good acting and good way. <br /> <br /> The music was terrible. It was really choppy. The edit was poor (most of the conversations were out of sync.) <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is also not suitable for one. I just saw this because I was very annoyed, and the movie did very little to entertain me. It was just ridiculous. My dead grandmother's left pink toes could make a better movie than this.
