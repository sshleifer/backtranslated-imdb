I actually like Asylum movie. I've made a habit of seeing as soon as possible. Even the work they did was cool like XXIS and when a killer calls. This is just plain lam. I can not believe that the same people who made Dead Men Walking and Dracula's attempt actually made this movie !!! Jolie Roger or Alin Education (which is, quite a bad), is not a humorous one. This is just BAD! I mean, I can praise and / or forgive the special effects of a bad film or hair in an asylum movie, but this movie is very important to take it on its own. I really hope that SNAKES on a train is good. Now that a movie I can not wait to see.
