What about people here? I will meet you in a different movie than the guys. I was so annoyed that I left the theater. What's up with this stuff? I laughed only once and was not even hard. Anyone who has made this movie green has taken it to the streets. I always find something that I love in a movie, but it's crazy. "Slackers" makes a look like a classic "not another teenage movie". It is always there with a trash like "Body Shots", "Con Air" and "Conspiracy Theory". Avoid all costs! I thought the studio would give money to people when they signed their apology on the theater, but my frustration was not happening. It looks like I will not see that money for two hours.
