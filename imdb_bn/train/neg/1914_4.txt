It's bad bad, but it's something good. It's just entertaining. <br /> <br /> As it is supposed to be a comedy, it's awesome. Each curiosity of the film has been done a hundred times before. It's a shame that all the actors in the film are usually cool, but none of them really does much. And sucks the end.
