Illustration: Excellent, nice camera angle (I do not remember watching a movie late, with good close-ups, it's up to one). Can avoid horrible scenes with a soft camera. Well illustrated in NY. I liked the flip angle (especially a different touch). <br /> <br /> Music: Not impressive. Even after watching the tracks, your mind does not roam around you. Maybe, I expected the same quality like "Anniyan". A disappointment. <br /> <br /> Actor: Kamal will gradually move away from the hard-core action sequence. His age and belly really show. Also, he should avoid romantic sequences going forward. Trying to play 20+ heroes scenes was very painful to see a mature / old star. Love can be expressed at any age; As we grow up, you can still express affection from a long distance (without touching a woman. For example, love published by "Chandramukhi" Rajinikanth). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this movie. He is not sure why he took this. Well, this is not my problem, I guess ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She disappointed me. It took a long time to release the film on various issues. She slips into a few scenes. Even from a famous director, the disgusting things have diminished. <br /> <br /> Overall: OK is a movie. Too many graphics Certainly for children (and adults who hope to "entertain") <br /> <br /> Thx
