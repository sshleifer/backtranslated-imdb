I loved the cast very beautiful but the story sort unfolds rather slowly. Danny Glover makes you do a good job if he is good guy. Meanwhile, other characters are only part of the story. He did not have much room in the story of Dennis Quaida. I thought the top was slightly more in the first scene compared to how the story was exposed. I'd like to see it again though. I wish it a 5 rating (I wish it could be 5.5 a rate)
