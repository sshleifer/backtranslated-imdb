(In this speaker) <br /> <br /> German romance "Romanstras" is a movie of heroic women during the Nazi period. But it is very long way, it is not touching and sometimes even annoying! There are many clinics and there is not enough good performance. <br /> <br /> Story story (story) is bad. James Cameron's old lady, like Titanic, remembers her live event. Well, now we've got a point. There is another woman who does the same thing. Confusing that they are remembering the lives of both other people! Come on! There is a lack of lack of these basic stories ... How can Riemann learn about the fate of the little girl's mother and ask her for example? <br /> <br /> The scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it happened. For example, when the scene is proposed by FEMen Fabia. When did that happen? Looks like the scene is set in the twentieth century ... <br /> <br /> The character of Rayman is definitely a talented Pianist, he is also a baroness! How nice. When his brother returns from the Eastern Front, he has received a "Ritterkreuz" in which he is shown some scenes. So he is a war hero and is still a fine man who saved his conscience. And he gained knowledge of genocide by the Germans. She even made some pictures! And so it goes, clich√© is cliling after and this does not work because of the movie. <br /> <br /> Originally Von Trotta made a chick flick what could be a decent movie. And in the end it's all very easy. Rayman found Gabbel's way to bed - oh! - Everybody is free. Which is not a historical event, but a true imagination despite the "true story" claim at the beginning. Like "sauce" it is a vaguely based on fact. <br /> <br /> It's sad but true, these days this common German movie. It's bad! McLeigh J. Connor <br /> <br />
