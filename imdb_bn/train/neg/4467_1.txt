<br /> <br /> I'm not sure which movie fits in any section, but this film is not a horror film. For the story, it was fairly interesting, rather slow. I was finally frustrated. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Intelligence or police first? She knows exactly what's going on at the time, plus there is a video tape as her proof. Instead, he goes there and becomes a brown and says, "I know everything, I have evidence! You do not expect evidence, do not you?" Then his uncle got up and walked towards him as if he was going to harm him. Good duh! Of course he is going to harm you fool, you just told him you know everything and have proof to express everything. What a stupid end.
