Oh this was a really bad movie. The girl who is playing Jennifer, but I think she is not getting her limbs off of the night, because she behaves wickedly through this movie, but she is thinking of shooting her agent to shoot her agent. . Like Faye Dunaway works she is remaking Mommy's darling and ending completely stupid. As a fan of Edgar Allen Poe, I really can not recommend this movie, although I am a bit surprised by the references (Ravens, Usher-like family, curse house and living burying). Perhaps if he knew about this picture, he would probably return to his grave.
