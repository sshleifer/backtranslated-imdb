It's worse, the series has suddenly dropped down. The first two signals were acceptable, and then we saw, really, a great show of horror movies. Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but Cast could not play the rest. The story of Alice, Frederick Kruger's deadly dreams resumed after surviving the previous installment of the Nightmare series. This time, the opposite murderer Alice was hit by the sleeping mind of her unborn child. His purpose is to "be born again" in the real world. Could Freddy stop her dead mother, but could Alice save her own soul while saving her own son? Check out the first three, and see the last twelve miss the next three.
