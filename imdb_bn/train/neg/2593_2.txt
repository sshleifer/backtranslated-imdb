American Pie: Beta houses are taller styles. On one hand, it is a comedy and a comedy with some really cute jokes. On the other hand, it is very soft-core to actually open any viewer. Originally a collage of beta house sex scenes - some humiliating, others just try to laugh with humor - some thin plot points thrown together in one endeavor. The characters are limited even bi-dimensional, most development depends on cash mile and "important" plot scenes are so far away that you think the author needs a story why. <br /> <br /> Justify all, I do not go into this movie without expectation. I liked the original three American pie movies, and thought that the band was hard to rent and the nude mileage was difficult. I thought the nude mile was good enough to be released on the theater, and so when I saw that some letters were coming back to the Beta House, I was excited to see this installment. I was aware that there would be numerous scenes of barbarity and sexual abuse in many forms. And I was good with that, because in the past, these scenes were supported by the story and they were consolidated into the plot. But in Beta House, it almost forgot the author why the formula worked in other AP films. They used to spend a lot of nude work that they actually forgot to write a story. <br /> <br /> This film is frustrating and is not even one dollar rental. Curiosity is long, the story is non-existent, and obscene attitude is very shameful, if you are really careful about watching it.
