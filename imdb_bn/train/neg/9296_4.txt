Generally, I'm a pretty liberal critic, but in this movie it seems incredibly bad. I am surprised to see how much positive reviews I have seen. <br /> <br /> There were some fantastic shots, but it was very bad that they got lost in the movie's synchos. "Daggers" is not entirely an action flick and romance, but it was unfortunately created around an empty love triangle. There is no chemistry between a couple, any relationship between Mei and his men seems more than love, and in most cases dialogue is simply silly. The translation can only be a problem, but the use of the term "flirt" does not remind me of the 8th grade, head-over-the-hill, forever together, worthless - to love; I also felt the wind had to beat on the head with metaphor. The audience is given very little about the really caring characters, and seeing completely too little emotional investment as a movie. I wish for the remote control to fast forward, I was ready to bathe in my seat, but most of the time I just cracked. <br /> <br /> ******* Hijacker ***** <br /> <br /> Now icing on the cake. Or rather, adding humiliation to the injury. The last one I saw was the most terrible, ridiculous one. The boys are fighting their intense fighting and screaming and yelling at each other and hacking. Oh, and then it started to snow. Randomly Oh, and then Mae (the dazzler bound in the heart) suddenly pops up from the weeds. Then he threw a hole that took about 5 minutes to reach his destination, and even slow to slow down the tube tube, easily slow the masking. Wow, calm down. <br /> <br /> Mother, I finally thought I was guilty because she was guilty in her chest and died. Gene songs, sobs, hangs off his body, the screen is empty. I, and people around me, are chuckling Not a good sign <br /> <br /> Apparently stunning, but eventually a failure.
