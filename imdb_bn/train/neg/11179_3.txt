We all love Al Pasino, it was painful to see him in this movie. Once a prominent and idealistic career seems to be what grubby finishes looks like an unmade bed in a promotional pacino and plays its part in assaulting everyone with utter bogus and inconsistent aliens. <br /> <br /> Spool out this way and that is that many loose ends and minds that are with reels (and then retreats). <br /> <br /> There's Kim Basinger, not much. Her scene with Pacino is flat and unconvincing. They believe hard to convince each other a lot. There is no strength in it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But it is not enough to save Alka from shame.
