I was really waiting to see the apps plan, but it was a huge direction. <br /> <br /> Settings and masks are great, but this is the only good aspect of the film. Other other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he's just looking for movies, stupid. Other actors are not very good. <br /> <br /> The worst part is the story. It's ridiculous! For example: the app is taking a stranglehold on the ground, but people do not attack them, nor do they wait again without waiting! This is just an example for stupid stories, but it will take a lot of time to tell them all.
