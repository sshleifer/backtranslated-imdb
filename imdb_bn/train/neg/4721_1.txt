Before watching this movie, check out the reviews available on the film about false propaganda, especially to see the widely accepted truth about 7,000,000 Muslim men being expelled from Srebrenica and their widely recognized truth that has been shot by the Serbian Armilairi. The documentary also includes various Pro-Serbian American organizations. See this movie critically, and review reviews previously. Most reviews argue that the documentary takes away his arguments far enough, even if he raises questions that are based on the prevailing wisdom of war. According to a review of the NYTimes by Stephen Holden, "Labeling this documentary pro-Serbian is wrong", but both "must speak in the entirety of the truth", most of which are derived from reliable sources, and those events exclude the Serbian forces. I do not recommend showing this documentary, but I warn you to experiment with a particularly complex perspective (as always should be done at any time).
