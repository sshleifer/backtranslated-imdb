The last critics were very generous. I calm like the first movie, but I can not enjoy this one too much. Early bearable, but it goes quite fast wave I just do not see John Bon Jovi as a "bad ass vampire hunter" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. There is not much knowledge in the scene only. I mean, a normal person will suspect something objectionable when a strange woman will try to soften you suddenly, leaving alone an experienced hunter. Why can not I contact with JV? Nothing has ever been explained in this movie, if it was entertaining you would not mind, but it was not too much asking. This will be the worst vampire movie I've ever seen.
