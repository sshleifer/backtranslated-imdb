Suddenly inactive and dull movie which stands around the character room or a rocket ship and speak continuously. You may find it tearing off while searching for Mars, but these scenes are illustrated by a heavy red / orange filter that makes everything very scary. Martin landscape / plants mainly drawn and the monsters consist entirely of strangers. The monster brides have exclusive pictures of when the heroine carefully falls into the air with winds like an airy wind like an octagonal wind, like a wind-like tree. Meanwhile, the Ed Wood film is a hundred times more entertaining. Otherwise 'sci-fi' music scores, repeat continuously when watching earplugs are good, you will run insane. If you fail to sleep yourself one night, then slip it in VCR and your insomnia will not be cured any time.
