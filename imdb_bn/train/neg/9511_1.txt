After the first ad on TV, I wanted to see this movie. I went to Tennels town to see 7:40 am yesterday. I have expressed some sadness when I saw a little better and spoiled my ticket in this trash. In the beginning all had a bunch of sexual trash and cliches. They actually exaggerate love work. The girls had all the stereo types. The boyfriend was very stupid for his own age. The pregnant woman who was pregnant pregnant did not get any smiles. Bank robberies were completely annoying with gags that were used in other movies. Their gateway car was an old beat-up van van that they had claimed that there was no break. Hey why did not they get beautiful girls car for robbery? It can raise audience opinion about the movie. This movie was not very low budget because it did not damage or destroy anything. This movie contains a lot of stuff that will drive the crazy people of the Christian people. Hey, I even expected the car's Chase scene because all the banks to loot movies, but I did not have any. So I rate this movie for less budget and stands for 1 in ten.
