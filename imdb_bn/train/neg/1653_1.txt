It just seems strange that someone read this script, and thought, "It's funny! I mean, it's so ridiculous that it needs to be made!" Who was this person? Is he really responsible for this person? Director, Writer / Writer owe me more than that? <br /> <br /> This picture is almost as simple as possible. There is no good conversation, and there is no shred of a favorite character. And the story ... <br /> <br /> I like the second worst movie, Most notable degrees of "No Holds Barred" by Hock Hogan. It seems relatively similar to Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> The last minute has gone a few minutes and it's still less than 80 minutes. The cast members in 'Outtakes' laugh about the 'comedy' mistakes, and the mistakes made in this 'comedy' set. Some people laugh while laughing, there are some connections with this film. <br /> <br /> Some interesting in this movie. There is nothing. It just keeps moving. It's really that lame. I love the movie that they are so bad that they are so bad. It's so bad ... some, but I do not know, and hope never will find. <br /> <br /> Amanda Pete is not absolutely chicken, and actually half the best things about this wannabe film. But, that really means a little. <br /> <br /> <br /> to avoid all costs.
