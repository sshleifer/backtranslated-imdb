When I first came to school in 1978, I saw this picture. I took a date to see it. I said, "no, no," do not need to say, because so bad picture! Joan's career is not as tanked as bad as it deserves after making a horrific, unfunny shit. Actually, the absurd is not a serious enough word: this movie is anti-funnier! You may be out walking out of feeling like you smile before it can happen as you happen. The meaning of this curiosity is to be considered "bad-to-good" in some sense or in some sense. Even the MSS 3 has shown this value to the gang! Billy Crystal's career is a miracle that survived the attempt of this primary suicide attempt.
