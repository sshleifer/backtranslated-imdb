I was frustrated. The film was a little predictable and did not live with all the plastering promotions in the box. It is said that the letters were well developed, the wind story was used on a unique premises and the room was quite upset but it was very missed for me. I keep waiting for that big AhhhhH or BOO! But it never came. Besides this, the film was poisoned by poor filming of poor special effects. Thus, using the atmosphere and audience imagination to create horror and mystery, the bad thing is not shown. If you are less qualified for budget but try to watch movies like Session 9 or thicker for a breakthrough movie.
