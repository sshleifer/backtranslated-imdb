When I first tuneed the news this morning, then I thought, "Wow, finally some entertainment." It was a little fun for a week ... but we have to face it, journalists in this newspaper (if they can call them anyway) but they can "play almost time". <br /> <br /> First, I thought Jillian breathe fresh air. But seriously, this woman has at least a bit of journalist in her. She is very unusual. When he told Stuove about specific news reports, he stopped the strike. It became really annoying that I could not see it again. <br /> <br /> Jillian is not a good journalist. Hell, a celebrity she loves to be a celebrity. Therefore, he converted immediately into a celebrity around celebrities who were supposed to be interviewed. She is not very professional and most people seem to be more important to her relationship with celebrities than being a properly dissatisfied journalist - and I can tell about her. <br /> <br /> (frustratingly), there is more entertainment news from this world than the news, government, the United States, or something that will serve the best of interest and / or public interest. They come off as a commercial product that focuses on the very sensationalism that they talk about. On the other hand, their field journalists are intensely tolerant ... <br /> <br /> I believe "Good Day" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and this is not for people who really care about this news. Side note: (I really want to see ktlA but they sometimes try hard to entertain, even though they are still a bit slow. Oh well, I'll be with NBC "Today" ABC's "Good Morning America "All right ... as long as Dian Sauer will not be very serious.)
