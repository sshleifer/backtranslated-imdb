OMG it was the most painful experience of my life. I could even finish it what is happening in Nick. That's about dropping Nick Nick and their best thing about teen nights and Josh and wind. Children's songs are annoying kinda and so are kids. My little sister wanted to see the show because she likes Disney or whatever comes next, but after showing this show, she said, "I've seen such a boring which looks the worst." My younger brother was asleep, I envy him. In short if you have no brain activity of 3 years old then you will not enjoy this show or else change the channel.
