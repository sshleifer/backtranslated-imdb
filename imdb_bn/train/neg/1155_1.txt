Never before has a movie directed me to write a review, but it was very terrible. I tried to find out about this picture that it chose the snooker as its first serious role, but in reality it was a poor choice. Made a good book, but of course it did not work as a movie for me. I saw this incredible, lack of atmosphere and I have kept many scenes hidden. It may be a musical intelligent but the actor can not act as an actor. Dylan was not enough to carry a weak plot with MS-Dermat and Rosemary Byan but transmissible but weak dialogue. Perhaps I missed the point completely but I did not fit it in any style, it did not sympathize with letters and it did not create any mystery. I actually prayed for the last and cried out loud. Three main character movements!
