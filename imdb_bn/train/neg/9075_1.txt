As a title to this film, Slacker was the graduate from the University of Dave, Jeff and Sam (Devon Sawah, Michael Marana, and Jason Segel respectively), who are graduating from the University, but successfully completed it. Unless it continues until the end, the film Nathan (Schwarztzmann)'s most preferred character reveals what they say. Nathan started blackmailing to associate with her dream girl because she could not move towards normalcy. The only problem is when three of them start working on it, Dave falls in love with the beautiful and well-hearted Angela (James King), unfortunately, not a great style movie. Schwarzmann makes the watch look as easy as its performance brightens. The average of King's performance, I think he is letting it be around with his gorgeous appearance. Slackers are memorable American Pieces with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as American Pie. But they are not used at all? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of fundamentalism. Overall, some sunny moments but in terms of acting (without Schwartzman) and subject to an awesome movie. * Out of *****
