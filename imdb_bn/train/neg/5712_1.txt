After sitting with this mound of goats, my husband and I wondered if a computer program could create a movie to see if it was indeed a test. It was that lazy and onset. But the American public campaign throughout the film proves - frustrating - it's the work of the people. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but we should steal the declaration of our independence for the sake of quotation, such as "ways to justify things like the Iraq attack". Etc. That's the line of Nicholas cage such as "I have never used the Declaration of Independence as an Exporter Chip" with a direct face, surprised me and my husband, whether the whole scene took the hall before the shooting. Every "logic" behind the plot and the new "formula" is really ludicrous and impossible to follow. And more Anyway, there is also a misusyny's bonus side plot with its name - everyone involved for "never stopped" is being intercepted. He only looks for movies only, but they "Dr." give some gravity to his character's title. At one point, the character of Cage says, "Do you ever stop?" And the camera looked at him looking at him as if he was a child. Really surprised The only benefit of this movie was that it is so surprisingly bad, you can get some smiles in it. The really scary thing is that people are enjoying watching movies with us. Creepy
