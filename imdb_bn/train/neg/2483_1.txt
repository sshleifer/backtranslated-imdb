Unfairly disagreeable Turkey, anti-Nazi music (!!), a mixture of pre-war America and Agatha Christie confuse a big, big problem: it is fatal. Besides single digit IQ The most amazing aspect of plots and dialogs, "Lady ..." is bed welding. Gene Wilder (star and co-writer) worked hard for it: He is a romantic lead (he looks at his face !! and his age !! He and Woody Allen start a club for fools, uneducated comedians), and he is trying to move And to be funny and disgusting and smart, and try to sing and dance, and no one is successful !! <br/> <br /> <br /> I thought that my myopia was fit, because everyone in the movie is telling Chery Jones that this cute hot chick, and Michael Comsty is this Impossible is the handsome stallion !! A man playing Clear Men's Clear Secretary is a sexy actress and an emotional motive for two main women! Mike Star has been one of the most incompetent, greatest police officers, and you deserve to be among the 10 most disgusting performers in recent history. Saddest note is to see the wonderful Claire Bloom and Barbara Sukowa completely miscast and offensively kidnapped. At least I hope both of them raise their bills with this flop (and later expose their agents). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director, this one study - otherwise stay away !!! 1/10
