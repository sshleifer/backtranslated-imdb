If you are surprised by the many ideas of conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the UN, Israel and international issues, see more. <br /> <br /> This is not a supernatural Hollywood movie that relies on some of the biblical passage. Instead, this movie was created by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a movie, the end result can be seen as clips outside of the television program (when family breaks and musicals breaks down when sperms are released). <br /> <br /> It can be strong belief for mainstream viewers, but many people believe in the literal sense of this stuff, presenting it as a movie. And that, perhaps, makes the movie important. You probably will not get a brief overview of odd views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So, if you see it, see it as a social / cultural document. If you are intelligent of all the media, you do not have to be cautious about the unreasonable efforts of filming and manipulation.
