I agree with everything I say about this but I have to add that the soundtrack is probably the best I've ever heard of throughout my life! When you are supposed to listen to the talk of the actors have real voices from time to time! And the voice is like a Broadway version of Danzig, "Dark in the Dark! Darkness of Darkness!" Or something else so stupid. The singer has a terrible vibrato and has been recorded with a trophal -Y microphone on some synthetized up string sections and mesh drum beats. It's awesome !! <br /> <br /> Yes, men's leads are awful. So women are more than ones. This gender stereotyping is a bad case - it's so bad! Everything they say is that men or women are getting closer, only playing the maximum stereotypes. Makes me sick Soho boring !!! <br /> <br /> The kids had so much holes on their lines, you do not understand. And why do women Scratch kids always wear beautiful hair on their hair, beautiful blue dresses and long hair? And Scratch boys always wear cleft cut slacks with cute little shiny blonde hair? Not terrible - Stupid. <br /> <br /> The daddy face was very painful and clear like a man in the cave. Beautiful beard and bangs, m. Are you spending your whole life with a knife or will you go to the city to roam? <br /> <br /> stupid movie.
