Made a very weak against all hope, sometimes painfully so, in the movie. It's Michael Madsen's first movie, and it shows, he's not good at it. Some people might find the story ridiculous; One alcoholic can understand his life and family separately, so he calls the preacher as the last resort to help. After telling the preacher his story, he took Jesus Christ into his heart. <br /> <br /> I actually found most religious scenes, such as Seyil Moi (Madsen) goes to a church but goes away from it, quite realistic. I love Sicil that his life is breaking and trying to get help, but realizes that God can help him. Eventually, he realized with God's help that he could go on living without drinking again. <br /> <br /> This movie can not be made well. Bad acting, the script might use some work, and looks worse than my home video, but it has a good message. Now, just being a Christian does not mean that you will be able to automatically stop an addiction or heal your broken family, and Cecil understands this and works hard to stay in the track. Overall, if one of your Christians would appreciate you how this film depicts Christianity and if you are not, then you can call yourself to know more about faith.
