When I went to the movies I used to live and see or if I do not like it, I go to sleep, but it was pure shit, I just stood up! .... it was bad script and together, I hate it. Also, they should not stop Brendan Fraussier, he was much better. I did not have the same hope as I expected, I think I love George's Jungle 1, and the graphics were the first such a bird, and it was never good to have crashed into a tree. I hope this director will pay attention, and he will make the next movies, he needs to reconsider ... awesome! I want to give Uralsa a good job as a good creator (until I go out) ... Overall, I give this movie 2 out of 10.
