I do not know who will blame, a terrible writer or a stupid director. It was one of the movies where they paid so much money to stars (Angely, Charlie, Denise, Rosanna and John) that there was not enough left to make a movie. It could be very entertaining, but the intensity of hanging over each scene, even the ugliness was. Since it got a rating, why was the public bubble bath shot with a 70-year-old woman and not Angelie Harmon? Why is the most attractive and sexual activity in the world to sleep through potential warm relationships with two? If they just smile, why did Hoopie drop off Goldberg and Judy Tenta? It was so hoped that the director was not five years old and was surprised to see. Not only for the audience, but also for the actors!
