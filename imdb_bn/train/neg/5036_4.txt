Sweet SIXTEEN (1983) ** ***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bow Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell In the city and it is not long before its death started almost close. Detectives played Friday 13th alumni, Dana Kimmel, organized by Nani Drew with the help of a good girl girl. Local Negative Americans are the main suspects because they seem disturbing the predicted civilians. These incidents all lead to the release of Melissa's 16th birthday party murderer. <br /> <br /> This lower average slasher is not very memorable. It's made for a TV, except for the title character's own pure theme song, without having too many scores, which couples around. Like the line, "the killer will turn us into a cottage." The standard eight fits in slasher screen display. Mercy calls Melissa a bad name, but immediately they develop friendships. Evidently Mercy shows how tough it is to fitness, because Melissa knows how to make up. This film will be tightly pressed with today's fifteen major characters and its directors will insert multiple unused close-ups. Social commentary on Indians was not taken seriously. I am very surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Sweet Soulin and the Bloody Birthday of Ed Hunt both have the ability to capitalize the honored tradition to create a strong tradition of birthday tradition, but I can not remember that it failed to deliver. But others expect the bright side of this kind of vague movies to be released in DVDs.
