<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The overall movie (forgiving) is already short, but it can be made by giving a little more attention to Mune Lion (one of its misses "Reference" How was it?) And his mistress worked more closely in small conspiracies. In short, the script was a good idea seed, but most recycling was needed. Second, it could work without irrational humor. The original was something that it could do without it, but at least it was almost a sensation - here, the lungs and the urine are wide. <br /> <br /> Third, the show is a little self-conscious. The original series was good enough, as did the first film, but here it is the right way, the path is much more. Brendan Fraser In Jokes is just a bit at the top (and why is not the mention of "New Urlsula"?). Other mess with the narrator, especially in the end, some interactions, also in good sense. <br /> <br /> Fourth, CGI work can be given a little more attention. First of all, it was difficult to know that Shampo was not a real elephant (without exception of course), but here the CGI stands like a painful pillar. Ideally special effects should be to tell the story only whether they are good or bad, and at least this count is successful, so this is a relatively small problem, but it is still there. <br /> <br /> Everybody says that Christopher Showman's performance as George is fairly decent. It lacked Brendan Fraser's attraction, but Christopher only failed in that particular comparison - even he directed George to give a personal depth, which was a big mistake in J Word-inspired movies but was not here. Julie Benz as the new Ursula surprised me as better than Leslie's standard. <br /> <br /> Most of the other performances were not quite standing out in my mind as a standard, good or bad.
