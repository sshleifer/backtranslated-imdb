The original Thunderbirds have achieved a place in TV history. It was, and still, a lot of favorites - in fact, the first 10 minutes of Wallace and the Groot film (Werbbitt) direct lift of Thunderbirds, the original Thunderbird 2 launch sequence (if you do not believe I do not believe it, get the movie and then get a copy of the original episode where Thunderbird 2 was launched). <br /> <br /> This film was a hypothetical attempt to make movies of children - when the original was loved and likewise enjoyed by kids and adults! In essence, Thunderbirds have spent time in their entire lives, who often became a victim of great language (yes, there were criminal laws sometimes). Thunderbirds do not risk their own life and resources at the risk of a reward - very perfect for heroism and selflessness. There was little physical violence. Thunderbirds challenged Kalpana to a degree - many of us would ever dream of building Thunderbird 2? And do not underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - many Japanese older Astrobows multiply their attraction with modest robots in cartoons. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a bad image of the original. This movie came as a shield between Thunderbirds and Lonnie Tunnels - I mean, we have Anthony Edwards that imitates the stuttering of the Purky Pig in the brain ????? Most of the tasks include Kung Fu / Power Ranger type war. Actually, the funny word was influenced when someone nailed their head with a frying pan. Our imagination-carrying technology was absent - instead of using a plot device that ran near our children, which was not in the original series (the entire group was closed together, putting the base based on the kids and the brain). Then there was a dose of "Use Force Look" when Tintin could raise some or some other, using aerodynamic with the hood that seems to have been taken from "Crowking Tiger, Hidden Dragon". The only thing for free is "Tintin, I'm your cousin" for the hood. There was a heart that made Thunderbird unique. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But Lady Pernylop, the actress came across as a child - HUH ???? <br /> <br /> And for this reason we hate this picture. When someone finds something popular on a fan base and guesses that fans can make money out of money to see and then supply something that the fans do not expect - well, I'm sorry, it's wrong! All right, so if they make a movie 'movie - fine' - the next time it distributes it directly to the video, where many of them are there. But a familiar wrapper is not up to the package and changes the interior.
