How many times can we see bad movies with a murderer of Skymappo? Although Bleed's plot is the root of the film, it is a complete failure. For one, the dialogue is poorly developed, it ruins a lot of time in annoying and small details, acting bad, etc. If I want my money back, this rental stinks worse than a scank.
