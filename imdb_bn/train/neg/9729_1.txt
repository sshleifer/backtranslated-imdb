Really, what is this? Hooper made classic films such as the Chanso massacre of Texas, then he made this horrible movie, what happened? He's a little dive in the crack too much? This film is about the father named Sam, who has the ability to set things in the fire, (Firestarter, someone?) The act was convicted, the plot was rubbish and special effects were very bad, they could see anything from 70. Van Dam is going to be happy that Darylade is not the worst movie ever, and what was the end? He started the bright blue, turned into a shining blue blob, sucked out his girlfriend's fire, and finished the film. What was that Oh? After the film's ending, I hope the DVD can spontaneously save me from my pain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stay away from this picture. <br /> <br /> Do not worry, oh, you thank me later.
