Hmmm ... where do you start? How is a serious actress like Demi Moore involved in such shit? The "first blood" can be identified as steam *** But this kind of nonsense is just rumba, tits, point. Of course if you are interested in Crafstream (Demi Moore just want to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals), the most stupid incognito I can think of, "GI Jane" is a great movie. The only acting of Viggo Martensen is that the film is portable but made in hell, I can not think of Demi Moore Rambo (especially the end, in vain, not 30 minutes). Ridley Scott is not eligible for this film to be associated with equal rights, it is simply an idiotic campaign for the American army and has dropped Moore to make it more interesting. Horror movie
