Quite simply this should not have been done. It's predicted and clich√©d's. The screen chemistry that makes the first "mother girl" is not available here, and is fully played and forced. The writing is going to be preferred, some 'memorable' lines such as "a savage customizing" are simply frustrating. Where "My Girl" enters the real feeling of sadness and some real fun moments, such as "My Girl 2" tries to revive those emotions created by the audience and sadly fails. I am working hard on this movie because of how big the first movie was, but in most cases it really insults its quality. Certainly it should come near the "son of a mask", which is one of the worst series of all times. In both cases, the old word is true ring; "If it does not break, do not fix it".
