I do not even review this movie, because it's not really a horror movie - and so on. The cheese is not worth the attention. At least, it's not horrible in the normal sense. It's certainly a terrible offer to waste your time watching this shit. That's why I stopped it after the first four hours. It is astonishing, when the clock shows that only 45 minutes have passed. Yes, all right; On simplic terms, this movie is B-ORING. <br /> <br /> There were many errors of "order", not all of them were unique. In particular, I think the main problem with the "religious" novels of Hari's films is the reluctance to add to Christianity on Hollywood's own terms. It is also quite possible to create a genuinely strange movie. Just ask William Peter Blatty. Indeed, without orthodox, such films are some of the filmmakers (usually neutral and illogical) fantasies-some of Smarsbybird. <br /> <br /> Think about it. If someone says the film firmly, physics, but only the basic laws of physics have not been wrong, but its entire plot is based on its wrong image, then soon you will be tired of fruitful plots. Similar to similar movies. In other words, "order" (and many similar films before that) invented the whole cloth stuff about the Catholic Church and Christian faith and efforts. Build a plot out of this discovery. Curiously, the plot ends up being incompatible and stupid. This movie has the charm added as interesting as seeing your titles growing. <br /> <br /> Avoid this steam shield.
