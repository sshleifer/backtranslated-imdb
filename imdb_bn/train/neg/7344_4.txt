It provokes a young girl, and then after her pregnancy, the story of her old, married lover falls; He through black magic, against himself, and his whole family, avenges ?? Which, frustrating, he does not work himself, but someone else works for him. Good production value for a Thai awful flick. But the Blend script never creates the mystery, the director goes completely forward to the object and the final law loses the sympathy of the audience by reasoning in the air. At one stage, only a villain of a character has a major chance to fire the dead, and instead he gets up and escapes without lifting the gun. Wrong writing ?? You're awake it! <br /> <br /> <br /> The effect of a somewhat strange pregnancy, in which a man who died from a truly washed dead-embryo-embryo dead body and hundreds of living eels exploded from his stomach. Only recommended for the critics who will see every horror film produced in Asia by the end of 15 years.
