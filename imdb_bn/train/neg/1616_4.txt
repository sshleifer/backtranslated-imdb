Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The second episode of these chambers leads to the story late in the 60s, where people now The South American hills have been able to remove its resistance fighters, survive without adequate food and water, and the tension in the group is increasing. When Bolivia crossed the border, everything comes from his head and the government forces carry out their campaign to bring him down. <br /> <br /> Without the flight of the last photo time and places, the second installment of Södörborg focuses on mountain action, and even managed to be a stupid experience. And more importantly, the score has drowned, in the second exchange gives artistic unexpected winds that prove only to be isolated. The only annoying wind in the movie that never gives up. You can not blame Soderberg's ambition or Dell Torre's drive in the main role, it is shameful that in some of the production areas, it is managed to take such a frustrating change somewhere. **
