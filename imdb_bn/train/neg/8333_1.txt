This is the worst movie of my life. Acting poor and storylines are almost understandable. Whether you like the discussion or any ship it is irrelevant. There is no film on special effects. The whole movie crew was probably in the boat outside the rough sea more than a studio and when some people "knocked" (if you can call it even it) their reaction is totally unrealistic. The guns are quieter than a mute How can this movie get two rewards, it makes serious questions to the mind of the people. Well thats about it It is more fun to see this review than reading the film. If someone is considering watching it or buying it, then I would suggest you seriously against it for obvious reasons. I have said that included a spoiler. If a few people become thieves and a gun is fired, a conspiracy giveaway. I think that's why they are the only good part of the film.
