Based on Seychelle and Ebert's review, I went to see this movie; I just did not make a fake, but I took some friends beside me, and I wanted to spend the rest of the day, apologizing for sitting with this pointless shit. After that, I have never visited a movie based on the advice of Siskel and Ebert.
