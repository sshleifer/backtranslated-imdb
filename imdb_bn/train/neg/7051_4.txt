A movie to deal with the problems of growing up, mind candy for those who like Blue Juice Surfing and Cornwal. SunPartway is the real star of this movie, though the more popular Catherine Zeta Jones plays her girlfriend, and Ian McGregor plays her drug addict Paul. <br /> <br /> For those who do not like the least surfing or Cornwall. It takes a long time before the movie indicates that it will be interesting. The beginning takes a lot of time in long shots of slow and little interesting landscapes. Plus too many major characters are leading their one dimensional. This plot is an interesting idea, but because of the shallow characters, you have no idea why they work in their condition. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br />
