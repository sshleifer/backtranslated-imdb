Each time I will rent a step / adventure movie to relax a bit and I will not grab my mind with something important. That's why I bought a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality movie, but it made me laugh and opened me for a while. Among these days, I would probably buy copies of Princess Bride and several Monty Python films. For the same reason, I hired this image because I wanted to entertain without the challenge. . In most cases I got what I wanted. The plot had something to do with a poorly written Xena episode, and Kathy Long's acting was not very bad for the community theater (professional kick boxer and amateur actress). Cyborgs had few high points in the part. In some way they got some nice actors playing bad boys - unfortunately, most of them died very slowly. <br /> <br /> Like most martial arts movies, you go to more movies, there is more emphasis on action, and the plot (which was not strong enough to start with) almost disappears as an act. However, more Cathy fights longer, the director devotes her back more time. At the end of the film, I was seriously considering to see each other how to calculate how many times the length of the Kathy Long's short red shorts was in the central screen. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there was not enough meat in it. The film was a pleasure to see the film as a curiosity for the second time. If you're a hard-core Xena fan you need to wile a few hours away - go all the way, go to the grocery store and spend .50 cents on rent. There are some strong matches between the show and this movie. <br /> <br /> Do not expect anything more than gently huffing for a few hours <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> You will have to choose Cathri Long's derri√®re. Then you might want to purchase a copy.
