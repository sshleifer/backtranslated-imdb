It is interesting that the novel of any plot has become the basis of the two films. Heresy was good, although not entirely correct, the adaptation Washington Square is a health handshake and bad acting, except for a part of Dr. Slipper, which can be so good. <br /> <br /> <br /> The directorial effort of creating a 'beautiful' scene is so obvious that I'm actually crying. There is no simple and straightforward beauty that can be a movie without any plots such as Wengin. I agree with Leigh's other remarks like Catherine's scripts, instead of being naive and shy; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But we do not have any say that we have a movie! I think someone has avoided adaptation classes in the school. <br /> <br /> I appreciate the effort of making a moving and moving film from a hard text but it does not work.
