Seriously, I want to say very seriously, when I started showing the first show, it seemed that it was good. But the plot just got worse. The story was very annoying or anticipated. George is not always funny, he sometimes works stupid. Her joke is overdone. His mother shows silliest character. How can a mother treat her own son in such a way, okay, if she is a daughter, then it was her own son. I gave this event 4/10 because the first few shows were a little fun. Actor Constance Marie and Messila Lusha do a great job. These shows do not know to get to play for so long. <br /> <br /> If you are really bored I was watching and there is nothing more to see, I suggest you see it.
