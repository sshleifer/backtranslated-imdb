I passed this title on blockbuster 15 or 20 times, looking for half-looking something beautiful. I can say that they were out of the night movie to rent at night. <br /> <br /> I'll give credit to jump better than Dracula 3000, but the reality is that this one is the Caper Van Dien to say it is easy to say. Other things were frustrations: an interesting custom, interesting story, good conversation and originality, but I think you can not get everything. <br /> <br /> *** *** Vampire hunters tried to find almost all vampires from mining colonies from mining colonies (one of which was vampire ... go fabulous). The crew is: Kaki, the Nee-Do-Well Captain (who died early), his book, still the inexperienced first mate, the vampire Hunter (not a typo) mentioned earlier, a Wannabe cowboy and, indeed, the young Asian commando, "Strong man" woman ... it sounds like a cast for MTV's The Real World. After the death of a massacre in a violent clash with Captain blood (and it turns out to be, lovers of physiological parts of the human being) his first companion ... bewilder, smoke, gradually ... everyone hates him .. Bla, Bla, .. I could go, but I said it used one of the same style 'style lines'. <br /> <br />'s effect was Cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (not yet typewrite) was quite hot, but of course if you are looking forward to more than his clauze, see elsewhere. I can not say it. I saw that the worst movie was, I actually paid 'Starships Troops 2', but I was waiting for the Saa-Fi Channel.
