When I saw a glimpse of the title, then I thought we were going to get another hard-hip slash, but actually I found "7 inch 5a", it could be a lightweight passable and almost 80 percent suddenly came up slowly in mid-second . Speed ​​for the final half-hour leading to the leading tacky climax leading to it leading and finishing. It will not win the awards for the originality, because you can get it and status as a thinner from the thrills (normal jumpy scares), location (solitary palace) and the motivation of other films. The impressive aspect is through the book and the element is quite hackneyed with its wide plot and weak red deer in the fireplace scripts. Sometimes ridiculous, but nevertheless I was largely entertained due to his cruel and grisly activities of brutal violence towards non-overwhelmingly annoying college students by a psychological killer with a war trunk. The performances were not bad at the size of a lively young cast, but the letters they portrayed were not particularly bizarre. An ever-presenting presenter Roger Lower shows a very supportive role as a grizzled detective. Made a slickly, but folded a shallow and forgotten addition.
