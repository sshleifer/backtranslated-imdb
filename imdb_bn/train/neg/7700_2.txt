I saw the movie here last night, but I think it was the largest one. Secondly, what I saw in the movie was far from text, even before I thought what I thought was like a comedy type movie. The movie movie is not funny: Feenz hit his girlfriend, beat The film was a very long way - if you want to sleep and it's wonderful when you wake up it will end and it will still be played! Some reunion items were too much for capturing - like singing a lady - I felt I'm seeing a spiritual song show here! Come on Perry, you can do better!
