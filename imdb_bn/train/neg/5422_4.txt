What failed to do "noise" to get us to understand its character Team Robins plays a cruel New Yorker who can not cope with the city's conflicting crystals and especially car alarms. This is an extraordinary idea for a movie, which has as much creative credibility as "wanting death". It is tricky at points; Especially a scene that our hero is trying to read through Hagel, "I'm too stupid to understand this." He reads a paragraph in confusion and reads again, we read it and we do not even get it. Only then does a car alarm stop. Alarm across the film and the city shore is a constant interference. Although it does little to help us all understand our hero, who gets confused with side plots instead of destroying their marriage and digging deeper his personality. <br /> <br /> It is very unknowable to notice the sound creation of the movie, the miserable editing and the visible bum mixes. No, "Noise" is not bad at all. William Hart is at least colorful. Do not fall at least the last plane. Overall it runs a logical point at home, you probably did not think. At least I was not. All in all, ninety minutes long, it can not end soon. The story goes on and starts to lose as soon as it starts. <br /> <br /> One of the films that you might see in a movie festival may not be chosen for distribution. If you see someone involved in the project really partly check it out to the DVD. Otherwise, avoid it.
