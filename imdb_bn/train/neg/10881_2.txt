My friend's mother was working at a video store and she got a preview of movies before she came out, so when she comes home convent, a horror movie, I could not wait to see it. Although it seems scary, but in reality, I can say that it is strange that I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, acting is bad, and yes, this is the cheapest movie I've ever seen, but it's very funny! "What, are you smoking CA-RACK?!" I do not know this movie was also released ... I thought it was too bad ... <br /> <br /> Yes, so ... the movie is very bad overall (you have to accept it more at least) but I I promise, you get a good smile from it. <br /> <br /> * This movie has been purchased but it is good to laugh ... Especially the man who keeps the 'bandit' frustrating 'Despair' scars!
