Without the desire to be a murderer, Brad Sykes is responsible for at least two inferior and clinched films. I saw it - one of these, and Camp Blade is another. <br /> <br /> The actress is terrible, the print is lazy, and everything about this movie is shouting "Seriously, you can do better yourself". Is it a challenge for everyone to satisfy YouTube with your own Jumpy Cat? <br /> <br /> I bought it for Â£ 1, but remember, you can not pay 71 minutes of your life. You will also do well to avoid this Turkish, even at the cost of the basement.
