Because to describe the objectives of these filmmakers, the word 'cruel' will be the only sound of existence. Where do you even start? B * tchiness in a spout, I'm going to start acting this terrible almost everyone around this movie. That scratch. Near that sentence does not belong. I can not even think of a character that was well illustrated. However, in all fairness, it is almost impossible to successfully illustrate these zero dimensional letters. Still, the girl who played Catherine (whose name I did not intro - I did not see it since) does not exist, the bad actors I've seen remain, only a person who played with Sebastian. The story was horrible to God. It tried to reflect the brightness of the first but failed in many ways. Most of it was in vain - although I would admit that the plot twist was great, its surprise. And the last was a little ridiculous at the end. But this picture I have seen with the worst. Do not see it. Just not It has absolutely no value for watching. None. It only takes away the first pleasure.
