I got the DVD very cheap and I'm almost crazy, and this is probably the only star where this movie can never be interested. <br /> <br /> The first Drew movie, she looks very nice, and she gets quite a lot of her beautiful scenes, such as a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, several sexy outfits etc. He never sees the friendly charm we have ever seen from his recent movie. <br /> <br /> The film is quite beautiful or sub-average, and it's more like a movie than a movie. No real horror or tension is created and dialogues are often chessy. <br /> <br /> The best part is probably the end because I can not tell the truth. But probably will not understand anything about it. But at least you are hoping that what you are hoping will not end and it is also expected that it will be available much earlier. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think this movie is specially meant for the drawers.
