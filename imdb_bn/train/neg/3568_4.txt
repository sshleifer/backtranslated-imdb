The truth is that a film based on Harold Robins is not going to win any prize. This is no exception. "The Lonely Lady" is a pure B photo of budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a TV movie for a made. The acting is very uneven. Joseph Kali is particularly appalled. Anthony Holland is an embarrassing one. A reviewer told Catherine Hepburn a certain performance, ranging from A to B. M. Zodorama is operated in G. The rest cast (and their waste is lost in their respective roles) Lloyd Bolchnar and Bibi are well-qualified to live. Nevertheless, the whole thing can be a fun fun way to sort through a trash. Befits as ropin, rolling everything gender and nudity. If you are looking for some fun ... and you're not too cool ... it may be for you.
