I was studying in Catalan and was delighted to find El Mur in a film containing most Catalan conversations in my Art-house video store. <br /> <br /> Hmmm ... it's not very happy to see it. <<br /> <br /> Yes, other critics said it was beautiful, and neatly photographed. Although the opening order of children is a violent, it's good acting and trustworthy. (Most of the time ... Melkarinas prepare to bury the dead in the middle of the city square in the full view of the 10-year-old boy's dead?) Oh, good .. Minor detail. At this time, it was the feeling of the geographical geography of a non-magical pan, which was also established in the Spanish Civil War. <br /> <br /> is fast approaching, and the three children who have survived the event have come here. Francisco is working in a tunoclosys panoramic and the two boys are Manuel and Ramalo patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen. <br /> <br /> The problem, with so many Spanish cinemas (Almodovar fans forgiveness), with an exception (Francisca) characters just so flashing * kinky *. Their intentions, personality, and dialogue are often straightforward. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Prepare for plenty of pain and blood. The critic who called it a "potboiler" quite well. If it was made 40 years ago, then the poster would say: look forward to love !! Rape !! Murder !! Mutilation !! Bigotry !! Animal cruelty !! Treason !! <br /> <br /> The first letter is not enough to create credentials and relationships. To work, there were multiple flashbacks of meat out of these characters. For example, it seems to be a distraught and boring cross between "brother sun, sister moon" and "pop fiction". If you find something you enjoy, enjoy all. I think that I'm going to take something that I do not feel, I need to take a shower to get rid of thunder and depression. <br /> <br /> For Catalan it is a dialect of Malayariki, a relatively different dialect than Barcelona, ​​although I am surprised by this comment that even the Barcelonans even clearly understand it requires Catalan subtitles.
