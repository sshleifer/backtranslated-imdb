I'm so humiliated by this movie, it's not even funny ... and I thought "Mulan" was incredible! But Disney's my expectations are low, I figured I would never do anything so stereotypical they figured. There is no respect for any genuine Chinese culture, only Hollywood's tradition of Random Martial Arts. <br /> <br /> I am thankful that they tried to turn Wanderer to a normal teenage girl ... but fortunately, the most normal teenage girls - especially Asian girls - are very less obscure with these shallow aspects of life. And from a cultural stand point, it's almost impossible. Yes, there are girls who are popular and fashioned, but they are very rare. And even those are still the perfect decent scholars. Another stereotype, maybe, but a fairly true one. Because how the parents work. That's how Chinese works in the price If they want to go for authenticity, they develop Wendy's glasses with a satirical girl and a love-hate relationship with her family. <br /> <br /> This is my disappointment with American films only. Asian culture is not like the meditative and vague, nature-based phrases that are intelligent. We are not often walking with a laughing smile and we all do not know some form of martial arts. We are a man, and if someone wants to write a part of Asia, I will realize it, which does not portray us as some sad illustration.
