I do not know how to describe this movie. It's certainly one of the weird movies I've seen in a long time. It's very annoying at times but boring at other places. The dental torture scenes are very wide and can attract anyone with gore and holes. I found myself holding my teeth during some of the above scenes. The tricky thing about the movie is that we play with fear and the dentist is so annoying. <br /> <br /> This humor may not be confused with anything else. But if you enter into strange and strange entertainment and tooth dust, then it is only the movie that you are looking for. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you read the comment and are attracted by such entertainment, Try! <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10 (Probably a little weird for my taste)
