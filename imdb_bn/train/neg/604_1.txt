I was so disgusted in this movie, I was forced to warn others. There are no stories, plots, or purpose hints in this movie. After the film's release, the role of the film "Let The Horror Becoming", which has so far become accustomed to the viewers of each movie. So we can completely ignore the start. We soon got to know the main actress and at the moment it has become clear to you that you have only ruined your hard work and will be better than static watching. (Unless you have seen white noise - EEK) is a discordance of acting and all of them have to go back to the traveling pantoemime. It says that the world's best actors will be able to see this movie remotely. Their poor performance only contributes to disaster. Uninterrupted violence and what I can guess is another chronically "unreal" writer, who may think himself as an artist, its written word has become a movie that will test your patience. My colleague Voucher told me to come back to me, "We are seeing it for 45 minutes." Did I realize that this film is thin and tasteless like a cup cup without a tea bag? Apparently something was missing and unfortunately it was not the audience. Instead of conveying what the film is missing, tell me what to say: Fooled blond (wonderful surprise), hunting, bad-monster-man-stuff, about 2 minutes of story that stretches for hours, days, weeks, months ... and Credit <br /> <br /> Want a silver lining? Well, the blonde girl is somewhat visually sticky, but hopefully her face will be closed for the rest of the picture!
