The band camp was awful, the wolf was a bit better, and this third seems to be the same quality as the direct American Pie franchisee DVD predecessor. After losing his virginity, Eric Stefler (John White) was separated from his girlfriend, and now he and Eric's cousin Dieuet (Steve Talele) are attending Mike 'Quayz' Kozemman (Jack Segel) College. Beta House promises many party commitments, plenty of warmth and enough hot girls, they have five listed jobs to become government beneficiaries. But there is a threat to the rival GEK ("GIK") house, driven by a greater and better power-hungry power-hungry Nerd (and sheep warden) Edgar (Tyrone Savage) than the BITS. Once it was decided, Beta and Geek continued with the banned war, for forty years, Greek games defeated each other and continued with the sufferers. The game's last champion, Noah Levenstein Urmi Jim's father (only regular Eugene Levi) runs the show, that people shed brass, flutter dip in the water, catch a greasy pig, and face Russian roulette cartridges. Older horse spunk, female carry and drink a full keg drink (with disqualified pond). When it suddenly comes to death, a guy gets a stripper lap dance and has to compete at least, winning the beta house, when Adger dresses with sheep in his neck. Christopher McDonald of Flabber as Mr. Stefler, Magnificon as Ashley, Dan Petroniievic as Bell, Nick Knock as Bobby, Cristine Burger as Mario, Italiana Richie Laura Johnson, Mossana Halbert Sara Callman, Sarah Power Dennis, Andrea Pancreas. Stacey and Jordan Prentice as stones. The amount of nudity has increased slightly, as it is roughly about Jokes, and I can assume that it has been rated from five stars, but I like it. Enough!
