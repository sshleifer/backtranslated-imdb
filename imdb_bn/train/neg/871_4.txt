Nicholas Walker Hall, Paul, the local city of Reverend with whom Maratha (Ally Shady) has married, but decides to fake his own death to escape with a habitual feminist and his current death, Veronica (Dara Tamanovich). However, doing so, he gets a bit of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland also holds a crazy old dog that pins for galaxies by means of "infrequent" way of "reverse" means. It's sad to see a nice beautiful cast throwing like this. At least bit John Savage is not a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy personal investigator. In a movie as a 'black comedy', one has been told to bring both elements to the movie. Although it brings the ancestors to the east, sadly it does not contain any of the later. Additionally you emphasize any of the characters and thus, there is no vague interest among them. Technically a bad movie together is just a highly forgotten one. <br /> <br /> I. Candy: Dama Tomanovich gets helpless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /> <br /> My grade: C- <br /> <br /> I saw it: Showtime Showcase
