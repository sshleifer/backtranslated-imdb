I saw this whole movie saying something about it ... or I This is not a good movie. Actually terrible But I kept my attention to the dangerous method that saw such a tragedy and was not like looking away. This has created a great MST3! <br /> <br /> Most of the things that make the movie terrible here are enjoyable: bad dialogue, inappropriate music, organized plot sequence, ridiculous disguise. You will be pleased with the sequence of deaths of slo-mo, thrilled poor people and facing the humiliating bondage rescuers of their death, many more time to think about their upcoming condemnation. Your heart will be warmed by the old action scene cliches when two women struggle for a gun and stop it, but the WHO shot? Look at both of themselves, then the other, then themselves, then (seemingly after 15 minutes), one finally goes down. You will sing along with street carolers (in Latin), which will turn into a deadly death-songwriter that for a moment, threatened to turn this movie into a curved music. <br /> <br /> So if you believe that they are even better when movies get worse, then this may be a good choice for you. It's not as funny as my current Skyfire Sculler, but it's more fun than Roudie Roddy Piper's "Live Live", but it's more like the Loomu-warmer films like Owen 2 or III. <br /> <br /> I give it 10 out 4
