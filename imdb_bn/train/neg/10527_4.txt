I discovered this movie with OOP's retail retailer. And this one is certainly an OOP. Exorcist One year later he returned to business with this movie but what we all had to do was that Blair never broke into the career, he did not become a mega star. Among its many movies, it is OOP. She gives this movie a better performance. It is rejected by its parents and they have no friends. Playing at the age of 15, the 14-year-old girl is funny The film was also known for the rape of the rainy season, they kept a boomstick on her virginity. It is cut in most editions, I do not know, no blood involved, okay, Blair has a naked butt, but nothing is shown, nor is it TRA, so that people can not be insulted. But the movie is slow, very slow. It's not naturally happy to me, but I almost slept. It is becoming rebellious against the 14-year-old society, but there is no blood flow, there is no excuse. This is still a surprise to me why this is classified into horror. If you are a fan of Blair, then buy it, if it leaves it otherwise, then buy it.
