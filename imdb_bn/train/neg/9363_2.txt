This movie has some serious flaws, it is incredible to see how anyone can safely walk through the door behind an extremely safe treatment facility. Then this same person just surrounded this facility and said. Entering its office, just bad writing or bad editing. <br /> <br /> Very very expected movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how this film was produced, except it was portrayed in Canada and perhaps it received a government grant. <br /> <br /> I said, Aaron Karun did a good job playing with Montyath. <br /> <br /> As long as you are really annoyed and do not have anything to watch on television, I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it's a movie or actors want their resume.
