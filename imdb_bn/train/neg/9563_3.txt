It relies on the original 80's hit ideas. It is destroyed by a UV at the beginning as we see a base in Afghanistan as set in modern day. <br /> <br /> and wherever the image sharks jumped. UV is not armed. They may be but I do not think it has ever been tried for real. We see a computer that has mastered this operation, whose name is R.I.P.L.E.Y. We are the "hacker" Will Fermer (he is good at chemistry and electronics, which does not make him computer hacker) and hacking's first attempt, which is not a complete failure of his IP address. Logged and ani guessed those who supposed it We meet Wilson's mother who works for the chemical company. <br /> <br /> The money-laundering Will (Mr. Masood) hack from his neighboring bank account (he helped set up the account), then we can get it back to the original film against the Battle of Global Theronowner and they play dead code. . The trail in the RIPLEY office is not a test, but Massude's PC was so vulnerable to the will that they were collecting evidence. <br /> <br /> Why is the translation machine shutting down not explained (she just plays an online game?) and why she felt the need to shut down all the blocks in the entire block as well. Why a counter-terrorist organization will see it as a viable goal is extremely suspicious. RIPLEY to activate her mobile phone? I do not think it was connected to the PC, and the message will not really stand until it actually answers the phone so there is worse "hacking" than science. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Massude will not find a car license plate as a "hack" as you do not see him break the DMV computer. There is no authority to arrest or detain the replay agents who have taken Dennis at the airport to get will. Mother's mother was not "stealing chemical and biological agents". Even if he does not have the right to arrest or detain Dennis. Patriotic law or <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> The computer has gone bad and all the activities against the will, its mother and Dennis are not approved by the government agency. Phone Freak We see the first exhibition of any hacking skill in Will Do, Movie, we have also got a hack in the Replayy which seems very easy for a powerful system. <br /> <br /> There was nothing to do with RIPLEY and ridiculous concepts of "people" airports at the airport and on the streets that RIPLEY could track a cell phone when the underground computer seems to be reading the lips. <br /> <br /> Another mention of the original movie when they refer to Stephen Falken as the designer of System Replay instead of Joseph Project. We discovered that the "guy" ran to Fanny (the original actor did not play with sadness), who was trapped in his own death. <br /> <br /> We also see WOPR as "What's going on". Beat RIPLEY and they hold the same used voice. Falcon and WOPR are rarely destroyed after very little use (the same explosion will kill Will, Annie and Russian) It is not that they will create a custom computer system that has the ability to drop or drop chemical weapons. <br /> <br /> The whole "disconnect" plot and concept is completely unbelievable. The other main lead is to go through. So the other ridiculous and unbelievable <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> IP hacks against the Rippel are completed by will. No, he only communicates with one of his friends, who advises and applies the concept. It is very ridiculous to get the login from the increase of the will RIPLEY's operating temperature. (Especially after the bits have been released) Josh Holding it, it was an incredible cop-out and a very frustrating writer screaming, which had no idea left and wanted to get and finish this movie. <br /> <br /> There is a terrific good where RIPLE Y is playing the dead code and We are seeing a countdown (saying 17 minutes) and then say "please disconnection between 30 minutes" when they can not keep up with their own timer. The Replayy attack mission against Filipelphia has been postponed (much easier than my opinion) and it decided to attack Joshua in its internal circuits and re-attack the missile targets in Philillay Washington where the Replayy stays. The concept of nuclear exchange to RIPLEY will not understand what he is doing (he must already know if he gave insight into Joshua, he learned this lesson in the original film)? Original movie <br /> <br /> Replayy repeats in their cop-out, repeating the exact same words of Joshua and ending the end of the original movie shows how many real ideas they can come up with. <br /> <br /> If you want to look at the fingers for bad and stealthy ideas, men will blame Randall Badr and Rob Kerner. This is a horror movie and the best is avoiding.
