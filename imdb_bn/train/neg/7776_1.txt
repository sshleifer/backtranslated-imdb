What a load of garbage .. I can not even start to describe how terrible this film was. It's really hard to believe its rating here. Avoid <br /> <br /> ... especially if you enjoy the first ginger snap. The first one is well written, well-directed, well-executed. A brilliant film with an amazing aesthetic and atmosphere. The second was 'Alright' - honest like a self-permanent film, but obviously not up to the first level ... Thirdly, the shame in the series. I lose films: 10, 6, 1. It's bad. <br /> <br /> Yes, and yes it has been really set in the past, sisters are still called ginger and B Fitzgerald ... with all the muddled some semi-assed Native American myths. Sisters have no real story, or progress, even a clear relationship ... They are just trying to survive and 'get together forever'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The action was terrible - people are not seen anywhere from anywhere, roaming around and roaming around a woman and working on a brain native American woman. With a wide candle-wind setup, sitting there, sitting there. The set was terrible, it could not actually move away from it, which really does not help. Also, there was consistently snow outside the camp, but inside a trace (on set ..). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, so bad! I was really hoping it would be as well as the second.
