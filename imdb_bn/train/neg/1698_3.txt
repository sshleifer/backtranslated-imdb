Lynch People have some really great things! He knows how to disturb us, then in our various ways thinks of us rewarded. This, however, is quite different. Dumbland's Award 1% unreasonable comedy, 99% gaining acquired by stupidity. I could once smile, but somewhere around the episode 4 I saw to go fast. Do not miss a thing. I felt relieved when it ended, and that is part of the point with this series. It's a boring series of annoying characters of annoying characters in annoying situations, annoying animations, voices and rounds with words. But the recognition of this and his other irrational qualities still fails to fit Dumbland.
