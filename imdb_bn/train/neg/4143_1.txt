I and my other half trash were the big fans of horror fans we could not resist finding a movie that was both great movie! But it's a disgrace for Freddy Vessel Jason's Rip off cover for the 2004 film! The worst movie I ever saw but laughing to see if you were able to sit through it! <br /> <br /> Actually the effect was ... ... I could actually do better in my camcoder so bad that they were annoyed only to face the body and to release neck, hands, etc. A storyline, a strange flashback that does not create any sense and horror scripts! <br /> <br /> "You have broken my teeth!" From a vampire "You broke my cigar" was the reaction of a person who had seen uncle from Jesse, Santa, with Santa!
