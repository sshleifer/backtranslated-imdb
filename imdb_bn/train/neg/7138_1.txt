Acting awesome This film makes the appearance of an Academy Award-winning film fast and furious. They throw a few boobs and butts out there trying to try and keep your interest despite very less weak and conveyed stories. There is a reason why people do not download this movie on the Internet. This movie sinks like an iron turd. Do not rent your time or even download it. This film will always be a PERMA-TURD. I'm dumber for now I've seen it. Actually this title should now be referred to as "PERMA-TURD". It is a taunting and insulting of calling a film.
