This movie was so bad that I could not sit through it without doing anything else. There was no plot and no point. I was completely annoyed and for a movie about Comedian's stand up, I could not remember the story of a fun or funny line. Politicians can not be less entertaining with the technical jargon to say any curiosity. <br /> <br /> So how was it made? Does the film have any quality control? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was so funny that he did not have the fun in this film, so it's important to write an effective comedy.
