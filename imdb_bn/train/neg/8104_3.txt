Yes I know the shots, but how can this movie critically critique the collection of signals in 'depth' (political unrest, love / desire) (see 'American beauty'). Kaufmann's movie plaques with lazy sex scenes were often associated with the sequences of painful dialogue (in one scene I used to count three different generic European languages ​​influenced by the actors) and the state's exhibition could do so, but failed to combine them into synchronized meditation, and Kunda proposed three long hours After it is almost completely shiny on franzes Is driven plot is located in the heart of the emotional spectrum, and the display of the love triangle is the fourth part of the book is dedicated to the process and to the strength of love. It also failed to include the token screen time for Thomas's son, some novels in the novel used in the novel are used in novels, for example. Combined with Overwatch Soundtrack, these flaws make the movie lightweight for three hours incredibly spontaneously.
