Wow, I can not believe that people consider this 'good' movie. Now, I've seen a lot of bad, but there are many romantic comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is the best one in the middle film. Acting was not terrible, but not great, for the romantic comedy, there was little emotions, little romance. There were many loose edges that were not shown or not fixed. Unfortunately, the main characters come off as complete cowards. They do not understand themselves well enough that they do not love people associated with them. We do not know how they love? Both the characters have to leave their meaning by the complete lack of remorse. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> Both of these will get cold feet, and if you do not end up with the wedding scene, you will feel more romantic than every drop. Promise once other like hot potatoes. This film is actually two people who can not do anything, in contrast to the letters of Kasak, who wanted to make a deep commitment (Martin Lloyd, Grossess Pinck Blanc, etc.). <br /> <br /> The greatest failure of this movie is the complete lack of a twist or full interest. After the film ended, I felt they failed to include a climax in the story, which basically fits the entire film: boring. There is no doubt about whether the two will end together, when they do not have any joy, their actions do not produce any results. <br /> <br /> It is so sad that people are so blind in the ruthlessness of this film, that they are just 'all very well-known' with no criticism! Criticism of this film is undoubtedly neutral, only neutral test. There is a lot of romantic comedy, even with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie St. <br /> <br /> If you think this film is great but try these movies, your heart will explode: Princess Bride, say something, Grosse Point Blank, High fidelity, Believe, Charade, Rear Window, Northwest Answer, or there is something about Mary (which is a good test of today's standard romance).
