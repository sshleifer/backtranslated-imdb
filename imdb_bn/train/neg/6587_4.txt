As we tried to close his eyes, we found a dead body in the morgue, but the efforts he tried will not be open. After that we will move forward in the future and we follow a group of friends in the East School who hide a terrible secret secret, but suddenly they start to pick one after another in terrible way. Through flashback we learn a shameful girl's terrible suicide that was trying to be one of the group, but she was stopped by them because they threw her past and discovered some strange phenomena. So, he wants to take revenge from the grave? <br /> <br /> What a wonderful and always wonderful story! Well, hopefully I can say that. And 'hoping' it was as good as it was. This is a forgotten, so supernatural horror stream that I've seen before, but I was thinking that it was my first visit. So I'm not surprised when I started to pick up some things, but I said it was a forgotten mix that it felt like seeing it again. "Nightmare" is just another field area that adds a 'few' changes to the grill. Oh, please give me a little more freshness. It does not have to be completely original, but it is a source and mostly tired J-Hor Flick. Although it string along the usual ghost story but you have guessed correctly ?? An evil look, the spirit of retrograde chick. <br /> <br /> But despite my negativity, the same old, same old stories and jolts. It's a time of entertainment, when it's suddenly gone and scattered in some scary visuals. Death scenes are clearly shown with bites and some originality. However, the toxic environment triggers the audience with light. The scene of terrorizing one of the girls is a bloody experience, but in reality when it is not trying to frustrate you. I found it to be a coma-education and I found a few shot-eyes. It might be rigid, but it's just that the moment in the shock does not go anywhere in any interest. You can say that the supposed mystery is not more than one, the uncertain story is simply flat and characters are not really a self-centered group that you really care about what can happen to them. Wicked story should have been more focused on soul than these vague characters, who have a vague group relationship. It became overly muddled and it took just too long to get it when it comes to climax, it's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> you run a fine line of acting, but Gyu -RI Kim's role is strong strong. <br /> <br /> It's nothing new and it steals shamefully ideas, but if you can see past it distributes some nasty thrills. Although, despite the strange effective coolness, it is found rather neutral handling. I assume all the rounds of a quality effort, but still it is equally missable.
