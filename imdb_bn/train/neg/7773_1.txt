This film was a good compound word: 9 people are afraid of winning one million dollars. Unfortunately, it does not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are too long and dancing like dance scenes. Some scenes are an excuse to point out the camera in the female body part. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their horror. It is a strange fact that in the end of the movie it was turned into 5 minutes west and in the end, the twists, which were a few of them, did not reveal the senses with the rest of the movie. It seems that the director added the right stuff because he thought that it would be great, when it would easily ignore the plot of the movie. It's not just a lot of knowledge. The only strange thing was to dance down the hall, but it did not even have to make it for the zodiac.
