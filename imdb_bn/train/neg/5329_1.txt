As a true Elvis fan, this film is total embarrassing and the script is a disaster. The film hopes for something special from viewers with the opening of the beautiful boy "Stay Away" and Grand Canyon scenery. Elvis gets the picture and his talent is wasted big time, especially the rest of the songs featured. I'm sitting through this movie twice, just to make sure it's a part of junk! 1 out of 10 !!!
