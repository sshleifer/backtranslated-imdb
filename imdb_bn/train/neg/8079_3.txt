Yet another movie may fall on the right side of an interesting court and some wonderful special effects trash. <br /> <br /> earns a truly stinker's rating in the annoying aspects and performances (the lovely Anabella Shuffle exception which is a brunette and probably worthy of many virgins as good material, and the greatest of all times Charlton Haston). <br /> <br /> It's wonderful to see how Hemant performs its normal par and show how this movie is really bad. Even if he plays a sub-plot, which is how I enclose the original line of the movie. They did not do the way they solved. It just fell off the end. <br /> <br /> Really. Do not waste your time on this one.
