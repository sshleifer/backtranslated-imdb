OK so I got to know about this movie and I had seen the preview read almost all the reviews and it was a difficult time to debate whether it was watching. I even thought it was psychologically awkward before I even saw the movie. I was reluctant to see if I would see it and be disturbed for a long time. So I liked to take this risk and saw it and thought about it: At the beginning, the fine started for me. It started heading in a decent direction. The rape scene has gone past and I could not think why this picture is so annoying or annoying. I do not think the rape scene is just as tragic and scary, but it does not really disturb me from a dramatic point of view. Then came to the middle and saw that the boring stuff was running. There was nothing like a 5-minute shot, but people are saying nothing! This is a shot where a person shows no emotion, but this film did not have it. There were 3 continuous scenes in it, where you go out of the original character of Maya character, but it does not show up correctly that I want to move faster. Then it was not so annoying but still little dust when she involved the hardcore partition. Oh and as a note Rosario Dawson has still done a great job. All right, so at the end of the middle of a point separation, the revenge for retaliation came to Maya. Thats where it got boring. I did not feel bad for him or he did not get anything he deserved, but the whole scene was really annoying and I felt after all this one. I can not really tell you whether or not the movie is seen or not ... so I do not know that I can not find a word for this number. But if you choose to view it, do not be inappropriate.
