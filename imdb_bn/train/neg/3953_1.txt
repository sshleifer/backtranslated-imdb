I can not believe that this picture can be made. These people should be out of the drug and beat with curved objects. They should be tortured. This image is a cruelty. This is nothing but footage from the first picture. Whatever makes the original weird and no sense. It's like some kind of drug addiction. Likewise, what to do with a bed on a mirror nude therapy Also, by combining this distress, no body was irritated to see the first film, because it called Susanna's love character in Natalie during Natalie. I felt like screaming on the screen, "LACEY IT, IT LACEY !!!!". I out of it 10 out of 50- My Allah !!!!
