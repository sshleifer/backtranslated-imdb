It was not enjoyable to see. Frank keeps all his dreams in the back burner and gets his usual (annoying!) Work so that his statistician film can go to school, but his stopson decides he will create an insulting documentary about the man instead. A documentary filmmaker dictates the camera and shoots simply, does not have to manipulate and comment with SNAP captions. The filmmaker's bitterness and annoyance towards his father-in-law is clear. And sad The target is considered frank and kind to frank, instead he has come to the most people in 3 people. <br /> <br /> Originally a smoking campaign is as smart and progressive as the most. It really is. This made me feel a severe dislike for the filmmaker.
