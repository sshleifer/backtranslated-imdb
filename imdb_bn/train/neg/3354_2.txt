My opinion is that when you decide to recreate a very good movie, you should try to do better than the original; Or at least give it a fresh point of view. Regarding the 1963 Robert Wise Sheryl Jackson's novel "The Hunting of Hill House", the value of the admission price is still today. Now fast forward 1999 and re-create I shook my head and asked, why? The acting difficulty, the story seems to be unreasonable and replacing the fine wounds of special effects that the computer can generate on the whole point. I heard that this update was bad; But considering the source material, could not believe that was bad. I was roasted. After seeing this and telling my wife how horrible it was, she said; "Well they got your money!" He does not get them, right there. There is no profit to reproduce hateful, perhaps they will stop making them or come in a high standard that will not insult their audience.
