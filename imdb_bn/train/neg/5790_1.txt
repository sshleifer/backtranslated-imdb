This movie is ridiculous. Nobody is saying great acting and casting does not look fantastic even in medieval movies. The first five characters you played are definitely terrible to meet. Lame I think all other "provocative" comments should be made by people involved in the filmmakers. I was not very impressed by the story, but wanted to see some beautiful villages in Oregon, and there were some decent paintings - but the cast was something but inspired. I think this movie generally creates a spider of encouraging advice that deeply in American culture has been ignored and probably lost and it is worthwhile to revive, and possible. It's a joke and keeps jokes in all very obvious places, and thinks it's written by the state department or something. Drawing board back. Even for the same area of ​​classics like Harold and Maud, this movie has been completely obstructed, and this film has begging and demonstration and "fun" in the same line as well as the same movie demands.
