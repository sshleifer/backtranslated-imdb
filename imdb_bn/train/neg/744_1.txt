The holy freaking god is all lazy-Almighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was in Drugs. Badly ... The role of acting was several times I saw the poorest things. This movie was more than the G-string's Lord, IMHO (this is a real movie). Most movies are done on an awesome green screen. When my favorite part was in the car, you could say that there is no horse. They are fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it's a far-off shot switch with a ridiculous CJ horse. And generally it seems to be sub-par in 1992's Bound of Minds Eye. I mean, come, really. Like the horrible episode of Hercules, it can save Kevin Sobo apart. worst. Movie Ever.
