I'm sorry, but TJ Hooker's Adrian Jemed could not even save this Situation. I went through half the movie thinking that it was a fool of the original. Then came the wild and spoiled motorcycle scene (Notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs); And I sadly they were trying to be serious. I was forced to use a motorcycle in another movie due to their gambling habit in main Greece due to their "wheel" of the opposition gang. The shrewd character is ashamed by Carrington, I hate to see what I'll enjoy next to them: <br /> <br /> I bought the hackneyed theme: hockey-australian-bal-cant-drunk-biker-helmet -Computer-to-people-school-domination-school-cargo-for-person This Disney story has become very scary. <br /> <br /> It looks like you can destroy a good thing by smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical museum. The only thing that I picked up from this film was how many points in ten.
