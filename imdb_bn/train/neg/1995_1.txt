Well I paid just a dollar for this movie in a DVD, and it was not even worth it. It's from a poor print and in the public domain, I'm guessing. <br /> <br /> Negal - Despite its glory, rewards and fame - a Homoir British girl who can not sing or dance <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Herbert Wilcox (Neagle's Husband) is always the most exciting and gifted femme of the screen. She was wrong. He was unbelievably popular in Britain before and after WWII. Her "serious" roles are more ridiculous than her musical look here. <br /> <br /> Only some famous songs are included and no one is well presented. Leave this one out and find that Doris is big in the day. At least you get some real comedy and professional style dance!
