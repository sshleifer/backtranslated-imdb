I agree fully with jamrom4 .. This single is the most horrible movie I've ever seen .. Holy cone. It was terrible .. I was not careful to see it .. And stupid. I saw it anyway. Experience about 10 minutes in painful. I totally watched torture Leave on .. But lastly sat.just I can see if I could see .. I was good and now I had no desire. It was annoying .. Nothing happened and the last was all the preacher ... a movie that does not have the right to live ... I request you all to inspire for fat violence. Only I have taken the same precautions ... ..You protect yourself from this movie. I think those who rated it were involved in creating the movie .. and everyone should shut the face of the planet ..
