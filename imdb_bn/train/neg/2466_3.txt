In the last few years, in most cases, there is a tendency for forced media-related incidents in connection with forced jambi-related films to the body of the body of the resurrection. "Fido" is a film that attempts to make a profit, only an outcome of it, or both - and it falls equally in the division of magnetic zombies. The joke here is that we can see in the reverse direction of a broad stereotype of spirits, spike-clean, alternative-history (we face a great land war, and animals are now being taken as slaves). Sub-city version of a 1950s. <br /> <br /> This is a moderate fun idea for yourself, and probably enough for a five-minute comedy sketch, but it can not be a feature film on its own. The joke that surrounds the bodies for the servants is incompatible with this ideal version of a small town is repeated repeatedly, and loses all the functionality. Zombies cannibalize cannibalize when the soundtrack stays tirelessly playing sunny melodies. The word "zombie" is constantly inserted into an otherwise familiar homy line for a cheerful effort of a smile. <br /> <br /> Very broadness and artificiality of "nineteenth-century" presentation can not help me but bother me. It is clear, it is more obvious to make markers of the 1950s decade of 1950s and 1959, more clearly than any similarity between the 1950s and 1959s, inspired by "Spanishville". It's a bit skeptical about graduation, as the film is more openly, down-to-earth and shocking and incredibly embarrassing about the excellence of the 2000s. <br /> <br /> Because the letters are so popular in the 1950's pop culture, it is difficult to develop many emotional investments among them. Everyone filmed some character with him - Helen's appearance is unclear, and Bill loves Golf and she is frightened by killing her father - but they remain quite two-dimensional. Performance in these bad writing limitations is fine. Best Billy Connolly thinks Fisho as Jimmy, who gives character and sympathy to the typical colorless green giant of Boris Karloff of "Frankenstein", who can not speak. <br /> <br /> There are uninterrupted small bits of stuff around fetishism, racism, classism, war paranoia, etc., but none of them works in a comprehensive level, and filmmakers do not; Stick with something really. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film does not really go away with the intense joke of "Look in in", let it beet! "" A good hour and a half hours. "
