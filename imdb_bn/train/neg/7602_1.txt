One of the other commentators mentioned that they ran around. If I did not live with my wife, then I wanted to stay. It's embarrassing, because I think it could be a good movie. But it's one of the worst adapted screenplaces I've ever seen. It does not start anywhere and it does not go anywhere (I'll say it does not go anywhere faster, but it's not really slow ... painfully slow). There may be some interesting things from time to time, or there are depths below the potential few characters, but this is to us - directions. There is not a single budget or release in the whole film. I do not need a quick plot for entertainment ... I love studying a good mad character as much as next indie buff. But nothing adds to this character. For the entire period of the film, you do not care what you do with any of them. In fact, you almost expect the death, because at least one death may be more interesting than seeing their illogical behavior, which is very strange and unpredictable that you think it will be mandatory, but not so. Instead of jokes, the characters of dirty-esquirean perform strictly in warm fashion, you only know it immediately for: Gifted but wrong performers, raising obesity and their eyebrows while reading malicious conversations without the context of contextual context. For these two plodding, all of this for painfully slow hours. Awful, terrifying.
