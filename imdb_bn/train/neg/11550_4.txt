I knew I was going to watch a low budget movie, but I hope much more from Alex Cox. The performance of two leading men was terrible, especially the white guy. Girl could have won the Oscar compared to that girl. This movie I thought was a joke for filmmakers and some other jokes that I actually realized and laugh loudly to me, which is rare. Without this hilarious moment I could have given this picture 2/10. Alexander Cox is the classic of all 80's who made? <br /> <br /> I had a few questions after the end of the picture. Why did the Mexican people go to other people's house at the beginning? His daughter said, shot dead 100 people from her last job? Why was he crazy when he broke his own things? I think I went to the question hour after the movie, but I did not want to get up till 10am.
