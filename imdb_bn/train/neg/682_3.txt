Please note: I see a real silent version and a different version of this same movie version. I saw the word version and it was esthetically yicky. Some feel that the original version was longer and without stupid dubbing, my review must be remembered. <br /> <br /> Although I know that Ron Cleier has the fame like the filmmaker and Louise Brooks. As well as a bit of a culture as well, it is a technically weak film made in many ways. Most of the Hindi films were switched around in 1929, by the mid-30's, most of its famous French films were largely in silent movies - some conversations and sound effects were very poorly placed on the film. Many people do not mix lips with the movement, and especially what the film says, and it will explain why an American like Mrs. Brooks could make a French movie. It was just sloppy and I liked that they made a silent film - and it was an average movie as a silent film - excellent camera work (sometimes) and some decent silent-style acting. <<br> <br /> The problem I got with this movie was the most simple plot. The game was good for a silent morality in 1920, but according to the 1930s, this plot is a bit deer (meaning "old" - "not whore"). A lady won a beauty contest and her macho fianc√© could not handle it. He gives it all up, temporarily, but fancy life lured back and this spells its end! A long melodramatic, huh? And a bit simple and unused. Finally, I found the character of a drunk friend (?) very frustrating and unrealistic. He looked like Harold Lloyd and abused most of the movies in friendship and everyone else. He took it around the film and did not get any resolution, his character seemed impossible, and the treatment he received was confident. Did the audience laugh to laugh? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />) as well as good silent film. I just do not understand the high ratings of this film.
