This movie often sounds like this: the future version of the Cinderella legend but the songs and (fairly perfect) sex scene! The film is not sure what it wants to be and most of it creates a mess. It is more expensive than most of the director Al Adamsan's films. However, it is not at the same budget stage that the viewers come from the expectations of Saifai films. The actor is quite bad and unlike the Adamson film, there are no big names or B actors. Some music is fine but the Cinderell 2000 has forgotten so many years why it's easy.
