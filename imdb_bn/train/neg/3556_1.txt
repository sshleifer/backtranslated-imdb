You know that when you are working in half-speed instead of full-throttle in a movie, "The Incomasses" is a great actor, who is going through bill pay motion when John Cassettes gets in trouble. Indeed, no one can blame him by observing the hammer script and John Huff's 'Barco' artistic order. The film has something to do with a series of rape killings in a small town, in which lots of supernatural accents have been mixed. On the one hand, the direction drives the tension and interest in each scene, and the cosets are visually appearing in the PE bar. Incubus itself, which is not seen until the last scene, it is a good job, but it is not valuable to wait. <br /> <br /> 1/10
