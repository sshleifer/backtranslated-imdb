This film should bear an alert label released directly on the video that it is dangerous for human health and the terminals may be annoying to the viewer. It is still disappeanishing suddenly with another slim, stylish "rapture" religious movie good people (believers) and left behind the bad guys (believers). This is a fun idea, especially since we happen to be on a flight driven by an unbeliever that is sinful with a steroidide (it says that sinners do not disappear!). Sadly, because of all pilots being disbelievers, the plane does not crash or the film ends mercilessly. Although it can be interesting without religious religious barbarism, the overall moving movie creates a gag, the act is terrible and possibly computer-made simulations are very fake. Plus it's another movie shot in Canada that can be New York City. Leave me ... I'll just read the Bible.
