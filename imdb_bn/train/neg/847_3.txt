The film is considered almost the same as two brothers and sisters - but there is no way to be smart - a surgeon and others can write computer code. The talent they like to call themselves, which is very ridiculous when compared to your personal characteristics. You can also grasp the contents of the title. <br /> <br /> I do not really like the style of the movie. I believe that anxiety, confusion and deep blues come with it for a purpose, but which is why I do not get so much. The film is cheap in the scene and it basically tells stories basically with no human aspect. It gives comic books like experience. However, the viewer's view is undoubtedly, it can bring blues in short dialogue, monotonic scenery, dynamic cut, music and sudden sounds. <br /> <br /> The story of the movie is very simple, which is dramatically portrayed for the longest time, in most cases simulating the effects of misleading fascinating drug use and dynamic cuts. <br /> <br /> I would say that this film did not fit my expats with a small bit.
