This picture was rather a disappointment. After very slow, after a very intense (and quite intense) movie, it started to lose. It took a very little time to explain a lot more intrigues, and after coming out of the theater, I was amazed at all these things. Characters are shallow, the story is certainly not believable, most of it is without the parody of the disciplines, and there are some very chessy parts ... Like, young police must dig a body. Of course it is night and rain and she needs to be alone ... Javan! Or the Evil Manifestation is "Nazis" plus "Genetic Manipulation" ... Wow, that's really real. There are some nice bits, though, like boxing scenes, mountain scenes and some Gaga (though Reno and Vincent Castle can do), it is certainly not worth it. (3 of 10)
