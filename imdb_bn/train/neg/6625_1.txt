This is the first time I am writing a comment on a movie in IMDB. But I had to write it for this one. His 3 hours unadulterated torture. From the beginning you get the idea that the movie will be bad. The acting is unfortunate. I have a great fan of Devgan (Bhagat Singh) who loves him today but he is his worst in this movie. It seems Amitabh has worked hard for this, but there is no fear in any way. Prashant Raj is an actor And the most annoying part of the movie is Nisha Kothari. There is no source of why the director took me to this movie. Background score is repetitive. The way I thought Ramu tried to repeat a government, color theme, background score, camera corners, but it did not work. Please do not see it
