I was expecting great things from the film, as a great fan of the films and dramas of David Mammoth, especially his first film House of Games, who played Joe Mantegna. Instead, I bothered myself by the lack of patronage and credibility of the film. Ethnic slurs are thrown without any feelings or meaning about them, hoping to set up a racial tension that never materialized for me. Identity is fully re-evaluated and men become "heroes" for no apparent reason. Because of taking oath as a policeman, the main character, sincerely, refuses to perform a relatively small task which can not do any harm and possibly save lives and still performs any other work that is very violent and very illegal, even then minor tasks. Also, an incredible concubine with whom his family has been killed has been suggested only for a plot point involving a person who has been killed with Sky-writing, and the police response to the incident extends credibility beyond all reasonable limits. Saying, after expecting another exciting thriller from David Mamet, I was frustrated to say the least. 10 out of 3
