Turn off your back or you will get bigger problems behind my friend! Only a happy ending can shoot your innocence that is full of sadness and condemnation at the moment you're watching this. It is absolutely safe to say that the whole movie is separated, the rhetorical aspect and jammy show respect, which denies the greatest ambiguity. We often get a name like "Johnny", and this "Johnny" is not anywhere. There is no specific reason why our "dead body" comes out of his body just to survive until the early nights, so that the film is completely useless. Without feeling sad, his mother is convinced that she is dead to tell the doctor. After Johnny, Eddie's arm takes a bite. The audience is asked a difficult question: Why should this be the crab? Have an answer. Any harmony with the living or dead person is completely respected. "Living" is a coincidence. There is nothing common with "dead" movies. Show this to your girlfriend and she will leave your life to be a deserted ruins and leave a big promotion. Blah !!!
