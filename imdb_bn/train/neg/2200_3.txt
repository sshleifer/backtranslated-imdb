I love the bad shark movie. I really do. I laugh hysterically over them. And the Sisfei Channel holds one of their marathons, their new original, finished in the premiere of Hamerhead: Shark Frenzy. Based on the preview, it seems to be extremely fun. Originally a creature of Benchley, it's really a remix, really. It was prefaced by a display of shark attack 3: Megalodon, which is the shark movie Hilarity at its best. I was in mood; I was ready to go. Get it, Hummerhead-mad-scientist-man! Oh, God, that movie was wrong. <br /> <br /> Wrong, wrong, wrong <br /> <br /> Sick. Twisted MESSED UP <br /> <br /> This is the theoretical reproduction at my worst time. When a drunken girl is brought out of the suspended animation and is screaming on her head on a table, because the shark-hybrid embryo wants the only crazy "scientist" who is deliberately stuck in her womb ... Jesus Monkeys. That's what I call boring. <br /> <br /> This is exactly how the plot works: Huma, crazy scientist. My son died due to cancer, but I brought him back with a combination of his DNA with a hammerhead shark, because shark did not die of cancer and reproduced through more Hammerhead placentas. Oh look Being a Perfect Amphibious! I have created the evolution of humanity! I know! Let's reproduce him! But all shark jinn did not make my son bloodthirsty, if darned; Instead of raping hot babes I keep sending her little jungle into heaven, she keeps eating him. But check this out! Some of the essential plots twists in random people, my research ended on the island, the girl who was hitting my son before he died! I said she will do her work! All this leads to a very touching and heartfelt reunion: Woman: Are you going to impregnate me? Crazy scientist: No. How sweet (he indicates a blurred shark-person in the tank) <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie. What
