This is rather a decent primary display of the talent of the sword and flying fist cinema John Woo. Cinematography is excellent and some of the swords are really awesome. Unfortunately, the film works under the burden of a bad story and under a seriously low budget (if you suspect, check out some of the set battle scenes). However, it is valuable to see, especially if you can catch letterboxed.
