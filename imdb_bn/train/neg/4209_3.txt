"I'm a cartoon!" "You are an illustration!" What does that mean? This plot can not be bad as a boy, which is afraid of everything, at the very end of the film it becomes very brave because he went to the library. While celluloid was the only purpose of this waste to encourage American kids to read, it could be a cheap, and more effective way to advertise a series of adverts! Even Macau Kulkin (as a child) could save Christopher Lloyd's (even the prospect that "he is a sponsor" librarian) genius, this uninterrupted film from a dull plot. Even the hype Goldberg, Patrick Stewart, even (Leonard Dimes), or the voice of the Hollywood God of Voices, Frank Welch never preserves it as a cartoon character. I can only describe as equivalent to 1990 that even the climatic expedition of 1978 was even terrible in 1978, because the blood animation will make the film worse, soft plots will not improve!
