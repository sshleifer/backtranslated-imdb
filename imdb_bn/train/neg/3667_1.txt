The open scene 'explains' why Hurt is 'immune to' after 'malicious man'. Very bad it does not explain anything else: How did he get caught / how was it / why it works so fast? Then we go to "The current day Budapest". Well, what was the past or the past? It's going to be past, of course, but for a minute it seems that the film's ND has started before it starts. Sorry, I should pay more attention, right? Or maybe it's done badly. Then there was confusion about his various activities in the relevant fields, and finally he mentioned how he had executed him from the actual examination. Ah! So the NS and the private industry have become poisonous to affect their toppling? He was certainly one of the top people, he is friends with Chemical Company CO, sakes for God Then the substance itself is: technically a poison, but it mutates the 'carriers', so we can do whatever we want; A poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, is all very different things in real life. Sorcery, it is not contagious just from being killed from one carrier to another. How convenient. Then there is a ZTT protocol: They jump in any situation without any idea, or how it is ready. The crew did not have enough money to show the producers under the proper wash after leaving the scene of a deadly unknown object? I used to think that the heart was going to die from the bad cleaning technique, and the open scene would go all the way.
