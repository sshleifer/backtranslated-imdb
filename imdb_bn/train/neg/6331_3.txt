Mr. Mike was probably the most notorious comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what I want to do with full creative control over a movie. Sadly, this is unreasonable, even though the joke is not funny - but some of them (I will not say the maximum), and indeed Mr. Mike did a good job by translating his mentally helpless fans into visual gags. The problem is the technical quality (set, light, sound, editing, you name it) so god-awful, film helpless. Some groups known as "PKO Productions" produce producer credits, but it does not show all produced; It looks like Mike stole the camera from the SNL set and made the whole thing in the afternoon. I understand that Mike's target was to persecute the viewer, but he deserves some basic criteria, such as the ability to see, hear, or understand, which is considered frustrating. Still, DVD is not a total waste: It is appreciated for Bill Murray and O'Nonoghue's SNL for three "Mr. Mike's Little Love Bedtime Stories". Plus, the "Cat Swimming" section of the movie is a great view to catch if you want to make someone superb. 3/10
