Just when I think I'll finish the whole film without a "bomb" rating, I came to my house with this infamous slumber last night. The worst fear I know of his fame, and I was as terrible as God expected. It's a mess of Mexican making, Dubbed in English and K. Produced by Gordon Murray. It has a terrible set and effect, and such a terrible Santa, which does not work in the North Pole, instead of the outer clouds of the cloud, and whose little elves do not help to make their toys, but help groups. There are practically children from every country. Early sequence, where Saint Nicho heartily looks at chocolate, he observes these quiddies while working hard to sing terrible holidays of different kinds of languages, observe the reviewers, go to forever and do not seem to have any stories. Clearly, this Santa Claus does not obey child labor laws! <br /> <br /> Finally we can do some tragic and slinky Red-Eligible beginner in the world from hell to hell, just to make young boys naughty and to launch Santa Christmas Eve round in a nightmare. This movie is a troppy and twisted experience to watch, and it stops the little kids and always stays off Santa Claus and Holidays. Surprisingly, the name of Jesus Christ is often mentioned in this Christmas movie, which in some way it creates all the crypires in the context of all the bizarre topics. It easily creates a personalized list of my "best of all time movies", but I'm sure it's not unique.
