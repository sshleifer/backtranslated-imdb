"Lies" about a relationship between 18-year-old ballet women students and sticky 38-year-old married men is said to be half-screen between naked screening and the half-screen between amateur screening and hockey strap and the other half lady seems more than an excuse for sex scenes Story A dirty mix of comedy and drama that spoils the "false" fast unwanted advertising, along with the poor production value, in a story with explicit sanitary equipment and phony software sex. About 2 hours of running, subtitles and so little stuff, "false" is simply not recommended. (C)
