Steven Sigal was never an Oscar material, but with every passing expression he became worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < These days are very emotional. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that the film is a dangerous dialog, which is often risky with cheese and acting talented deficiency. The story is not interesting and its parts do not create any sense and do not add anything to the story, because the characters of the film are completely as it is not necessary for titles to get 'visibly' viewers of 'castle' and it is not confusing only because it was no need when it happened Why does no sense <br /> <br /> A terrible script with bad dialogue, sub -Something is distributed by actors, annoying and occasionally badly operated action scenes, and irrelevant parts that only make it impossible and make the movie worse. <br /> <br /> Save your 98 minutes to life and miss this, even if you are Seagal's most motivated fan.
