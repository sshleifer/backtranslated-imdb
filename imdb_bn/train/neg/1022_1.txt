Starting with the poster (only featuring Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey), the whole film was a fraud. After all, there was nothing about a stereotype, the film - at least not something new. After 10-15 minutes, you realize that you just paid to send Justin Timberlake and LL Cool for another cop-flick. <br /> <br /> Basically, the story is supported in some of the cities about the corrupt system, secretly under the backbone business and the city, under the watchful supervision of some hot-shot politicians. Almighty and senior organizations are called frat and what can be estimated? They got a kick-ass loony police shooting and beating deliberately - suspect, girlfriends, you name it. FRAT deals are corrupt and greedy, so they are making a mistake by discovering young and talented (!!!) journalists. After an hour, after a series of incredibly badly shot shooting scenes and more stereotype lines, everything happily ends and we serve the final line: You can not kill the system. Ah! Do not see this waste of film roll. Freeman and Spesi have 10 minutes with everyone!
