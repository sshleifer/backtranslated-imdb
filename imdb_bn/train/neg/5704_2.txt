After reading some good reviews about this movie, I thought it was almost time and I could see it. I do not know why I'm bored. Originally, this family is employed by a formula that leads to the entire big column of ancient fame, which was hidden by the Knights Templar during the liberation war. Obviously it should have been kept in the hands of the British. First, why the knights asked to remove riches from Europe? How did the image of Nick Cages figure out that 'Charlotte' was actually a ship? How do they find all the formulas and riddles in about a minute? And how can two people suddenly become master thieves and what could possibly be the best protected bit in the world? This simple bit of Hollywood action has some of the wrong camouflage wrong plot. Cage is a great action film - 'Face Off' and 'The Rock' - then why did he bow down to himself? He got too old?! His character is really annoying - some of these 'ordinary' people steal the declaration of independence, expel the thief with a gun, flee to the FBI and generally seem unbeatable. The whole film does not actually make sense and it was all disappointing.
