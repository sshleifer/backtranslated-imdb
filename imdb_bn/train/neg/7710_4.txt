"The Killer Tomatoes Attack" In most cases, there is poorly integrated footage in search of a movie. The plot has no ideas, and drops in and out of the photo with no explanation of the various characters. Seeing this foolish fool, you feel much better than your opinion: it is a cheap, low quality quality film, and then the "parody" angle is easy to use as an excuse for its superstar and low quality, female Swimmers feared the floating tomatoes; Even "lame" can even go to "suspension of disbelief" even how far?). The title song is great, though. (* 1/2)
