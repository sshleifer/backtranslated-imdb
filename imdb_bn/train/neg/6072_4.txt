DeNiro is a master ... one of my favorites. And I like good sports movies {not baseball, but hey, its a sports movie, is not it? I had much more hope for this movie. It seems to be starting well: What I hope is Dioro, Snippets {Those I do not really like} Very good as a weak star. Barkin's role was right for me. She is a good actress, but this role takes place in place. To me, they always began to rotate the scenes, and then drag it to some place. It just so tastes me tio! Considering throwing and plot, it can be much better. I rated it a '4', and I was generous ~ I'm a tough one with numbers!
