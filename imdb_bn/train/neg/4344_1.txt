If you hit your head with a chest, enter the script with your feet, you can come around this movie's intelligence level. There is nothing in this movie that has not been done more than thousands of other gangsters on Flickr and much better. Those who think "Scarface" saw any kind of hero or "Goodfellas", "Men's 2 Society" or "Dead President" and "MmM" thought "This is my life!" This movie will be loved. I thought I would give a chance to the movie, because the premiere was perfect for the past. After joining Mario van Pablos and Shan combs, I need to know better. Look at the original to be someone, 4th grade education, Pacino, real actor, and satisfied.
