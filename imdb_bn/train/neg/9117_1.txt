... or maybe it's just this bad. The plot is a cheap Rehash, which is strange, because it is supposed to be a prickle, not a single pic. Most films seem like a cheap rebuilding of the first, the scenes that imitate what happened in the first scenes, are just a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first one was a great cast, it has B-list actors and rejection. The acting is mostly terrible bad. Half of the film's best lines are taken directly from the beginning, such as almost every major character, not including the first movie. I understand it was made by a TV series pilot episode, but no excuse. They do not have to turn on a movie (bad) footage. Only one thing is a little good, and that erotic order. However, since it is not nearly as good as the first ones, it is not even raised at the rating of 1. If you have free viewing opportunities and you're a straight guy then it's worth checking out, like some lover that you are not indulging in. If not, avoid all costs. 1/10
