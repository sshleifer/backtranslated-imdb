Spoilers can be shortened in the film plot brief sentences: three victims of the forest. Anyone else got their shot without a two-headed shot explaining them. The last man can stand clearly, shouting without doing the shot. He continues to walk through an old factory and the evil man continues to fight directly in his struggle. Villains are easily decorated in black and look like villains. <br /> <br /> This is a complete story, not briefly but in detail. Everything is drawn with a guy standing in a door ringing ring. We wait with him. The boys are getting bored and sleeping in long shots in the jungle. We can take a graduation with them. A piece of shoe followed by a female provider might be recovered, if we could see his butt or raising boobs. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is low after the terminator and there is no reason why there is so much system. Characters just do not speak And then there is no grain to say 'I'll be back'. If my friend shot this weekend, I'd be happy for him, because it's enough credit to portray camera controls. Payment as a DVD is completely inappropriate for the rental. <br /> <br /> One thing is a little funny, the director says extra, how they did not understand the local police that they are shooting and walking around with a gun to treat them like a shuffle. If they portray it, I'm sure it will be more fun to watch the movie.
