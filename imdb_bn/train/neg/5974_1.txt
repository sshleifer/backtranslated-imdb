I'm not saying that it does not look like a movie. It does not seem to be just about a popular TV language and a TV show about a real movie language. <br /> <br /> Camera angles are so straightforward that the story is always easy to say that people are never able to connect to it. This movie takes us to where I have not seen any movie before: in a region where the movie theater becomes a hot medium, which provides every element to explain to the public. Inevitably The big movie screen is used only as an extended TV where we can see each of these women's lives more than life. <br /> <br /> Recently, young directors are uploading films for sale. This is very scary. Industry is spoiling art in the movie. Let us and our children know about cinematography and its language really. Not just sales and entertainment, feelings, emotions, and even a way of communicating the culture. Not as a launch platform for young divas and jocks.
