There was a great cast for this movie: Christopher Lee, Dean Ziger, McDonald Kerry, Liu Aires - all the solid film actors. But this downturn in the movie does not help them in any way, they do not match any of their characters (although Christopher Lee may play in contrast to many scenes). <br /> <br />> The inspiration for the alien in this movie seems to change at a hat. First of all, they only want to repair their ships and leave them, then they kill their most friends and then release the main character without releasing the wife after getting their necessary part. Then, from somewhere, this "peaceful" nation decides that they want to destroy the planet because it has many "diseases" (though they make the main character and his wife place in their society). /> Most movies driving men and wives or walking or roaming or sitting in the table are not sitting. You're almost ready to come out with the last planet, just take revenge for the annoyance of our death. <br /> <br /> If you really like Chris Lee or budget scientists less than 70 years old, I'd like to miss this one. It falls within the narrow range of eroded celluloid between Star ODC and UFO: Target in Earth.
