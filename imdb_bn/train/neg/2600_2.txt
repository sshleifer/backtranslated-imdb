Here we have a movie that often fails for the failure of a movie. Horror scripts, lazy acting, amateur direction, ridiculous special effects ... This is a completely horror movie. When you are finished, do not mention that you can not understand the whole thing that it does not make a feeling fat. After spending the whole movie thinking, what is happening in the world, when things have finally been explained, you realize that the foundation based on this story is shamelessly impossible. Explains a terrible "villain movie", "We have been told that our reputation has done something that can not be done simply and that does not give any sense to anybody. Oh, and then we see that there is a few gel-non monsters involved in it. Looks like I'm sure Drew Barrymore will never like to pretend that the movie will be for some unreasonable reasons. I'm tempted to see the sweet but I propose to take the time when I push your head against the wall for 104 minutes, which will prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting in the garbage.
