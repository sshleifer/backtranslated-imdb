The first one was really good if you ask me. See Sarah MG, she looks real, average, cruel girl, Emmy Adams, she is almost hanging around a little stupid. He's nothing! People do not worship him! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in the first film, now he is "baby face". The story is not good, and I do not understand. Why do they do it first, it starts. Loosy actors, nothing with stories. This is not cruel, this is playing. The first one has good actors, good stories, and have meaning. I think the music is good for cruel purposes 1 and music is even better in cruel motives. 3. I did not see it as the worst movie, but there is a big, big, big thing in line with the first.
