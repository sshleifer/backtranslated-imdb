For the first few episodes, I think The Apprentice was a very compelling and exciting show. The combination between reality TV and 16 week job interviews was innovative and the show's producers kept the program relevant and were not very "kept out". <br /> <br /> New Season 6 is nothing but a great joke and it's nothing to do with the business - it's all about. In the previous seasons, they take great care of business-related tasks - now the focus is on most boardrooms where competitors are expected to do everything they can to keep their shots (which means false, trash-talking, backstabbing etc.). It can be entertaining to look at the boardroom, but its entertainment at its low-point - sometimes you think you are seeing the repeat of the old Jerry Springer episode. The show is mostly annoying and a showcase for most companies, which is stupid enough to give NBC for the promotion. And what is the contract for half of the contestants in the 6th episode? It's just a common fool and nothing to do with business in real life. <br /> <br /> There is no respect for me in any of the competitors in this season, they all seem stupid to me. At least competitors were at least fair in the previous season, now it seems that the contestants will kill their own mother to keep them in mourning. It seems that the huge ego of the Donald Trump is a big and bigger season that grows up to be honest, I can not see why anyone wants to work for him with a general sense. His logic does not give much thought in the boardroom, and sometimes it seems like how valuable he is to trash people. <br /> <br /> R.I.P. Beginner For God, please NBC, get the show off wind as soon as possible. It is very embarrassing to see. Apprenticeship was once a great TV show, but now it's a big fat joke.
