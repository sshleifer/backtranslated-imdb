The main character of the serial killer is on an electric chair (seems to be an unemployed truck) when you are going to prison, what kind of films are you getting, to fight with prison cars only (and I'm not making this up) a genetic engineering tanker truck The madness that he tears in front of him, melts him, and fascinates his DNA with ice, makes us hero, killer snowman <br /> <br /> My favorite part is a shoulder shot. Snowman thrashing some poor schmuck, among which his hand looks suspiciously like a couple of white stove-potholder gloves. <br /> <br /> Mmmmm, schllock ...
