SNL is pretty funny, but people who are looking for a small skit in SNL are a little stupid. It's nothing like SNL, it's just a stupid fool <br /> <br /> <br /> Andy Samber tried to act like John Heder but failed. Although John Haidar Napoleon Dynamite Andy has tried his fun and people think of him as funny. <br /> <br /> Just funny people in this movie were Danny MacBride and Bill Hader. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The part in which he is pronouncing more of his H is frustrating. They seem to have tried for a very long and half-time, while Andy is laughing ... She is not worthy of being a horror actor and film. <br /> <br /> This movie is for comedy and simple minded people with a 10 year old comedy brain. Which is almost half the United States.
