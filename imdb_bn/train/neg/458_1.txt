What is this shit? My little cousins ​​chose this for the beautiful women's DVD industry and title ... I decided to look at it so that she did not get bothered and I was sure that I was afraid of terrible quality. <br /> <br /> First, the acting was terrible. They feel like an amateur actress reading off cou card. The delivery is sub-par and very early on. The scenes were horrible .. It seems that they went straight from the story board, if there were. <br /> <br /> Secondly, jokes and stereootypes are not realistic or do not play at all. formulaic I could not count the times I was able to predict the next joke. I got a few chuckles out of blatantly "delicate" sexual stimuli. Cat, Beaver Patch, Hong Wang? Come on! Just stay away from this movie. It's not tricky, it's not funny, it's not even fool-ridden. It's just stupid fools It confiscates an MPA rating with a PG children film, unnecessary sexual inexperience, obscenity and violence. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said,
