Very few budget police systematic films about heart disease detective, whose body is trying to solve the murder of a woman in a Central Park stealing vehicle, and their only formula is a tattoo in her arm. Although published by RKO, it is the appearance of an independent production which was taken for distribution by the studio. Cast and crew, with some exceptions - one of them young and unknown Jack Lord, director Edward Montagne and Cameraman William Steiner - is completely unknown, and it shows. Performance will not be universally awake in sub-par and high school training movies, the subject is stodgy and sticky and as mentioned earlier, there is no chemistry between lead actors. However, despite the many errors in the film, it has some good points. Due to the location of the location of New York City and the film's extremely low budget, it gives a great authentication like "Better City", a shootout of a bold basement is routinely managed and some investigation methods are clever. Otherwise, do not write a lot about it at home. However, in the early 1950s, the Syrian divisions of New York City were seen at a glance and the old car buffs would be delighted to see the logo of '30 and 40 'cars on the street. <Br /> <br />.
