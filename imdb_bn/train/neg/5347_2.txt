A year before SSA's SA-WALL Ilsa, BlackScan could easily be called Susan, SEO-OLF, and perhaps it encourages the producer to go ahead with the Nazi sex epic, along with their more notorious movies, because the stories are identical: a superb, horny, head Strong (but stupid) blonde woman reduces many people under her control and kills them, whose saba Eh hates him and wants him to die. Sound familiar? Ilsa Flickr producer, director Ras Meyer and David Friedman are good friends and they start their career. So, perhaps, there is a connection there. Seeing Blacksanna, I can not help, but can remember that Russa's daughter wanted to do something other than her ideal busty female epic, and because in the mid-1970s XXX movies were all angry and Ras girl's films filled nudity and kinkiness and violence , Real porn was not even near. His films began to look positively weird look by Deep Throat and other hard-core blockbusters. Maya knew that she could not compete with such films, and Blacksnek arranged the end result of such rebellion in her career. He definitely wanted to branch out in several uncharted regions. But Blacksank bombing a bomb attack! And the girl came back to create a fast vixen film, even if they are not yet obscene, then they were more clearly than her earlier films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A BO was a failure. It's just terrible. Trash-O-Rama Jaw badly bad If you take a pure camp on slavery, you can imagine that. The end result is jarring. One minute, we are usually in the girl's area: the best, the playful and the fools, and then the next minute, serious meditation on slavery and violence. is not it? It just does not work. Slavery / racism outlook has been nastyly spoiled and the film fills the film in real exploitation. But BlackSneck is not as lazy as the SSSHWLSSS of SSS and such a movie, I imagine that the fans of the next generation were frustrated, which would explain the lack of interest from the supporters of this movie's fans or roya girl. . The daughter complained of failure in Blackson, and I quote, "There was not enough breast in it." Well, I'm sorry, but the movie is not bad, breasts or any breasts. But though he is less about breast cancer right then. Apart from Anushka and Maida, the shield of the film is male. Maya has replaced her stupid kids with a cranky son with a huge pink, pink player and an anonymous Black Actor in David Wonder Piece. And Anushka with the right hand man, who is portrayed as a brutal but shining gay man, who enjoys his power over men, only one might think that the girl is actually trying to make it here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Poor david She looks completely befuddled by the full experience. He enjoyed making movies, but you can clearly see that sometimes, he has no idea what's going on. And then there's Anouska Hample. She is a beautiful woman ... in the 1970s, not in the 1870s. With her makeup and hair, she looks like a Brit Pin-Up baby in the 1970s instead of a century of dabatitis. And its clothes are lovely. At one time, he actually unzips his skin boot! I do not know that their jeeps were on that day. But the character that he played is really frustrating. He is nothing but cipher on every man's (and woman) miserliness on the island. For example, one night, when David and Anuska were getting it, their boring slaves wandered in the house, made Davids unconscious and tried to rape her, displeased her. The next day, the slave driver is still working as Anushka and the two things have happened as nothing happened. It's totally ridiculous. Under any circumstances, his character was a real person, Ankka wanted to fool a slave driver and to loose his butt from the island. Or even kill him. But after the girl tried to rape her, she planted him in a plantation; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A surprisingly unpleasant but picturesque movie. To see a variety of train debris. I could not only help but see the film for its completely baseless aspects (the excellent painting sort makes it easy to see). So, it's a exploitation film, I suppose it was supposed to do what was successful. But Blacksneck is mainly for critics of Russanne.
