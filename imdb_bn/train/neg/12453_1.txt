I was always a fan of Linda Carter-Wonder Umman, so when Saifi channel ran in this film, I had to see. I feel very frustrated. This is only a wonder women movie The right costume [he had refused or made a big change] and the plot is running like a poor man's James Bond. The success of the heroine of comic book means great power or determined will. Bad dream I think Cathy is all that interesting. I will not waste your time.
