This watch in class English was a bad idea. Serious and more educational movies can be affected, but it seems that there will be no impact in the class - the conversation starts fast when the teacher is left - and I have not heard the words "Shakespeare" or "Shakespeare". Tempest "is being used all the time and when you look at it, why it is easy to see. Acting is nothing special - everyone feels bored in bits, reads from the page without care of the world. Shakespeare always likes exotic dialogue for action and death, but I just could not understand a word that someone was saying. Clothing is not too bad and not special effects - the class may be They did not like PETA, but they did not accept P * S but the fun of a movie is difficult without any inspiration or pleasure. At the beginning of the cinema, the view of the ship did not happen very badly - even though the rain was somewhat unreal, but everything else is good and good. But where were the shattered head and explosion masts? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? Airless peas The sweet clothes were taken very seriously, but all shows show that he was just another excuse for joking, this photo is not sexual harassment, women and girls do not have to enjoy any romance or comedy, and lots of nude men There is a lack of amount of action and death that will stop most men and boys. Tempest was not done badly, but it seemed like something that the producers wanted to create, not something they wanted to do. And show the lack of general apathy and inspiration. 3/10
