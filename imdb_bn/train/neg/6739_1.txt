Someone has seen that the successful movie plots will try to restore why it has already been seen, as it is for this movie. Why "wedding date" is why a new example should not try to rebuild a new story that should have been left alone. If a project like this goes forward with the approval of Big Hanchos in the studio, then all the big and shiny production prices will match all, so people will come for adults. <br /> <br /> It's not a comedy that goes astray. The problem is that the screen writer seems to have a way of transferring the story to London, when it seems to be a common American situation that will not be able to fix the setting. Then there are problems with the stars. Messi Messing and Dermot Mullununi? They have many chemistry like oil and vinegar! <br /> <br /> Because there is no conflict from the beginning of Kat and Nick, viewers should think about how they think the viewer is not dragged into the film. It is clear that Kat will fall for Nick, and unlike this prediction story. Amy Adams, the owner of "Junkbug", comes across as a shallow girl, who is willing to continue her lip and is not clear to a person who loves her and is going to marry her. <br /> <br> Anyone interested, run at the end of the movie for about seven minutes of credit!
