I really hate the most lasting movie in the world. They show what Hollywood people think of the rest of the world, and they clearly think that we are the most naughty statues (or at least some of the phenomenal idiots responding to the reaction are somewhat entertaining). I have visited L.A. many times, my family has a family that works in the show business, and I just want to say that this * last * people should search for a reality check. Some disaster films are painting at least one cute picture: Men's children, 12 monkeys, but usually the message "People will do something to live, all dark and sad and purposeless, we all should be ashamed". <Br> <br /> Do not make me wrong, I like the idea of ​​a story that throws up the system of social system and tries to meet people in horror and I believe some people will act like this movie. Illustrations, but on one side of the evil-minded idiots, I seriously doubt society's society will just dissolve in every person, that's just humiliating.
