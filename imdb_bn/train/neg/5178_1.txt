I think this responsibility as a lover of horror films is warming up about this horrible and very bad "horror" movie of other people. Do not waste your time or money on this movie, bad acting, story is my worst one and this script was just awesome. There was nothing good about it, why are you thinking about yourself why I'm watching this shit. There was a lot of holes in the plot and they were never cleansed till finally, it was very bad, I do not know how a movie can be so terrible. I said before I loved the horror films and I was so frustrated that it was 18, but you see a little blood and do not get scared. Was it also disturbing me that the stupid things happened in the film, which was not a directive to plot such as kissing a brother and sister? All i can say Do not just bother, there are many more awesome films, just do not waste your time too small.
