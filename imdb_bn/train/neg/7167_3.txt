In another video I saw a trailer for it, and decided to rented it after it's gone. Boy, I was frustrated! The story is very annoying, acting (alongside Christopher Walken) is bad, and I did not notice less about the characters, as well as hoping Nora's husband would be frustrated. Christopher Walken's role has gone so far, what a tension!
