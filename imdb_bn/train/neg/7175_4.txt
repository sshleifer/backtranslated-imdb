It can be based on historical events, and we know that the creators of this TV doc-drama have gained independence to make it even more dramatic - I can stay with them - but this is so bad! I am surprised that the crisis in the Middle East surprised me how everyone felt calm, of course someone was scared, and no easy flight, no passengers were uncomfortable! Not sure about the rules, nowadays some of the airline security staff seem to be unconscious, but why do your shoes come before landing on an urgent basis, common sense tells me that it is not a good idea! The shots coming out on this remote airplane were incredible and fake. In fact it was a great view from a nearby ground, this movie was outside of the ratio it was and probably it looked like a model. The currents slide appeared in the front and middle emergency doors, yet there was much less drop, even though someone appeared to exit from the front. Why did the captain return to the plane after landing? This has not been explained. We know that the emergency landing was due to the outside of the fuel, but even under the tank some fuel was fueled and the risk of explosion was very dangerous, but deportation seems almost comfortable. , And instead of moving away as far as possible, everyone is standing at the foot of the currents slide, I'm sure I did. There were many contrasts, errors and faked actions in this. I saw a presentation of real-time dramas, and the portraits will be portrayed with realistic motion. It was likely to be thrilling, but due to the crisis the budget restrictions failed, and one thought that an airplane that is losing air is not really a big deal and you will safely enter the safari, but not the real danger! Of course, the reality is slightly different!
