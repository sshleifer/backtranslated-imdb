It was a blindly used DVD to buy. When I started playing, I was eating a nice lightning. <br /> <br /> It's bubble-headed comedy, but it's um. Poverty-stricken The plot is ZANY! However, the characters do things that are very small and annoying and depraved to each other. I finally got depressed to see it. <br /> <br /> Maybe the box leads me to expect more than anything. Disgrace, foolspeed film. (I know, I know, citing quotes and the Academy Award nomination is nothing.)
