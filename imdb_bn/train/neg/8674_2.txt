The first few minutes of "The Bedguard" have a campite charm: it is open with the opening of the bible syllabus (the part that happens soon with Samuel Pearson's "Pope Fiction"), teachers in two cart schools New York are debating about the eternal question of mankind (Who's the best? Sony Chew or Bruce Lee?), And then plays with Chibba himself; He immediately hijacked an aircrafts and broke a bottle between two with his bare hands. Unfortunately, the value of any entertainment, deliberate or unintended, isolated stories, shortage of work for a long time and crushed by the bad quality of any current work. To keep it simple, here is an intolerable movie to watch "The Bedguard" here: <br /> <br /> 1) You do not know what's going on. <br /> <br /> 2) There is very little no war. <br /> <br /> 3) There are fights that are small and horrific. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Judy Lee is gorgeous, her face is magnificent. This is only for them, "The Bedguard" offers the 2nd star among 10. This movie feels 5 hours like 87 minutes.
