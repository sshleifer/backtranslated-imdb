Before starting to say how good the series would be, I could say that the pilot was less than me. There is still potential for the series, however. Of course when I saw the first Voyager I thought it was possible, - but was very sorry. My heart tells me that the enterprise will not be as bad as the Voices, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Theme. I like the role. The show's opening credits were interesting and with the progress of a suitable theme song. The role of Scott Bakula Captain is remarkable. <br /> <br /> It seemed to be "feeling" in a grand adventure where it had become smaller for me. The plot of this episode was "Generic" Trek Story which is "Exploration" and "First Step towards Space" with only theorem and seated. It is hard to distinguish between the enterprise, the TOS or the TNG era in order to refer to it as the first deep space mission. The central plot reflects or does not do justice to the grand theme of the series. <br /> <br /> The plot to launch the first step was grand enough without "action". Instead of a separate reference to the innovation of search, they might be stories. Get more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, a TV show that will think about us again). Feel the "sea" of feeling "the wind" and instead of confusing us because of the "recovered" and strong gun fight. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> As opposed to venturing into a large unknown universe, block new kids. Sadly, the clones were sitting in our house instead of finding us. That meeting can be much more historic and much more socialist. How to contact these two different societies? Do not just indicate this, show it! <br /> <br /> I had to think more about 'Akkward crew and track with limited technology' as opposed to 'the first bold step of unknown'. I wanted to see something new and new. The series promises to have a new idea but so far I have not seen this new, great idea. <br /> <br /> I will end up with the repetition of the attitude that the series has the possibility. There are some interesting characters. Bakula wonderful. Blalock has potential. Apple's 11th ago we saw the first Kirk in the world, its overall theme is the most interesting. If these future episodes can judge this huge and wonderful theme, we will have a show that will create new legends. <br /> <br /> You shoot an arrow in the air ... Good luck Captain. <br /> <br /> To the producers: Take the risk and * think * us! :-)
