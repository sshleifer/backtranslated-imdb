This is the worst movie I ever seen. I'm going to go and go to tape 4 but I stuck it. I think myself a mastochist now! Afghanistan? Come on everyone! Who has forgotten to hide the Sanskrit billboard? I think the main actor (George Kyle) was particularly inactive. Along with shocking bad acting and shaking more cameras, I think of 9/11 events "Larson the Lunatic Implaces", "disgraceful and illogical behavior" for victims of 9/11 as a reason to create "all on one screen". Using the phone call from Larson's wife Sarah, the plane seemed to have been caught by one of the terrorists on that day. Shaking the camera did not make me sick, cold heartless stunts.
