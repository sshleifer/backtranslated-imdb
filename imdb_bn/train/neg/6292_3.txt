I am surprised, how the film was actually involved with the 1984 film "Bachelor Party", which played Tom Hans. Is this movie even an official sequel? This movie is lacking in every section and you are good looking at it. <br /> <br /> This film is not only good or funny for a comedian. It depends mostly on their stereotypical evaluation of the character, but the film actually shows some good, original and fun moments. <br /> <br /> Certainly there's a short story and nude breast above script pages. Wait for the things you just started off eventually. It has a main plot line somewhere but it is a very dangerous pair and it is so badly executed in movies that it thinks that it does not exist. I guess it's a message somewhere and even moral stories but this again so terribly unoriginal and weakly movies that it simply does not work. <br /> <br /> It is basically a capillary trick, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, except for the main character of the teen, which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless. The film really makes some foul jokes, which is mistakenly transferred to any kind of movie. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to ever see it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
