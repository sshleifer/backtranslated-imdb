Steven Sigal .... Can you be part of such a horrific photo? I hired this movie because your movies are usually quite clean. I lost much respect for this for you being such a terrible movie. Very, very poor taste! I'm worried that I hired this movie. Steven, if you act in such films, I believe your job is over. My husband and I have enjoyed seeing most of your movies because you can always get the "bad guy" with some tools and clean it ... and the language is quite clear in your movies ... but this is something else. I think twice before renting your another movie.
