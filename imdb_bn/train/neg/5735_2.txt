After all, this is a low budget movie, so my expectations were incredibly low. I think most people wanted information on this movie only for bleeding, and basically it's all about it. <br /> <br /> Plot? There really is no one. It is basically seen but China and an entire hell are very bad. Cast? No one, duration. Special effects? In my opinion, it was terrible ... and the blood was often unbelievable because of the amount, separator, color, texture, etc. <br /> <br /> I believe the film is a cruel, shock film. Now it was a big potential for a big budget, but what looked like poor scripting, bad conversations, horror performances, camcorder video shots, and the only incredible "Gore" made this movie really awkward. <br /> <br /> Movies are valuable to take advantage of some reviews, even "B-rate" films deserve some scope (for example, the blood trills I saw the most recent against its critique), but it was just awful. I hope people considering this film will read my comment and decide against it. <br /> <br /> I'm all for cruelty and grief, but overall unreasonableness and genuine terrible acting make for a horrific experience. Save your time / money and opportunity to something else, you will not be disappointed.
