Someone actually gave this movie 2 stars. They do not have too much chance to require their immediate professional help because you can not give a star to see if anyone does not spend 30 seconds. This is literally terrible. <br /> <br /> This image ... well ... I try it mostly on an awesome porn / snuff movie without any porn or any real horror bit (acting, plot, story, set, dialogue and sound) Try most of the kind. I wrongly guessed it about zombies. <br /> <br /> This is really scary in fairness to see it. You are afraid that someone will come and not describe what you are describing, and they think that you are an error that shows homemade amateur abuse videos or something with them. <br /> <br /> I am very surprised, I am writing this review on my mobile so I do not forget to try a rating of less than 1.6, that can protect others from the same horrible fate. I just suffered. <br /> <br /> I have seen the worst movie and I can say (by hand in the heart) it will never be the top.
