I've heard a lot of stories about this picture ... well, I've seen it for cheap prices last week in eBay when I took my chance. <br /> <br /> I have seen it, and I have some comments about it: <br /> <br /> 1) Horror storyline, 2) Horrible acting, 3) Bad battle scenes ... < br /> <br /> I have never seen any bad movies in my life !! If the story is bad, at least some of the deadly things will have to be more interesting. But both have been ridiculously bad ... <br /> <br /> The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nicky Barwick. God, he looks beautiful in this movie. <br /> <br /> About ...
