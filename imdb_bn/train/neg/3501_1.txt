I understand jokes very well, they are not just good. Show horrible I understand it, and that's another awesome thing about it. The only cool character on the show was one of those episodes, but I saw that episode with the episode and the show was awesome. It's not funny, not funny! I do not want to tell people that "only smart people get it" because they are so smart why they judge people who they do not know and say that they are smart or intellectual enough to understand? It's saying "sky red" but not saying. But anyway, it has never seen the worst show in my life, Jokes are terrible, I mean, you can understand them, they are very terrible, very long in his debate, his fart jokes and other humorous fluids are physically stupid and usually played really bad. Composed. I'm sure what these "smart" people are watching on this show, but when they judge others they do not know anything about us, it's not really a smart comment.
