I think it was a better film if Kajun was portrayed in more credible light. My family is from the southeastern region of Louisiana and I live in southeastern Texas (about 20 miles from Lake Charles). I grew up around these people like the conversation I have not heard. Cajuns are portrayed as rednecks behind. I know most of the people are well educated, proud people and they do not feel illiterate about the way these people are talking. It's a fine movie with all the great scenery and music. I understand that the author has come from Lake Charles, and has knowledge of the area, but for somebody's love, some actors study the language, you live in the illustrated people and how they understand you are before trying to work like them. In my opinion, when the actor believes that he is that person, this is a more enjoyable movie!
