It is certainly one of the 70 Viadars films, and it is most notable for the prevention of Bigfoot Hustriya for a decade. It is also notable for the slightest touch of crazy throughout the film, especially when the first half of the mood is replaced by a music interlude of all things (such as another user indicates, a song character in the songs, a catbatch, who paddles in a breed for a while, then ... Page, will not be seen again). Although it is sadly dated, I still have a funny scary movie to show the kids, and anyone who enjoys the bigfute Lower or 70's mountainous culture is forced to get out of it. My favorite part: A man is so scared that he jumped to Haydsth through a door (!?) And the narrator explains that he is unconscious from "shock". Oh, I used to say that there is a possibility of breaking a door with his head, why he became unconscious, but whatever. <br /> <br /> 4/10 stars, or 7/10 if you like bad America
