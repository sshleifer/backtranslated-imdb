This movie made it for TV. However, it starts with great intentions and genuine promos and costume features. This picture quickly became intense in the Nose Chess dialogue, and began to play an alluring melodramatic television. The characters were so sad that at times I thought that they were turning into a puddle of Gobo and the action was so slowly and badly cut that it seems that the soldiers are standing and shooting each other. . The Germans were so unconsciously portrayed that it was painful to see. German officers are the only thing that the Americans were amazing. Accept my word for this. I'm a huge fan of the series of battles, and this movie is shit. However, this DVD has a great additional feature, which covers letters from the WWI front line, thus, this rental is not a total waste of my time.
