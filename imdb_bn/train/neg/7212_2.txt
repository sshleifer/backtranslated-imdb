Why William Fredkin's "classic" is a very impressive movie and in my opinion, not all the times or frustrations, why every awesome director wants to imitate "Exorcist" And yet another Spanish rip off here, this time in Spanish, who shamefully repeats the story of a young girl who is possessed by pure evil and goes against her family. Paul Naschie (whom I would definitely like to feel hot) played an honorable priest who reached John Gibson because his sister Lila's behavior changed greatly due to her new boyfriend. The priest does not believe in the beginning, but when the bodies of his body are discovered with his neck, Lilar's giant behavior becomes even more attentive ... "Exorcism" is not the only illogical, it is an impossible annoying film! Here is a religiously exploited exploitation of Nashie and director Juan Bose and an open-ended opportunity to flutter the void, and yet this is a perfect and bloodless play that will almost fall asleep! There are some atmospheric moments in the last twenty minutes, though very stupid, and mostly stylishly-grounded female nudity and sledge. The complete lack of budget is a real excuse because Paul Nathish has already proved that he has enough imagination for lack of money. It's just a horror film, the story ends. Other European "The Exorcist" Rip Offs "The the Antistrist" and "The Bind the Door" and they also suck!
