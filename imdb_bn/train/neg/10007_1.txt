This film is the best intermediary. Angela Harmon is funny as a bag of hammers. The "law and order" to make its unsuccessful incompatible attempt to comedy in the comedy. Charlie Shane is the only one to come out of this awesome anti-comedy. The only positive thing that comes from this mess is the marriage of Charlie and Dennis. Hope that effort generates good results.
