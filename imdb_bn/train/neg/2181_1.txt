I have seen this movie that it can be one of the older B movies which is fun to watch. I was so wrong! This movie is annoying and obviously the goal of a man who likes to look at malicious women. The story was so ridiculous and impossible that it completely lost my interest. Ed Wood looks like the same style as the film - under the barrel.
