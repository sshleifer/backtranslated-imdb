My previous expectation of Mike Meyer's previous work (Owens World and Saturday Night Live) was much higher than my expectations of Bond Spuff 60. After the first minute it becomes plain that it is possible how it is possible and cheerful. I closed the sheet after ten minutes. The second time I saw the second time that I did wrong for the first time. I switch it off after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe that a twelve year old boy can find this humor. The conversation makes an issue worse, seeing the mothers hateful (e.g. hedger graham) and fat extracellarisation of character succession. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen, alongside gently funny titles and psychedelic set designs. I personally recommend you avoid like plugs, although several friends of mine have enjoyed it (probably they were blindfolded at times).
