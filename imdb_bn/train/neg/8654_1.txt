The film was completely confusing and the bonus element confirmed my impression that it was a rip off of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the river was replaced by a road and the boat was zipped and Walter Cartz was Osama. <br /> <<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br /> I have warned the video store that the movie should be removed from their "documentary" category and should be kept in the war-drama area for real events quasi imaginary accounts.
