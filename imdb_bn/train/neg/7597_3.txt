I love the illustration of the film 30s and 40s. I love Salma Hayek. I was more than ready to love this picture. But then . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! ! !! ! <br /> <br /> No, there is nothing good about this. The only entertainment aspect for me was that the character of Colin Farrell is an unsafe writer, and despite this screenplay, despite the subject of racism, it reaches the viewers of an ABC Afterschool special. <br /> <br /> The only person who was "played" was not sound like Sutherland, and his minutes were few. <br /> <br /> Stale method from a tired plot.
