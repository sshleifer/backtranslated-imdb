Really, really, there is no way to describe how this movie is really bad. It's really embarrassing that I was sitting through this movie, it's a very annoying and anticipated movie. Is it wrong Acting: There is no performance that even sub-parameters are even closer to the remote (at least they are all very nice). Soundtrack (songs): "If we get the soundtrack fast, everyone will know that they are watching a horror movie!"; Soundtrack (Score): OK, but anyone with a keyboard can make a soundtrack right this day. Even me "What the hell?" Moments, there are some of them: the killer can move at the speed of light - the door actress turns around, there is no one there, she comes back, there is something in front of her. From now on where the killer looks with a power drill, really a big! Filmmakers have at least got points for plugging it, but I can really believe that the killer takes time to find the power outlet to get it. I think one of the guards at the beginning of the Holy Grill and "Where do you get the power drill?". I can take away this bad image and I have only 1000 words. I would give this ten star out 2. A star for me to laugh and create another star for all the clearing. Seriously, do not waste your time with this one.
