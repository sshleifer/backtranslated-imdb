Morkis de Said, Egypt, Old Nostal Slots, Robert Albion A dual role, unwelcome sex and nudity, murder and Mahmoud ... On paper Tobey Hooper's Night Tower looks like it should be at least a fun, entertaining Flick element. It does not make it a plot less, intimate shambles that brings little entertainment. In addition to some obscure material about a religion that follows the work of D. Sade, there is no fundamental plot, who, for a vague, feel the need to persuade the local Christian archaeologist's daughter and kill him. It's quite a lot - I think it's something with democracy, but who knows what the author is thinking. Most of the movie is a confusing mess, which is visible with the fingers appearing in the 19th century jail with a spectacularly spectacular visual appearance like the de Saad, with heroin facing various oddities, dreams and erotic encounters. It seems that the makers are trying hard but they have lowered their heads by showing glasses, bad acting, laziness and fraud in whatever context they have. <br /> <br /> There are not many good points. Robert Englund is always fun to watch, though, and the main actress, Joe Trilling, is not very talented, although interesting and different stages of dresses through the movie, but watching Night Terrors is a joke. At least I was able to see the film from which "when you are not a criminal like me", there was a bit from the Australian Film Certification Rating Guide, which was in front of many VHS tapes in the nineties.
