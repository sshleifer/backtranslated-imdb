I have read the book several times and do not follow this film just as it should. I could give this slide, it's a movie later. But I have serious problems with the setting of the movie. Someone seems to mention this image and it's book based on actual events that happened in Nebraska. I live in Nebraska. I was supposed to be based on this movie that grew up in the city. First, the "small" city that is spoken as setting, is the third largest city in the state. With about 50,000 population The Grand Island is the largest city in Lincoln and Denver. The second scene in the movie is wrong. The Grand Island Plateau is located in the river valley. Which is very flat with very little trees. I have tried to watch this movie, but my city has made me crazy for such a bad behavior. It was a real event. Large parts of the city are deleted. In the book, they talk about motoring in Fona Park from Mormon Island. I think if you do not think every 15-minute road, but you can feel it.
