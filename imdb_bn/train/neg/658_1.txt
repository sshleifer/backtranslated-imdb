I can give this movie zero in ten. After leaving this movie, I came to IMDB to see this comment. Make a comment predictable and fat with terrifying dialogue. I do not go through other people's opinions, so I lost seven dollars for this shit movie. It was to be one of the world movie I've ever seen <br /> <br /> The script wrote that the person should be pushed off a steep. Since the scary movies have sad scenes? I swear, I was surprised that there was no group ^ ^ ^ moments <br /> <br /> I think I'm jumping. Sometime And that's because I zoned out in English, thinking about my research paper. If you do not have anything clayed, birds / cats, then you are thinking about something. <br /> <br /> and letters were STUPID. My friend and I became almost shy and laughing, "My mother's shawl needs to be !!!" You Idiot Screw shawl! Security is just a few steps away, but not my mother's shawl (which does not match the dress) is more important than my health and safety. And stop it all, they returned him to his house, knew that the killer knew where he lived. God <br /> <br /> My friend and I also predicted the whole movie. And not just, I betting he hid under the bed, the moment. It was, "he stole belpe clothes and came out of the hotel" and "this detective person is coming down the hallway, not a murderer!" The moment This does not have to be expected in the movie. Disney movies are not even expected in this. <br /> <br /> Now I'm saying this was a terrible movie. I'm glad to see it in the theater so I will not buy it for $ 15.00 and then hate it. It was just bad. If only one thing happened then it was good. If the detective was shot dead, the killer would have been shot and killed in the same position. Hand knife, the girl was falling and the girl went on her way. Oh, how beautiful that has been. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money. Go visit a good movie.
