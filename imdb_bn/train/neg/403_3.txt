Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven Verhoeven is a puzzle: With the sardonic intention or completely devotedly, it is difficult to know whether to take his sordid impulses seriously. He seems completely unconscious that he can not conceal a negligence of stories, dialogues and performance of the whole bright scenes (and some of these outstanding ones) in the world. Kevin Bacon is an anti-corruption scientist who invented invisibility and used it to manage himself in moral bankruptcy. Bacon is usually his favorite actor who sometimes sees his dark side (`The River Wild ') trying to offset the appearance of his youth; Although given the ingredient, Bacon is not terribly obnoxious. Other princesses are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, among which there is not enough talent to create a strong impression and those who are forced to provide inactive conversations, themselves are embarrassed. A study of ultimate measurement studies and unbelief has really been postponed.
