Frequently Streisand guides this very Jewish story and its older ones <br /> <br /> To get education opportunities, parents enthusiastically impersonate themselves as a boy, which he does not seem to be the hardest to do beforehand. A boy, anyway. In his new school, he met many male classmates who believe that he does not believe in a person. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . * snicker *. <br /> <br /> Mediocre film; Splashy stories about nothing particularly interesting.
