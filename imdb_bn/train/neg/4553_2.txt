I read the book of Celestine Prediction and was looking forward to watching movies. The film is based on the book. Most interesting topics in the book also do not come in the film. This is the best one "B" movie. How many incidents, letters, letters, interactivity, and books are seen only in the book or do not happen. The streams of the book are very smooth, they are sticky and fed in your child's view. Character development is very poor. Character personality is different from books. The direction is similar to a "B" horrible flush. I understand that it will take six hours to spread everything in the book, but the curtain game misses many points. Welding was very good.
