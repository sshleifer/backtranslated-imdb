If Mr Cranky has rated it, I would rather be tempted to copy and paste it here and paste it. But since he is not there, I have to give it myself too. <br /> <br /> Malcolm McDowell's acting is a nice one instead of 0. But he can not even protect this movie from disaster. The director was really confused when the director did this because it is a group of scenes thrown together in a very consistent series - memorable of the '70s of the movies. Even worse, both actors and directors were visible to create it, which they probably showed how bad the original script was. It is not even valuable to discuss the line of the story, though it is a future corporation called Proxet Corporation, who combine the crew of an old container / slave ship capable of carrying a dangerous cargo in Nigeria. The computer of this ship is placed in a glass vessel and it is integrated into the crew through USB 12 or something. The company should call the prostate corporation because the entertainment price of this movie is equivalent to a test of the same name. <br /> <br /> I can not really find a scene that I can say and create a real sense in the movie context. I just watched it last because I had a bird flu touch and this movie reminded me that there were people who were worse than me-- especially Melakum McDowell. I will not keep this against him as a great actor and every great actor is a bad film in his career and it's a dosage. So, if this is the only movie you hire or you are a male and you do not take part in the prostitute test this week and if you think that it seems to be a bad thing, it's really a Real expanse Support a copy of Malcolm and then use it as a beverage coaster.
