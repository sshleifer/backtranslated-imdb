I can remember that I was hungry for Samurai Flix. I wanted to look arbitrary rather than that, it could be "elitist", the diversity of seven Samurai or bloody comic books such as Lone Wolf and Coupe. I like the US / Japanese "crossover" like Bushdo Blad. And of course all things are Sony Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanda. And I have seen samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto. <br /> <br /> I saw Kabuto in the first video in 1993, even Samurai movies can be annoying. At the beginning, I was waiting for the arrival of Maida Europe and the conflicts that came from it came, but when he was actually in Spain, I did not really care so much for the film. <br /> <br /> Do not judge movies to say "bad". Technically it is a clear entry in the section. But not enough just enough. Both have both limited expertise as both director and actor and have only a fraction of the above-mentioned Japanese actors charisma. The show Kosugis is talking to the son Kane, who was present in almost all shows Kosugi as a son of sin: he earned his father-mother's limited acting skills. Blood and cow absence of subtracting points, as long as not all samurai film trademarks were there. It was obviously for a small US / European audience. <br /> <br /> Just say that this movie is so much for the historical-action-adventure fan, but a sister for the harsh fans of the movie crew. "Samurai fills ??" - Fans want to see Red Sun instead (1971) and Charles Branson should be seen as a cowboy, who want to fight with Samurai Toshiro Mifume, to rescue a Samurai sword from the bad guy's Allan Dellon. . How accurate it is and how many mistakes have been made. <br /> <br /> So, the film is only 100 minutes, but it seems like a lot more movie. Because I gave it a respectable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: for the first time I saw this movie, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version, Kusugi is actually understood. I must admit that his 'ingress' is occasionally funny but after about 30 minutes he gets tired.
