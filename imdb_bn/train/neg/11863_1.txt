I thought that these movies were frustrating, I wanted to be much better than this. I'm very happy that I could not see this movie and I was not sitting in a movie theater for this. Where will this movie start, the role of acting in this movie was humorous, and the whole story of this film was not special. I thought that this film might be great, but it was not more than a scam. I think the acting of this movie was not a terrible event of chemists in this movie, it was not just there. I think if maybe we had a kirk compared to a different actor J. Baruchel, maybe it would have been good, but during the whole movie I saw this picture and I do not think he is acting in this film. Now, Elise Eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and J.. All the actors in this movie did not have a name and this movie had very little effect. The comedy was not funny, there were few lines in this movie that were right but your friends did not have anything to say that they would understand. I think this was a difficult time with Jim Field Smith because he could not determine whether he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to be with Burger King commercials. I think the film could have been better if the writer left another director. The story of this movie is just like any other hot girl is the story of people's love? It seems annoying that it would have been better if it had more originality, but there was nothing to be disappointed about. I will not recommend going to watch this movie honestly. I think you'll get dental entertainment more than this movie. So save yourself pain and do not see it.
