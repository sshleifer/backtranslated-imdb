There is a comment that has been raped by Russian soldiers on one of the heroes of "drunken rapacious", which is totally untrue. This image should not be shown for this reason only. There is also a statement by some that KGB has accused "Jews, Gypsies, etc." which is "worse than the Nazis". KGB looking for the so-called "zionist" agent, who was the imperialist agent (believe in KGB). It is completely different from targeting the Jews as a whole nation, as Nazis did. Gypsies are never prosecuted. KGB is a political tool and used politically, but from internationalist perspective. Communists do not really distinguish between nationalities. <br /> <br /> The whole film sinks like a fake. The main protagonist does not speak Russian, symptoms in Berlin have typographic errors, KGB General fully shows Fony Some so-called "Russian Proverbs" have been completely created and the list is going on. <br /> <br /> It is not recommended to watch - this movie is false, and dirty stuff. Instead of "good pastors" go.
