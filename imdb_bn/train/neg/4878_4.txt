If you want to make a movie like this, the threat will be real. Do not surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is dust and incredible. Acting is even worse. I used to think that I saw Arthur Lake (Dougwood) who is the worst actor in history, when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point he will encounter music and get crazy fight. I do not care. What are you These lasting offices have all these long scenes (furniture made from cardboard or mesenite). People talk and smoke and do nothing. Most steps take place in the order of five minutes. After that, it ends. Do not disturb.
