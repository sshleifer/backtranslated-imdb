When I was watching this movie, I could remember the B-grade slip. Many talk about the quality of its release, how the film depicts their next spiral representation in the realistic presentation of the drug and the effect of a person and the spontaneous phenomenon of unfortunate events. Yet, the techniques used (as already mentioned) have been excessive and thus completely disrespectful and completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, the less is less, unimaginable, impossible and convoluted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just carry a film. The job is poor and intermediate: throwing a few here and there, and a final gunfight at the end. <br /> <br /> Someone says that 'bad' movies are very bad because they are very good to see 'bad'. This picture, however, is a void. <br /> <br /> Also, if an educational film is needed to get rid of people from using drugs, I would strongly recommend such issues to many other films that have more effective procedures on board. Some examples are 'Formom for a Dream', 'Transposing', 'Voss and Lothings in Las Vegas' and 'Candy'. Although there should be some more light-weight films on both 'C' (both overall, critical and funny) and 'Halfback' on the same subject. <br /> <br /> In a final note, perhaps a movie released by Vinnie Jones was stolen from 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
