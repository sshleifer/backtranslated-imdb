The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo did not feel very good and I did not understand half of the things because of her speech, which was very harmful for this role. Melvin Douglas played the role of his usual unlike, and Constance Bennet was rather fun, except for his strong interval. <br /> <br /> Plus, Roland Young plays the best role of the film. I had her more lines, as she disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, Ruth Gordon was so interesting to see the young. I saw him play a crazy role, which he played a stupid sister in the '60s' and' 80s' at the end of the '60s. According to the story, the best part may be the last few minutes when we see amazing things on Stan, Douglas pretends to shield the shield. That was amazing and ridiculous footage. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can see where this movie - Garbo was not the end of the box office success. It just drags over and over, cheating on too much. This is a boring story Garbo knew it too, and it is called quits.
