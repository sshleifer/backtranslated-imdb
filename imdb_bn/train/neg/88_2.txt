I started looking at this movie too. This is a good family movie; However, if Michael London Jr.'s editorial team does a good job of editing, the film will be even better. Many scenes outside the context. I hope there are other movies from the series, they all are very good. However, if another is made, I request to take good care at their editing. This story was everywhere and does not seem to have a center. Which is unfortunate because the other films in the series were great. I enjoy the story of Wiley and Missy; They are both great role models. Plus, romantic aspects of viewers always enjoy a good love story.
