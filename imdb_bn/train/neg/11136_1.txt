I am forced to comment on a movie in IMDB this second time. Perhaps for the first time I saw the best movie and it was for Memento. <br /> <br /> On the other side of Scale than the Macmato, on the other side of the scale, as I did, it was unfortunate to see the worst movies. Apart from the two scenes of nude women, there is nothing to raise this movie from the trash-pile. <br /> <br /> Let's see, unexpected effects, clip script, bad acting and about 90 minutes long. In my disbelief, my wife and I became laughing through the disbelief. Wonderfully I saw it in the end, I do not know how! To avoid !!!
