I think it was an overrated PG-13 shit! At least Britannia had a performance of Snow and some others like Idris Elblar were also good, but lovers like many other children did not even believe. The killer was so stupid and looked very stupid. Death was stupid, annoying and totally unoriginals. The movie was very annoying and very overrated. It was not at all suspicious, I almost fell asleep. This is another bad PG-13 remake, it's a really awesome movie IMO. The end was so stupid and the final was very boring and annoying. The movie is very slow. Overall, the only good thing about this shit festival is probably the Britannia Snow, I think he has given a good performance and IDIS elbow, but it was also a complete horror movie and a terrific remix. Well that's just my opinion. I gave it a 2/10.
