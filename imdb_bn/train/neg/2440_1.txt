Koen Wouters is a stupid singer and presenter. In the early nineties, he tried his hand in the film. But this incredible piece of junk once and for all has finished his acting career. It also ended the acting career of Dutch actress Nada Van Ni, who was a TV presenter and programmaker as a football-woman. I actually saw it (almost empty) in the theater because I used to be Coen Waters, Clausau band's fan. I'm sorry to spend it money. It looks cheap, it's a terrible story and it's potentially executed in all possible ways. Some people think that this is a very interesting thing. I'm not one of them. I just found an incredible waste of time and money.
