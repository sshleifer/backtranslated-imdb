Kubrick meets the King. It was so optimistic in the spring of 1980, I remember. Then the film came out, and the Kabarik cultureists had been annoyed with the King. <br /> <br /> King Poetry said Stanley Kubrick took a great horror story and destroyed it. Kubrick does not have a mockery about the story of Lord Hanuman King. They talk about steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles. This is a film, they emphasize: It should be considered yourself. As it happens, both camps are correct. Unfortunately <br /> <br /> If anyone sees it as the adaptation of the King's novel, "The Shining" is a genuinely failure, humiliated scope, a section of rotted rival domains. <br /> <br /> I blamed the Kubrick artist. Writer Deane Johnson (Le Marriage, Lei Affair, Le Divorce, etc.) has earned fame as a social behavior novel. Perhaps he was selected for a fine understanding of his marriage relationship or family dynamics. But the small blue-colored city of Colorado Sidewinder does not exist on any map of its Frenchfilm universe. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She is, of course, a real auteur. And considering his own merit, his screenplay for "The Shining" - with extraordinary psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism and certified revival - can not stand up to mere logical analysis. <br /> <br /> I would like to consider Kubrick's "burning" in his own position. I'm willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-general movie. But it is not as successful as the natural study of isolation, isolation and insanity. Whatever the permissible, the film becomes a different one. <br /> <br /> What is the real horror of hotels? Or do they exist only in the mind - just like the first parent's little Danny Torrens had ghosts of nightmares? Whenever Jack Torrance is said to be "ghost" he looks at a glance. One person's notes appear in the stunted, convoluted psyche symbol of how the hotel's frozen top-hedge bragal jack. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Did we seriously conclude that Jack Torrens' bad life has happened in some way of "past life" experience? (And if you say it, since when did the resurrected people get the correct physical transcript supposed to be their past?) <br /> <br /> Perhaps the family did not care about his story. Maybe just wanted to revel in a mood of awful. However, whatever the film tries to hedge its descriptive bit - it's both way, rational and supernatural. As a result, the story is a mess. This film did not improve with age, and does not necessarily improve with a repeat view. <br /> <br /> I do not deny that a few moments of fear, clustrophobia and general cries have spread this long time, long film. But those EliVeters 'blood', repeatedly seen in Danny's view, are stupid and ridiculous. And Jack Torrens's notorious tag lines ("Wondi, I'm at home!" And "Heyyere's John!") Simply clings to the dramatic excitement of the film and waste its reporting power. (I know: I was sitting in the theater and listening to the audience laughing laughing: "Wheel, we do not have to take this thing seriously!") Finally, Kubrick is completely in the sea - or completely blamed - during the scenes where Vendy roam around the hotel empty , When her husband tries to purify their son. A fire inside the mimiest guest, everyone has died in their hat hat? Yes, I'm really scared. <br /> <br /> Jack Nicholson has shown brightness over the years, only one can think that he only wanted the director of jaw-rolling, eyebrow-winging, scenery-champing performance. Shelli Duval's performance as the female version of Don Knott's "Ghost and Mr Chicken" has passed the maximum silence. <br /> <br /> This movie is not only successful - as an adaptation, not its own post. It probably has 3 out of 10 qualifications, but I'm giving it 1 because it has been rated so high in this forum.
