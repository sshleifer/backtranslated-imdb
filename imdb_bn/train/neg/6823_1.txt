I was good at my innate belief: no expectation - no frustration. Instead, however, I was hoping to feel the same type of composer like Quanissakatsi (1983) and was frustrated at times. Povakkatsi is nothing but my modest opinion, cheap efforts to cash for the pagan success of her ancestors, and - art - it tragically fails. It seems that some producers have collected the remaining components of the koanskatasi, dropped everything slowly, gradually kept everything, and found some pop entertainers in the camouflage of Philipp Glass, so that some extraordinary background music can be combined in a hurry, which can be repeated continuously. For a quick and gradual change of pace with the speed of the koanaskatasi, a long sequence of pawkatasa gradually moving images (you can see what you understand if you see them in your VCR on their quick view). But the soundtrack of Philip Glass was the most disappointing of me. I can not believe - and still can not believe that these commercial terms are new age-type drones, which can be easily made in Casio calculator on an afternoon of 14-year-old, composing emotional and perfectly-synonymous music for the same musician from Quanissacatus Brightly. All the time, a big waste! My suggestion: Forget business! See Kanyansataji again!
