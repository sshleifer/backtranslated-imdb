Flooding forest begins with Jam (Daniel McLagan), Molly (Nicole Ratty) and Andrew (David Hood), five young friends, brothers and sisters Emilio (Richard Cambridge) and Ally (Sophie Holland), who have been closed in one week. The long holiday 'somewhere in the middle', their words are not mine. However, they know it before they are deep into a forest and emilio bargains on a woman (Frances da Costa) to add their problem alongside a deadly wounded person they will not start the van they're starting and they can not get any signal on their mobile phone . They need to find quick help so that molly and jod break in hopes of finding the house, as time goes on and darkness falls, it becomes clear that they are not alone and there is some hiding in the forest ... <br /> <br / > This English product was written and directed by Johannes Roberts and views both comments on IMDB and the internet and some have thought to be reviewed It seems like some people share opinions. No, personally it does not do much for all. This script is submitted to the Roberts screen, but here in the IMDB, Joseph London is listed with 'additional screenplay material', which is the main element of your uncouth backdoubles, the Texas Tensao genocide (1974) Using the fascinating idea of ​​the fallen angels, who roam the forest and the people are blessed with that reason The West does not give any big explanation for killing them. Then starring Steven, who played the fantastic gorgeous Tom Savini, which is not supported for what he does. He is the victim of the angels? If so why is he bashing his head to kill Andrew? The story is very loose, it does not feel like a correct film. The character is poor, the conversation is no better, and the lack of a significant story can not penetrate it or keep track of what is happening. Not saying that it can move along at a reasonable speed and there are several decent scenes here. <br /> <br /> Director Johans does not do anything special, it is not particularly stylish or flash film. Whenever there are some moderate horror scenes and Tom Sawini's character on the screen, she is still cool (though she did not hear Jolie walking around with molly in turn)? And when she died, she was shy. Here are some scenes of beautiful Gore, some have covered their heads, there is a decapitation, someone shotguns burst, someone goes out throat, bites some lip and someone breaks half. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was shot in England and Wales and it is quite curious to see the English setting for a very American themed chasing. Acting is usually Savni's poor collection, who claims to be better than that. Horror writer Shawn Hootson has finally found a embarrassing Kyoma and proves that he should be stuck for writing rather than acting. <br /> <br /> The damned forest was a beautiful poor horror movie, it seems there are fans, maybe I miss something but this is not a movie that is very much love for me. There is not much to recommend except for one or two decent moments.
