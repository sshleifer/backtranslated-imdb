Men, I love police movies, filling, shooting, chess etc. <br /> <br /> After watching this small and unsatisfactory movie, boy, I left. We have seen all before, hostage, bank, neighboring ... Yet, some officers and innocent people are shot dead, those who might hurt for some carers. <<br /> <br /> Just few shots, no, hundreds of shots. Going back to the bank, where the fools do not lock the doors safely or when the bad guys go out. We used to think how stupid the director was. <br /> <br /> The shot was good in that fake document, but only after watching the film, I was just thinking: Why did not the police get it? A decent shooting course? And why there was so much police and there was a real long break SWAT. Really bad.
