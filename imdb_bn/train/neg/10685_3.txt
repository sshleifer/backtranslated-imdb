Forecasted, hackneyed and poorly written. Foolly I would not have been involved in such a prominent cast as not being meritorious. I think competition among actors so intense (and worse) so long that no one can pick and choose more. At first we were given a shoulder, who was helpful in the killing and after that we threw our throats down. The film was a lack of conspiracies, there was only one possible objective of intimidating and killing the victim. Something is obviously embarrassing! It is hard to believe that somebody will consider, agreeing together, spending millions of dollars for this tribunal.
