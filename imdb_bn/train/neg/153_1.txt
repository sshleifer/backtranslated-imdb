"Spielberg loves the smell of jam in the morning, but what is the feeling of the honesty of the narrative? Nobody can love it." - Lucius Shepard <br /> <br /> "The color purple" took place in the deep south of the early 1900s and tells the story of two African American sisters, Seli and Natalie. The picture is open with the girls playing on the field of violet flowers, an ornate shelter that immediately disintegrates with the look of their father. This motif ?? Innocence interrupted by men ?? Enter the whole picture. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a series of short codes. Celebrity has doubled her father's father, has born a newborn child, her newborn baby was taken, and she was forced to marry Albert Johnson, a local widow who forced her to cook a violent drug repeatedly and raped her. , Clean and look after his kids. <br /> <br /> These horror scenes are given a little time screen and instead surrounded by pixy-dust cinematography, a middle symphonic score, an incompatible comedy, and a lot of bright camera work. The growing effect is a Disney cartoon and a rape movie, which is similar to a jingle aesthetic, which comments Stanley Kubrick "The Color Purple", so disturbs him that he had to stop it after ten minutes. Ten minutes? He was lasting for a long time. <br /> <br /> The film often talks about tackling "racism", "sex" and "black culture", but this is not true. Alice Walker, author of the novel, based on which the movie is based, claims to be a bisexual, but it is actually a close lesbian Her book painted a lesbian, as a story of women's independence and self-discovery, which stymie women who fell as men britten. For Walker, the only way to go about this deviation is to get women into a type of lesbian ostrich, black sisterhood and women's freedom. <br /> <br /> Spieberg's film, but re-frame the story of Walker. Comfort American legendary lenses. It is a movie that the tribal power of Christianity crosses the natural cruelty of men. A movie that Albert has found himself in several ridiculous situations, the moments of erroneous comedy insert him into a stupid fool. A movie where all the letters are derived from small texts of the alphabet, Castrolian men (always in love with satire laughter and tooth greens), stereotypical fat mamies, jazz bands and gospel singers. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that black people naturally like a child, easily and happily accept their social status. A movie where black people are more sexually, spiritually sensualists influenced by violent emotions A movie where poverty and class issues are completely invisible (Albert lives in a large room) and black men are completely ineligible. It is not Old South, it is Old South which is derived from "Gone with the Win", MGM Muscals, "South of the Song", Warner Cartoon, "Haleleha!" And Disney movies banned. In other words, it is seen as south by the child grown on 50th TV. It is cartoonic, so this racist racist black novelist Ishmael Reid, who has reduced the humankind to a diminished ethnic style, has likewise compared it to a Nazi conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Of course, spilberg fashionation generally ends with the close bond family bond of film. This reunion was in Walker's novel, but Spielberg went ahead with each of the characters in the story related to his daughter. <br /> <br /> Except the hate letter of Waqar to the black man and the bizarre curiosity of Spielberg's black life, we have not seen anything in the black community. We have only a vague idea about who has any of these characters and who have no insight about how they communicate with others in their community. Instead, Spielberg's cameras are fighting for our attention (it appears to be in a "Home Alone" film among the silly kitchen clutches), every passion in the competition, the director simply does not allow viewing or a little bit. Passed simply by life. Coupled with this ridiculous "white" song from Queenie Jones, and one of the strangest movies in your movie history: a rude feminine tract illustrated by a white Jew in Disney and Griffith's style by a black man trying to follow the public. Williams <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is also the lack of white letters. Consider this: Men in this movie are not portrayed as rude to each other, nor do they rule over women because they reduce their atrocities by racist society, which makes them atrocities. No, they are cruel by nature. And the women, like the silent sellie or his sister, are rebellious and difficult, suffer and only survive because men are too stupid to destroy them. A good movie does not pay full attention to the violence of women, because it happened in the persecuted, rather, it showed that it is social torture that has been subjected to sexual violence, slave slave has been forced to do the same job. Economic reasons for their male opponents (although still being played in traditional women's roles) and African American domestic violence are key factors, women can not support themselves and their children alone. <br /> <br /> And here's a secret ideology to work here. At the end of the picture, one character tells others that he did not pay tribute to his wife, so he was seriously beaten and imprisoned. This means that blacks must go back to African roots to recover their own dignity and it is their fault that White blows them badly. That is - respect each other among your poor minority communities and you will not reflect the dominant white culture. <br /> <br /> 3/10 - Failure to face sex and lesbians, inappropriate musical numbers, external visual pizas, incompatible comic business, brilliant music signals, and countless sequences loaded with brutally propagated mentality, contribute to all rendering "Color purple" is worthless.
