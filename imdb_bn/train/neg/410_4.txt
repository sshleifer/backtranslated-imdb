Unfortunately, one of the best attempts to create special effects areas is still neutral, as well as a structure, stupid and equally uninterrupted plot and insufficient, clinched scrapple. The Hole Mann is a rather vain movie. It is seen here that everything is really death - the only real element of character, concept and verb adjectives (especially lift shafts!) - has a special effect on the film's fascination. However, it is again the same effect as the special effects, and again the death of the movie that ended with the death. Before looking at Holman Man I hope that the invisible man theme, which will basically be the foundation of something original, new and more interesting. This is not so. The film was not long before it became known to the blood baths and ineffective heartics - it has become almost impressive and it is almost impressive. <br /> <br /> On top of all this, Kevin Bacon does a fairly useless job and his supporters rarely try their best. Good points can be a good green goldsmith score (but there is no competition for their best efforts), very interesting use of heat imagery and special effects. I was tempted to give this picture three out of ten, but the effects pushed Holle Man's talent to a notch. <br /> <br /> 4/10
