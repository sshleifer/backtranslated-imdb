Unfortunately for a rating it was 0 or otherwise I would choose it. This film lacks the immense popularity of the movie, which is lacking in the movie. Expert from Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Barnett Peters, Edward Harman, the new inventor, Islin Quinn's innocence and experienced professor John Houston (father of actress Angelica Houston) made this film so beautiful. The 1999 Ramikake with Cathy Betes, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming and Christian Chanoyet, was even more likely than this sad excuse for a signal. Prior to this movie, he was known as Ashley Johnson's role in the role of Crisi Savwar in the prime-time show, Growing Pines. He had some part in the movies but I do not know who had the talent to carry a movie on his own. And Adding Joan Collins to Lady Advinna Hogbotom, ridiculous! They did not get enough good actors to play a big role like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Ani, but would they sign some of the British women playing Joan Collins? It does not surprise me that it was as bad as this movie. Critics did not have the right to agree with this movie, even if it was made for television only but it was a bad series for otherwise romantic movies.
