Seeing Tom Hans as the hit man for the Irish crowd, a little hostage Stuart seems to be a serial rapist, it does not work. I had a hard time to take it. I do not think that Tom can not work, I can follow his careers from majes and monsters, but for some reason it gets flattened for me. Maybe because I'm at the risk of such a fan of graphic novels and a word like a fanboy (the only form of fun in a film less than a fanboy), the movie completely fails for me. Jod Law, and Tragic Everything left I left more than cold and a little depressed ones. I hope that Bonnie and Clyde Mendes's veins are another great crime movie, hoping to get all the stories out of the heart and leave nothing but painful bones. There is something to be liked in this movie, but cinematography is exciting with filling screens with beautiful pictures. Paul Newman is naturally nice and I really enjoyed the score, but Tom feels "the angel of death", Sullivan is completely flat.
