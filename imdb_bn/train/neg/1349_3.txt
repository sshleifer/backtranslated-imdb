I got this DVD well 2 years ago and decided to watch it yesterday. I do not know why it took me so long why I do not like the Inspector Gadget Show and even the latest gadgets and gadget gadgets. Although it can have a bright color palette and a modern animated film that has all the technical durability, this gadget is missing some old things in the bottom right of the toilet. <br /> <br /> The first classic inspector gadget theme is missing songs and music completely. Musician tried to compromise with similar sound but it is still not good enough. Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, a car that can not be turned into a van. Plus it looks much cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny has her computer books and she and the brain make absolutely a look. <br /> <br /> The plot does not exist. Sometimes there is something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw for something not published but I got it. I will never know whether the contract was with the small / giant Italian people. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He says, 'The last case' is why it is also mystery. <br /> <br /> I was not so impressed. It is not funny for a great animated show in the absurd absence of DVDs, but does not allow you to request any Inspector Gadget DVDs to buy. I finally sold these few seconds after watching it. No child likes it and does not like any fan of the old show.
