What was with all the Turkish actors? No crime but I did nothing for all these actors. There was no script in the film to test any actor acting acting skills or abilities. I did not buy this picture to watch Michael Maden He was one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Among them there was nothing to sink your teeth and all the letters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to work like a hard donkey but the script and direction can not make him more attractive or enough with his character to level 3. <br /> <br /> The sound effects of gunfight also sounds like a gunshot sound when they are fired into a clash at the beginning of the film. It was really weird and they do not sound like real guns. A video game has sounded better than this movie. Robbery gang member was also very annoying block at the beginning of the film. She trembled shaking tremble like these Americans, trembling trembling trembled, "Get rid of F # dollar from here" and what are we going to do. "She spoke as a girl." It was funny to see it as a positive, I was very laughing. For a few seconds, Huh! Mobile phone, poor Madness, he'll bring it back ...
