Do not expect much from this film. In many ways, this film starred Doris Day in 1956, titled Julie. In this movie, Doris, who was a Flight Advocate, at the time, her husband had fallen, while playing Louis Jordan playing Captain. He did a far better job than Kim Ojhaah, who took control of the 747 and grabbed the land without much help from the control tower. I know little about the 747 plane, I use myself as a flight attendant. I said, I do not expect much from this film, it was made in a cheap budget. The producers were cheaper to use it on a plane in the name of an aircraft. Ocean is one name which has been used in various movies. The name of the only written airline company on this aircraft was named.
