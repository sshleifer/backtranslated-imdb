This is a direct sequel to 'The Mummy's Hand' (1940), the main character, Stephen Banning (played by Dick Foren), is now 30 years old and related to the story related to the story of his son's mother (with archive footage). There are only two unusual aspects in the film: the initial death of Benning, and the presence of Turhan Bailey. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is nothing scary about his presence, without trying to carry Feenes, Yoobel (Ellis Knox). Dick Faran gets second billing, but he stays off in the first fifteen minutes! We will have to wait until 'Sikoku' (1960), when a lead character (genetic ley) dies before the end of the movie! Bening Jensen (now Henson), from the first film, saw little later, he did not do much, old and original humorous work. It is hard to believe that it is the same actor! Unfortunately, this great acting job is wasted because by Kharis he only dies after two short scenes. Then it leads to the graveyard of Bening Ben John (played by Bit Player John Hubbard) - No! Sheriff made a torch to enter the living room and kill Mammy. Sound is universally known? <br /> <br /> Turhan B is presented with viewers as a new High Priest Mehmet B for the care and feeding of the tree plant at Kharij. With his 'external' voice and appearance, it is very bad he is killed so easily. With a good movie 'Bobby' taking a final decision with him and Mehmet Bay, Mammy took charge of Von Heelsing for tracking. Instead, there is a pedestrian reheath of several set pieces of our previous global horror films, Hack Griffin has been put together, who wrote some other climbers of Universal, though he was also known as 'Don Winslow' by Navy Dawn (1942) along with 'Coast Guard's Don Winslow' (1943) , Which also illustrated Alice Noxo. Alice Knox starred in six Joe Pulka films (1946-19 42), and certainly, 43 films including Trhan Bay and TV credits, 'The Amazing Dr. X' (1948), in the title role. <br /> <br /> The first Kharis' Mummy Film, but there is more to be of interest or excitement, cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric (with lots of silent shades in the Sheriff's office). <br /> <br /> I'll give it a 3.
