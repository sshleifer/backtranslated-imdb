Well, I can answer the question once and all: 'What is the worst movie ever made?' This is a flight flight, played by Steven Sigal and co-written. Definitely there are a lot of famous movies, but it takes a cake that takes it very seriously. <br /> <br /> This is a roman film which will catch up to Romania to catch up with Bollywood. It speaks how regardless of intelligence and talent Steven Seagal irrespective of regards. This movie is so bad that after seeing it you feel violated and feel the need to roam the corners of the shower and tears, know that nothing will be cleared again. <br /> <br /> it's just released on the video. (I can not imagine) and I suspect that DVDs should wear protection gear and get regular counseling.
