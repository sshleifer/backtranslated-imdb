I said almost HBO and wanted my money back in the month because they are coming to this movie. I can sit and watch during the movie, "All right, we have to come up with something that is just like a house, only we will pay cash for children, cat-rate actors and oh yeah, we'll make it a lot less fun!" /> <br /> Well, it's probably not the last part, but basically here's what you got.If not anyone is worth it even if someone else hired it? And as a movie for kids? Forget it. Children do not want to see it, because of the bad jokes, it is not necessary, but I do not want to tell them, "Did you show us that the garbage lame, father? !!"
