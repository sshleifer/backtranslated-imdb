This movie is not like "office space" except in the premises. Office Space was delightful. I will not recommend this movie to anyone, because I did not have a smile during the whole movie. Mr Cornham's self-motivated tricks quickly became more annoying than 15 Jason Alexander in the same room. If you agree to view this movie, use a free rental or see it in someone else's room so that you can leave.
