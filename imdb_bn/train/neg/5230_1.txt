Although Robert "Nox" is his fan of Benfah, I'm not one of them. His films are sedentary and amateur, and not very funny, unless you are 14 years old, but this is the underlying ideas of depression. <br /> <br /> He is certainly not famous, because his unexpected fans want to believe you, harass people in Wikipedia, or stuff Ratings votes on IMDB. He certainly did not create a profile through a major media outlet, which is a volume about "his reputation" and his creation. <br /> <br /> There is little skill in Bennafar in limited animation but he must stay away from his young sycophants and learn to write some real funny stuff before he will be taken seriously as a real entertainer. At this moment, though, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
