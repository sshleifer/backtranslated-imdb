Quote: Rebel: Anyone with IQ. For more than 50 years, this film has seen, it was an intelligent, well-modern modern day classic, yes it does not have blockbuster cast or huge budget, but it still works very well and has tied me up for a full duration. <br /> <br /> An IQ is saying more than 50. This means that you have an IQ. Less than 50. Carlito's Way: Power to Wright !!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not know anything but do not comment on a movie. But I guess an IQ. Under 50, you do not know what I'm screaming for ... <br /> <br /> be calm!
