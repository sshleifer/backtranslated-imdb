This movie saw me because the plot was so unbearable and the film woke up to the expectation. In fact it makes quite awkward visits at times. Contrary to other female movies, sexual anxiety is the lowest. Violence scenes are some unnecessary unnecessary and objectionable. The plot is undesirable and the actresses and some of the lines are horrific. <br /> <br /> This picture is a strange combination of the Saddam-Mosochic Fantasy, which has been compromised by a window of atrocities and immorality of slavery and has failed in all calculations. . It was trying to create a child's sexual moral message for sexual intercourse. The girl knows that we feel somewhat guilty about being turned into rebellious dabatics in the initial scene. Then he tried to return to a movie about bador's victory over evil and return to the godly path. However, because they cancel each other, you end up with nothing. <br /> <br /> In many ways it is so bad because it is really valuable, if you realize the worst movie-making industry, the potential taste. Probably, because it is very bad, we almost abandoned the girl unacceptable.
