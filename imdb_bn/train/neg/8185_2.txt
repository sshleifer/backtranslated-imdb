Eat I decided to go out of the movie with some friends, want to see one of those light, incredible Christmas films, and I became despicable. The movie has failed. Beard Paul Jacksoni, who I considered as a good actor, played his role and played very terrible Vince Von, who was always my personal favorite. They tried a new Christmas, a Christmas movie and tried. Well sorted, well mixed with, but it all turned very wrong. The first ten or so minutes were not very bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It did not do any good, the rate was the same, there was no character development, and certainly the worst Christmas movie was ever discovered. Do not look it up, whatever.
