All right, we all love Daisy Dukes, but what's with this cast? Let's start, Jessica Simpson as Dessie, this girl has no country and there was no Daisy Dieti! Aunt Jessie was probably the closest one to be the closest one. There is no crime in Burt, but I have never seen it grow taller. The boss was part of the boss's humor. They even tried someone like Danny Davito ?! All right, now that Jessica Simpson saw her husband? He connects with a tie in Leak Duke !!!!!! Cleary does not look at the appearance of the old cast members of this producer. The screen was not present at the duck! It closes the movie from the beginning. I give this down a huge thum
