I have written about this supposed "masterpiece" of German New Wave and said that disagrees with many things: <br /> <br /> General expositions have major flaws, Maria's abortion and Oswald and her husband in basic contact with complex plot points In relation to the secret deal. How many people realized that the husband would not return his wife until Oswald's death, in return for a sufficient amount of money? <br /> <br /> 2) Finishing is extremely unhappy because of arbitrary and accidental. After reading Oswald's Will, the real screenplay to hide her for Maria Maria, her husband sold her marriage to Ashamald's marriage. In the final version, Maria performed a gesture of suicide only to water from a call across her wrist. Maria has gone terribly disappeared, instead of dealing with the consequences of her self-confusion and moral compromise and living with her. <br /> 3) Fasibinders are trying to force the people to personal, political, personal, private. Critics and "experts" emphasize, I do not do it. The dramatic events of the movie do not just make the historic radio news or Jackhammer's word of German reconstruction hardly deny that historical events make it an integral part of the play. <br /> <br /> The selfish ambition of the rise of prosperity from Maria's poverty is parallel to the so-called economic miracle of Germany. Maria is thus aimed to be a woman and her character of time and place, but in reality, unoriginal and vague. For women's age self-advocacy has been demanded by women for their independence. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally, there are several examples of unreasonable neutrality and amateurity - phasingbinder's drug addiction and consequently the ambiguity and irrationality have had their impact. Unknown people are ever seen screen closed; Music is confusing in places clumsily; And replace sporadically alternatives for acting. <br /> <br /> Strangely, Holocaust for a movie condemns a country for deliberate collective retention, it does not mention it once itself.
