Dear viewer- Whenever a person listens to his name, his first thought will be 'comedy'. This person was known for, or rather, was known for. After making an awesome blockbuster comedy like Huma, Hira Ferry and Hanchul, his silence silently and went slowly with few numbers, whose names I can not remember now. Now with the harmful films that are harmful, the first word that we will lose our mind after listening to its name will be 'torture'. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mysteries and idolatry. The only good thing about wash was the visual one or two scenes that were funny, although not surprising, and secondly, except Kunal Khemu and Kinky Granny, the performance was good. <br /> <br /> When I said acting, I felt Rajpal Yadav and Sharmin Joshi were at the top (if you compare them with others in the movie), then the snow climber, then the tanasree comes up and then the two idiots mentioned above. There was a problem in Kunal Khemu that he was laughing at his joke and even in his performance. Granny, firstly resembling a Scratch, plus he was not rather fun at all. <br /> <br /> The plot was the same, seen before one. Girls need four boys and money behind, but with a few twists. There is a 'bad' man who is instinctively stupid and stupid. And in the end, well and well on the good win all is well. The idea of ​​being spoiled with a full tone of cash is not just diverse. <br /> <br /> The worst thing about the movie is its length. After an hour or so, you want to leave the theater exhausted. But being a critic, I have to bear the whole full and half an hour of the film. The movie continues and the same humor is repeatedly and the situation is very different. <br /> <br /> If your mother-in-law arrives at your home and starts to spell everything you have, then send him to this movie and have fun. 10 out of 3
