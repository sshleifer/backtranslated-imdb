I was a horror / cowboy movie fiddle and this flick was so bad, I was not just an "actor", but was a director of a producer and felt embarrassed for the poor dreams who made money for this scalp. From the title, <br> <br />, you expect some great killings, some stories and at least some aspects or dialogs. Instead, you get what you see like a little more violent and sexually stooges episode. At least I smile at three Stooges. While watching this shit, I started another TV and started to watch Howard Staron for a while. <br /> <br /> Not saying, I see the strain. <br /> <br /> I understand that I can make a movie with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $ 50 dollars in lieu and a broken PC. This film is my inspiration to create a budget movie. Check out this movie if you see courage, but be careful ... there are not many here, but complete conversations and very little steps. It looks like "Kajamam" is like a Marily Strip film. <br /> <br /> I'm sure Germany has not banned due to gender or violence. Other countries have to pay attention.
