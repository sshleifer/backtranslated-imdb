This is the worst movie I ever seen. Everyone involved should be embarrassed. Everybody Ice-loving, conversations are horrible, and hockey does not begin to describe acting by every actor in this movie. Plagiarizing theft from the executive decision, but compared to Air Rage, executive decision academy prize element. I was not so frustrated when watching a movie. The air that is light in the air will not burn again. Anyone who views it should take a shower and wash them off the stinking creepy movie. The best part of this movie probably comes to an end, when the credits are rolling. This was the most simple movie I ever seen. <br /> <br /> Ice should be used to protect the law and order, and other people in this film should either retire or commit suicide. In both ways, they should not try to be a movie again.
