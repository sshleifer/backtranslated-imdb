Slashar ..... Well if you want to see scary, otherwise it will not be disturbed. It is quite clear that this movie has very little budget, for example it seems the whole movie has been shot. Somewhere in a warehouse, and numerous shows you'll see Mike Boom shadows and camera shades, believe me that you do not have to look them up. Also, try to ignore the Chess actors, what do you say to them! Basic Outline Some people decide to go to a game where they live on a street in a street, because their 3 killers are loose and finally anyone who survives becomes rich. Now there's something about this movie that keeps you watch and rarely has you seen that the horrors of a cheap budget these days, for example when I saw it, I felt myself I did not want to go to this game! Especially for $ 12.000.000 So anyway I will recommend it to you and see your own mind up.
