This film is a good example of the lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood. People have been paid to create this junket that lacks the main ideas and talents of the entertainment business. Discourage viewers to pay attention to this movie (and just like the one I hired). <br /> <br /> Uneducated teacher (3 years ago) kills the teenager's family because he wants to. For some reason he killed mother, father and brother. From the first five minutes you see bad acting and direction. After a few years, the detained teacher stopped from prison. Hmmm - Normal Bad Writing - Anyone in town who does not know him as a terrorist until the last moment knows. Neglected teachers somehow become like a navy seal and sneak around, superhuman with people hijacking and knives. Of course !!! Now the uneducated teacher kills the maid at the hotel for some reason, tearing the belfell to make it fun, and starts finding friends of the teenager. The girl is now the perfect way to love you. Neglected teachers come out of the hotel --- fools, sometimes the police can know his face - but he walks in the right direction by him. Now she killed two policemen outside the teenage house and entered her bedroom and killed her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This trash is not the only positive thing to do. If this low-level work of any other profession is done, they will be fired. Yet these fools create thousands of dollars for writing and managing this trash.
