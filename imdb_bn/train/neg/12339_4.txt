This comedy has some tolerant fun stuff, inexpensive stuff surrounds a lot. Every scene involving the palace servants and their stupid antics are time consuming And this plot is so rural that it surprises whether a script was actually ready before you started filming, or they uploaded it only after they went along. (* 1/2)
