A very weak movie, primarily due to a poor story, but also poor performance in Robert Danny Jr., and unreasonable behavior by many letters. If you are the person who likes to change your mind and only see a movie for its creativity or performance criteria, you can choose this movie. Personally I can not do this with a play and it is not too far away. <br /> <br /> When I'm considered a special character, I'll be particularly annoyed, stupid. In this film, if the main character usually works in this situation, there will be no film. When the first character played the first character, a successful attorney Magruder, starring Kennith Branagh, is leaving a party and starring Mary Dysk by Mobythe Davydtz, who stole his car and cried out. They are standing around a tropical rain because they are convincing him to roam around. <br /> <br /> She has something to say about her strange father, who is involved in some strange religion and makes crazy things. When they arrive at the fraudulent shake of the poor in the city, they notice that their car is on the drive. House lamps are also growing and some of the house breaks are broken. <br /> <br /> The things are so weird, she looks weird (looks like a trump, until she gets completely naked until she comes down to her?) Oh! Also, my father's strange, a ruins in the house - everything should be said to the Magrudadar, "Hey, it's so weird for me, I'm from here!" But not the Magrudadara, she is sleeping with him and then inspired by his stories and sex, objecting to his father's attempts to be grateful. They all shout! <br /> <br /> He's a flight attorney, he used to wear the same shirt before night (all the women in the office notice that was a fact) late in the office. Perhaps it is a successful attorney 16 parents have bothered the police in some of his cases, so when the police goes to the police, they claim that the father is terrorizing them, the police ignores him. All things - probably not! <br /> <br /> This is very unlikely.
