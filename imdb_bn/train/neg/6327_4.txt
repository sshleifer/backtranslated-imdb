I thought this picture would be a lot better. It sounds like a taunting spy generator, and it reminds me of Pleasantvil at the beginning, but this film is short up. <br /> <br /> The plot is just ridiculous. Russia's KGB and the Soviet Union have started an espionage school to treat their spying as Americans, but the city they set up for training is a little date, so they collect two inch spices from the United States. I do not know, but it seems to be okay. It is really strange when anyone in Russian city does not speak Russian. Collapsed in the welding of someone. Also, for a comedy it is painfully dry. One, two funny spot tops, and they have no singing and dance. Finally the movie will let you sleep. <br /> <br /> And, as a curved punch in the face, this film is so inspired to the United States that it makes me sick. In the movie again and again, the United States is Satan and Satan in the United States. This is the kind of memorandum campaign against the Japanese in the First World War. This is a film that everybody thinks that America itself is full. <br /> <br /> It gets 4 out of 10, and I'm kind of getting it. It would really get a, but the dance scene was fun, but then again it dragged far enough to be fun.
