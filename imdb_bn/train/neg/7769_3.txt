A real head of a film by Bill Rebin, which is becoming screwed in his business by stuck in the world. Three crackpot millionaire invites nine people to compete in a last-minute contest in a remote hotel, in which the final contestant will be given $ 1 million, although he has kept it far away. In most circumstances, most of the guest guests can get a shuttle in the hotel bar for guests, in most of the guests, a series of lam ribs is dragged. Most of the scenes are just an excuse to focus the camera on different female body parts, including an opening dance number that meets Geriatric Arrowbics, complete with crossover hookers in American bandstand. The ultimate nail hammer in the coffin that the white guy had no hesitation that could not dance to this scene. Give close attention to nipple slip. It continued for forty minutes until Bill Reben started throwing darts in various plot twists and which hit the next scene was inspired, which made this incompatible mess. It's a game until it's a game. Three old coots are under full control until they are there. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural power until it just becomes props. They are dead until they are dead. Even the ultimate narrator does not know what happened to him. None of the others, some of whom, some of them had no reason. Acting dinners are without the thinner caliber Diner dinner. Perhaps most of the actors probably go back to their jobs in local Sticky. I give a few points for the scene where the UPP Broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside the sink. Let's see with the wind! This Chilling Classic collection is really becoming my ben. Ben, drink it! Like Reben! I hate myself.
