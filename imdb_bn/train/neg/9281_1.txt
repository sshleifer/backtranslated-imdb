Only the Antichrist could be behind such a disaster. The only hope is the motivation behind this satiric "film"! This movie was so bad, it forced me to register with IMDb, finally, so I can trash it. This movie makes it even more tragic that it was such a great source material! I did not see a movie where its elements were so much that lesser results were given than the quantity of its parts. <br /> <br /> This may seem incomplete, but I want to start with the score. As a proud owner of a proud owner, my anger must be registered! I heard what John Scheffer Gold's Myth's brilliant score was as I had to pull in the sunny and dry heavy; It was much more awesome than burlesque death scenes, and almost as oddly comedic. As I've heard from her most inappropriate score, well, I can not really think about the bad. Maybe Jawas 4? <br /> <br /> as a plot ... I'm sorry. New age mysticism ??? What happened to the true trilogy satisfying reality? This movie (in the first two, but still !!), the supernatural part is understood in most cases and this is the subtlety which makes movies so credible. Here we are going crying crystals (calling all skyscrapers and brains !!) and reversed the crucifixion, though crucified in some scenes is quite normal but for camera angles. The elaborate refinement of psychological manipulation involving the molecule involved in our collective brain: a crap in the "disagreement" of recycled clich√©s and transparent incompetence in its place. Add that a lead "actress" so incredibly thank you the director for the feeling that she is missing for sure. I've never seen a little girl because of destroying the little Stefani family, so fundamentally annoying. Even more, I do not have any strong feelings about this ;-) Fortunately, the first three films are not sufficiently unsustainable in this train-deleter of celluloid or the most, how to do a research without making a film. Watch out for visitors! You may be lucky if inspired to flip.
