Before looking at this picture, I had very low expectations and just went to see the car. Finally I'm even regretted going for that reason. Plots are almost non-existent. Character development does not exist. There were so many clich√©s in film and so many quarrels and shrimp that I was just surprised and amazed how it got released. If not for the outsiders, I could not even give the rating 1 rating. An effort to create a coherent storyline that destroyed the eloquent racing rituals of foolhardiness and humorous characters that make up its members. Indeed, the plot of the film is so anticipated and simple that an average child story can predict most of the numbers. Bad acting, bad plot, bad joke, bad movie <br /> <br /> do not see it. Play instead of the Gran Turismo HD and it'll melt your thirst for faster sexy cars without going after a bad one.
