I also saw this movie, and Altho it was very good, I found it an impressive and would not recommend it to women who have small children. Terror on the mother's face when she will take care of her child. The train is really heartbreaking. And sad things - internally he died. Finally he went back to Applacian Mountain. She does not hide his grief from all the money in the world which is made of dolls. To try to heal her child, she seems to be pulling money from her clothes, she seems depressed. I'm surprised this movie was held in Detroit, because when I saw it, I was sure that people came to Cincinnati, Ohio. There was a route for the poor from this hill.
