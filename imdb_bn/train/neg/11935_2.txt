Billy Chung Siu Hanss (1993 Bloody Talwar film Asasin) Film to Love to Kill (Hong Kong, 1993) In the early nineties, Hack was among the most powerful products in the third division of the film. It is strictly between movies with strong sex, nudity, and violence, less or less void, and shocks are only valuable. Lethal death is definitely contained in the "more" section, with some unforgettable ideas and fragments of celluloid illness. <br /> <br /> Hong Kong Cyco Anthony Wang (from the same year, from Herman Yue's remarkable story) is a businessman and a husband who likes to torture, humiliate and rape his young wife (Elizabeth Lee May Fung), for any reason Leave him and protect himself and his younger son from the annoying pain. A police member (Danny Lee, famously named by actress Dr. Lam (1992), actress Billy Tong (directed by Lee) and The Killer (1989) by John Wow) names the problem and protects the wife and son But Anthony does not like it naturally, and it usually reaches too much spiritual and graphic fins during the rainstorm. <br /> <br /> Such movies were so popular when it was solely a part of the exploitation for cash, without any serious qualification. Pictures and incidents are not found in at least mainstream in Western cinema, and it gets worse when some / most tabs for the West, such as violence and distortion seen by children, are broken in this movie, often due to frequent reading in the platoon, most visitors feel ill, and This is particularly true for this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is still notable. There is an interesting and obscure soundtrack in Lamb's tradition, which effectively started the full turbine in 1992. Generally, the music and soundtracks in HK movies are interesting and added to the film, especially in these terrorist films. Cinematography is also notable, especially in finely, blue color and camera lenses (such as assassin), and in the camera a fierce storm is detected. There is nothing to lose any other film than a dance-meter. <br /> <br /> Actresses and actresses are talented and professional and so do not make the film even worse with their performance. Nonetheless, the film is normal HK There are humor that gets sick- even even sick, and even some "humor" are dropped into the soup. There is some jokes about Danny Lee's brutality and so ... There was no such thing found in Western "serious" movies. And this thing usually destroys Mac's otherwise notable hacks, like humor is a very obvious way and tries to entertain the audience and the public. <br /> <br /> This picture has a lot of disrespect, because it has so many scenes that Wong's wife abuse in different ways. She is raped and oppressed, beaten and kicked by her husband. We also see some flashbacks from Wang's own childhood that becomes equally violent as his own father, and his little boy now makes what he has done. These flashback scenes, mostly at the end of the film, include some completely unexpected experiences as some screenplay movements (for example, an ax's hits) and it apparently creates a completely insane and silly atmosphere. Again something that seems to be able to come with manufacturers of only H. In the end, suddenly suddenly suddenly woke up suddenly, suddenly as the madman kept his cell and filled some nails, for example, in the way of his anger. <br /> <br /> This image is also "suspicious" in my opinion, since violence and terrorism are really painful and work on something that should never be taken as entertainment, mostly I mean rape. The version I saw (I have seen two editions) is a very long and totally annoying rape scene that just tries as tragically as possible. I'm not sure that the H.H. listener likes such imagery, but I think no one will accept or do anything with the idea of ​​movie / entertainment ethics. Women die cruelly in the most cruel and neutral way, and men's fate often feels less than men. I have seen another version, new DVDs (Excluded Subtitles), published in HK. This "table atrocity" scene has a lot of subtitle in comparison to Taiwan's DVDs, which is otherwise similar to HTML versions. I have heard that the old HK Laserdisk is different from these two and the final credits are not as full of scenes and images found in the actual movie, it is impossible to say how the "uncut" versions that were released or shown are impossible. Apparently, a large number of footage was spent, probably before the theater was released. <br /> <br /> This film is written by Law Gum Fai and Lau Wing Bun, Dr. Lamb, The Untold Story and Gunmen (Kark Wang, 1988) But I have seen that outside of his other films, love kill is most unrealistic. Both Dr. Lamb and Antonold Story are very cruel and violent, but generally there are some attempts to criticize authorities and men, such as following a sequence of easy to follow or follow. Anthodo Storri's heartbreaking torture imagery, predatory offender, is very strong, and for example, the effect of such changes in society and the police must have its effect. But there is no one in death of love, it is only honest, counting and quick absorption, which is produced by Wang, an elderly director, "organized crime and justice bureau" (1993), Crime Story (1993) ". /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I said, what would I say? (hk) meaning the movie can be more and love Films like murders only live within the real parts of the commercial parasite industry.
