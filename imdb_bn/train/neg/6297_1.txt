I am a great fan of Martin Ames, whose picture is based on this photo. Unfortunately the manager can not translate the book into the screen. The novel is completely modern and highly artificial and its wildlife characters and traditional plot lines and the separation of character development. This is the temptation of the most moral one of contemporary British writers, extra and simply a ridiculous test. The director of the film completely missed the novel's point of view. In his hand, the film shouted at Breakkake speed, each known comedy shot and 'strange' camera involved in the corner. It's like a Russell on acid, and hundreds of cramps are due to the dictator's old dictatorship. Gorgeous actor Christian Salimeno's penis was too short to save this mad film for me (even short). Bottomless!
