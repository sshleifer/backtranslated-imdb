A really muddled sensory mess. Most of the movie shows less or less like 1987, but still the future things like a police ray gun are cast. And that car! The director began to love with colorful lighting. The only real actress was Valerie, but since there was no cast list, I did not know which actress was there. This is one missing value. Grade: F.
