The author came up with a beautiful idea for a story, but in many cases, many errors were taken away from the film, which almost got stuck in the implementation of the plot. Basic elements such as character development were most discussed. Inconsistencies also foster their ugly heads. A large palace in the middle of the rural Irish countryside? Characters are just "showing" in a garden in the night ("I can add at very convenient times")? Not at all was "bad" at all. I rated it 4, based mostly on Alison Elliott's story and genius.
