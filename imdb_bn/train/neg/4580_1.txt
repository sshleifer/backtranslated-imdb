I'm still trying to determine that this is actually the worst movie I've ever seen - a very annoying problem with the film is that true scientists have been interviewed, but their footage has helped to see it as they support these ideas, BSR. For measuring the signals of the interview, BS from around 10 thousand to one-up, the interviewers say, "We want to do you _think_ !!", but they are very lazy for easy research on their own words. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you think you want to expand your consciousness, please be quite careful to read some real book about quantum theory: "Einstein's Universe", Nigel Calder (a thin Volume, not a challenge), "The Crossover Code", Henz Pegels. If you can not bring yourself to read a book, please do not complain to critics about being "open minded". <br /> <br /> To recover, this movie is incredibly bad. <br /> <br /> Do you really know the good picture which questions the nature of reality? "Thirty-floor", operated by Roland Emerick, Craig Bayer√≥, Gretchen Mole, Vincent d'Anfrio. Smart, sexy, thought-provoking.
