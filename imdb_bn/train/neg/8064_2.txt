... I saw it at my teenage age. This movie was quietly entertaining. What I like about Soul Beaverwowers is Gothic atmosphere during party scenes and in constant 'dream' and 'reality' <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 6th Finance 'and' Don 'Now look,' I'm surprised at the end.
