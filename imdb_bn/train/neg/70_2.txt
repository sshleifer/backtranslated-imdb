This movie did not create it in theater in our area, so it was the first person to rent it after it became available on DVD. At one time, I heard the critics and passed it. <br /> <br /> The movie was very disappointing despite the excellent lines of actors. I can now see why it went directly to the video. <br /> <br /> I thought it could be something valuable with Bloom, Laser, and Rush. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /> <br /> The film did not move slowly and did not drag me. I failed to develop a lot of sympathy for the characters and had to protest fast to advance. <br /> <br /> If you're just thinking of hiring it for 'eye candy' but I do not recommend this movie. It would not even be that satisfied.
