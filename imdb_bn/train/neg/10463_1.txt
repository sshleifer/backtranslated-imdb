These pictures had so much promise. I was very excited about this film. In the end, it was the worst, painful laughing. The acting style really, plays the towel from the super-animated (character of Casper) to the plane (angels, wife and daughter). I felt that the conversation was an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of talking to each other. Give special attention to the "bug" scenes. It is very insulting about the ability to find the audience's things. In the defense of that scene, though it gets the biggest smile from the whole movie. I could read that they spent a lot of money on various foreign destinations. Very bad they do not use it. I do not think I was transferred to external locations. Anyone can insert the collagen stock footage in Rome. However, to finish a positive note, I had set the set was pretty good. I really like the graphics that have been shown on decoding computers. This is my opinion (and that is) if the Schmaltz factor is very low and the ACTION factor is greatly increased, then this film will be good.
