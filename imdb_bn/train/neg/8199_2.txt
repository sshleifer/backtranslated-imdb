I'm so glad, I did not spend the money to go to the movies :-). Things, Final Fantasy, The Abyss, etc. It is nothing more than a compilation of other classic title elements, rather it is made in soft and meaningless scenes. How can I not understand the purpose of making this movie - there is nothing completely new in its story, which is too stupid. And there is nothing to see - FX'es seem to have been collected from the other hand, you usually have seen them all in other movies. But it is certainly a good lullaby.
