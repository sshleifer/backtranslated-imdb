I did not have anything about this movie that I liked. It was almost a clear low budget, including bad light and camera work (almost like Blair Witch's project, it was not supposed to be the only way). The plot was not really a lot, and the movie is just over drugs and. I've actually fast-forwarded through the last 1/3 movies, but it does not help much about this issue. It seems to be good from the box, but I must say again: There is nothing good about this movie. No good actor, special effects were so fake, the camera work was terrific, and the dialogue was terrible terrible. On my own personal scale, I give this movie 10 of the 10. Yes!
