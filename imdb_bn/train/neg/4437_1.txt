"Love win" does not win anything. This is a plodding, ponderous, 4 hours of torture. Actually it's a little less than 2 hours long, it takes a lot more. Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw may also think of actors acting as amateur. Supporters are not terribly frightened. Perhaps they tried so much to the top so that they could be clowns, but, if so, I did not see it. Mira Sorvino does not have an impression in one way or the other. She (she) is okay. My guess is that Maravox's game of the same name written more than 27 years ago, is even better. It can not be any worse. The writer and director of this movie, Claire Paypalo, was inspired by the latest production of this game. She did not know what she was thinking when making this bomb. <br /> <br /> All translations may be lost.
