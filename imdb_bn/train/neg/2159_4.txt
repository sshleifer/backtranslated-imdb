Well, Robin Hood is right as 'Gizaar' ... like advertising! That was not a very optimistic word, and, I was skeptical than it was worse. <br /> <br /> I can take a kick Robin; I can have a robin who can argue with a professor diary girl; But Robin, who did not exchange fun with his single Henman, is hard to swallow, and Robin and * full cast * who find it difficult to manage their line is the kiss of destruction. How could anyone pass such label distribution without visible visible visible? Again and again, he thinks that he is struggling with half-defined Shakespeare instead of loosening it with a sweet clip; I hope that this was simply an extraordinary comedy feature of a comedy movie that was clearly defined as the role of the comedy Sidekick, but then it started to spread into the rest of Cast. <br /> <br /> Ariel Flinen's role in this role was what you said, naturally he escaped from delivering high-speed conversations, as if he was thinking about it at the moment ... and this product shows that it is not so easy Sounds! If they were going to throw characters as shiny chappes, then the questions of the actors should have been given the right line: they think they have no idea about how they can be managed. <br /> <br /> I was afraid I did not even like pantomime Sheriff for the same reason; The line is definitely not taken seriously but the audience delivers with a nudge and a surprise (and written in this case). They have moved from the place - the fourth-wall-stuffing staff - but it's not really funny. <br /> <br /> This committed product reminds me of a leaking school game. The only actor and character I felt that there was any gratefulness for the Guy of Gisborne player, who (a) was a credible velili and (b) could have a handle on the credible character - but in truth, I want to have a very good future for the series. There was no good trauma! At the time of writing, I hope it will give a shot that improves things and falls in bed a little bit next week, needs less firmly visible setting-settings, and perhaps more easily with actors dialogue: after all, the first episode of "Doctor Who" is really a There was no show-stop, though it was not so bad. But if I do not see any improvement after episode 2, I am afraid that this series has lost nearly one audience. <br /> <br /> There will be no sorrow because I have a soft spot of Robin Hood, "Douglas Fairbank's courage is a legend from Richard Green's strong reliance on the screen, but this robin is unable to stir my blood in the slightest.
