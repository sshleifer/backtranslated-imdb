Poor Paul Mercurio After landing the role of Scott Hastings in Strictly Ballroom, he was able to find many junkies in the best film in history. No character in this movie is too unlikely, even horrible, but Marcueri's leadership is like someone who you want to ignore - totally inept and he is above all. Large design of clothing is big mistake, that is one.
