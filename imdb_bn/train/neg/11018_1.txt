I bought this video quite cheaply pre-rental, thinking that the cover looks pretty beautiful. And it was nice, but the movie is trash. I can handle B-grade, sometimes I can enjoy a good B-romp (even the best example of how the word 'surf nazi's die die' can be entertaining), but it is only a mixture of blue color Incredibly dull scenes are very clearly broken by the horrible sequence of good healthy cheap porn and entertaining dreams. This movie has very little offers.
