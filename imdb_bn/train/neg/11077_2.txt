Due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Burginin I was the only reason I was elected to give this shot a shot. What I can say is that it is a good actor, the greatest waste of all time. As far as I can say, Baragon is the only actor. Other performance was so monotonous that I would be surprised to see the "actors" actually in the studio. This level of acting was so strong and penetrated by the acting department in the acting department that I felt that my eyes were bleeding when the credits fell, and you had a perfect cinematic disaster. This movie was evidently made to appeal to children's audiences and as a credit it was better than the original programming in Disney Channel and similar kid-focus networks. But honestly, that's not saying much.
