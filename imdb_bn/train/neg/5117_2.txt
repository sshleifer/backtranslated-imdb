First of all, I want to say that I am a Christian (and I work in movies and TV industry) so I understand that it is a feature length film to work on, so encouragement to film makers on this issue. I'm all for positive, raised messages if they are true for the nature of life (that's a fallen world and things do not always work ... even for Christ's followers). I'm glad others are seeing so much positive feedback for growing Christian message; For me it was that death sentence where the film fell on its face. A movie lives in his story and dies and here you have a dimensional stereootip, exposition exponential and spontaneous changes in character behavior, which at least say the least. I believe that a movie will not have to put the point together with your message. I'm sure Kendrick Bro. The time will be developed alongside and their story will be as well. Maybe they could manage another person's scrapplek as their next project. <br /> <br /> * Sports movies are not my first love but a good one (Hobbies, Dreams field etc.) can be inspired in many ways. If you are interested in a PG-rated movie that inspires, give a look to Steven SÃ¶nderberg's 'King of the Hills'. The truth of all true God ...
