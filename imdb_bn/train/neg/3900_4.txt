Anyone who reads the book, I can say that it is much lower than the larger American version of Gwynth Paltrow acting. There are several reasons for this. First, Emma is very unpleasant. Yes, he has errors, and it is not the easiest person to choose - but the viewer should not be cruel to him. Second, Mr. Nightwie is miscast. This version is more suitable for Bront or Gaskell's adaptation than its annoying and annoying Austen, and the whole mood of the whole thing can be "closed". Thirdly, an actress in the role of Samant Morton Harriet Why did he become so sick? Harriet is considered to be blond and flower - in the next scenario it does not see whether it is going to carry it. Fourthly, the structure was mucked up and cut to the scene. Finally, when Emma decides that she loves Mr Knightley, then it seems completely annoying because this description was not well shown and carried across throughout the film. Fifth, what was right with Mrs Elton's accent? He tried to suppress his own accent at the beginning of the words like American actress, through halfway through America and then finally came back to English. Finally, drag this end up. The book and the big film version end with the marriage of Emma and Mr. Knightley. This version is actually confusing after the announcement of marriage without displaying our show. <br /> <br /> All the efforts, rather the worst, Read the book or rent the Paltro version instead
