When I first saw this movie, I thought it should have come from the category of children - it is very funny and occasionally funny, and actually a good story, but it is unthinkable because of the lack of "romantic chemistry", such as Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins Able to do I should remember that Walter Matthew Albert is perfect for Einstein, and his performance is remarkable, but this is the only exception. This image is displayed forcibly, there is a lack of instruction and oh yes ... the music is ridiculously awful, it did not keep me in a very mood. But if you do not expect a smart, disciplined comedy / romance story, it can certainly be entertaining, as I said it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his friends Tim Robbins are annoying, often intense enthusiasm for the heart stolen by Mogh Raayan. A very contradictory movie, but it can be a perfect film until it is taken seriously.
