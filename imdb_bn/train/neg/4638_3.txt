A group of predators kill a Verubal, kill it, and then the head is immoral. Sells the attyl (operated by director / writer Tim Sullivan), which runs a special personal clinic in Connell Transplants. Research chemist Rich Stevens (Mark Sawer), while the lab blast, when his face disappears, his eyes are wasted, the unfortunate recipient of the Verneuf jaw. The first full moon takes some time to reach, so first we get a flexible love story between Rich and his sympathetic, Big Breasted Nurses Sandra Gard (Stefani Bitton). Sondra is so kindly that she has the opportunity to tie off her wardrobe and start to ride rich in the bed even before her bandages remove! After one month in the hospital, Rich Ice's wife Rita (Deborah Huber) returned home, who immediately said to her, "You look so ugly". Our protagonist soon discovered that Rita is not only a bitch, but an adulteress who has maintained a relationship with Craig (Lyndon Johnson), his supposed friend. Finally, the emergence of the full moon and the wealthy finds herself in a hairy accident herself because she transformed into a (very stupid looking) violin animal. The onset of predictable killings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She made friends with the humanoid psychic / secret expert Andros (Kurt Levy) and the local author Sydmak (Jason Clark) and Lesbian-police-detective-in-a-pants-suit Justin Evers (Tary Merkel) both fall into trouble. When Dr. Atholl was shocked, the doctor sent her toxic youthful Henchen Cass (Eric Messenger), who was later found to have torn to death in the clinic. With help from Sandra, the rich managed to escape. Sandra takes her back to her place and she is basically raping her during a five-minute sex scene. Will Rich be able to control his Lycanthropy or get rid of it before slowly claiming more victims? <br /> <br /> This simple WAWFLE FICTION, with a camcorder shot furiously, has some unique firmness with the eye-bone angle, but otherwise the cliche comes out later on the clit. Set sub-layer level - Clinic view seems to be pictured inside someone's home or apartment. The wolf conversion scenes do not look good on the use of timeline photography in the 1940s. Instead, they work ragged editing. Actors throw some hair. Cut Throw some more on. Cut More fur ... and his face full of white lips he can fill. Cut There is no need to worry about the continuation! There is no fade, no dissolving, nothing. It's pretty sloppy. Once fully transformed, Wearfulle Dress (designed by Jeff Leroy, who edited and shot the film) is quite awful. It is red, flaming Christmas bulb eyes, fox carpet and plastic face which is almost completely restless. There are many times to see the cameraman's fingers in front of the camera lens, and the moon lasts for five whole days all day long? As much as Cast is related, they are amateur, but tolerant. And as far as B's awful flicks are concerned, there are bad ones. It can be considered fairly well, it is only 70 minutes long and provides plenty of red material during attack scenes, as well as T & A. mentioned by Mrs. Beaton. <br /> <br /> It was produced by David S. Sterling (Camp Blood) is the first to run the wave of digital video, who began to dominate low-budget / independent horror scenes between the mid-right / late decade. Most of his notoriously awesome productions were published by Brain Damage Films, a label that can be avoided like plugs in most cases. The FX guy Jeff Leroy (who is listed as the co-director in IMDB, not on the original credits of the film) and Vinnie Bilansio (who appeared as a small role in the hunters) became more fun and smooth. In 2006, a women's generation of Vernolus showed absorption, which had red eyes and all kinds of similar animals in the display.
