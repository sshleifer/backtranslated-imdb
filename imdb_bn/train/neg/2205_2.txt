Such a plot really has a lot of potential, but it was butchered here. Actually, I felt the cheese ingredient at the beginning, but I thought it would be better after a great cat. Oh, I was wrong! So crazy scientist makes a monster, he wants to be proud of his old cronies before killing them, but of course they escape. Then, it's really bad. Rubber shark masks should have been counted while coming out of some phoselles, but probably could lose my number. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> How we found people in shark people. I hate to eat spoon from every aspect of a horror movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing more pleasant in the middle, after almost being killed by a modified shark-man and rushing around the jungle-eski island. When you hear about Shakespeare ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
