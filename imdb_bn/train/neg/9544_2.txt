I do not enjoy this picture. I was not very good at acting and the stories were annoying. 20 years old save the computer? I thought it was even a little too far for a film. I did not understand why they could not stop it, why does it take a sledgehammer? It's a shame, but after the original 80's, you'd expect a lot more than what was actually distributed. This picture could be the 21st Century version of the old photo, it was not. If you want to see, do not see this film! <br /> <br /> Even if the old computer could not survive to save, but in my opinion, very sugar would be flick.
