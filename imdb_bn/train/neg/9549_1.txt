I thought why John Wood was. I'm not playing Falcon until I saw the movie. BAD plot, bad science, bad acting and overall a bad film. Please do not see this film. If you are an atheist, rent the original "War Games". <br /> <br /> I do not like the bamboo plot to reduce the idea of ​​terrorist-threatening. In the first film, WOPR It was created because thousands of surgeries were performed in Russia in the United States. The idea behind the computer in this movie was that they could kill the terrorist before threatening them. Alongside politics, the good thing about the first film was highlighted that even a fool would understand the concept of continuity of war. No such insight is given to this film.
