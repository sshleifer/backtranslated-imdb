Oh, all right. So, after reading a little rebellion here, I decided to watch this movie for myself. This movie is deer. I stopped watching it. Instead of seeing this film, I strongly recommend cleaning a closet, you will be more fooled / entertained. <br /> <br /> This is less budget with bad acting. <br /> <br /> Anyone giving this movie 10? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> Very, very bad movie.
