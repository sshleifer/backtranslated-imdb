For finding half-yearly movies for rent for my kids over several years, I've really developed a sixth sense in the search of straight-to-video efforts that are really painful (anyone who lives for ages) eight). I said, cut this buggy, the kids asked me for half the movie, "What did he say?" And "why does he do it?" And my eyes got sad from rolling every minute or so the identity of the characters apparently changing the random plot has done a really bad job. And the next time someone decides that there is absolutely no skill with the sword, just "bring the reality" into a film, please run it with a dull butter knife. "Prehysteria!" This was the head and shoulders above. Ah.
