This version has moved slowly for my taste and I think I have problems at the beginning of this game. But the first film is a general TV movie version of a game which means it is not the original version of William Holden's version. Can not they hire more than twelve people as extra? Why was the film moved in 1966? So you can give a small sister a line about the Vietnam War protests? Why did not 1963 and give a line about civil rights movement? <br /> <br /> Missing something to weld. Joe and Sanders, especially with Josh Brolin, hit the right notes for his character with his scene. On the other hand, miss a lot of brilliant notes. She is credible as a former BMOJ joke but William Holden's raw sensitivity is not there. I always thought that Brolin is looking like a gorilla so that all women can ride on her in the city (penal apologies). Gretchen Mole was excellent, but she was very knowledgeable about the character she had played. She does not need the characteristic of innocence or ignorance projects. Maybe because he was about 5 years old than Brolin and the letter. But then Holden was ten years old again. Bonnie Badeelia rather forgot because Mother and Mary Steinberg could not remember whether her Blanch Dobos or Catherine played "The Timing of the Shieu". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I've always felt that stories like young girls always need a fast to choose passion for practicality. "The Twilight Zone" I believe, with the episode "Spot of the Moment", proposed a possible theorem, where a small Diana Highland was transmitted by a bitter adult Diana Highland, because the little Diana Hyland chose to run with a similarly similar helter guy .
