Apparently isolated and full of herself, the director apparently chose to explore the wrong-depth to stretch a 5-minute plot in the 81-minute Snow-Fest. <br /> <br /> The moments that work now are very limited, and the letters do not seem too real. How can you invest in a major drama invest in those who make so much surreal? <br /> <br /> Carefully and stylistically, it all seems like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring works with irregular camera work, strange silence and action spacing, and little spider images of crawling across the screen? Anyone thought that the film will go back to film It has not added anything, not only cheese, and even the rest of the stylistic film (this film is also called a style which is a close call). What a flop
