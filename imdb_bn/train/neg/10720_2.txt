I saw this movie last weekend and it's stupid and stupid. An ancient curse is a man turn into a mummy in his pajamas? The victim gets frightened and can not run from a slow moving old man. They tried to pull him off and instead of torching him or drops, burned him. Mr. Munnar's Quantin aka Mr. Feyarsam married Diane Brauer alias Miss Canfield, who was dissatisfied with the marriage to get away from the marriage fame. Wow, love plot The rest of the cast left each other in the grave and wait to scream and wait for them to run. The Egyptian girl does not feel bad but does not lend too much to the film. Where's Mummy? Really just unleashed a damn. It does not contain a torch at least in public mummy movies. Watch this movie if you need sleep, because you do dose.
