At least every new fall line up show, my "3 strikes and you out" deserve the policy. I smile to a humor 3 chance, ie, 3 full episodes. After Episode 1, I actually said on TV, "Tomorrow will be canceled". It was that bad. I have now seen the first 4 episodes of "Cavemen" and are still there to manage even a sunny. It's not really a matter of fact, a gopher, a little child, is not actually a movement. I'll judge every episode in the future and punish myself, because I'm sure I'm clearly missing on this show. I'm simply not getting "this", but I believe that Prime-Time is a comedy of a major TV network, just be fun; But still there is no smile from me. There is no way that ABC can keep the greatest fun comedy of all time at 8:00 PM. I know that the tongue with my brain will be an internal joke. I've read each of the previous comments, I find it "social" aspect, but, where is the work ???? I will continue to torment for at least 30 minutes a week, until I have a light-bullet moment and shout "Eureka" on the head.
