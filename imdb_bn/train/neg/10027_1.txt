Gader Sunny Bhai's action in this movie! Akshay Kumar Kumar 300, Leonidas Director General, Spiderman and Matrix Neo with Superman. It's fun. Without Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor's comedy, I can not see anything positive in this film. The author seems to have asked to write his 10yr old son. The film is so unrealistic that Anil Kapoor is the director of shooting for a long time shooting shotgun with the lowest possible mistake. Besides Tasan, there is no other tension for this film. I'm sorry for spoiling my money in this movie and I will not recommend it to anyone. 1/10 I can at least give IMDB or I will give it a blank.
