Where to start? How terrible it can be described in the movie? <br /> <br /> I started with a hick laugh. It's not too funny. The actors add a bunch of camouflage musicians - meat loaf terrible and Deborah Harry even worse. Poor Art Carnie, who knows better than doing this movie. <br /> <br /> and then there are plots. Alice Cooper is living a life of work, whose life goal meets Elise Cooper, a girl from a group. At least they get what they want ... <br /> <br /> And then, when the film ends, they can not come up with more visible end scenes than good and bad scenes - well, I will not destroy if you're really movie Want to see it but it's for you. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who can tell you that it may be a "B" movie or perhaps worse. Gilead Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. It's a sure sign that the movie probably will not be very good. If nothing else, the film lives up to low expectations - even worse than the poor. <br /> <br /> Just say this. All bad movies are compared with this movie. And there is no one better than Rhode.
