Certainly young mind products, this piece can apply very well to 20 crowds, who are still trying to find their place in the world, when looking at every neurosis. However, I can not imagine that the large number of dancers will be engaging for navigational, bitter humor, or wild topics, especially for more than 30 years. Another problem is that peripheral characters, whose filmmakers do not have anything abusive, are humped up to such strange caricatures for humorous effects, that they fail to be relatable in any real way. <br /> <br /> However, there must be some style points for filmmakers, who have grown up in the video generation and using every conceivable editing technique in the book, otherwise the unattended plot. Here are 2 points to remember. First, beware of the festival darling. Secondly, even though we are young at YouTube, every one of them has not been eligible to receive big screen treatments in their old life accounts. But these young filmmakers have all the rights to make their films, and if others find something to identify with it, then it is better. Still, I can not think at the end of this film that the last generation, how old it is, how many challenges and complications will be presented in the real world. At the age when every child is constantly assuring them and their 15-minute exposure, elasticity and the ability to read problems, it does not seem to be the only firm point of this generation.
