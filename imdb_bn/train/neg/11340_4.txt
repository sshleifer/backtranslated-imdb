This is one of the most bizarre movies ever made - even for Philinea. The only big thing about her is SATYRICON. It's a weird wonder world, untimely and ramp of two and a half hours through sexual challenge. Sutherland makes an enthusiast unappealing Casanova and fails to engage visitors in a series of strange vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography to the audience. Although industrial aspects and costume design are outsteading. The Academy is not even nominated nor even academically rewarded by rewarding another OSCAR itself. There were also nominated (weird) odd, pointless, and almost incompetent popple. Go figure !! The movie is only 150 minutes in the video, less than 16 minutes from the original running time. This viewer was grateful.
