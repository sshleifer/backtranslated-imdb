I'm 17 years old, and still like most of the episodes of Scooby Doo and the old ones. I liked the movies of the 1990s, and recently we were directly directed to this year's skid Doo and the Goblin King DVD Scuba Doo Outdoors, which I was not expecting as good as I did. However, get a needle to get back! I have seen some episodes, I hope very well, but I was not very impressed by what I saw. First of all, I hate animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday-cartoon-standard, the worst aspects of the series were easy. Even some shows I really had a little better animation of the hatred. Even worse, Saggy and Scuba looked like Alien, and I really missed Fred, Velema and Dafen because they added a lot to the older episodes, while Schuvo Do was positively good. I hate the change of character, because instead of solving this mystery, it seems that Shaggy and Schubby have now played superheroes, they could never do anything in movies or in the sky where you? Show The theme tune was not very good, I could not even remember it, and the jokes were lame and surprised. Although, I acknowledge that there are very talented voice cast, they had good elements, and as human beings, different sounds like actual voices were not called possible, which they did, I could add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was terrible, and I'm not trying to protest it, I personally feel it. 1/10 Bethany Cox's Bazar
