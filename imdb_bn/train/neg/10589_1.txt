Universal soldier: Back is not the worst movie ever made. No, that honor should go to a film that tries to make a statement or achieves some artistic achievement, but it fails in a cruel or abusive manner. However, I've never seen a movie that has been so successful and successful as a universal soldier: The Return <br /> <br /> This image is a scientific work / workshop which is nothing more effective than its recommendation. Acting as bad as any movie I've ever seen. The plot is terrible and anticipated. Special effects are unfortunate. In short, anyone who is connected to this movie remotely should be ashamed of yourself. US: The previous Van Damme Rental Ground Makes Breaks feel like cinematic masterpieces breaking. Some movies are so bad, they are good. Believe me when I tell you that it is not one of them. Do not forget to tell me what I really do here. I suspect that many people will not see this movie even before they see it, only in case: no.
