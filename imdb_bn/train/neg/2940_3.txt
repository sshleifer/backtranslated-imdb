I saw this movie when I was really small. It's one of the weird movies I've seen, sometimes. Now, generally, I like the weird movie, but it's just a little more. <br /> <br /> There is not much of this movie. If anything, it starts like a toy story, where the toys come in life, and Raggedi Ann and Andy carry out an adventure to rescue their new friend Bobbet. From there, craziness ensues. Greedy, Lonice, a sea monster called Gazook, listening listening songs, all of which only create movie vids. Also, I can not help but Bobot is boring and slightly intense. He certainly will not help the film. <br /> <br /> Now that I did not like this movie, there were some nice parts too. I liked the camel's music. Although it was a song about loneliness, it was a friendly feeling. Then, there was Sir Leonard. Most of the Lonnians were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and perhaps interesting. Raja Ku Ku is a small darbag, which Dr. Evil looked like a serious villain. Also, there were songs of Ragejdy Andy, not the girls toys. It was definitely a good song for young boys who wanted to work hard. But, honesty, even this thing is no good in the movie. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /> <br /> Although I personally do not recommend this movie, I have to admit, it has a pleasant moment. If you are interested see this, but only if you are in the mood for something "actually".
