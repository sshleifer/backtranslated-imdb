In the days before the toxic avenger, the troupes of the lower camp of Tromas Films tried to take high (OK, least-less) roads to create slash pictures directly. I want to think that to see the results here they are all determined to leave the protection and take self-aware parody. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It goes through two different castes and countless subpopulations, It is painful to see. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> , Let's call it St. Splatter). Students argue and sullen, and pettily with each other, their time slackers ahead. Meanwhile, Julie Parker, a new professor, proved completely disabled in her job. How children work to avoid doing any work in relationships, infidelity, unwanted pregnancies, adulterers and classes; Julie shows an unclear lover, St Splatter's rigid administration, counseling unexpected mothers, and her students's empty, vague appearance. It means no meaning of a darn thing or is resolved in a meaningful way. Oh, and once again, a pov shot comes and kills one of the girls, but does not wait for your breath. A red herring killer, and then sadly with a real killer, the anticlimactic clash, then it's back to shelter and roll credit. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And the most serious subject of this movie is the determination of the killer of the film - the men of this film are so deserving. I paid good money to stop a quarrel with a pregnant girlfriend, or Lanched Latharieu, who fooled his girlfriend roommate or any other strange priest. There is no trial.
