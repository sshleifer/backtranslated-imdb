Like all the karnosaur films, this is a joke. On the way to the removal of dinosaurs, my sister reminds me when she plays with her doll, because they can not be a stereo or more fake-look than they do. <br /> <br /> <br /> I mean, first they are on the bus, then in a warehouse, suddenly they are in the boat. And let's be serious, does it mean that a couple of dinosaurs can live together in the van, or on the ship? I thought dinosaurs were the biggest animals, and now they can fit on a moving van. Even when you think about it, it seems stupid. <br /> <br /> The only reason I gave it 3, it's still entertaining. I found it better than the first one (not yet second observer). Just do not rent it. I saw it on TV and it is a good thing because I did not want to rent it.
