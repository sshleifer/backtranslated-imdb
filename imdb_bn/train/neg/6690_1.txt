I sit down to see this photo with my friends with very low expectations. Where was my expectation is close enough close. I can not really say how this film is watching, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot was helpless and the act was terrible. My friends and I will be able to stop this movie about 30 to 40 minutes before and request the video store to be taken back immediately. I do not recommend this film to anyone until you are deliberately trying to watch bad movies all the time. I do not really know how this film is going on in the theater for more than a day, and I do not understand why anyone would be interested to see it, this is not only an extraordinary title, but a lack of famous actors / actors. This review is not a joke and I honestly think it could possibly be the worst movie ever made. It's certainly the worst movie I've ever had to sit through.
