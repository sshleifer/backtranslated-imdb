Usually I do not have any problem with the ineffective oath in the film, but it really bothered me. They all had oaths. For the whole picture. (And as someone else mentioned, get cancer) This is annoying, annoying and provocative. I was not you. <br /> <br /> It's not that I do not like movies, since most people like it 'target life'. I love drinking the drink men's women, and what happens in it is that a load of Taiwanese people lead their life. But I can relate to them. I have never met the actors in this film, I never met, and I used to work on a construction site. So go figure. William H. Messi told me depressed. Sometime <br /> <br /> 2/10. Avoid, until you enjoy tedium.
