This is a great idea for a movie but unfortunately, it does not turn into a great movie. What is the start of a sweet and almost ignorant romantic comedy about Fluffer with Fluffy in love with the Fluffy spiral outside the control of the generous bumps and generous bumps in the real stuets of the Plots with a generous loan from the Knights, Thorma and Lauais, Schwarz, Frisse? , And even a weird "dash" 400 blows thrown towards the end. (At least the director has researched!) The result is certainly not annoying but ultimately, this chic, well-produced flick has added a lot. However, the actors do not have a sporting career with all the elements and there are few good smiles in the world of gay pornographic scenes. <br /> <br />
