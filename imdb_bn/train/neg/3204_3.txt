As bad as it has been made (I have seen so many bad), it's still a very hairy movie. Originally a rehearsal of Sigel's "Coogan Bluff", the main difference is that Clint Eastwood's hat was much more curiosity than Joe Doe Biker, if it was an unexpected actor. <br /> <br /> Great (and great fun) as a bad guy, sort of a budget Vittorio Gassman. She is the main reason for sitting through this steampile, as most of the other cast performs terrible, especially giving the girl. Unfortunately the old-fashioned Brazilian, he once believed in romantic lead (see "Mando Cane" to see him fleeing from women). Here, like the second-level Ben Gaza, he was offered after doing nothing. It's all Joe Dawn's show, unfortunately. And all of its generic 80's "Action movie" music which can not be more annoying. <br /> <br /> Gradeon Clark can make good B-movies ("without warning"), but here he travels, falls, breaks his nose and loses three teeth. Well, at least Malta was beautiful, and there are venetian to try to save the day. 3/10.
