The concept behind the LOST MISSILE is not bad at all, but unfortunately the story becomes a little dust in the middle and excessive use of stock footage and poor special effects sink the movie into sub-level level. <Br> <br /> The film starts with a missile title on Earth. Due to reducing the world, it manages to resist Soviet objects in a panic. It is not necessarily good, but this apparently inhuman crafts has a steam trill that destroys everything on its path and the ship is now in the orbit of the planet. In other words, with each pass it follows a swath of death - one that could potentially kill us all !! So, it is the best scientist of the United States (under the leadership of young and well recognized Robert Loggia) to save us and plan for planning - and save New York from its immediate flight route! Unfortunately, they are not able to save it (I was not there, so I can not say that it is not a big loss), but thanks to the good Americans, they can finally destroy the ruins! <br /> <br /> So, you can see, the story idea is not bad but the original. However, many old clips of warrior planes and son's sons who run Rider Scopes are out of date and it seems like padding. Overall, a decent but at least inspired movie that the ultimate fans of the genre might like - all else, look at your own risk.
