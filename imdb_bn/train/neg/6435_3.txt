I believe it is difficult to believe that anyone will keep this movie in the same context as Exxcist. Where the Exorcist was fine and unclear, Stigmata was a fool, painful and traveler. <br /> <br /> In a while I saw one of the most beautiful scenes, but did not create imagery. The exhibition sponsor makes it intolerable for downward spiral. <br /> <br /> When I was interested in this movie compared to exosiist, I was interested and that interest increased on my web site. On the web site there were many stories of "real" stigmata of history. However, the scene of the scene, the film is so obsessed with the search of "real" that it has become ridiculous first, then works hard to keep an eye on the end. When the accused accused of investigating possible miracles, they move in the beauty palace, they begin to suspect, where our heroine will cut hair and obviously flirt with the priests. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " A priest was sent directly from the Vatican for investigation. Is the Frankie possessed by Satan, or is a vessel for Jesus Christ? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The only miracle done in this movie is finished.
