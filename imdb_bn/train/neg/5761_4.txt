Hollywood does it again. There is not much money, no creativity. During this writing I was sure that the author had something other than oxygen. Based on the preview, I thought it would be a fun movie. But if you are not in the latest stupid pop culture, you will miss most of the film's stupid humor. Why waste your time You're making a log and get more fun than giving this movie. <br /> <br />
