Looks like someone can make a movie nowadays. It's like your camera, your cast and crew, a script and a little money and a group of walls that you have a movie. The problem is that talent is not always part of this equation, and often such low-budget films continue to be ugly. The video store shelves are filled with these so-called films. These are not even guilty pleasures, they are just good to forget that a celluloid is a waste. Trauma Entertainment is known for making trash movies, but most of their movies are gold in the film. However, they did not have to do anything to create some of the films that they had created, and there was no such form of liberation war like 'Nightmare Weekend'. <br /> <br />: The best of what they can do with cruel ingredients. Some strange humor Run at a good speed (should be in 81 minutes). <br /> <br /> Wrong writing, which includes lotus dialogue and numerous plot holes. Blinking badly, especially the night scene and finishing, which you can not get out of all. Do not sense a lick. Score badly Cheap and Very Dated Effect There is a total lack of character development and you do not keep an eye on anyone. This is considered to be a horror movie, but it is a lack of region and it is not least bit scary. Nothing interesting or exciting happens. Loaded with unnecessary padding. Final Thinking: I never expected this forgotten gem, but I never thought it would be bad. I never know this is the worst movie, but I do not know whether it is a particular competitor. Troma was supposed to give it a release instead of rubbed this film. I do not make the same mistakes and let you curse your curiosity. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/5
