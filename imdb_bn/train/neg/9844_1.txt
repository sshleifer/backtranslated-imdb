This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was not serious yet, or just not sure to have a mockery. A movie using such stupid things that they can think of as an impersonation. <br /> <br /> <br /> Don Johnson really was quite good. But otherwise it sucked. It was 10 years ago I saw, but it still does not stop hurting and lingering in my brain. <br /> <br /> The last line of the movie is so stupid! I will not destroy it for you, you want to lure luck by watching this movie. But I finally guarantee a * nghya * moment, with a few in between. If you do not have anything good, and you want to make a point and laugh, then maybe your time may be worth it. In addition, if you are forced to go on a date with someone you do not really like, then suggest to see this film together and they will probably leave you after seeing it. To give it a fair price, I guess.
