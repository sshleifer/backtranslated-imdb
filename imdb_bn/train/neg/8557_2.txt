I admired 'kiss on the face' for his mind ?? Serious hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead / director Joe Swanberg. They were not afraid to show the authenticity of the daily "personal" incident. Unfortunately, the film falls under the state of 'The Brown Bani', although it also has more envy. Yes, it does not show much to the volume of 'banni', or is there a lot of cinematography shots (or heartfelt fondness)? Feet, hands or genetics Again, unfortunately, I can see why the film is released and why people are renting: Real sex scenes and full frontal (even both male and female nudity) nudity. Another that, it was a waste of complete waste. We quickly learn about the male / female roommate pair of post-college, which has a clear feeling for men, who see him as a friend only when having sex with his ex-boyfriend. Apart from that, we are under the events of each day of their annoying life: he works for his parents; She works a highly reluctant sexual awareness project on her computer. To do all of this, the dialogue will be interesting and the acting will be practical. Not working and boring, like watching someone run for hours, such as 'Brown Bunny.' Cut out the only actor out of the Winter Stand, and even he has some suspicious acting. (In addition to a mic in front of a mic, additional DVDs are actually worth watching / listening.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, to stop it all and not be afraid to express themselves or showers, but overall the film is flat. It has scenes that do not fit the scenes, many annoying everyday events and the unusual acting that you're doing, without the soft-porn factor, why you hired it.
