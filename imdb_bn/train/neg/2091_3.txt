I think I see the BGG pilot. I can just describe that night I think I was sitting in the chair. That event was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I even enjoyed the third year's part, and I saw every episode of the fourth year, fully trustfully that it often wanders. Well, it did not. <br /> <br /> I saw the mapic pilot and fascinated me. Here was the hope for something good. Then I started watching regular episodes, and they became even more annoying. <br /> <br /> This is very clear, very guessable. It reminds me of my last failing show, the political purity of uniformity droll. <br /> <br /> Her line work on her DSW was quite good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. The first was the pattern of the Pattern of the first phase of the BSG series. When they left Admiral Kain and Pegasus, they all went to the container. After knowing where he was going, he wrote the rest of the show. <br /> <br /> Maybe it will improve. Maybe it was just a few weak elementary episodes. But I'm very, very nervous.
