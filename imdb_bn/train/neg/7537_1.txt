And I thought the beach was bad, the difference is that this film is the best actor of our time, Nicholas Cage. Do not blame him for the horrific scripts, if someone does not give an idea on the point of the movie then put your voice on the back. It is a cross between a village and a cropped script. It starts getting caught in your eyes and then when it goes to the plot it does not give any sense and I do not start at the end !!!! What was that Nicholas Cage is the only thing that exists in this movie, which, in general, is a great humor and its ability to be funny in strange situations. If you go to a blockbuster and the only movie to watch it, save yourself five rupees and just go back home and set some things in the fire and when someone asks you why just tell the stupid thing that comes to you, and you go there!
