"Crash" for some 40 minutes of friendly friends, romantic chick for the first two-thirds or more, because it is a Brit "tries as sex and city". <br /> <br /> I especially enjoyed the trophy youths walking around, whose character does not get very faint (think we did not see all his body meat and Kenny Datty is worth seeing more). <br /> <br /> They are convinced that "Sabrina" (I do not like the movie) or any version with Douglas / Jeter makes a lot of contracts to the young / old woman who is made against the opposite. - Jones or Deon / Sevenogly Nuptialies. <br /> <br /> Formerly known as Andy McDowell, welcomed the renowned Anna chancellors as brilliant drama and comedians. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the credit did not come to an end that I could understand That might actually be wrong. Just like "Sex and City", writer / director male, here's the first timer Scott John Mac, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably related to their boyfriend and work (character is a school principal, a police And a doctor), which has been a good and more interesting movie. The title of the film was titled "The Saad FÃ¤ckers Club", which parallels homosexuals with "Breakocon Hearts Club". <br /> <br /> (basically 4/6/2002)
