I wanted to choose this western, fans of this fan and everyone in this story, as a fan of "Bumblebee Bill", "Wild Bill Hikoc" and "Colton Jane"! Add to the Gary Cooper blend as the main actor, and it sounded great. <br /> <br /> There was a problem ... it was not. I looked at my watch and found that only 40 minutes, death was concerned. Genre Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison did not just see or played "Baffle Bill". Cooper was not very good at it, very wooden words. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Walk to the side and see another snack, because most are much better than M.
