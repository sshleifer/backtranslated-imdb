I happened to love growing shows along with millions of others. So I tuned in this movie, I can not think it would be a little surprising and fun if it is not good. <br /> <br /> Wrong! I just wonder, at the end of this, was Charlie's Angels really that annoying? I do not seem to feel like this. But like this movie, such films can be bad, encourages the time and encouragement of the show. I see it all, despite the negative, it was not unwanted. But it was very nice, which I did not blame the actors, especially the women who played the angels actually saw them. The movie just was not that interesting. It's an angel trying to make a "character" of each angel. (One angel awakened, one "good girl", one took her husband ....), all the characters were portrayed as a particular characteristic and were portrayed deeper than the stereotypes. The tension of the event was absent and the dialog was ... dialog. It's so beautiful. <br /> <br /> is not horror. The TV movie is not the worst. But missable
