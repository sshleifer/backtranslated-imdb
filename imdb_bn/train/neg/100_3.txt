All right, I have never seen that the best movie but at the same time I can sit and watch it !!! The story line was quite awful and in the first part of the first little story I was wondering what I was seeing, but at the same time it was so awkward that I liked all the cheap smiles. <br /> <br /> Djibaida blames Oscar for his role in this movie, the only thing that will stop him calling off his evil name and half way. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture was quite beautiful, but afterwards you laugh and you go to see it on the pound.
