(Following different spoilers) <br /> <br /> Gene Kelly. Not to George Getty, sometimes criticized for being too young and non-French. Leslie Caron, is sometimes not critical for her very green performance. Not even Oscar Levant, who often does not bother Dickens from me. <br /> <br /> No, it must be genie kelly. There is something about his screen personality, which is highly ambitious, and for him it is convincing as a perfect artist in Paris, attention to critics indefinitely, paying attention to vandalism with little children and old women and painting on the street. For this reason, he was so effective in Singhine's 'The In The Rain' and other films where he acted in ambitious, focused characters. Jerry Mulligan In some ways, a cousin of Tommy Albarrett of Brigdon, another story with Kelly, who loves America as a beautiful European place and an innocent woman as a symbol of his love. That is not as funny as the poor dazed Tommy besides Jerry. That's another galling thing about this film. Jerry sometimes a Cad Milo, and Lise is even worse. When he looked at the club for the first time, he made a dirty trick to dance with him. Whenever he sit again, he pulls even a dirtier strategy to get his phone number. He calls him the next day when he hangs over him, which he takes as a coup to drop at his workplace. And it is clear across all of this that he does not want to do anything with her. When he began to laugh at his joke in the perfume shop, it was as credible as Mille's interest in his painting. He's handsome and playful, but why did he get Henry, when he looks like a gentleman to boot? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . If he is played by Sid Cheris, someone would feel proud of him. But when she played the first timer Leslie Caron, she works as a shameful, weak teenager and works, and this makes Jerry feel like a creep. And why do they like these other actors (though I personally would rather fix things through change) when the whole story prevents them from annoying promises to old rich people on the romance of these two young poor lovers? Gene Kelly is not only more than Gaitrey and Folk for several years, she is old enough to be Karen's father. <br /> <br /> I think it will improve young cast comedy-relief type dancer as a Jerry cast. , That kind of turned into the kind of musical support role ... for example Roy McDonald's good news or Bobby Van short town girl. Maybe they do not necessarily have them but somebody like them. Anyone who can run behind Lais and thinks of playing him shamefully; Someone who entered Chapline in the hole actually lived a happy life. Whose comedies and naivete Oscar Levant would be good opposite with the sophisticated grumpiness. This would probably be considered less ponderous in ballet. And it can provide a voice that can sing better to Gerswin. <br /> <br /> All of this might seem like I do not like Gene Kelly. I like him He was horrible in most of his movies, not only this (well, and some). I myself do not hate AAIP; It's like good direction, industrial direction. And Leslie Caron, who is rather charming in spite of her inexperience, and really looks like she stepped out of a painting. George Geetry has done a fine job and my favorite number in the movie "Standway to Paradise" Nina Foke is beautiful and should touch and end up with something. But not Jerry Mulligan. I will not have that desire on her.
