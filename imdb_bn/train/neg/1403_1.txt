Waste the film a absolutely bitch !! There is nothing to do. There is no ghost, rarely any train, no mystery, no interest. The constant and braural effort in comedy is painful. All other painful. The courtyard was stupid: people trapped in the middle, because their train was kept for less than 3 minutes. What? And the railways put their place in a heavy storm? I do not think so. Oh, they could walk 4 miles across the dead and black fields. Um, yes. Of course. Or, they can strengthen themselves on the hospitality of the railway and may be in the 'ghost' train station. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> From the list of LOST movies !! Hey !!
