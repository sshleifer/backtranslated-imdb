A play / manipulation documentary about one of the darkest places in Guatemala. Portrayed as a fun, safe ... but sad places, get a bunch of sexual crews playing in a football team, combine what seems to be more than a week! The main focus of the documentary proves that the society re-establishes this type of "worker", although no solution has been made for these poor women, but it is recorded by people registered by them as "stars" (as the title), making this reality show documentary For the exchange being exploited. But its own documented reality ... but, sadly, there is nothing to do with the main story. I will not accept to see it again; But I would recommend it only for common cultural purposes.
