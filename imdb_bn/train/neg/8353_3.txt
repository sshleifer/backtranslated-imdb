Boudre Demeril (a weak Peter Fonda, who has ordered), an adult gambler, did not win the young two "Nevada" (fantastic, but talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together unthinkable pairs (of course) started the search for Indian gold in Grand Canyon. <br /> <br /> It does not need to find the story and its deeper meaning. It's just not there. The acting was very weak, which was quite surprised by Peter Fonda's leadership. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something interesting in this movie, keep an eye on the awesome scene. And a young Brooke Shield looks something good. Its character is so annoying (especially at the beginning) and fool, that she does not come off as pretty sexy or interesting. Too bad, but, given the story, I could have made more doubt about this issue. I instructed Peter Fonda and played this film. He used to speak in this ridiculous zodiac his father (Henry Fonda) even a (vain) Camio. Unfortunately, this was their only film together. For example, can Henry not be easily radar? 3/10
