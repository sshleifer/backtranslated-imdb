I hired this movie because I hope the whole family will enjoy it. Although the film is friendly, my family does not enjoy it because it gives false views to God. If you obey God and follow him, then you do not guarantee success. Your football team will not always win. You do not have to get good grades magically. Reproduction is not always cured. You do not always have to get a raft Sometimes, you will be stuck with the old car. <br /> <br /> God does not exist to meet each of us whim. Rather, we were created to glorify Him. Sometimes we feel proud of him when we seem to be going bad for us. Christ is alive; Death is the gain.
