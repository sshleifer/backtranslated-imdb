Not just a new story line, but this romantic comedy concept works. A young man (John Cusack) and a drop-dead superb woman (Kate Binsell) offers an opportunity to interview and wonder if they mean to each other. Although both of them are pledged to others ... oddly they still feel that their soul mates are out of nowhere. Some places are a little sad, but Viva la love. Being a romantic I ought to be almost riveted. My favorite scene is where the cusack is on the ground and the snow starts. The end is almost too sweet, but most deserving. Not one of the major aspects of this couscous, but who died in the hell by Bakersel. Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon are providing significant support. John Corbett I played him the worst role ever. On the other hand, Eugene Levy is quirky and fun. See this with your soul mate.
