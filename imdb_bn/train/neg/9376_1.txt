I was sick of seeing this movie. I was growing up with Pippi and every time there was a real pleasure. When my wife came to Sweden, she looked at the old and was a good laugh. But this American version should be renamed and not seen again. It's terrible to start from the end. They can manage how to make it so bad. Well I guess someone translated Haha .. but they are not around Pippi. This movie will not be seen again and could not be sent to a broadcast. Burn the movie and save the kids. If you want to see the pipes, check out the original and get a good smile. We love Paipi Ingar Nilsson, sorry Tami Irin. You will not ever stand to be a PP. Oh yes .. When the "spoilers" read the explanation, then "wonderful" will become and the joy of the movie and the audience will be hidden. "Well I guess the director stood for this ... you are looking at this movie at your own risk. It really is the waste of time ...
