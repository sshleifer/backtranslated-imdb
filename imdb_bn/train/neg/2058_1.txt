I can find that this film is very good to say about that. I'm sure the idea and script are good on paper but filmography and acting are not something I'm not afraid that I hope from some talented people. I doubt their CV filmography will highly appreciate this feature. Michael Caine appeared in Wood at the time of her role as a doctor, and in no time did I really believe her character. The plot was especially incredible about the victim's son. Some scenes were very memorable for other movies, sometimes I wondered if it was actually a fool thriller. The light was dark at the time and it was added to the view of seeing a low budget movie with some big names, which is not surprising why I am tired of seeing it.
