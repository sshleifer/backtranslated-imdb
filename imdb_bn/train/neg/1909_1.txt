The worst romantic comedy (no, the worst movie) I've ever seen. Boy (who works as a phone psychologist!) Should be assumed to be gay with his dream woman being transferred to the apartment. Hilarity not ensue To annoy, light gay bashing, and make horrific dialogs. If you read Brad Melzer and like his unclear conversation, you would love this movie. <br /> <br /> Be smart. Avoid this. If you see it, delete the copy.
