This movie is great, you remember - but it's just a very bad story. Stella is so awesome weird, and can not learn better. Her husband is incredibly snobby and small-minded. Do not ever learn better. Is this realistic? Somehow, Stella has realized that her daughter is ashamed of her arrogance and dress, but does not understand that she just needs to pull it all out? I do not think so. Stella is a good woman, and a very good mother. Give yourself a gift, so her daughter can be associated with a big powdery snobs. <br /> <br /> What we saw was mostly normal - people's beer or two, enjoying a piano piano, dancing - but it can be a moral inferiority. "I can not live our child this way!" Spare me <br /> <br /> This story tells me one thing: The rowdy working class can not expect the ambition of the upper class to rise. And that's just a load of Hogwash.
