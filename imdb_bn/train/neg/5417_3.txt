Three Russian aristocrats are causing Monte Carlo's fall, though they are under their last franc. To support their extraordinary lifestyle, using three fraudulent services and using notes in casinos, bogus coins for jackpot expects in exchange for currency. US ambassador Andrew Hughes came to Monaco with his wife Helen and hoped for three financial support to make friends with the audience. One of the three Russians, Count Sergeyas Karamzin, is planning to move forward with Helen's growing progress, while the County's maid who loves Sergey desperately. Finally, the situation play their hands against three aristocrats. It is clear that Van Straih is trying to publish a message (with the American woman's stupidity and inappropriate behavior of the American woman) instead of telling a story, and the film can really lead to modern audiences like me. Even acting, which is great in Ives like greed and marriage march, here's just mills running. The film could use different levels of improvement. Ratings, 3
