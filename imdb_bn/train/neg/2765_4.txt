How was this film made with a budget of $ 70 million and crossed me without completely reinstating? The story and the dialogue are overcome amateurish. Characters are saying that no real person will ever say and do not respond to anything that has never been said before. No one seems grounded in the real world. Written by Lead's performance as a fine, it is so ugly ... but many actors supporting the role really dragged the production. The hero's hair probably should have earned its own credit, it was so strange that ... it does not mention that it gave better performance in the film. Finally, L.A. covered by giant reptiles For a movie about this, this picture is a bit annoying. What a shame! If you see it, your mind will constantly run, you can take advantage of the views of the SHXX and make better films around them. Sadly, it will not take a lot.
