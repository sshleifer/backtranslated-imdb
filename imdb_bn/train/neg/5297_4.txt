When someone comes across such a movie and claims to be one of the worst slash of movies outside of it, it confuses me. It's not the worst one yet, yet not a good movie, but the worst is that. Go to see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think Charlie is the worst at night. The film is a lot of camera work and editing, which is much more than what I can say for a more vague Slashar movie. <br /> <br /> The movie does not offer on-screen death, where a death you saw has been snatched away, but all other deaths are very interesting. But lack of on-screen graphic violence does not mean that it is not a slash film, just a bad one. <br /> <br /> This picture has not been taken seriously. The film came in at the end of the second slash cycle, so it was certainly a reflection of the slaughter elements in the tongue of the cheek. For example, after a murder, Charlie goes to the city's 'welcome' mark and marks one of the few below the population. This is a thing that can only laugh. <br /> <br /> If you are in Slashar, then definitely check out this movie. This is slightly different than your normal slash film, the possibility of two killers, but not much. The film's comedy feels very good to relax the audience and the movie can not make it so important. You can forget the movie, you can think of it. I'll remember it because I love the name.
