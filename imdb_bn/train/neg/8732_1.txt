The plot is about the death of small children. Hooper must investigate the killing. During the movie, I think there is some problem with her girl. At the end to get caught serial killer. That's it. But before you find out before the dunts, you will see all the actors playing some terrible. How bad these actors are with Hooper are incredible is incredible. I could go like this but that's a waste of my time lots. Do not just watch the movie. I've warned you.
