This I did not want to see. I bought the DVD and I saw myself under the movie and stopped the movie for a moment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 2 tribes were really annoying <br /> <br /> 3 dinosaurs (mostly) feeling faint <br /> <br /> 4 Bad scientist was well bored <br /> <br /> 5 The quality of the film in DVD was really bad <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The music is really great. I have bootleg soundtrack from this movie. Sadly, the word is not good, but its time is fine. <br /> <br /> We saw dinosaurs for the first time, they gave a kind of scary inspiration. <br /> <br /> 3 little kids when they drink water and play the picture <br /> <br /> Funny scenes with 4 tents. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this movie expect they will always lose the evil.
