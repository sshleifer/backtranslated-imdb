I had no real prospect going to this movie and I'm happy. Even if I expect it to be bad, I'll be disappointed. <br /> <br /> Where to start? First of all, I think 15% of the film has a stunning footage of a dark jungle-field statue footage. I get it There are scarecrows. I think the title "Scarecrows" was enough. Second, an overwhelming thing has never been explained about horrible and unusual events. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A B-movie with buckets, screaming women, and stupid violence that results in a simple psychology or ancient curse. However, these films often know that they also snatch it like B-movies and even Dead Snoos (Sunny Scandinavian Jamie Flick) or Evil Dead. However, the film seems unclear for its indifference. Finally, there should be more blood and / or nudity. Yes, I said it. If you are going to have a shit horror movie, be it with the murder. And if you're going to get a hot and a semi-hot girl, one of them must show some side-by-side at least. <br /> <br /> So, like the summary, "SquareCro" and poke yourself just in the eye. You thank me
