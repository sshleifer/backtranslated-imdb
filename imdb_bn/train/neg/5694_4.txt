I'll be honest - because I rent this movie because I'm a huge fan of Kyle Chandler (especially from the early version). Since he usually plays the good guy, I wanted to see him a different role (out of curiosity). Draw me the plot itself; A Van-Hitman (K. K. Chandler of Tony Greco) must be killed randomly before believing a person's life - or, rather, the witness of death, who will testify against "family" someone. There was nothing like the movie I expected. It was sick, I hate the last (if you have seen it, why you know), and there were many unnecessary parts there. Basically - it was dirty, and made in a little sense. Yes, it was a crowd movie, and yes do not go to gun boats. But there's more to a movie than that. This movie worked as if it did not have time to go in detail - just deal with it and understand it. Acting really made for it- James Belushi was as funny as "Roses". Sheryl Lee thinks as credible as he could get. She surprised me most. And Kyl Chandler was equally as a worrying youngest "family" believer. If only the script actor did justice.
