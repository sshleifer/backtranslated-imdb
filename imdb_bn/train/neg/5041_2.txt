Ya Laura film Purple Butterfly kills a secret organization (Purple Butterfly) in the Shanghai War against Japanese soldiers. Ding Hui (Zhang Zia) and his ex-boyfriend Haidihiko Itami (Tora Nakamura) find themselves in front of opposition parties at an opportunity meeting. <br /> <br /> I agree with the critics from Paris. The film replaces a narrow, semi-historical conflict for a plot without the sole reason of the audience to care for the characters or their causes. Casual time shift does not help matters as it appears completely irrational and vain. Generally I do not think of dark movies, but the light, bone-fighting camera footage, and generally the trick to making bad films, is really creating a solid film to watch and interested in it. I agree with the audience that this film is "a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography from Georgia", but I do not think it helps the film. The retreat of the 20th Century film is one of the most powerful events, and I do not believe that you can judge it by editing it as Michael Bay's film. Much melodramatic moments are not added to its watchability. <br /> <br /> Actors are all suitable melancholy. Zhang Ziei once again shows that she has a completely limited acting range because she spends the full movie, works best in all her movies, annoying and generally bothered. However, at least he has added a bit more to this role in the role of Chanmoking and the worst love scene involved in this role. Terminator Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton from <br /> <br /> <br /> Finally, a very frustrating film, especially to see how Susu came to the director. 2/10
