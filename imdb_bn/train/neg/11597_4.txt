I'll status with Alice's platform, after living in the previous installment of the Nightmare series, Freddy Kr√ºger's deadly dreams are starting again. This time, the opposite murderer Alice was hit by the sleeping mind of her unborn child. His purpose is to "be born again" in the real world. Could Freddy stop her dead mother, but could Alice save her own soul while saving her own son? This movie really started well, as we saw the dream of seeing Alice Amanda Kruger's dream of raping 100 people and taking her to the hospital, but then she did not take much time from the pregnant lady but then Amanda again gave birth to Freddy. <br/> <br /> Alice and Dan are the only two people who returned from the fourth movie and then got some new friends' Frendie, before long before I was dead, I'm just like the first dead, not as good as another death or dream <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Freddie did not feel scared in this picture, nightmares were not just boring, they were not terribly awesome. <br /> <br /> In the movies, the film was right for the 5th film but overall I think the film was really vague. (Still not the worst movie in the series, Freddie Dead is the worst) <br /> <br /> 4/10
