I read another review that saw the last round of platoon morin was like killing people, killing, taking drugs and talking about trash. [<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's also a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: it was not a real plot - which I Agree on a topic. <br /> <br /> This is its self-motivated stone. Best. He really wanted to show how war does not lead to death, but it is very disappointing on survivors. Unfortunately, this view seems to be "proud" and the grand finale is a favorite image for my favorite like champagne, grand standing, oscar-hunting, and so on. <br /> <br /> I have problems with Stone and all the other filmmakers that they failed to understand this simple concept: the fatally describing the bloody deadly waste of war is not shown or even it was not an unfair or immoral war It reflects. We have seen the same thing at the moment with Iraq. If you are missing the point, I tell you this clearly: If you see the real bloodshed of World War II and see how devastating the lives of the surviving soldiers, do you think it was an unfair fight? If you do not firmly believe this fact is an unfair fight, why the images of the horrors of Vietnam seem to convince you that there was a mistake in fighting in this regard. <br /> <br /> Personally, I do not support the American decision in the war in Vietnam, but I certainly do not subscribe to the theory "This war is wrong because people have died and have died". I do not think the motivations are always wrong as the default, because the war itself is terrible. <br /> <br /> It is not something that last or final big "turn" was somewhat stupid. However, this does not exhaust the first oddball of the Stones. Wall Street was a great movie, which lasted 30 minutes or when it created a terrific "wrong turn". JF is probably one of the few films that really ended well. <br /> <br /> But this is very rare because it was a very small plot until that point in the film. And for this reason I gave it a low sign. It's virtually story-less and finally annoying - unless you fall for cruel poignancy.
