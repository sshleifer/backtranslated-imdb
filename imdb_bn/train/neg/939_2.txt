I loved Batman TV series and was really looking forward to this. But they tried a lot more. <br /> <br /> Why was the story of Adam West with them and trying to recover the Bart Ward batmobile was outside of me. Even after 35 years of appearing in Bert and Robin, it took 35 years to wear their clothes and 'Badgui' war. I would rather not have to make big big comments. BitMobile side story was stupid. <br /> <br /> For flashback movies, I think it was too small and too much of the way. It really was a quick overview in my opinion. I want more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for just one minute that I knew the same thing. Joker had a mosaic under his makeup and Penguin had to smoke though he hated him and was a former smoker. That was 2. <br /> <br /> I love reading books. I showed it that it has more sure. Why were two riders or why the 3 Catwoman or 3 Mister Freezes were like. Where is the list of commissioners Gordon, Chef Wahra, Alfred, Mr. Fritz, King Toot etc. As I said, it was not even in one. <br /> <br /> Very frustrating. And really corny.
