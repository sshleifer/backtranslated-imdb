This is a serious annoying movie. Although the boys got what they got ................... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was a joke to make viewers flutter in false promises before it came. . <br /> <br /> The only thing that could save the movie for me, if Jack Nicholson came out of Bush and used to say, "Where's Batman?" Kim could bounce! <br /> <br /> Now it was cool!
