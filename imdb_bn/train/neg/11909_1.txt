I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time: Darklight. <br /> <br /> The original principle of the film - Lilith Adam was the first wife and he considered immature and exiled from Eden garden because he himself considers Adam's consideration and refuses to submit to him. See, I've taken those words directly from that script. Then the film continues and even though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she is acceptable is what men say to her! He ended the film under betrayal - a male group! <br /> <br /> The script was predictable even more and the FX was awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of women in modern cinemas, there was nothing original about darklight.
