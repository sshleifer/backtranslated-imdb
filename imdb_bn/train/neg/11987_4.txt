In my litters We've finished class, Hatch, and this movie is nothing like a book. (1) Brian did not eat pests in the book. (2) He does not know the name of the pilot. (3) Her mother was cheating her father in the station wagon, where no one could see. (4) The soil that is cheating is not black hair, it has a blond. <br /> <br /> Now for the unrealistic parts of the film: (1) Thirteen-year-old punch is not able to throw a fist in a window. <br /> <br /> And for the role, Brian played the child, was an awesome actor. However, I believe that the scenery was impressive, although I did not hesitate to read the book to the director too. <br /> <br /> If this picture is good, then you do not read Hutchot, Gary Pulseen, but if you have one, then start a complaint letter to the manager.
