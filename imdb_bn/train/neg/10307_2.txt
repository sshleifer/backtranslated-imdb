This "math" approach is simply one of the busiest of other copos shows to set the TV show. The only redemption side of this event was Rob Morro, although his career must have been frustrated after the northern exposure after signing up for this sequence. <br /> <br /> The "math" aspect of the "math" aspect is that this show is a part of the co-star of the loop Diamond Phillips (which ensures that this show is the last resort of enemies.) is definitely bound in an episode.) A horror To get caught, using some theories about "mathematical" "bubbles". So, he has given a long explanation that, if we have seen the suspects at A, B and C, then we can use "bubble theory" to count where we can be. He can remember all this (with a stick in a chalkboard, or perhaps dirty). However, if you look at the last product, he basically took three spots, and picked a point right in the middle and said, "Well, mathematically, here we are finding the most eccentric." At some point, another character indicates "Oh, that point may also be the cabin where people live." What is that math? Even it does not connect to the -8 ** ** ** ** G-Dots !!! This program reminds me of the head of mathematics, which I used to do with banking, whose mathematical analysis was, which he can do to "support", is already agreed with at least every critical analysis or basic general knowledge. <Br /> <br /> goes to show it - when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can not wait to hold the NUMB3RS team at OSAMA ... they will use calculus, call an airplane in the middle of the mountain, Osama will hit and even five children will not be used as a human shield! cuz hey ... all about the number. <br /> <br /> Completely ridiculous TV show.
