After all, tell me that it's not a movie for people to see something exciting and fun for the holiday. This movie is cold, brutal, and just depressing depressing. Mary Stenbergen has read Christmas, who has fallen under Christmas, because her husband has lost her job, she lost her house, could not buy Christmas gifts for kids, etc. You get this idea, happy things for the holiday. So Harry Dean Stanton comes to Grendon as the Christmas angel, who climbs in his dark hat and long overcott like a podfil that saves children all day long. The better way to encourage Christmas spirit in Marie Steinbergen than killing her family, she believes in Christmas again if she can bring her back. The Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop shows more like a refuge for the refuge of the refuge of Lam. The film is so thick that you do not care about the happy ending when it comes, because the rest of the film is so bitter and incredible. I'm sure this movie wanted to be something like Cappra, but it gave up the joy and feeling of what a holiday movie should be.
