***** Warnings, there might be spirals that get more than this trip. **** <br /> <br /> Some good advice is given to anyone living in the UK when the age of channel 5's age is 80 comedy, instead of reading a book. Currently I am in the process of recovering from the seizure due to reading some comments on this movie. In fact, I actually said this threat that this picture is really realistic! I can say that Shol Ward never grew, or did we give our limit to the thank you, thanks ... I was very scared of this picture, perhaps it's my British perception that makes a movie fun, who knows? But in all cases, this picture is not just terrible, its teeth are terrible. <br /> <br /> I sometimes hit the bill and it was not his garbage that he supported me. Do not make me wrong, I like the hotstaster, which was created just three years after this movie. But this really bills Murray really sums up. I can safely say that I do not feel so disrespected about seeing my time as the first operation of the Delta Force, though these two films are more common than you. For 1 thing, they both have to end from the beginning, and from second to the terrible action sequence. Both of them are Redlade with Chess Cliche. <br /> <br /> One thing, these guys are supposed to be "UK Army". Yet they were allowed to enter their camps, Wiley Nilei, seducing women's military police officers, and later their silly shagging at the general quarter. Talk about random! This photo is awesome I'm just terrible for this. Now do not make me wrong, I am not a feminist sympathizer, but actually these two women actually put their hand on the heels in love with two letters after the arrest, freeing them ... twice, just the humiliating female nation. Truly, in the underwear of the baby's thorns, long fists, long wings (and wingers) and his unexpected sided Ramis MP can be sweet, in which they fall madly in love with the two people. > <br /> There are training scenes, where you can meet the squad "Phico", who threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his staff, then overweight block (played by late and great John Candy) who claims He joined the army "to avoid paying $ 400 for the Rug Management Class". "Giant Too," (WTF?) Paid tribute to 'Drill Sergeant' and proceeded towards Moore, who could not really organize a PI $$ in Bravavir, left his appointment band alone. This scene loads loads of loads of view to everyone, telling people "the road to the ass hole"! All the time, etc .. <br /> <br /> These scenes have shown a bunch of rug tags, making it their own face on the Astart course, which gives a scene where some of them shoot in the air wildly. Getting birds with an attack rifle, peppering a watch tower with bullets. (Just as Yep, told you that this picture was random ... he ran away from the miraculously illiterate ...) Finally, moving towards the passing parade, where the Huffle Squad would turn the magic into two hours. (Badger, Miracle!) Thank you for some wise words from Murray, after which they run a large army of dancers in front of a grietic general in front of the rest of the group. These are for the strong pleasure of their two friends, who actually should have arrested them ... they all smile though. This bit is nothing short of surprising though. Then he chose them to protect a new multi-million dollar prototype armored vehicle in Italy (which seems to be just a mobile home painted green in-house, with loads of gadgets inside), claiming "this army is exactly the same!" Okay ... <br /> <br /> The terrible ending, where Murray and Ramis have decided to steal this new secret prototype military vehicle in Germany, to acquire their newly acquired and some hyperactive MP Girl friends. Happles Captain (John Lerock) Then find and lead the new recruitment squad for the recovery mission for this vehicle. They then took a "wrong counter" route and ended in Soviet-controlled Czechoslovakia, where they were detained. (We did not see that we're coming ...) Thus Ramis and Murray + Elephants started the rescue operation of birds, where a big fight, shooting of the hip and blowing of the tanks. With them coming back as national heroes, the Russians have been terminated by saying "Possiji" and so on. That's right. Martial in any court, nothing. They only stole a prototype military car, it turned into a Warsaw contract land and it was caused by an international incident that could spark the WW3! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I meant it to be a comedy, got all the rights actors for it, but where is it hell? Channel 5 cut those bits? The only freedom fighter in this movie is the repetitive use of nude women's fountain and female mud racing. (As I said, random) it really helps to be isolated from it that it must be a completely crap film. This film should be a nonsense 9 years old, sadly, we will have to look at it instead. 10 out of 1 star - Total Tripe My suggestion, do something a little more useful with your time. Like to do yourself a casting ...
