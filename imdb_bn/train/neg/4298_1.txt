Incredibly muddled, putting off and finally ridiculous ("Horses, O my God, Horse!") Thriller It's sometimes vague, but it's one of the worst scripts written for a horror movie. In the final 10 minutes, everyone needs to be "magical" for the "resolution" event. Due to the great role played by Richard Lynch, it is usually an extraordinary. Video transfer is a real hack work, cutting half the scene and making the movie more difficult to understand. 4 stars out of 0
