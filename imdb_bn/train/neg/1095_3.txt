I saw this a few days ago, so the details being lazy. The film was shot in handheld cameras and it was originally made many times during the War of Liberation, because we did not have many studio images made in this manner. I can not help, but it seems that it was more hostage than anything else, which was designed to remind viewers that what we see on screen is not all compromise with big budget and so is more "real". It is not much better than the first half of the full metal jacket, so anyone who has seen it, or any other rope is off to know it I hope <br/> <br /> <br /> My main problem was the stereotyped character, with its deepest children, their deep singularity, black colored dots, world tedious sergeant, bitter and twisted psychology etc .. In all situations, most of the friction and tension is given at any given time, perhaps due to this stupidity and the highlight of the situation. It was probably lazy, perhaps it was a committee that tried to appeal to most audiences, I knew that it was annoying. The novel was a combination of volunteers and duffites (where all the letters were generally compromised in the situation), though In two main characters, the scenes only play a lot of it. The main character of this plot seems to be that the volunteers are coming to their senses and the drafts get the feeling of duty and interest, but it is carried out in a compulsory and irrational way. The other major bug that I had was the first letter and with the threat of violence, each letter (except for psychology and real softness) would respond to each inevitable conflict, facing the fullest stooges of Pharellal, return immediately and everyone is justified and diplomatic. <br /> <br /> I guess if I have to find a plus, it will be played in two strongly strong, strong and very convincing, considering the formula of the characters, it was "very difficult. <br /> <br /> In my imagination, Bose became the ticket of duty, and for my money, 4 episodes were even more fun to see.
