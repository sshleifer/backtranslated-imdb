In contrast to "Bacru Bangaji's Adventure" or "Big Problems in Little China" or "Conan the Barbarian", which is a great calm and self-humorous humor that makes them think of religion, Golden Child is just slightly worse. <br /> <br /> The premises themselves are not void, and there are some fun moments. But here Eddie Murphy confiscates the feelings of "flip attitude" tension or danger. And silly enough to make more impact that tension more damage. The "mysterious secret" of Tibetan Buddhism is rather long to grasp for obedience. <br /> <br /> No one is at risk, or the letters face real danger without any feeling, why should we care? <br /> <br /> Who should see this image: <br /> <br /> - Big fans of Eddie Morphy who can not help themselves <br /> - br /> <br /> I will sometimes give this image 4 out of 10 for this joke.
