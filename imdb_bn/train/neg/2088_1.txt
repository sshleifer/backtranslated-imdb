What a terrible show. Science fiction fans seem to see anything other than quality. It blows me up that something like the fuzzy lasts for a season of exceptional, when the batletist closes the garbage spin like Galactica Remack. Unfortunately every aspect of this spin off show is unfortunate. Acting is young and uninspired. Characters are cardboard clich√©s of what has happened in a bad psy-ph series The story is bad. The dialog is worse than a major time soap opera. The direction is shoddy and the set is terrible. Waste waste of Caprica film, waste waste time and efforts. This is a spin that should never be created.
