Take a SciFi original movie and mix it in a little alternative / revisionist history, and you will find "Aztec Rex". Clearly, before conquering the Harnan Cortes, the Agateg empire, first had to win the Trenosaurus Rex and his companion. That's the firmness of this movie. Plot provided it could really be sucked; It is only a tip of writers hat of sucked type. There are some problems. For beginners, Cortes is played by Ian Ziering. Even with a black wig, Ziering as Cortes is about as convincing as excels playing Rose Gandhi. And although the Cort√©s won the indigenous people in Mexico, the agendas were played by all Hawaiian groups. Keep aside, T-Rex (es) looks great, although each one of them shoots fired, but it only closes CGI. And they die very easily; I think if T-Rex is close to real life, it may be a little more fundamental than the 16th century surgery or at least injured. But takes some distance from the movie. There are some graphic T-Rex-melting-human scenes that are wonderful, but in this context I think they're okay. There is a lot of activity and the entire colonization angle is present everywhere but the dinosaurs are not destroying the corners, unlike the other recent Saifi's original dinosaur film "Warbirds". Above all, a medium (but suitable by scientific fundamental criteria) movie, which gives a decent 4.
