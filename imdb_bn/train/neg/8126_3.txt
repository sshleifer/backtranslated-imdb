I do not think this was absolutely horrible as some people definitely do. It passes as one of the Chess horror movies that you can break in the middle of the night, when you can not sleep, but it is not a better value by admitting it. It is true that the acting is not extraordinary - I think Maria Mc Andrew was considered as Kathy Baker, for example, it was added as completely innocent - but the main problem is that I do not really understand many aspects of this plot. Becks are part of the partnership by John (Stuart Moss) and partly in the part of Hanimun (now it's romantic!) Part of the travel caves, which seems to be strange to us (which is part of a cave A tour group is related to somebody's work?) But it gets unfamiliar when we know that he is a doctor who studies the prevention of drugs (Hah? That connection has completely lost me.) When he bats, the cave batting starts to convert, he thinks that the value of the human standard is as hybrid (although we finally see him in a makeup, he is just like a bit more See) and a killing begins. Here's another problem. The first murder is a nurse in a hospital. First of all, everyone thought that his death was an accident. The second killer is described as a young girl, her throat leak out. Sheriff (Michael Pataki) then told us that his death was like a nurse (i.e., did anyone feel that it was an accident?) And what's with Sheriff? The view of the Kathy hotel room until she takes a wine rake and rapes her almost, she seems fairly vague, after that everything seems to be normal. It is restrained with a finale that almost everything has been settled, and in one movie I have ever heard that one of the most annoying theme songs. Even for all that, here was something that kept watching me. Sometimes pure cheesiness can get you through an hour and a half. Quite bad, yes - but as some people are saying as terrible.
