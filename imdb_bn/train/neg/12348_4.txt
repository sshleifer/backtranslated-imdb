This movie is very similar to "FlashDance", you know Flickr with Jennifer Bells. That picture is probably not bad enough to be funny in the most annoying film I've ever seen. "GI Jane" is much better than the movie, but it does not say much. Here Demi Moore sleeps a lot and has high music and we see her war and everything, but of course it is not very compelling. I really think the idea behind the movie is interesting, but the script is very clean and readley Scott can not do anything about it. Well, as I said ... it's better than "flashdance" ... (4/10)
