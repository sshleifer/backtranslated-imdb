I was surprised to see the production of "Bauolff and Grenelle" in the Canadian / Icelandic / British 2004, because I was terrific and stunning, because of this year's first 3 new Bauful films - I was scared. As soon as I heard the "Vikings" and the horned helmet, I cried. This migration era was not in Sweden and Danes, Vikings (they came later). And even the Vikings did not wear horns on their helmets (horns closed your helmet to your enemies and then could make your brain easier). Then there is the Palace of Helflger, which looks like a movie set of the 6th century Denmark, not Greece, or Rome. The sword and armor look like the props left from the previous film set in different historical periods. I saw the weapons used by the Crusaders in the "Kingdom of Heaven of Surgery" and a series of "Bauolff and Grenelle" also operates a windowless breeding movie of Windslus Stilchers! Outside the fundamental plot of the original epic poem, the writing is frustrating and the entire structure of acting and the incredible structure is incredible. The biggest yuk was a secret-surgery crossbase, perspective phase and complete with explosion projectile, which seems to have been bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special effect was in the monster and his mother's stereo so that Bauful never could tear his hand, as he did in poetry. Thanks to the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go, but I did not.
