As an inspirational director herself, the movie was exciting to watch with criticism. Probably shot with a low-end digital camera with 35 mm adapter for DOF. Good to perform well, the effect of the sound is not very above. I would give it a 7 for an indie film, but the story is not interesting. This is more than the character's development, rather than a horror flickr. <br /> <br /> This is not for people who want to get upset with frustration, or just want to have fun with popcorn. <br /> <<br /> <br /> This movie is about a family that has a dry ground, and this is exactly right.
