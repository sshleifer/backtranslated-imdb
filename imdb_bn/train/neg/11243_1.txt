In short, this movie is completely worthless. <br /> <br /> The idea is that since the early 1900s, one can think of the future, making the film from his point of view. An interesting idea, but the lack of engaging stories or characters prevents us from suspending our mistrust, so the idea is only spreading. Actually the entire movie has been working with actors in front of the green screen and we are supposed to be impressed. But as a graphics person, there was a clear thrust over softening to hide the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening. The color is not washed out mainly of any relevant effects without decreasing visual quality. And I do not understand why anything in this movie will consider breaking the ground in any way. If anything, ridiculous reverse graphics have been reduced times for really bad graphics - they do not even measure up to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics. The model for robots was so simple, plain and very unclear. There was a bunch of weird prehistoric-like creatures on that island, but they have not been explained in any way. <br /> <br /> The story is horrific beyond belief. Actually, I can not believe I did not go out of this movie. The relationship between Polly and Joe is unsupported, and based on mistrust and deception throughout the movie. Even why are there Morris playie characters? We do not believe in any way that Joe is heroic - I mean that he flew an airplane, and saved a person's personal (poly) for personal reasons. Yes there is a great hero for you. Dex has very short screen time, so why would we care about Joe want to save him? Who was in Naples who locked the joe and silly in the vault and why would they do it (remember that the entire Tottenkopf Operation robotics was there?) <br /> <br /> Plot hole: (1) Why is the character of Bye Lings? ("Crow" a big fall from his excellent character) Joe to stop the robots who occupy it? They were looking for foxes, and they were not found. (2) Why the hell will be captured but not killed (He did not know or did not know about the Fox, and the bad guys did not know that the polite fox was there and Joe was associated with it and so on Dax)? (3) Polly indicates that "stars" do not know anything about Totenkopf, but he has some hidden sources about him that seems to be a fairly complete FBI-style file to him. (4) Spaces in the maps described by the Nepalese - if they knew everyone in this mysterious area, why is their map empty in that place? (5) At one point, Polly and Joe will have to leave their clothes (they are burned) - Joe is given new clothes just like his old clothes, but polly is forced to wear some very weird looking heavy clothes. Polar has its original clothes suddenly in the same line of continuity. <br /> <br /> * Sigh *. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> And acting? Are we supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British launches? Which character is not boring? I think Linkkai's conversation was probably the best in the whole movie (there is no line in it). There was no dialogue camp, even the cheese level did not rise. It's just bad and annoying. This man is not a hero or compulsorily; They are such a person, if you are unhappy of meeting them in real life, try to ignore or disassemble. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that the movie has received the highest rating on the World Cup. IMHO It should always compete with "Batman forever" under 100.
