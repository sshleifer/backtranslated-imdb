There are a lot of downside in this movie and all I can see is that. It is painfully long and widely operated. I could see the entire audience overwhelming and wait for it to finish. Run time is more than 3 hours, which can be less edited after 2 hours. <br /> <br /> <br /> The average transformation among stories. Most of the people sit down and hope to sit for some hope. <br /> <br /> This is just fun pocket. Aspiring projects and a below performance. Govinda does a perfect job, Anil Kapoor disappointed me, as we expected rest. If you expect anything near the bible or love, then it's actually not close to it.
