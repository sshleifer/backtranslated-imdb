This show closes all kinds of different kinds of things to make it worse, hair, and basically it's "original". First off: Animation is so ugly ... Johnny's terrible ... and everyone is annoying. Genes seem to be like Teen Women Discoasters from "Dexter's Lab" and Johnny is often more intelligent male DD (also "Dexter Lab"). Like this: Plots ... are painfully long, which makes them hard to follow. Gags are corny, and nothing is really forced to laugh me a little ... Especially when it tries to be fun. I only saw two episodes, but those who stopped me alone. <br /> <br /> Third Thriji: "American Idiot" tunes of Green Day's all-theme song began to burst. And, when I'm not very fond of that band, I feel completely fooled that they will accept the same open tone, and then change it to change itself. <br /> <br /> At the point of view ... it is a big fat ugly bore. 1/10
