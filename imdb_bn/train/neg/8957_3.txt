Incredible Is it any more disaster? There is no chance. The stupidity of this film will be ashamed of Ed Wood, De Palma, and Woo. If the first part of the series is in moderate dialogue and the second has bad conversations, there is a great dialogue between them. Amazing But this time the dialogue level has also been reduced. Despite the acting and dialogue, I like the first two films, but "Cub Zero" will definitely kill the voting rights. <br /> <br /> I am sometimes surprised that the leftists can also understand themselves how they are in favor of democracy and dictatorship. In this film they obviously target the US ?? A democracy Why do not they look at anti-military films such as Korea, Iran, Syria, China, Zimbabwe? Of course, most of these places are expected to produce such a cube soon, but it is nearby. It is obvious: the junk writers actually appreciate such rulers, whether they are conscious about it or not. As far as I can say that anyone who always attacks US foreign policy, he has his basic democratic belief. <br /> <br /> Return to the movies: Apart from being so far away that it is no longer fun, the film has many obvious absurdities. For example, for some reasons the Carbon supervisor has done it for some time and the project does not know the pain and sorrow involved, but the first of the others suddenly turns against the system! Anyone that has no idea about human nature will see this stupid right through. Or how about that growing character, an obscure evil bureaucrat, who is speaking as a bad mel Brooks comedy. Indeed, as soon as this creature has emerged, the film has lost all seriousness and is likely to be exciting: it has actually become a comedy.
