I really came into this movie missing this line. I thought there were many possibilities in the premises and was ripe for an interesting movie. Do not blame me here, I'm not expecting a citizen, I was accepting it for the B movie. That said, it is still short of hope. The historical view of the story has become chocolate and the end has kept me a little cold. Acting in the film was very woody. Above all, I give it a great idea to give 4, but the film has scored more and more attention to the principles of movie making. Is it valuable? I do not want to ask me two hours ago, but I do not know that I would recommend to others.
