This is the most contaminated entry of IMDB which I have still read. All the previous critics acted like this in the movie. This is not the movie. Rather it is simply a feature that is extra in the DVD of the "DVD" movie, it does not even have it as 90 minutes, where it is listed here. Actually, it's cooler than Jute Lee Marshall Art can do for more than 13 minutes. And her reflection of the movie. So yes this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar. Do not listen to all other reviews because they are all wrong. You can trust me because I never eat you, dear reader, BS. <br /> <br /> And it's true. I guess you can say that I'm about "one" review.
