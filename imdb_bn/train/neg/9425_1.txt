Did anyone edit this image? Or was it a DVD release that was a 30-second gap in the scene? It's okay, I fell asleep watching it for the first time. Then I fell asleep for the second time and the third time. The plot is actually the worst I've seen, but it's close. I do not see the worst of acting ... but it's close. Production ... Well, I can honestly say that it was the worst in my life! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, I felt like I laughed, laughed in the film and laughed and laughed. Serious moments were not done very badly, but a shoe budget could also work well. <br /> <br /> The letters were curiously developed, or were ignored together, the thick ends were very bad and the exposition was taken forever without expressing much <br /> <br /> <br /> I avoid this picture Give advice. <br /> <br /> 1/10
