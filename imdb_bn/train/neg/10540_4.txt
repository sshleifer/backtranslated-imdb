Patrick Channing (Jeff Kobber) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who has "the first power": Even after being captured by detective Russell Logan (Lu Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he can move away from his soul and body. Continue to deliberately kill. With the help of interesting psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, half-sister of Melanie G.), she tried to stop channing. This concept is likely to have some possibilities, but at the end the "first power" suffers from routine scripting and film making. This is not something we have never seen before, sometimes it has happened well. There is nothing about this film to separate it from other supernatural horror thrillers. The point is more, it is not too thrilling and it is certainly not scary. Phillips is sold as hard-working, senior police striotype, and Griffith does not seem to be trying very hard; The best cast member is probably doing his best work to become extraordinarily extraordinary. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> 4/10
