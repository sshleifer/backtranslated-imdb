The very hot plot of "Forestry Trieste" is taken from Francois Sagan's short novel, which has become a best seller, even though God knows why. It is possible to have a specific appeal for young people who want to get rid of their parents. David Nevain plays the playboy father and Deborah Care is not considered to be a mother-in-the-step. Unfortunately, Jean-Seberg's imperfect shoulder rests too much. She is beautiful and easily met a spoiled teenage image. The problem is that he can hit the dress but he can not work. Anyone who saw him as the youngest person to star in the first film of St. Premani's St Joan-Sabers - he knows that at the age of 19 he was unable to carry a film. This premiection movie has completed the first "commitment". It was his second movie; What was he thinking at the age of 20? Sevens are lacking in the ability to perform that compensation and care compensation? There is no chance? Seberg's character is located in the center of the story and, although he can be physically physically 17 years old, he firmly believes that he can not fulfill the emotional needs of the role. I do not know that he never became a successful actress in his younger life because in his next film, he had no influence about my consciousness. But anyone who thinks this picture needs to check a taste better than the mediator. In spite of Neveen and Care, this is a small story played by a young girl badly needed to send her to a young girl.
