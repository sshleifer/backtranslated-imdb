Unreal with a capital "A" If this is not an unexpected show at the moment, it will be one. I do not know about it as anti-bush, but this show does not even get a chocolate from me. There is absolutely nothing to do with whether you want to choose the shadow of this shit showcasing what you think of Bush as President. "Junk" is not all fun. For example, in Lil Bush's head there is a scene in his underwear: "Welcome to Shibir Al Qaeda!" There is nothing interesting about that. Is it even supposed to be joke? The ads appearing in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, it was hipping, was more fun than the show and it is simply sad. Hopefully this is not considered for a second season. It was not even the first.
