I am the 11th class in my high school. This video was a child in my class in my current World Affairs class and we are seeing. So we did. I'm convinced that we went to the moon, my dad was working for NASA. Although I think I have seen the biggest piece of the movie, the person who created it has some serious force. First of all, JF shot was shown? And how he dares to use all biblical quotations. The only good thing in this movie is that it sparks the debate, which is good b / c in my class, we debate weekly. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore will work together and make another movie. Michael Moore's next film "Spotberger 11 can be called a fun thief" or "White House of the funny thing".
