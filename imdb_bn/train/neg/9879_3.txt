After watching the film, I was really shocked to see high ratings at IMMb. <br /> <br /> 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox is an adaptation of a favorite children's classic, smooth performers of slick stories. Fox (or 'foxi') he tried the 'last' hijst to steal from the ghosts, bogisins, bonuses and beans. All right, one small, one fat, one thin, or anyway. <br /> <br /> I do not know where to start with my criticism. <br /> <br /> I was not a fan of my late teenager and Rold Dahl, but I liked his ingredients well enough to see his books as a child, and saw Matilda and Charlie and the chocolate factory again and again. . But this film is struggling for the audience. Is it targeting children? The stars? I'm still uncertain! Many 'jokes' give birth to children, especially Mr. Fox, like a lawyer who is seen or complained of being poor. Also, I (I suppose) are expected to be impressive with the audience of an audience, who steals chickens and kills them. I'm all for food chains, but you're actually biting Mr. Fox in their neck! Of course it's a little more? And, Plot ... Well, that's kind of annoying. I just hoped to be good, but instead I became more annoyed with Mr. Fox and his son, Eash, for making foolish decisions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I only laughed once or twice, although I specifically recognized the effort at Jokes. I think it is incredibly flat and played monotonously played part of the voice. Voice actors have no sense of comic timing, instead it is the subtlety of humor that works with a particular medium. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and smooth, but there is no character in his voice. The Marily Strip does not show any emotions, even though Bill Murray did not have a role in the end, even in the Fox-Year, Twelve-year-old Esh seemed to think that he was like 30. <br /> <br /> I love the animation, especially the speed off, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. Character lengthy, spindly and lack of any warmth of the design. They move with very little fluidity and often jerky and weird animation. There is also a unique 'mixed mode' feeling, because 2D elements have been added to spiral and failure. Character look and talk directly to the camera; It was very painful. While looking directly at the camera, Kelly was not looking at one or two moments and was hanging on her ribs. It actually makes me weird. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Many people still seem to like it - look at reviews. Maybe it was not for me.
