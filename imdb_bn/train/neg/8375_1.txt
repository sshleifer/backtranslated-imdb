America A country of freedom, hope and dream. This nation, since its freedom, has struggled to bring democracy, prosperity and peace to the whole world for the welfare of all mankind. There is a time, but when no one can help, Americans should stay at the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> This 'movie' (and I use that term with some reservations) raises these feelings with intense purity. This view of hell follows Kelvin's courage, it is a strange jewelry thief, which was created by connecting the scattered head of marlane wine over two feet high dwarf body. After excluding a big diamond in an unidentified way in the Vennesa handbags, a career woman who was unwilling to bear children, Calvin realized that he must be associated with him to recover the diamond. So, as a normal person, Calvin prepares himself as a 2-year-old man and parks himself in the house of a poor woman, where Danielle Vanessa's husband husband Darill appears. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Darlene fell helplessly to the disguise of Kelvin, that 'baby' has a full tooth, skin, a tattoo, a knife and a 16-year-old sex drive heel . Old Even more absurdly, Vanessa does not see Calvin's baby before and looks at diminutive perverted breastfeed effort. This cruel attack on the soul of mankind strives to find humor in rape, neuroscience, sexual abuse, and pedophilia, but fails, but in the evil act of converting yourself into a "family-friendly" part, the Wyan brothers stir up feelings and error morality is a sick amount. <br /> <br /> Brothers try to rehabilitate the thieves of their thieves by expressing them as "silly parents". Crate crushes Darrell repeatedly and enables Calvin to develop a loving father-son relationship, which he always and Darrell always wished. As it was not ridiculous, Kenvin's attempt for sexually assaulting Kelvin was by no means firm believing that for a successful career, she should be selfish to make a woman selfish, and instead she should play the role of a little wife, who spent her time in the children's Were up and cooked for her husband. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < In addition, they are primarily of the current generation of black comedians, who are responsible for transforming African-American humor into a poor and unfortunate shadow, which is more involved in satirical and unreasonable sex world. By the rights these two cameras should be likewise legally prohibited from picking something even similar even to the camera. Unfortunately, the current artistic and moral bankruptcy of American movies is that in the next two months they will definitely film two signals and earn millions of dollars from ticket merchandise.
