He was not too funny to see the Burn Barn. He was also good at playing secondary characters in the movie "Mel Brooks" ("High Concern" comes to mind). However, he is not a person who can carry a film to play a dual role. It's basically a "Gremlins" knockoff, "Critters" and "Ghoulies" followed by a tradition of such movies. This is not a very good drama similar to "Goli", but it is a very lighter tone, it is close to a dark place where the movie is found. In fact, this one is very light and frothy, and unfortunately many junk ends the fall of the plane. Although I gave it 3 for a score, it is only a movie that is a bad "Gremlin" counterfeit-off If you've seen the mystery science theater 3,000, then I know what you're talking about ... the infamous "Hobbbins". This guy found a little bird in some underground place (I've seen this movie a while ago, so I do not remember everything clearly) and it starts friendly enough. However, these animals became increasingly integral and certainly more spawned and that movie. Much more than the hits in the comedy section, and it is really worth watching Comman's bad role. It's best to skip it, but you just want to check it out for what.
