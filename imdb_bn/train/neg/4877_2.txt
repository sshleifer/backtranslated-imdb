Frank Caper's creativity should be spent during the making of this film. Although it is a few charming moments and many wonderful performers, CAPRA is not totally reusable of the script, but Broadway Bill (1934) is the most frustrating footage from its first version of this story. It is understood that he will reuse the footage from the climatic horse race, which is thrilling. But he used full dialogue scenes with small actors, then brought those actors back, and obviously we do not expect that the ward bond is 14 years old! You do not want to see one of Oliver Hardy's latest appearances, then exclude it and instead see the Broadway bill.
