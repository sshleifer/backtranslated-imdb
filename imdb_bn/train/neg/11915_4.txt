This clear pilot for an unseen TV series shows young Canadian actress Shirie Appleby as a reminder of some amazingly unbelievable power that the people of the world should be used while traveling around the globe. CGI is equal to a TV job, and Appleby is difficult to swap just as a pest but as a superheroine. As well as going to be the mentor of the famous TV mask Richard Bergie Appleby, nothing can do to increase this drake on the medieval level. We see too much way from the beginning to the cartoon flying monster from the right side, a bad sign. Also, the scenes that Appleby has trained for the Bagi war are actually funny. They have a bad copy of the same scenes in many other films, especially Remo Williams.
