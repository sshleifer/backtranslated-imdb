You may have heard or not, there is no real fight between the vampire or the jumbo in this movie. Someone might ask why the title has offered such a thing, but it is really good because nothing else about this movie has been made in any way. There was absolutely no story or plot, it was just happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than security commercial ads. <br /> <br /> There was no war between the vampires and the body, but it seems that it was the only scene with Jumbo. Their make-up looks like it is enforced by an 8-year-old girl. The scene was completely random and out and featured one of the characters fighting zombies with a hedge trimmer (I'm not fun) but they use the effects of the chainsaw sound. <br /> <br /> This is undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life. In the only case I do not completely ridicule every person responsible for the production of this film if I know that it was fully produced by 11 years old. <br /> <br /> I'm really even with the criticism. Offer here, I strongly recommend this movie to be based on this fact that it can be a very bad movie and because of this, it is a comical movie. Even it should count the error flaws.
