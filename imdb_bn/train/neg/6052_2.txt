Despite its flaws, I have enjoyed "Cigarette Burns", a series of sessions of John Condor's Masters of Horror series. Yes, the story looked like a cheap cross on the mind and 8 mm face, but it was still quite good for budget and time constraints. With "pro-life", however low budget and time constraints clearly show more than anything else. There is always strong direction from the presenter but still there is a quality of writing and complete product that makes the feeling total and completely slow. The script is not always clear, the message is unclear, and once you look at them, the story is full of plot pits. Probably rewriting the carpenter script, it could be a suitable episode. Instead, it's a mess that will find just the least enjoyment among the hardcore carpenters. Definitely the worst curcure ever made. 2/10
