A bad rap-off attempt at "Seven", sub-second-grade performance, awful camera work, half-baked stories and strong reaction to furor propaganda Yes, their "sex offender", they live in the next house and you will be raped. <br /> <br /> There is no surprise from the woman of the vice-terminist, she always works - like a piece of wood in pieces. Richard Gere is slogan below and below - and it's less like late Steven Siegel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unlike "Seven", which was up, but funny), which can be related to less or more regardless of the country, this movie only focuses on the US-only obsession. If someone does not care too much about "sex offenders" - and statistics that the lack of exercise and poor diet can cause more pain, pain and death - there is little reason to see or see it. <Br /> <br /> Some parts of the body are broken and some are wasted, but the cow has fewer medium, and artistic instruments (because it is in vain) and fails like Gore, because it is not very poor. <br /> <br /> Do not waste this one time.
