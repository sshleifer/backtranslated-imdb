"Welcome Collinwood" is a disaster type. Considering the people involved, it should be many times better. <br /> <br /> Seeing it, if at least it is connected to the belief, it will be better, probably you will cry. It was one of the few possible films, but this possible thank you was a terrible script and was blocked from some bad acting, strangely unpleasant and unnecessary George Clooney's character and that person who did not remind me of Richard Dreyfus but whom I care about so much Little, I do not even want to know his name. <br /> <br /> It's the only strange dictionary of the movie to be released. I think once again time and time when I saw myself guilty more time. This is the only reason I gave the film 3. The plot is boring, the characters are neurotic, unreasonably invasive, and extremely unlikely. They are in a very acute situation and they are so annoying that I have kept them obstructed. They shouted at each other and cried fierce. This conversation is good and humiliating foolish from the bottom. <br /> <br /> I found that Steven "Traffic" Soderbrujabrabah and George Clooney are responsible for this. They should try their war crimes, if someone really cough enough to care for this care.
