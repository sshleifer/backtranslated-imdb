Hat cat is just a slip in the face film. Mike Moms as Hat-In-Cat is not just funny and Mike's mothers could not be any worse. This is his worst film ever he has ever been. Acting and the stories were just terrible. I mean how they said. The most beloved stories of Sees can be made in movies and can be one of the worst movies of all time and can be such a disappointment. I could not see a bad film except this, maybe baby jeans But this picture is so bad that I can not describe how badly I've described this movie. Bo Welch should be fired or the author should. <br /> <br /> Hadith's view: 0/10 star F.
