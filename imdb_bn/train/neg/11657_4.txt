"Scary Movie 2" scorn the scary movie franchise. The scary movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but it was kind of annoying and very funny. Fortunately they did this work and made two other awesome horror films. <br /> <br /> <br /> This image was about a group of teenage years who led their professor to go to a scary palace for the night. The facts start to go wrong and then they realize that they will run away. <br /> <br /> This movie is not awesome but could have developed several things. This is something funny and if you like other movies of the scary movie franchise, then give it a watch - but I do not think you like it.
