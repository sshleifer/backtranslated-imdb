A Meteor hit the Crater Lake (seeing our heading), a Plesiosaur awakening, who proceeded to snack over the hick population (California, that capital of the world. Hick.) <br /> <br /> There are bad movies, and then there is "The Crater Lake Slow", anyway MSST 3 was managed to escape. Acting acting a grating, a decent stop-motion animal, and much more, it's a terrific piece of 1970's low budget absorption / giant film Drake. <br /> <br /> Although the film is guilty of many crimes, but the biggest of the two offensive rednecks serving as comic reference to Arnie and Mitch, They roam, fight "stocking music", abuse women, and act on cruel pretenses of humanity. Characters are so bad, they should count as a crime against humanity.
