I do not think it can be done, but something has happened and replaced the open house - because of the high cost of real estate, the horrors of low budget - the horrors of low budget - I saw some of my little picture but otherwise sweet life. <br /> <br /> It was considered the best movie in Montreal's most recent movie festival, which led me to believe that all other entries must have funky poetry as well as empty wall shots. <br /> <br /> This movie was like a little fruit from Hell. It's from Austria, and it tries to keep aside the scenes with a few characters living in a colony area with the darkest shadows of short cots and blue velvet. The owner of the fat dog and his fat maid wife, who has striked for him, skinny Talakdar, whose wife still lives with her in the obsolete room of her dead child, referring to the top ten lists on the list of high-boring female hits. The list goes away. Forever. More than two hours I spent in that theater. <br /> <br /> Yes, communicating with characters, but not tricky or interesting or even relevant. According to subtitles, I could not say that they were not as good as the actors, they were "so fussy!" Its Austrian equivalent was. They certainly could not learn a lot, because everyone repeated their same lines at least three times in a scene. <br /> <br /> This is not a gamo or an earlier movie. There is no art to discover, and after no further things you should change the policy of "No Time to Walk in a Movie" (which was done by a number of older couples in a random orgy scene - and if it is hungry, this is not the case No you are one of those who do not find the idea of ​​your parents' sexual relationship - and some local medieval couples The boot-staged). <br /> <br /> This movie was objectionable to me. Not silent nudity, not cring-educating soundtracks, guns are not a shock scene involved. I was stunned that someone actually spent money to spend it for writers and filmmakers there capable of making money. If someone came out of town outside to see the dog's day and we could know if the Montrealers found the best, I am surprised. Most of the time, I was satisfied, because the people involved in the festival all believed that the Emperor was a fantastic and shocked new team when it was painful that he was stripping the fat maid. <br /> <br />
