I like to report that I do not rate movies below 5 years. I was really excited to see this movie. For several months I wanted to watch this movie in the numerous TV trailers. So, on the other night when I saw that it was available on the Fire Net on Demand, I found some popcorn and sat down to see the pictures. <br /> <br /> The story seems curious - some kids are imposing on vague people. Underground way A photographed obsessed with missing people. Where are they going? What's going on with them One day, the photographer saw a connection between some pictures, and the Butcher, followed by his back, yada yada. Although the plot was highly anticipated, the film was a way to suck you. "Oh no, it's dark, looking at your back" I say, most bored with the cheap thrill. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "It was good at the end .... then it became stupid", the message Jackschellington in the board said to Frare. And I totally agree. And here the spoilers come ... see <br /> <br />, I was hoping some crazy killer, some psychological person obsessed with cannibalism. No There were some secret societies to keep animals alive for several centuries. A. How come true How unreal <br /> <br /> 3/10. Come on Lionsgate. You've done amazing films, but this one blurred.
