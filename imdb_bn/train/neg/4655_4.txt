I wanted to give benefit to the initial suspicion of drawing blood. In the opening moment, the swine and painter Diana with a nude woman to draw him out and then take out his blood so that he could use it for his art, giving the idea that it could be a kick-ass of arts. Vampire flush. It turns out active in this initial impression. Oops, trumpets, signs of lack of quality: Sometimes they will offer something that is trash but fun and at least a few junk food craft (or sometimes not). Is it an event where it is weaker than the humorous effort (such as the protagonist of the protagonist of the protagonist of the protagonist of Jimmy Durante?), And any strange smile is reduced by Sergio Lapel, it is not entirely fun to watch from him. The direction of the basement on the door. <br /> <br /> Without trying her, oh, not the lord. He tried a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for lights, but I have made use of the way in the movie, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sitting in my seat: If I have seen it in a theater then I must blind myself in many cases Whether the eye, and its DP can really understand the core 3-point discussion set up Although it should not be something to focus on during the trompoery, with some very lazy sound design (or random hamming in the art gallery scene), it should be something * basic * that a movie-maker script is very funny or scary (and It is not) Even if Lapel makes a weird mix of strange moments, even then it can deal with it. <br /> <br /> This is not a good film by any side, and probably if you killed a vampire (or only a vampire time), it would be an appeal to some of the lesser rental rental basements, or some kind of blood type of 1972 May be a little improvement. You have the best way to waste your time overall.
