Japanese ideas of pacing, editing and musical scores should be different from American flavor, but this film definitely means that more post production can be so much more. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Create this movie and I think it would be a big hit. The story is interesting and awesome. There is something about the city, broken police, earthquake, sanitary and killings of the mysterious saltwater that are enough to concentrate. However, this story can create a little bit of the idea and may be perhaps 40 minutes short. <br /> <br /> I would say that the "six-sense" effect was complete in this film, and it was clear from the very beginning. <br /> <br /> As it stands, diy-hard Japanese filmmakers should be annoyed to see this arrogant movie.
