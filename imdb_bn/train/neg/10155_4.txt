I've read several good reviews that saved and criticized various aspects of this movie. Trying to change the world, I see an issue with the ideological political scientist Megan, I over over. I like her character. Maybe, because I'm a 23-year-old political science student and I think I'm going to change the world too, so I'm related to the megans. Besides, she is beautiful. He is a super model, but an intelligent girl more door more <br /> <br /> He cried so loudly. It seems very dramatic, and overdone, but does it fit its character? He goes on to show that with a motive to sacrifice his life to prove a point. He thinks people who enjoy such programs are sick I think he made his argument very well. Of course, being a young little girl is afraid, she is afraid of being confronted. I pictured a young girl showing her moral courage showing her acting accurately despite her horror. Still, I think he maintained a certain status throughout the film, despite being in despair. <br /> <br /> In general, there was a movie other than Megan, which I expected. This was a nice grape scene by the micro budget standard. Plot probably took a quick thought, rarely any thoughts. It is basically a dark humorous stupid slashher film, which refers to the name. I love the pain of the doctor. He torn Magan's shirt, not only because of sludge (though mostly in most cases), but it would make him painful before killing him. Chain hick was ridiculous. For Slasher film lovers, she was probably the best character. <br /> <br /> I give this image 4 out of 10. It was a good setting, almost no plot and a mix of good and terrible acting. I would suggest it for a cheaper thriller, but rough micro budget is awful that rough is a diamond.
