Crime BOSS is run by Alberto de Martino; Partially illustrated Italian crime drama in Germany's Hamburg An easy-to-forget movie. Even in spite of a good car cycle order, this flick seems aimlessly woody. A new don takes on a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life. Mafia code written laws and ethics make it hard to believe someone, especially when millions of dollars are reduced. Brutality and violence back to the same breed. This can not be a shelf with real gangster epic. America's drive-in rental memories come back only in the face of the film. Even the popular American actor Tele Savalas could not increase the capacity of this crime drama. Antonio Sabato also accompanies him: Paola Tedesco, Guido Lolobrigrida, Serio Tramanti and Peero Morr√≠a.
