This show is awful. How is George the fun of his mother's fun? This show is terrible. Parents must be extremely awesome and children should be brought to the service. The girl is a witch with a B and the boy is just a complete brat. George is not funny, especially when he speaks out loud about Spanish and objectionable brands. Ernie is a loser, but at least I've chuckled him several times, but mainly how sad he is. George's mother, Beni, is a terrible, disgusting character. Sure, her husband had left her, but the way one behaves like a baby, someone can laugh more than that. <br /> <br /> Can anyone force me to say that George's head is big? It's not even bigger! I have been removed from the letter because they are very awful and it takes me a few hours to write and I really do not care enough. I care enough to see someone look at this and if they want to see the show, this show is an illogical excuse for a sitcom and your time is worth. <br /> <br /> I give it 2 because the wife is very attractive.
