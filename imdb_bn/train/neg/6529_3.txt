This movie is fun and painful at the same time. "Cinemagic" almost seized me one. Despite what they mean, "cinemagic" is not some innovative technical method. It was "developed" as a result of an accident, and they used it because it was their "monsters" so stupid-that the camouflage was. I do not think it's a coincidence that the author's CD "Pink". <br /> <br /> This movie is good for laughing, if you are really looking for a movie made up to $ 200,000 in 9 days. It is entertaining; At least I can tell about it. The bat / rats / spider is highlighted.
