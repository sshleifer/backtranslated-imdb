After watching my "Trans," or "Ananta", or any producer calling this movie, I surprised myself, "I've found the bad movies I've seen, at least one of them Is not it seen which was entertaining? "Although there is no film made well in the acting, direction, writing, or what you have, it can be a little fun and so appropriate. But artistic standards are bad only this film, it's incredibly annoying. For such a thin slip, it comes slowly, slowly with a little dramatic tension. At least, in the humble attempt, the death of letters could have been cold and / or serious, but the manufacturers of this division also failed in that department. <br /> <br /> What is this movie going on for? Christopher Walken, who is able to be brilliant, without having to watch him, does not have much to do, much less effort in his acting, he has been in self-parody mode (why does he want to do this movie?). <<br /> <br /> I'm giving this picture 3/10, because God helps us, actually it has made a worse movie earlier.
