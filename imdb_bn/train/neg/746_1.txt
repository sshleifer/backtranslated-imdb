Save $ 8.97, you go to Walmart to buy this DVD and watch Steven Spielberg's original movie. <br /> <br /> I was a filmmaker and I had to buy HG Wales to be a raging fan. Expect this to sit and watch three hours good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to see because I could not meet for more than 10 minutes at a time. It's horrible <br /> <br /> Timothy Hines has reported a budget of $ 20 million for this report. Where did he go? Does he use it most to buy a new house? His retirement means? Or what? What's really good about this movie is about starting. It has the book true and there are some good performances in it. I can act as an actor trying to make it a good film definitely. But good performance was overshadowed by the horrific quick ... and I mean terrible special effects. A new film school student can work better with CGI. To me, most of it looked like the cutouts of the "stop action" card board, which was used to sophisticated CGI software that should be used for $ 20 million projects. <br /> <br /> Applying this film is not an excuse for producing an amateur post. My own partner and I used to sit down and use the software to rebuild our version of the ferry scene which costs less than $ 1500.00 and there was a five-minute view that was better and more realistic than the hines. I've seen movies with less than $ 2 million in budgets. very good. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, special effects used in the original King Kong were far more sophisticated and better than the effects of Hines in this movie. Actually, due to this film there is a lot of gratitude for the attack of my killer Tometos. There is no excuse for today's technology for a film like the 50's B-movie, unless it is an intention that was not with this particular project. <br /> <br /> I had a problem with DVD transfer, the film was a violent, another film-making exhibition. <br /> <br /> Overall, I want to say that in 2003, I created a $ 45,000 project that has cinematography and special effects than this movie. <br /> <br /> I strongly encourage a person who appreciates the making of the movie or a WOTW fan to leave the film on the roof and instead see 50 feet of women attack. It will be easy on the eyes.
