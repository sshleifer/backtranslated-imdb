Being an Elvis fan, I do not understand how it can be done. So far, the worst Alvish related film is the greatest of all time, stupid, stupid, and lots of mistakes about the king. Elvis graves in a public park? Referring to suspicious Minds in 1958? ... and these two examples. Cast people try to do their best, Mike Star is funny (especially as an incognito), Tom Hendes Cameo is a wonderful phenomenon, but that guy is playing Elvis short. Above all, the movie does not have fun and then becomes more annoying minute. Minutes If you are looking for a very cheap, insane but very funny little movie related to Elvis, I really recommend you "Buba Ho-Tape" instead of this mess.
