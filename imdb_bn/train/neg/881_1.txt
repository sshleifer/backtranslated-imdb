Thanks to some notorious home video distributors brought in the so-called German independent series, four are not terrible for Venice, but really awful. So terrible, I have dumped it on second hand products shop for extra cash. <br /> <br /> Nick and Charlotte reached a contract to stay married to a married couple who only had their well-planned schedule. Profession. Eva and Lewis face a pair of couples, where Eve works as a waitress and louis artist. Nick is indirectly because Eva lose his job as a waitress. Luis and Charlotte were a matter of behind Eva and Nick. Luis cheated Eve in a lie that she was flying to London to do something about her artwork, but she was actually going to Venice with Charlotte for adultery holidays. Eva has dragged her 2 kids along with the kidnapped and collision for the kidnapping and collision Venice trip Nick and Eve both fall for each other. <br /> <br /> Venice's journey presentation from Germany to Nick and Eve marks the failure of the comedy. It does not look cute only, but the tunnels. In the film, Nick tried to seek help in different ways, but it does not help in any way. This is the stranger who works around him, or they are just fools. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But the film is not being used to solve a problem in general. They like to go through a big round to solve the problem. <br /> <br /> It became so bad that Venus's fine graduation even failed to attain the fame of the film.
