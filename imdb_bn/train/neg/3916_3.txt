We all know that a film does not fully test the book, but it's an exception. Important characters were cut, Blanka and Alba were originally dropped into the same character, most of the subheads and main components of the main plot were omitted. Clarar's cleansing had rarely diminished, which seemed to be a far more shallow character than the book. In the book, we learn more about his power and his important influence on many people, which were the main elements of family life. In the film he was more than some special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-III, by the way, son, and thus comes after Segundo-II) and Pancha Garcia is Esteban and his connection between his grandchildren (son, who he has accepted) and its importance Gets reduced. <br /> <br /> One of the most basic of this book is that the film is omitted: it is known as "Spiritus House". Where's the house? The story of a family of 3-4 generations has been mentioned several times in the novel "Wandering around the big house of the corner". The basic house of the story, but the film completely depicts one another's retreat. <br /> <br /> If I did not read the book before, I would never have been convinced that such a bad, shallow movie could be based on a rich and entertaining novel.
