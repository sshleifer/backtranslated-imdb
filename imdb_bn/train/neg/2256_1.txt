I admit that I might have seen five minutes of "Jerry Springer". I do not consider myself a snob, but I really think above what I see on her show. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was told that the film did not really have a slight relation with Springer, rather it focused on the life of the exhibition in "Springer". Well-managed, this film may actually be an attractive look by seeing how bad these people are in life. I would admit, I felt a feeling of sympathy for Conny (Molly Hagen). In this life he has all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Did you notice that after this movie he played the role of "B" on TV mainly? I'll talk about Hagen. She is a very beautiful and intelligent woman. I have no acting that he is very sincere in his acting and he tries to play his role with a lot of sympathy. The problem hagana can not bear a scene of its own. She did not just take a lead role. His best work was always "Harmon's Head" (a ceremony that was not extraordinary, his heart was in the right place), and when he was present as Sister Roberter as a guest of "SafeField".
