"Smitherens" is just like the flicker that was destroyed in cable channels, just as a Chasey Dime novel in the public library. Mid-term director Sedelman's quintessence and first attempt, the film has poor performance, poor sound, bad camera work, and low quality in all aspects of the film. There are many good films that can not be made in the market and why such junk flicks do and sometimes it does not seem to go away is a great mystery of life. (D-)
