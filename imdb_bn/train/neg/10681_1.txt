How unfortunate, many of the "A" lists on the list and the good "B" list actors agree to do this film, but they did it, and it sucked me. I have never heard of this movie, but Dowdy was on Cuba Gooding Junior and how could James Woods be bad in the background? A word too! This movie starts with O.K. There are some twists and turns, then just puts an egg. The end was so weak, the writer was called, and his 4-year-old son sat on the writer's writings and eventually hacked. How harmful it is to a movie titled "last game" is so poor. These are such movies that the actors can move to the list "A" in a fast "B" list. I hope Cuba Gooding Jr, and James Woods is not a habit of this.
