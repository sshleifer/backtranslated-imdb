So far I have seen most movie movies. I hope to have a Chess movie but at least some cool car is going on with the scene / race. I had nothing to do. The racing scene is so low budget that they are confiscated at a lower speed to think they are "fast moving". In a scene, a Morshedis SLR circular around four seconds is more than 200 seconds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want to see a real movie about a quick and furious series please see. They may be a little hungry, but this film can be expected to be 100 times better. Well just look at Mischief 3000, I think ever made the best car movie.
