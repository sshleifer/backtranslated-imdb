Original casting concept has been preserved (Hunting Roger, not Ice), the film worked. Sadly, racism came in the film (literally) and it was messy. Primarily black production workers did not allow the opponents to be black, so they reinforced the role of router and ice. It is only the beginning of the downward spiral of this movie. Ernest Dickerson's 'directing' news orbital motive only verified that it employed another positive action-action. Master shot, close up, close up Gadas, 'Who line it is Evey' even uses more creative camera work. Eric's rewriting of 'The Most Dangerous Game' is at least an effort to modernize the classic story, but the characters are failing to give us any motivation why this is working on this. We never give these reasons because "nobody else will miss this person", why the leader (these are rewritten as router) does these things. In addition to John McGuin's heart-felt performance and in addition to Charles Dutton's perfect job, do not get bored with it. There was a small diversification, during the filming of F.Murray Abraham was a real drunken driving accident, and as a result of the death of a young driver killed by the accident.
