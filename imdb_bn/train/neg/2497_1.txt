There is only one problem with this website, you can not give a negative rating. In addition a companion rated this as a D-grade movie. I said he was very nice. A piece of wood, the film's actor and the meaning used to create this film can show more passion that could be used better to start a fire. This is terrible, 2 hours of life nobody can tolerate this neutral bloodshed. After 5 minutes, I and the boys wondered if the bulk would be heavy, it would not be entertained any more. After half carto and 151 bottles I finally found some distant funny acting in this G grade. The director that insults the entire planet on this may think that something more beneficial than this, go to him and buy a rope. And to these flint actors, I hope you paid this jockey well because I doubt you will work again. In summary, I've stopped the actors of this movie for 100 Grand and 12 Demright points.
