I watched Phat Beach on the wire for a while and I enjoyed it sort of. He looks like a nice guy, fat person is the best character The remaining characters are just different stereotypes of young and young black men. I like watching these low-budget movies that take a long time because they like about a year's attitude and a documentary of pads. Phat Beach is also fun because this movie low budget babes strictly home girls. Most low budget movies have "local children" quality, and you can tell kids in this movie for JC Penney, local fishermen and underwear models. Some of them hung hanging cellulite hanging from their binoculars, how fun it was to see how "young people" really are over-used, high-mileage scanks. There were too many cuties. That's the charm of this low-budget crappy movie. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked out some of them at IMDB and seven years later Phat Beach their only credit. very bad. In all cats shown in the history of the film, it will be interesting if the book is directed to the book "Where is now," and then never come back. what happened?? Perhaps one or two young people in almost every movie seem to be eating too much for them, and after a few years when you again watch TV on TV, you are surprised that "What happened to X?" However, this movie mostly hit, but it has some funny moments.
