All right .. this movie was so beautiful! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbird and it has come to love and this movie has some nice features that will look for a good Thunderbird movie. The draft itself and Tracy Island were actually moved to the big screen, although we still love in designs. Sofia Miles was fantastic as Lady P and Bill Paxton, when I did not think Jeff Tracy's opinion was enough ... but then adults were brought out from the equation and we were asked to believe in the age of 8, 200 tons of machines could fly <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Allen Tracy was so objectionable in the film, and he thought that three The machines, as well as the brothers, will be able to fly ... who were at least 19/20. Seriously, in this case there are several simple machines to use it. <br /> <br /> I do not think the picture wants to be serious or harmful. It tries to give respect when satirising and it usually falls flat on its face. 3/10 (for 2 machines, Lady P1)
