These photo figures are well researched. There is no doubt about this! Al Gore certainly presented his case very well and it is no surprise that the film received the praise it received. Al Gore must be quite an actor. She sounds so anxious. But the words of the words are loud! Throughout this film, political films and their political career spread throughout the essence. This photo is spread all over the world. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Carter is a honest person who does not just talk about the discussion, but walks like a walk just like Al Gore. When Carter felt that we needed to save our energy, he had closed the thermostat in the White House and warmed up wearing sweater. <br /> <br /> Al-light tells us that our energy needs to be saved and claimed that we're creating global warming when it travels around its own private jet. How much power and its jet uses pollution in its jet? How much power does it take to heat the Gore swimming pool behind his house? It will be good if we create a point to save electricity using small appliances and to stop anything that is not used to it. But if we do that, then the power company will respond by 50% of its "damage to 50% of the revenue" and restore their losses to 50% reduction power. So "just shutting it off" would not be a very good idea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
