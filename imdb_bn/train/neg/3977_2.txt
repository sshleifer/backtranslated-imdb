The same pair of sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have earned fame in "Comedy" such as "Two Kinds", I have never seen them before, but I had an idea about what I thought, but it was worse. Originally Hunter's sister Charlie (Mary Kate) and Lella (Ashley) are in Rome for a Summer Intern program, but soon after they started their jobs, they were immediately expelled for miscreants. But the company-owned person Derek Hammond (Julian Stone) returns their jobs and they gradually prove their own useful resources, and talented (fashion) artists, and prevent a medieval person from accepting. Company. Jamie's Leslie Dannon, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Eleanorie Lazararin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Matolini as Heidi, Michellejo Tomasso as Paolo and Matt Patcheri like Enrico Tartonii. You can say directly that this movie has to go straight to the video, the camera is completely independent, and when it does not help, when you want to appreciate the philosophy of Rome. In fact, the only good thing to see in the background, both of the sisters are among the most annoying celebrities, I already knew that they would not show interest in me anyhow (not even beautiful), it's a junky film horror friction. Beautiful poor!
