When I'm watching a movie, I'm aware that this is just a movie, but still I want to let myself be as furious as possible in the situation. I think it makes us cry, cry, laugh, or otherwise respond to emotion like the audience members, although deeply we know it's just a movie. What I do not want to remind me of the movie is that it is only a movie that I can not slip through the distraction mentioned above regardless of the quality of the film. The director of this movie likes to use multi-angle camera shots simultaneously on the screen. Maybe it's just me, but I'm going to be this very confusing and uncomfortable boring. They can run a continuous banner as well as reading the screen as well, 'Attention: it's just a movie. Do not allow yourself to be very interested or engrossed. If I want to 'photo-in-picture', I will activate it from my TV remote, but I do not want to enjoy any movie time.
