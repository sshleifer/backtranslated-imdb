And forget this. Completely. If you really have to see the Madonna Act, hire "proof body", at least willem defo is one of them. <br /> <br /> In this picture, if the sets are beautiful, you can mute the dialog. You do not miss anything Bruce Greenwood is lost, a phenomenon of Jane Triphforn, and Madonna is so awful, it's fun. Why did they have to save the original movie in this zombie, I would never know; Guess they were it "bankable". Madonna, certainly not as an actress. <br /> <br /> If you rent the original movie since 1979, you will enjoy it and the actor can actually work in it. 1/10
