This movie is just so awful. It is so bad that I can not spend anything other than a few words. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Lots of bootleg footage Curious cut and edit. No continuation of the plot. Acting is the most amateur I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> A movie bomb was used to earn some money without any meaning regarding its content accuracy. The camera is out at work and always shaky focus is out. It looks like the video was shot. <br /> <br /> In fact, they have now got Dennis Radar with life in prison, I want them to keep those people who made this horrible movie in jail <br /> <br /> Do not worry, look at this one seriously. If I can do this then I'd give it a negative star.
