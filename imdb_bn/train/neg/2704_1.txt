I do not understand why people would appreciate this garbage. His mistakes, stupid, unreal, awful, and everything else is just about right. A scene on film life, ethnic problems, bias, and oddly everything goes on in college. This is where it fails. It has no grasps of reality. For example, from a number of suspicious unknown scenes in the film, <br /> <br /> A black man threw a white man with a gun, trapped by a black man and security guards and armed with a gunman. Right behind them. <br /> <br /> The same white man stops the man from the roof, and the same black man is beaten, then closed and Rodney King Styles is beaten when the gunman runs. After a moment, the four guards were just behind. <br /> <br /> As a previous critic, some white 230lbs men are being beaten by some black men, including 105 kg sacks. Rhymes <br /> <br /> Another critical error in the film is the unreadable main character. The horrible and confused white people and money, anger, and yet valid (?) From black people It's almost as an insult to both the people of black and white. I am a white man and I know many black and Hispanic people who portray this picture and make them mistake especially for their race according to their race. <br /> <br /> The story that I'll explain is now rolling about three letters. A black athlete, another confused white girl who questions her sexuality, and the third is a white man, who is confused and frightened, then she blames her problems on black people, in which she becomes nazed after the film. All of them do not forget sexual issues, rape, fights, love, hatred, bias, ethnic warfare, and hello lessons. Which comes down to the end for all the deadly shoots. After which they go back to their annoying life and think of "being white is bad". Does this word sound like your college year? So do not think so. I do not think the director has been admitted to this college, especially if he made this awful mess. <br /> <br /> Overall this is a bad, bad, ugly movie. If you want to see more correct scenes or racial problems then see American history. If you want to see more accurate views of college rent Porkys. Just avoid this mess.
