This image describes the experience of hitting men (one of them, Bart Reynolds), prostitution, and two drag rui in a few hours in Miami on one night. The transformed stories finally bring together all the people in one place and at a time. The movie was hilarious, but the big problem was that everything happened at night and many scenes were literally expressed in the sense that it was impossible to see what was happening. In some scenes you can actually see them where they tried to "stretch" the developing process to save pictures. No one knows how to drive a movie camera. Wonderful that this image is released!
