I admired Rob Marshall for Chicago, but Geisha's flurry has become another failure in combining western and Asian art. Overall, the scene is beautiful, but after a steady emphasis on externalism-based scenes some people might be excited about them. Excessive cherry blister, apparently, was overdone. This is perhaps the cultural difference of perception here: The extreme beauty is not at all ideal, because in reality, the West will not be a pumpkin on the beautiful Gaisha film. <br /> <br /> Some other comments correctly mention the biggest error. As a Taiwanese citizen, I have no doubt that the actress is great. He can play a role when an actor / actress sees it. Gong Li is great, but the power of the emotions shown in this movie has not been translated into Japanese style. I saw a bittersweet and jealous Chinese woman. My favorite actress Michelle Yeow did not look like Japan. Some comments mention Japanese women's special fine, feminine characteristics, which I can not agree with anymore. These are so subtle that I do not think all modern Japanese actresses are not suitable for Gaisha's role, two Chinese and one Malaysian actress grew up in a different culture and probably did not know much about Japanese culture. <br /> <br /> Geisha is a good shot for the enthusiasm of American visitors. However, the film will be insulting for itself and for the industry if the film wins Oscars for Best Wear, Best Director or Best Picture.
