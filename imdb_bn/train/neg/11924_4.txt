Run ... do not walk away from this movie !!!!! This movie will make you cry, targeting very young people. When the gamer trilogy of the 90s is raised again and again, this movie just lowered. It is slow and giant war is good, but rarely seen. This movie was drying me in the box of cats. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The top 10 reasons why the gamer fans of the 90 series will hate this picture. <br /> <br /> 10. This film is a play that is trying to deal with the death of his mother, and fearing the death of his father Gammer, the boy is afraid to lose the gamer. <br /> <br /> 9 You can see adult gamra for one minute at the beginning of the movie. She gets kicked by her butt a few Gyos and self destructs ??? She looks old and vivid. Plus he does not see anything like a gamma that he has ever seen. His suit looked cheap. <br /> <br /> 8. The young gamara you see the rest of the picture look like crazy. Big-eyed and intelligent ... this will remind you of Godzilla vs. Mechgadilla baby Godzilla 2. Gamers are now very nice. <br /> <br /> 7. During the 3-hour rain delay, this movie has the speed of watching a NASCAR race. I saw this movie with 2 other Gammer fans and no one was satisfied about how slow the movie was going on. I saw an SVV The full people who are climbing on the mountain roads are fast moving. <br /> <br /> 6. Like Godzilla: Final War, this movie was very short time at the time of Qaiju. The final wars were a lot more, in fact, and even better fights were brief though. <br /> <br /> 5. Kids take the title role. In the 1970s, the theme song of all children and poisonous poems killed the gamara series and in the 2000s, the history repeats itself. Most successful gamers abandoned the feeling of films after the films and went to a dark place. Why go back to a failed formula? It was a new trilogy and a weak ticket sale, there was no hope of continuing this story (thank god). <br /> <br /> 4. Gamera lost his deceitful roar. She now sounds like an elephant with a stroke throat. <br /> <br /> 3 This movie can create a new Olympic event. Imagine a relay race that sends very young children to harmful paths. You have to see ending this point understand. Where was the father? Oh yeah ... okay send their kids to a Kaizu war zone there. <br /> <br /> 2. Special effects were good, but sub-par for a Gamera movie. Trajan and Iris had a good influence. The best effect was showing the apple size baby Gamera Fly. Not very impressive <br /> <br /> 1. This movie does not expect adult kyuju fans. The manager was involved in power rangers and it shows. It closes like a cross between ET, always: Sunset on Third Street and TMTT. If you know all 3 references, then Cundo. <br /> <br /> Watch this one to complete the best DVD or DVD series.
