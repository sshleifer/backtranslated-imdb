I think many people commented / reviewed their first movie at IMDB because the movie was spectacular or horror - I wrote later. <br /> <br /> I was excited for the success of "Wargames". I thought the original was good considering the time and time of the content, I felt it was more than worth seeing once. In 2008, I had high hopes for what they would do with this picture. Computer, gaming, terrorism, military joradari, has grown so much since the first film, and "oyaragamesa: The Dead Code," it was a great opportunity to bring flick. <br /> <br /> Most of the levels of the film failed, but I am particularly concerned that the gaming aspects of the author, and anyone blame him if reality had no input. "The Dead Code" was a Flight Simulator of the 1990's plane and some people inserted into their heads. Meanwhile, the Will Farmer is about 7,000 command button buttons - which are affecting what's happening on the screen. Finally, he is a box on the screen with the mouse by clicking on the "winners" of the gas out of which 0.000 virtual killed immediately (no one is around gas). Because in 15 minutes he defeated 5 levels, it's Replayy (real life war machine) that he is a high level terrorist threat. <br /> <br /> While 5-16 years old can do the same thing - the government believes that he has a serious threat to humanity. The "bio-terrorism expert knowledge" bio-terrorism wiki entries like the thing ... he read the first 3 chapters will be no less than knowledge. So, in the title of the bone, film-long-chase scenes with almost .01% of budgets and tensions arise. There are about 1000 possibilities to catch them and clear the whole thing. Sometimes they become crazy, they rarely miss him. But on the other hand, they skillfully create opportunities, let them go deliberately to follow him. /> <br /> ... I write ... uga <br, but I've already wasted 1.5 hours, 1.5 hours, I braderika and Joshua T-Tech-tow seen playing on.
