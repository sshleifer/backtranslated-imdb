Historically correct? Hmm ... probably ... if you squint, and the light falls on just the subject. But the core accuracy is a neutral, patchy and incompatible plot, reams of cardboard dialogue and no compensation for an unhappy conclusion. The main characters are mere characterizations; Embarrassing stereotypes that are 'stuffed or brutish' British officials from 'geographical and quality' American Indians. A rogue and incompetent presentation of a fascinating period of American history. I want my money back.
