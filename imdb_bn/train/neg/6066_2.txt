I was looking forward to seeing John Carpenter's episode in Season 2 because his first cigarette was the Best of Burns Season 1 (and I liked other episodes from that season). Oh, how was I frustrated <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting was bad, and I usually love Ron Perlin, but I can only blame them because writing was so awesome. Do not try to guess what the authors are trying to do, because it will be in vain, but it seems that they are trying to break the horrific (perhaps) terrible outbreaks of some social form of abortion and religion. In this case, surprisingly, it takes an opportunity to bash a certain variety or religious nuts and fanatic anti-abortionists. And I'm on both goals, but it was done so horribly that I feel embarrassed to see the characters and talk to such a stereo inconsistency. Completely failed to give any appropriate opinion in these matters and the terrible elements such as incomplete text have failed as well. <br /> <br /> Although I do not think the perforator can be blamed for most of the evil. He chose to give instructions on the telephone and so will be responsible for it. I got a few small bits, which I found pretty, so I gave 2 big stars. <br /> <br /> The actual grave and giant effects were good, but CGI Gore (two separate guns from the head) was so low-quality CGI they were never supposed to give. I usually have CGI's very critical but I basically have a problem with it. I have a problem with executing it. Although the technology is amazing in some cases, it is not good enough to match the "real" effects, even though it matches the image or the cow, especially when it appears to be organic and / or living something, and they should not be used until then. The CGIIT can be used well in small quantities, or if the whole image is animated then <br /> <br /> I can take care of the opportunity that the title of the show, the master's master, is a bad title. There are not many easy "awful masters" there. Maybe two or three The show is called "the story of heroo" or something like that will be good. But the criteria for managing one of these episodes has stood, and therefore being criticized for being "intimidatory", they have at least one horror movie in their career. And it will not even be a good one.
