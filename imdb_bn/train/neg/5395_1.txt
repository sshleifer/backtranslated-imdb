Kenneth Branagh attempted to make William Schuppayer's obscure, least-produced comedy as the musical instrument of the 1930s, which resulted in both bad Shakespeare and bad musical comedy because actors are rarely one or the other, and in some cases both flounder badly. Particularly painful, Nathan Lane, who thinks he's absolutely violent but wrongly wrong like Costard, and Alicia Silverstone, who runs Shakespeare's language with all the authority of a teenage girl, who is reading the script in her middle school, English classes. <br /> <br /> Production of high school production of musical numbers "sea dames" is efficiently, while singing and dancing while singing and shows amateur and amateur, the only exception is Adrian Lester who is himself a wonderful song and dancer. The other solo composer of the film, Notscha McLean and Emily Montimer, has contributed to the eye eye, but they have done better performance than this picture and you can check out some other titles in their movie and it's a pass of stupid mess.
