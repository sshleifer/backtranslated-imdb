I would say hate this movie. I do not want to say because Gerard Butler is in it. Almost half of the annoying conversations, who really care about the plot, I started fast-forwarding in Gary's view. I do not really know the end, I was annoyed with that. If Gary does not have it, maybe I've done two things: have either fallen asleep or stopped it, but Gary is the bright light of this film, because she's with her previous movie. If you are a fan of Gary, do not worry that he is always adorable and valuable, but if you really want to see the film for the plot, then luckily you will need it, then keep that coffee or plenty of coffee or soda awake! <br /> <br /> 4/10 ... And that's why Gary's ideas were conceived in this film, although the director had no idea of ​​making his name!
