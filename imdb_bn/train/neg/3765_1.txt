I was always interested in something about Bigfoot, so when I was roaming home watching movies, I was caught in my eyes. I spent a total of 4.50 dollars and I want my money back! Please do not waste your money on this !! This is one of the cheapest movies I've ever seen. The whole movie was so annoying and I was rolling in my own eyes and I did not even see everything through it. I just got annoyed with it. The acting was terrible, the effect was terrible, everything was really really bad and tasteless. It all adds up to be a really bad, annoying movie and total waste of time and money. I hope that one day they will make a good film about Saskatcheck, but still, I have to sit through an amazingly cheap dog, which can find out the real masterpiece.
