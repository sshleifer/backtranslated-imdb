Encouraged by positive comments about this movie here I was looking forward to seeing this picture. The worst mistake I've seen in the 950+ movie and it's really the worst of them - it's terrible in almost all ways: editing, pacing, story, acting, 'soundtrack' (the only song in the film - a lam country tune - not less than four times). The film looks cheaper and nasty and is extremely annoying. Very rarely I was so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /> <br /> The only thing that prevented me from giving 1-score to Harvey Keitel - although it is far beyond his best performance, he seems to have at least one attempt at least. One for Keitel obsessives only.
