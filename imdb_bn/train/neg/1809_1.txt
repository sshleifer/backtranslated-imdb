I do not hate myself more than congratulating myself. Kevin Smith is capable of blurting his toes because he inspires everyone to inspire the white middle-class winnower why they can not get laid. I really do not mind the inexperience and low budget productions but while writing this obvious and cloying really burns my potatoes. The meaning of this can go to the real struggling filmmaker, who actually has an opportunity like John Gulzar. If you look at the project Greenlight, you will immediately identify a gifted visionary who is fighting against the system. Anybody can grab a camera and make a conversation picture that really does not handle something to say. When will we protect the world from Smithnets and Wadenet? The revolution can not come very soon. Find out a real first-time effort by buying Desperado or finding friends with benefits. Thank you and happy day
