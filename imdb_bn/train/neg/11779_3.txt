I dislike much of this movie. If you read books of Puja, or at least two first movies (especially the first), you will agree with me very closely. <br /> <br /> Compared to Corleone's song, through Pujo's novel, the script of this movie is sometimes ridiculous. The characters and relationships between them are distorted. The story can not reach the end somewhere, even though it remains in some aspects during the movie. It is understood that in the 90's decade Corleone should expect several times for the song, and we will not go find the way they were before. But, on the other hand, I do not know why they had copied some conversations in other movies, when they were not suitable. Why is that? It sounds like bad stuff that only tries to copy the attributes of the original film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> A person, directed by pieces like Apocalypse Now and Goudfather, has to apologize for what he does in the movie as long as he does not die. So Al Pasino, he is to be an actor. But Mario Puzo was not supposed to write this. How? He damaged all previous work. What a shame, my friend. Puja's novel "The Last Don" is about 90's story, and it's cool. We can not say the same thing about the plot for Godfather III.
