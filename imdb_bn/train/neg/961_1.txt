Silly, simple and small, music cragie (Volume 1: A woman from Nohhar) does not go anywhere. <br /> <br /> This short (more than just over 60 minutes) story is not inspired by the classic spaghetti Westerns, but it is brought to Sam Reymie's The Kick and the Dead (acknowledging the devotion of his Spaghetti Westerns) to a transformed contemporary setting. Between fast and dead, the character of Sharon Stone tried to take revenge against the shocking Sheriff (played by Jean Hackman), when he was an urchin, he set up the fate of his father (a short camera from Gary Sinai); He accidentally shot him through the head. The song Krazy, Saki (played by Chytan Rikko Yenkurara) tries to take revenge against Mr Tojo (played by a short appeal by Shangry TÃ¼rmu), who had the fate of his father when he was an urchin; Let him slip off his feet, and the favorite Ole pulled the father and was quartered by a semi truck. The only significant difference despite the settings, Tajo hates Saki, sadly? Well, if you decide to see it, I will not loot it for you. <br /> <br /> small, saki ?? Pale Emery of Clint Eastwood's 'Man with No Name'? Entered the city ?? Basically, there is an automatic shop and a tavern along with an American military base, so I guess enough for a town ?? Contaminated by Tajo, the local criminal did not laughingly explain or investigate the reasons with high value on his mind. As a monster acknowledges his true self as a hunter, Sakki drives a local gunman at the shootouts, whose dance skills carry more than compatibility with Johnny Tew and John Woorke's work. Of course, Saqi has endured torture in the right hands of bad boys at the end of the movie, but he grew up on that occasion ?? On his knees, an amazing ending of a wonderful ending ?? And conquer all his enemies with a rocket launcher. <br /> <br /> Do not ask where the rocket launcher gets. Just see it for yourself. Try to laugh. <br /> <br /> Image quality average for DVD release. Different sequences have a grainy quality, but, all in all, this is not a bad transfer. Imagine the quality of sound gives a little bit, but, again, it is not a bad transfer. <br /> <br /> Instead, it's a bad film.
