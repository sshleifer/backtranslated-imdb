The only real highlight of the movie is the death of the sniveling person and the surviving characters respond to it. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, this film was cast with a little bit of Jaws, a very long Rif of Plycead in Lake, and the Alligator, Godzilla (1998). <br /> <br /> As the film's horror film genre of 1990s, two non-acting women each take off their clothes at least once. She does not lead the lead because she is probably a good agent. <br /> <br /> The whole movie surrounds the filming of a mobile game called Blood Surfing, where the surfers cut themselves and surf the shark-infected water. In this picture, there may be a giant salt-water crocodile in the area. People are eating. The movie is over. <br /> <br /> I do not think of a bad movie, but I really hate a bad bad movie, which of course is it.
