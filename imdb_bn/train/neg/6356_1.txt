If I accidentally stumbled across this script in the form of the form I would read it and probably laugh. However, I will not laugh at the point where the director wants to laugh at me. Although I'm still not sure where these are. Woody Allen, I do not have any differences, this writer can not write dialogue, or at least he can not write intelligently dialogue, even the comedians can also act as the actors capable of drawing laughter from the lizard. For example: <br /> <br /> (Paraphase) "I'm an art artist, I want to get a job in the art gallery." <br /> <br /> It's really, but really, you know of any art historians who say it? How would you answer? <br /> <br /> "Actually an art gallery?" Who thought it? <br /> <br /> The whole script is covered with a kind of merit-intellectualism which I did not expect. As an honorable character from the author, I admit that I have no knowledge about Alan's other work and I do not want to start learning. Character is cruel without exception, an example that we have to all human conditions Ogadakhala, or really, really poor writing letters? You wake judge.
