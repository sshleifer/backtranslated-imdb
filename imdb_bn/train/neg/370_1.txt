Empty check is easily one of Ninety One of the worst movies. The plot is completely pointless; Its overtones of loneliness are unfortunate. Do you really believe as a twelve year old actor as a worldwide assistant, that everything can be done in this movie, just like buying a palace for just $ 300 Grand. The ideas, leaving only the door-basement price, will be believed only by the most important visitors. Please, respect your intelligence and do not see this horror, terrible film.
