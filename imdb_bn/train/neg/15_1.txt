This is That's it. This is the worst movie ever made. Ever. It beats everything I have not seen bad Revoke the trophy and give it to these people ... There is no comparison. <br /> <br /> After three days of watching it (why I still do not know for some reason) I can not believe how insane this film was horrific. It's too bad. From a story that can be considered as a movie, a story or what should ever be made and brought to us. <br /> <br /> It has asked me whether the person really keeps on this world or not. It makes me feel as a species of this universe and hate with our progress. This kind of cinema earnestly gives us pain like ours. We will be ashamed I can not emphasize on our global responsibility, such as resident and industrial construction, it will have to withstand the serious distortion of our reality for ourselves. This is an embarrassing one. I do not know any actor, writer, or director of this movie who sleeps at night knows that they have a role to "load". I do not know what kind of monstrous monsters they enjoy watching this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> That says, I like the good "bad" movie. I love shark attack 3, i love bad taste, they mute I ask all their friends to show them because they are "bad" <br /> <br /> But this ........ has exceeded the "bad" line in a whole new level. This painful is bad. It's such a bad thing where you're going to happen everything, each line, each step, each death, each order before they know what; And just like never before, I think it's like to see the first 5 minutes, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Impact" of each sugar is used repeatedly. I do not really want to see the "shaky" camera "drug buzz rush" effect or jump or swim or sometimes never cut any fanny. It is magically annoying, repetitive, and just tortures the audience. <br /> <br /> But let me specify here, the most depressing thing about this film is that the production is given, it appears that some decent decent amount is actually done in this emission . I would personally put him on the shoulder, if I saw him and gathered him, he ran towards the house and I would do this for him if he wanted to drain the melting water. <br /> <br /> <br /> If we ever require our inhuman torture for our war detainees abroad, then only continue to show this movie in the padded room. Believe me, I think they will become even more desperate in this 72-minute process of suicide. <br /> <br /> Close these movies, they are the most cruel in all aspects of our society. Please Close. now.
