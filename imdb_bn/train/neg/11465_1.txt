Without any doubt, this is actually the worst picture I ever see - a flicker that you choose from outside the frustration in the mall during the Christmas holidays when you missed the start time for some good but still set on watching a movie that was dead! And in the same way I have come to see this packing bomb ... <br /> <br /> I still smell this cyclone which can create this story line in the distance of a good part of three decades. Incredible plot - that a killer whales carry angry against a person who is not of the sea - ridiculous. And that's all except the "love theme" outside of a complete story that plays on the end of a film without a love story. At least Charlotte Rampoling is beautiful (a bi-dimensional role) but Richard Harris just has visibility chews up. He was not a Captain Queen (Robert Shaw) and it is not a "Goss". Regardless, I mostly excluded it from the heart and when I ran it across the television air, I immediately went away. "Dangers, Will Robinson!" See the current TV. Commercial showing a husband and wife whale showing ("Orca - I love Orca ...") - At least it is more than sixty seconds. This flick represents 92 minutes of my life which I will never get back to.
