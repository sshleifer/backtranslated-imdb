This film is thought to be really good, some of the plot material is taken from the hierarchy of the scientists. And Dolf always borrowed some delicious appeal in his role. But nobody dropped this ball somewhere. <br /> <br /> To restore a key to a pothole kicked a monk (!) who travels to New York, which opens a door under his monastery which has captured the Antichrist for 2000 years. He is a small war, of course a soul which jumps with the body jump from the body of the body as hidden and Jason goes well. Minion, naturally, wants the key so it can out of the Antichrist. Along with the journey, an annoying female archaeologist, and together, she and Dolf are followed by small body. <br /> <br /> If I make this sound entertaining, forget it. Panning is very unpredictable and lazy, best-acting subpar, and battle scenes are badly managed. Dolph went to sleep through his role and spouted some of his worst career dialogues. <br /> <br /> While fighting a machine-gun force in the hands of minen beggars at the time of mine, the cheese factor is really over. The rest of this flicker is a snackfest. <br /> <br /> Very bad, I really wanted to like it.
