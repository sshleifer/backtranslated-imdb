"Custom of Mestress" served as the agent of the London branch of Interpol Bureau 17 in Celeste, (I think) Specialists among the undercover criminals Destiny's eyes are in her hands, good in her hands, if anyone else gets it, but dangerous. <br /> <br /> 17 One Hydhen of California (no relation to Dr. Jakeel) has caught a devil from California LAPD's spy Lucky Lottz is going to England to bring him back to England. Before Lutz, related to the science of the occult film, Steveny Biton was played before 9th Witchcraft. In the 7th part, Lutz played another female; At the age of 6, Lutz is a man! <br /> <br /> The 9th part of Lotus was not too big, but he is one of the main stars. Although he has left behind his high heels and little scratts, he still has the top of it released. And this time she has naked and sex scenes. Beaton's role is quite interesting. <br /> <br /> As usual, there are a lot of sex scenes. An anonymous clubpower has a deadly threesome with two vampires, Satan and the head vampires find it with some knot, Lutz finds an English grip, and loves Celeste and her boyfriend. The main recurring character of <br /> <br />, the Witchcraft series, Will Spanner, does not appear in it, although Lootz has mentioned him in the conversation of the bureau 17 agent Dixon in the vampires. He also called his partner Detective Garner (Part 6, 7, and 9), although we can not hear the end of his conversation. <br /> <br /> Highway is spread by fishermen by a team of vampires led by Reven. For Walpurgis, there is something with a god named Morsheba (I think). The Highway delivers all its lines in a very flat manner, when Renay overacts on a camp's degree. Horror dancers in battle scenes <br /> <br /> The movie's audio was recorded poorly, and badly edited. In addition, some dialogues are lost by highlighting the music or the cirrents. Cinematography is not great. Setting up films and shooting actually in the United States, it was a bit of an innovation, at least for this series. <br /> <br /> Welledie Cooper is very good as Celeste; Interesting, of course, but more importantly, he is also the best actor in the film (despite witchcraft scenes). I was surprised that his photo is so small. If ever there is a witchcraft XIV, and I will bet, even if they mean to fly in California means that they will bring him back! <br /> <br /> Witch X is available in its own or DVD, Astronomy XI and Hutter Than Hell Collection, with two unrelated films.
