I just saw this movie, and I want to say that it was a big time wastage. The girl can not do all the work while playing Eva (Allen Fjaestad). He reads his lines very naturally, and through the whole film he had a very unusual facial expression. On the other hand, Petra plays a natural, Rosanna Munter is a natural. He played his part with great perfection. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS! The story was simple - we saw it a long time ago, long ago. He breaks, he finds another, he gets jealous, he breaks with another girl and they end up ending at the end. There was no surprise, some knew that Eva would fall, and Adam would "hook up" with Petra. Nobody is coming that the only one to go after Eve at the Petra Adam Party. He became very serious, which was not seen by Patrar before the audience, and asked him to win back Eva's heart, which was really clever. <br /> <br /> Besides Rosna Munter, there is no <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
