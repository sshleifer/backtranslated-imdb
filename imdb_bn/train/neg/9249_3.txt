While watching the film, I'm not sure how hard it was. The author should not direct his work and even there is a reason why it should not work, you can not do it all. I was really hurt in this picture by seeing the director wearing so many hats. Mrs. MacAtere picture. To add to his amazing talent, I was involved in why I was doing this painting of this woman. Here is a British actress who can do anything. In my view, the conflict creates a drama and a great story. I felt that this film has that. Everything was a bit easier for letters, but there were no restrictions on what the vendors wanted. Watch the movie for a smash, but the most for Mrs McTar's bright performance.
