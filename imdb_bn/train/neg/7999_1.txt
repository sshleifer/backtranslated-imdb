I have seen sometimes in my worst movies in this life. I leave it for an hour to see it and regretted that many hours. Acting is awesome and almost no plot. My guess is that an animal came up with a strange shape and started to make a story around it. Some ideas of movies like Resident Evil and Alliance are not as a result of a movie like them. If it's going to be a top Korean movie, I would not even be bothered to see the Korean movie trailer ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is essentially a high rating means. I think every Korean who has rated this movie above 8 on the Internet for online gaming, although there is no source for this.
