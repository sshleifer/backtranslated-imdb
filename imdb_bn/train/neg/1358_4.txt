Do not mix the word "Swedish" and "action movie". That clause became more and more obvious with each effort made. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Las Brunel (Shanti Roni) works with a top secret computer system on a military aircraft base. One day foreign criminals are threatening to hurt his family if they do not do what they say. They want secret tools and do something to get it. <br /> <br /> There are ups and downs of this movie. And generally there is no "compromise" in Swedish action movies, only "downs". So I guess this movie showed some things. To start with a positive comment, I can mention that the film was technically well-formed. Flying aircrafts and helicopter footage are good shots and look very nice. Acting is very different quality. Shanti Ranani creates a decent performance, when Maria Bonnie is as tough as normal and irrelevant (I think how long the Swedish director continues to use despite her performance skills?). Stefan Sauk may be laughing as a "cool" special force who laugh laughing <br /> <br /> What other scenes? Well, I said above the plane scene and the helicopter flying scene. But there is not much work to talk about that as well. And this is a common problem with Swedish action films. Not just enough action is going on. Maybe it's a budget problem, perhaps it's the film-making culture. I do not know, but it negatively impacts the experience. Because it is absolutely true, story and acting are not good enough for this movie. <br /> <br /> I have rated this 4/10 to try.
