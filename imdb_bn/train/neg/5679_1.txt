I was so annoyed by the original footage at the beginning of the film that I felt sick in my stomach and closed the film. How can this film give me a rating of 1 o'clock more than a rating? I know that the intention of the movie is in jeopardy, but the actual footage of the dog has been shown which has been alive (I have retained the type of reverse) - please! I closed off after the scene with the decomposing baby. I had covered my eyes that most of the time up to that point. This image was not found in HMV outgoing bine. I do not want to see any other movie by this woo person. Anyone enjoyed this therapy requirement. Duration
