How can you collect this respectful shield of young British actors and come up with such a heap of filmmaker rows? Terrible scripts, annoying hacker cameras, widely edited, played badly. Just tried to fill his role with the life of Rhys Ifans. Another painful evidence that "different" is sometimes equal to "drake". Why money people fail to read the script before? Make a favor on your behalf: Free yourself and do something else - hit the knee with your knees. It's less fascinating and more fun than this movie!
