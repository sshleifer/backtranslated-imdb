An avvent-garde night, there is a very low budget "film" which delivers greatness. Sit through hard. I get the message that child abuse is wrong Wow big revelation. There was no formula I was wrong before I see it. Yes that annoying Do not see this "film" if you are offended by male or female sex nudity. Do not see it if you squeamish at least bits. Do not see it if you care about acting. <br /> <br /> My degree: D- <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> DVD Extra: Interview with Christie Bourscock, Deleted Scenes, Movie Stills, Director's Commentary, 2 versions of Teaser Trailer, The AZoic Music Video, and Classroom Video Test
