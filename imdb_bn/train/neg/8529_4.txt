What was the warmth in the MGM that it is a good idea to move to Stanley Clark Gabell playing the role of the Salvation Army activist ?? Surprisingly enough, another handsome future star, Kary Grant, just two years later the Salvation Army played the man, he was very rowdy as Shah. I think it's easy to see these roles in the dark, but I still wonder that WHO thought that the Salvation Army boys could "watch" the boys and look at these horrible men and see the parts they played as their real presentations. Long ago, I used to work for a sister organization of the Salvation Army (I volunteer) and I did not see any of the study boys working there (and included me unfortunately). Maybe I'll get a job with the Salvation Army! So, for a very strange, it is a good movie to watch, but for others, it is made for a very slow film of poor writing, muddy conversation and moralizing boring.
