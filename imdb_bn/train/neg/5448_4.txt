Doris Day does not let him get any bad script. Even the most tried situations give 100% of the day and usually come out unscathed. This comedy is perhaps inspired by the real life of New York City Blackout in 1965, adapted from the French play of Claude Magn√©or's French drama, Doris does little to do, but destroys her own lady image.
