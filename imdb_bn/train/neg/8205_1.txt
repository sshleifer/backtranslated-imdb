Very bad acting, and a very shallow story. Not even a suitable movie B-movie <br /> <br /> The events which made people frustrated by the people who were dragged on the shore were disappointing and very hairy. <br /> <br /> This is the worst I've ever seen in sci-fi. I 5.0 they saw and decided to look at it since I liked this section, but it looks so bad. <br /> <br /> Now Alien has really very good movies, I think because most of them are less budgeted <br /> <br /> I give him 3/10
