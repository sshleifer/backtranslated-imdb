I saw the Canadian videotip of this movie as "The Witching" which is in no way going to New York State. The audio was bad, I had to increase it to 7/8 to hear it, and the soundtrack was often making the dialog worse. Orson Wells is worse than usual, bad and some of its conversations and others have been run by an echo chamber. His ghost was distorted by a ghostly person who kept reappearing. Some close captions really helped! <br /> <br /> A group of sorcerers or satanists (the last credit group that does not represent any real group!) have a glee in which they get nude and abortion because of stubbing a doll. Abortion and her husband moved to a town called "Lilith", where they were given jobs in toy factories. Apparently "The Toy Factory" is not seen in spite of the units of this film, and it is only occasionally mentioned. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ His new chief, Mr. Kato, wanted to know about his religious endeavors. He runs aggressively, and because the other car is off the road and blow up. After the police arrived, he took a doll from the car, the film's second hand of many handmade dolls. <br /> <br /> it's m. Kateo turns and all the people drown, and do they cause her abortion, even though she does not realize it. They want him because he has a neutral talent for his inferiority, in which he was not really aware. Some pictures on the film have some effects, but the whole film is not very involved. The film seems to be a mess, and it is basically no doubt because it is re-assembled and adding new footage. According to the last credit, the original version is Neckomancy - Life for a Life. The DVD's magic lets us see both versions of a disc, but it is probably not a priority to republish this movie.
