(Sincerely, Barbara, I know it's you who are clapping in my review of "NO" 22 times ?? How many people have to give instructions to help you? Do not do anything good for you, like seeing yourself in the mirror throughout the day? /> <br /> Steven Spielberg has repeatedly said that this is the best movie I've seen since "Citizen Kane", which is mostly called it - and works as a terrible warning! <br /> <b r /> What is the element of cinematic disaster of a sure fire and which will frustrate you, will not you forget the tears of laughter and the pain? Elements: Barbara Streisand's face, a musical instrument, feminism, Barbara Streissand's voice, Barbara Streisand's instruction, and an exaggerated / stupid <br /> <br /> Hollywood is full. In fact, almost everyone ?? Be an egomaniac. How could anyone want to work? "Art" for ?! Well, if you pay attention to them was stupid enough to believe it says ready to interview and streisanda their greatest pride ??! It's quite an achievement. Narcissistic be surrounded by cretins, and yet to manage them all ?? O of non-SM-fold. <br /> <br /> <br /> Like his movie "Alone", a hell out of hell is straight. Each view of Streisand is automatically destroyed. Dead But that was not enough, he sing the whole bunch of Streisandy songs ?? You know, such killings of Maria Carey, Selen Dianes and Whitney Houston of this world have been able to poison our valuable wind waves for decades. Not only that, the episodes in 100 South Park make him fun. <br /> <br /> Prices, Streisand dressed as a man dressed as a rabbi, sounds like a Johnny jazz comedy It is a clear problem in addition to a clutch, does Straussand look like a woman or does she look like a man? Actually, I'm not sure that the man. She shows this movie, well ?? It can not be described in words. E.T. Comparison looks like a high school jock. In 2015 he saw more tribes than Michael Jackson. He looks cool <br /> <br /> song They make fun of me. Especially "Dad, do you hear me squirrels like an egg-shaped female walner?" And "Tomorrow I'll prepare a sequel, YENTL 2: bit return". <br /> <br /> Do you know that Streisand could consider having a nose job first in his career, but changing his mind when he told him to change his voice? What can you believe She should do it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What should be retired by Barbara Streisand? Click "Yes" or "No".
