It may have been made for hell, but for most years I saw the worst movie, the best thing about the whole DVD is !!! I am surprised that people took time to do so objectionable and still spend money on it, I am glad that I only paid. I think the original fans of this movie are probably unfortunate and hope to take care of Gothic about any CGI or any other impact, I hope learn to make a good film about Alex Chaden Lite and SFX. In the future, that, if he is still in work. <br /> <br /> Notes to buyers are very frustrating, do not buy it !!!!!
