Star Ratings: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> The American army has just launched a new stealth fighter plane Unlike avoiding detection. A rebuilding pilot (Steve Tucent) stole it and smuggled it to liberate the United States. So he was forced to send his best John John (Siegel, who?) To detain him, he was forced to remove his mind from all the abusive information that he wanted to remove in exchange for his freedom in exchange for years. . <br /> <br /> I dropped the force of attack because I could say from the cover and the robbery that happened in all the post posts will become frustrating and when I think all the negative reviews and fewer user ratings are inserted then I will be sure. But I decided to give the FOF because Shadow Man (by the same director) was not bad and what was, Segal was once my favorite action star and probably, maybe he could make a great movie again. Oh, I was a fool ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This terrible European lancer action movie and its next movie Prince of Pistols' Theater May mark the return mark. Hell, he did it earlier and Stallone would be driven to do it before. (Rocky Bulbo) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not a cruise flight. It's not a flight of fun. It's a flight that even off the ground and fails. *
