This is not one of the best movies of Arabakol or Keaton, it is sure. The fatty wife is tired of all her heavy drinks, so she takes her to a sanatorium where a psychiatrist (Keaton) demands guaranteed! Well, once there, Arbuckle accidentally took a thermometer and took it to the surgery. Then, she is following the place about where she meets and a cute girl who wants to escape. Eventually, despite the workers behind them, they escape from any direction that the girl is crazy and Arabakl is soon recovering. However, he became awake and everything had been dreamed after surgery - there was no sexy crazy girl and Doton Keyon was not as likely to dream. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with the picture of humor is. Of course, the mentality of mentally ill people is quite less fun, but in his days it was sure laughs. I smile, too, if the reaction was just something funny! Many strengths and all that FYI - At one time of Chase Sigenation, fatty shows a surprise for a man over 200 pounds (Wow, what is weird?). And, soon after, he went back to a post where the number 5 was only redrawn. As a result, five are now behind the fatty shirts and it's like regular participants. However, the number should appear in the fatty shirt behind, but it comes out in front - a mistake, because they could have realized that the image of the mirror would be 5 in the back.
