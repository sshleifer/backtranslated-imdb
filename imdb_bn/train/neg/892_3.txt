(I will point out this review where the explosive will start.) My dissatisfaction divided: 30% Tone-deafness, 70% lack of writing. <br /> <br /> 30%: I agree with the first commenter's summary about the lack of diversity in story characters and scope. I was surprised that this film has narrowed the narrations of the best people and relationships that it has been living through the cast of Gaspep Girl (it's coming from someone who loves Gossip). Some minority characters have been written in the story but are included in their obligation, when we see gears so clearly under the film, trying to be "diverse" but falling soon <br /> <br /> 70% why everything is small All letters, minor plus a few tokens, one dimensional, are human cardboard cardboard cutouts. Worse, their interaction with each other is recorded in such a manner that for every format of the film, the audience is treated as a "joke": we got a basic feeling, then some of the tricks of a fifth are a twisted yarn. But if we suspend terrorism for a moment, "OK, this is a wonderful event" ... stories are not interesting yet because they are shallow. When you make stories so that they are tired of the unexpected end of their existence, you are writing jokes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> romantic story That's okay But romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. Each of these "romantic" stories has a daughter and a boy who shares the same position at any time and looks at each other. Sound exchange, ideas are projected through voice-over, but they also only communicate with viewers that only one person is attracted to others. <br /> <br /> There is no conflict or conflict with the contradiction of trying to adjust their existence to mean no temptation (in a broad sense), no tension, and other two minds. The only story involving the only "temptation" is that the audience is surprised that the person (Ethan Huq) bothers with the girl who is hurt, who suddenly becomes a hooker. Of course, his words seem attractive to him while trying to take him away, and we are surprised if we are beside him, but there is no content in this story beyond "ABB". So it is published, if some other story like "poster" like "posting" goes to "publish": a then B - this is the only thing that can happen in this "set" of Manhattan. However, we only see the Brooklyn Connie Island sketch; A train ride flown by a character traveling only in the Queens West. <br /> <br /> It is easy to choose which films play in race, sex, sexual orientation, Soon _ New York, I love you, but it's worth the hard work because of the title. We hope to see the real New York and the real New Yorkers, but instead we have parade in front of our demographic selected slice, its characters have flew from the OC, and some others make it as SEEM, as we pay attention to diversity. But when we look closely at those characters, then they are attracted to the concept of complete diversity, and these nations and cultures fail to represent shamefully. <br /> <br /> For example, the Latino man with little white girl in the park, who mistook two women as his monkey (male grandmother) when he was actually a father. Although the last scene of this section was unnecessary from the point of view of a dramatic creation, (despite the fact that mother and boyfriend / daughter pushed away the girl, it was a lot more fun), it is a really annoying scene where we are sure that our father will have to tell us Latino That she is a sexually danced Can not Dad be a few people from South America? Now he is obviously hot, is the audience ready to accept that there is a white white girl from her? Is that naive as we need? Just as Mexican construction workers will obviously become obscure. <br /> <br /> It is not my place to decide where this movie should go. But in every imaginable set-up and plot twist, the direction that has been taken is suddenly screaming, appeals for security. These stories can become more interesting, even if we are forced to maintain the single dimension of the letters resident, even without selecting from at least standard and clear stereotypes. The Asian girl living in Chinatown has given Scregade to the old white man? Instead of pursuing a white college kid how to bout an Asian cougar Again, I'm not saying that the whole pride will change. It's just that every one. Damn Story premises. So Hackneynids - and thus fail to express something about why they can love New York love. The original way to improve the film is to write a written text. <br /> <br /> I am glad of the soundtrack, good pacing of the film (even if it had been read, well, dreage), and the view is very common. The film was okay to sit, and I could not stop anyone like this. However, it is said that the most notable respect in terms of irrelevance is when the old opera singer says (feeling impaired) "What I like about New York is: Everyone is from a different place." Well, you do not have to know it from watching one of these.
