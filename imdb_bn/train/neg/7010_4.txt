I'm not worried about anyone, but I do. This picture is historic for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes from two great seventeen sci-fi films. Well, one is great, and one is quite bad. The great one is really great, actually it's good. Bad one is really bad, in fact it's the worst. I certainly mention "Star Wars" and his star Mark Hammel, the lawyer "Luke Skywalker", the hero of this movie who switches his vault and then goes to Vegas (a lead) and the protagonist of this movie. After a complete many events, finally it recovers. (Since he seems to be fixing the car, you might call him "Lub Skywalker"). He met a hooker with the heart of gold and played it in the role of comedian Chem Milford, the protagonist of the film "Laserblast", which I previously indicated, the worst ever made Sci-Fi film ever made. Milford-led actress Hamill must steal his car. I understand that someone is not interested in this meeting at these two civilized meetings, but I do. And I must say that this is one of the best / worst movies of all time. Mark Hamille needs to apply force to the acting, the plot needs to be expanded to JD training, and Hooker's character, directed by Annie Potts, can always be the most annoying character in any film. But it's a fun movie that is too late at weekends or weekends. It is a film that combines, to find something but to find it out, and at the same time, its sole purpose, like free form jazz, is only available. And do it. And that's not cool, but you can not say it's not entertaining, because you can tear it for half an hour but you will not feel cheated. So relax your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddled wax without any expectation, and the ball can always be with you.
