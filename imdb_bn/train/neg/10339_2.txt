How did Mike Hammer live - a large screen cathode ray tube TV in a panthouse with a golf bug, and a snapshot of the fireplace was placed in the corner? Nah, he threw a bottle of Rai and pushed the resting person to his fly-sized office on the sofa or floor, or LC entered the flop house, removing dry red cast and oil dirt from his mouth. , That's how. Spillane wrote the trash paperbacks, sure, but how do you make it worse? Give some frustrating skimming producers a blank check because they think that a movie will sell silent titled box in the box office, add some hot summer tomatoes and generally a bit annoying screen writer screw-up the storyline, how that!
