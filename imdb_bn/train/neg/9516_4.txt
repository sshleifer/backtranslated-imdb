Frank Sinatra is a no-Goodian ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hardworking and hardworking, who returned to his Midwestern Ground and reunited with his perverted brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the city fights big with the disrespected wife. Head girl. Frank Jamila, who is involved with Dean Martin, kisses the uneducated Shirley McLain, and has some run-in with the law, but write what she really wants to do and write with a good woman. The role of McLain's over-simplified play in sub-operas is growing, which is driven by 'colorful' and embarrassingly sensitive (its next drunken belting "Fif You You Gone", with the brightness of the film, and efficiently). Director Vincent Mainleei focuses on direct surveillance fashion, but he surprisingly displays glowing spirits and most of the large scenes are flat or dense. The film looks incredibly handsome on the widescreen, with a beautiful eye for detail and compilation, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** **** to
