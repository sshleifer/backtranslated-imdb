For me, this movie just seems to fall on his face. The main problem for me was the casting of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know whether it is bigger than type-casting or simply its inconsistency, but I suspect that Glover could ever represent a credible villain. She is a good guy, and her performance is always obvious that. In addition to the film, the film is your serial killer story. Nothing is very innovative.
