Just a warning ... I saw the worst movie in the year ... I did not see it in the end ... it's a pure waste! I'm sorry for snipes, such as a movie up. There really is not much to say about it. Awesome acting, incredibly bad lines, stories, everything. The only reason to suggest you to watch this movie is if you really want to see what a movie should not be. Just to tell you a scene: Police are searching for snipes, and they are surrounded by buildings with helicopters and cars, they are shooting inside the building, but they are still sitting so that snippets do not have any doubt.
