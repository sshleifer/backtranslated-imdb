I admit, I had to go ahead with this badly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes - nothing was happening, and everyone had already described the "plot". But someone mentioned the opening scene - a slaughterhouse is stolen with a wig and it is stolen in grass in the grass! I'm guessing it's bratty kid, it does not explain. Truly open the trippie. <br /> <br /> I want it to be a good writing or thought film, because if we are beautiful and stupid and have a movie that is not a "cute" movie it's a badly executed movie. <br /> <br /> I want to see a clean up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if I want to see it. Otherwise, this is a weird little film that is best for fast-forward!
