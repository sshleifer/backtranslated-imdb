Another rape in the history <br /> <br /> This movie is a disaster; It uses only a historical story and creates sweet love stories about poor performance and low budget production. <br /> <br /> The movie should be 1/3 time, they have taken time to create mini series. <br /> <br /> War scenes are so stupid and unreasonable, fooling vendors, wearing a disaster. The Romans had good battles in the open areas, when one of their soldiers tried to fight in the forest, the Germans were completely destroyed, in this film the Romans wanted to fight beside the city, I mean, that will be real. <Br /> <br /> and Cleopatra were of Macedonian descent, which means a light-skinned person.
