A film starring Salma Heike and Colin Farrell, two respected and talented actors, is a great idea. An independent film sounds even better The studio will have fewer control over the content that allows actors and writers and directors to have more creativity. <br /> <br /> But why is this movie so beautiful? Ask the dust <br /> <br /> <br /> This image closes the bat which we have invested heavily in characters. Nobody gives the right background, so we never know why the characters do their work. <br /> <br /> If you still have one, interpretations of physical and emotional pressure are left to our imagination. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Can Colleen Faille Save It? "My response:" Colin Farel's ass can not even save it. "
