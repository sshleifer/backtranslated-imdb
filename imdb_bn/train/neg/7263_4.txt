This star-round British / Spanish co-production looks great, you can see it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all have been very much crammed, so it seems that the buildings are communicating with each other. Some films are suffering from pans very badly, and Robert Perry believes that if he was neglected on both sides of the screen occasionally he was so excited with the widescreen process. Another user comments that we first see the whole massacre of a church that is genocide; I do not have any copies. Some of the peasants have been spun off to shoot their rifle fires, a Mexican officer has been shot, celebrated shows and landay, and this is We never know that Shayo has become a priest (if he really is) we do not know what can happen to Don Carlos (Savalas). Although he is suspected to be brought home from house to house as a Kozak star, because his departure seems deliberately. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (mysterious island) famous old English music is dancing around a belt hat in the tradition and in bad cases and with the new Orlans in the hit hit of 1960, here Johnny Horton did not sing, but I heard some songs before. On the plus side, the location is superb, a large old ruined fortress that does not move the escar-style stairs somewhere, with some nice scenery-Robert show Chewing and Stevens, Landau, Lateri and Telly Savalas's best performance by Telly Savalas. I really did not like this picture, but I did not see it at all. I need to find the widescreen version and then make my decision.
