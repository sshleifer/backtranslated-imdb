Really ??? <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised to see the amazing reviews here! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's a big unfortunate, vase, clich√©. I laugh a lot, and many, but there was a date with a former military person. I could not hide my other responses, BOREDOM Yes, I think of my date, a flat line "good old boy", like it. That's not a compliment. I know that an actor wants to work ... fine for others. But Ralph, come on. <br /> <br /> It was a painful dark red from Ralph. I only voted 2 because Ralph looked so stunning. But I must say, how are you, Ralph? And why ?? <br /> <br /> I'm going to sleep and now I'm going to recover! C1
