This is one of the worst movies ever. I like sugar movies but this is simply terrible. Where are the picture pictures of the box? I think more money has been spent on the DVD box than the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Why would a DVD release a company which is so confusing to the cover? I feel like such a donkey for hiring this movie strictly based on the box. As much as I explore the IMDB, I should do a little research before visiting my local video rental store and a list should be made. I have blamed anyone other than myself. I want my money and time back. <br /> <br /> Do not see this image. <br /> <br /> Even curiosity gives you inspiration, instead keep a cocktail umbrella in your eyes. It will be much more enjoyable. You have been warned!
