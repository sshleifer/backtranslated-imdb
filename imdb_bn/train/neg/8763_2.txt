I think I read somewhere that this was the last monogram, but whether it is true or not, because it should not have been. It's a deadly lazy thing that played with some gray-haired John Cardenas and showed himself as an old scientist, who is experimenting with the help of his young guardian (Robert Cheyenne) to bring the dead young man back. Each time their issues are resurrected, they feel like a marble-like white face because they are bound to the laboratory table (big deal). Caradine manages to bring her faithful dog back to life after death, and Monte receives unusual ability to walk through walls in a ghostly fashion (wooooooohhhh). He wrote about all that is about. <br /> <br /> For a hugely cheap monogram Quickie, at least this allocation actually uses more fancy-schmancy lab setup than usual. The most amusing current joke on the film is that the "old" doctor, Caradine, constantly mentions her "young" assistant Shayne as "Bobby", in fact, Cardman was actually 40 and Shayne was 45 when they made it!
