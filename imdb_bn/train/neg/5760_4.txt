Well ... I waited for this video to watch, and I wanted to, I really got 2 cable scary movies in the second day, and it liked me more, that I was in CRANA Airplane ... I mean if I'm flying If you like any other Leslie Nielsen car, then you probably will be in heaven, but if you are usually used in Waynes, you'll be dissapointed, there was more to this. Haramonake which will see young, young adult children will be happy, perhaps it was a box office because it was the first week. I've enjoyed terrible movie 2, then this quadrangle, and the part is 5 times more. Curious that the better part of the 3rd part is the second part, but then again I make Halloween 2 better as well ... okay. The most interesting part of the film is the way to get rid of Alien. But that's not the 11 dollar cost I spent with my fianc√© to catch a matinee. Save your cash until it's released on the video tap and then hold the part 2 again, and then hire it, do not buy it.
