When I was five years old, trying to obsess this movie; I have not been the same since. The "movie", despite its colorful appearance, is not for the people, not especially the children, with frozen drug-induced images protesting the general dispersion of the general disruption of your average sanctuary. <br /> <br /> It starts out and innocently enough out with a poor boy putting his head through (destroying for him) by destroying his classmates' drum; Yes, putting her head through it. But do not be afraid, my friends! She is very consoled by her chirping flute, which is quite weird, I will give you, but still acceptable. Then <br />: The movie wizard of Oz and where wild things morphs in a combination, but these two books lose all the "warm and vague" aspects. So <br/> <br /> <br /> Barney's friendship with this poor boy relative to seven feet of pounds, and depressed him even deeper. << br /> <br /> And, to add a tasty array of terrible themes, a drunk boat, an earlier parent's horse and a friend of the big crew of the doped-up "dragon", Mahmood has been added to the mix. <<br /> <br /> The most comforting figure in this chaos is that of Villen, the exact creator "Wikipedia" (?). Of course, there is his own problem: Narrow the facial expressions with a clear plastic mask, which can deal with a bromstick whose gas layer always seems to be the lowest in the most unexpected moments. As a result, one of his favorite cultures was the nose-diving of water in the body that separated the Pufnstuf land from its degenerate, decayed habitat (where I liked to live). <Br / <br /> <br /> This movie is awesome ... <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie that has the same effect on its audience, it's for you as Exorcist. Enjoy.
