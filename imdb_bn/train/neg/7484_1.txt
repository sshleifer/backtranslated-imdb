Within 15 minutes, my entire family left the character of the golf haun or left him for Steve Martin's character. In 40 minutes, we turned it off. There are only a few films a year that we become so annoying that we do not have enough long time to establish the story. <br /> <br /> I usually like Steve Martin and Goldie Haun. , And I feel blue white really enjoyed. So I blame Mark Lawrence and Sam Weasman. Combine the author of "Miss Consonant 2" and the author of "Miss Consignment 2", and I guess we end it.
