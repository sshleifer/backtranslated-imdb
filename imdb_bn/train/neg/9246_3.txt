After being publicly released, I refused to see it, mourned the 1960s series with Mir Pratt and Kenneth Cop, collecting memories of memories, but I can never resist any challenge. I should have known better. Most are not rebuilt and parody more than reverence, how this shot can be played is not fully known and pumped with child comedy and cartoon plots and letters. The three main characters were a little more than the actors' caricatures, and could only play Emilia Fox (Bob Maritima's direct role is painful). Supporting Cast was only comedian-known as Victor and Bob's joke and was very much aware of the situation and was aware of the situation. And CGI, although the effects that can be made available 30 years ago can not help to be an improvement, the audience dazzled only with the light and camera work, and the poor quality of the script and dialogue did little visor. All styles and no substances (And the 1960s show was mocked for most of his time, but this 'update' is now more date-wise than 'matrix' style fashion, compulsory 'girl power' scenery, and subtle pressure between two living things.)
