The previous part of the film was rather enjoyable but at the end it became intense. Although Tarururo is an actor, I usually like him, his lugin often portrays a bad rain man's impression and semi-autistic people as a boring antagonist. Overall it seems that if this film tries hard and shows pumps in spite of most fine performance.
