This is a kind of movie that makes me most disappointed. The great cast, the great director, the possibility of a great story, then they destroy it with a scrapple that does not go anywhere ... and there is nothing to say when going there! There is no depth here. No depth of characters, no depth of plot, no depth of mystery, mystery, or common sense. We know what is happening to us, how they plan to solve the problem, they fix the problem, and if we fail to make a doubt, then we are surprised at the end, then they suddenly end the film. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Provides some wonderful bit of humor and warmth. I thought that this movie had a great look ... all shades and fog ... very pictures seem silent. <br /> <br /> While the actors can do well and the directions are enjoyable, it is not enough to recommend spending time watching the film. There are better Glenn Ford movies: Big Hit, Gilda, Trinidad Affair, etc.
