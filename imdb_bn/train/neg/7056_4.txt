This movie is a great example of a very funny trick that can even go very wrongly. I really expect at least something from this movie which looks like it was funny, but the picture was half good. <br /> <br /> The strange part is that jokes are fun, smoking, Joe Bull ... etc are really good jokes, but I do not know that the film will blame the flip. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> To really watch this movie, or to get another copy, every advertisement or teaser of this movie and your butt smile because it is much more fun than film. <br /> <br /> Mahesh Manjrekar, the only storekeeper of this film and the funny Chapu Bhai
