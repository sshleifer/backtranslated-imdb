This video is not atheistic, but it happened in 1994 when they were probably tired due to the whole thing in Britain. It is revenge for Boogeyman's 75%, and for the same reasons - whatever. I was confused at first because I thought that Anne (Kelly Gallindo) might be different from Lacey, but she had no problems with the psychological view of a bogman like the first movie. Fans immediately remember that they are not the same person. <br /> <br /> Seeing a murder in a bathroom and seeing the address, Ani, his psychological and para psychology students are very similar to the person. Cheap romance novels and butter advertisements, home heads, and, of course, the same bathroom. After 24 hours, a murder just described. Of course, we do not have any idea why we are killing this barbaric woman. <br /> <br /> The movie was then transferred to Boogman's story with some additional footage that we did not see at the core. In particular, Boogeyman is shown opposite the original. Sorry, some of the good scenes were cut, but it has 90%. Why reconciliation of this picture? Have they found footage in the trash? What was the purpose? <br /> <br /> We will never know and, despite the mental ai Anir being cured, we all know that the dog will never die.
