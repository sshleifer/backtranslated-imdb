College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Selogenie) Alcrez suffers from nightmare sleeping from home. He dreams of cutting his own hands, spitting a worm, a horse opens his chest and suffers from an open fire. After taking her friends "6 feet" in her bed, a friendly, secretive teacher (Donna Denton) advised her to face Alcrase facing her fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when there is no one to help when things come out of their hands! <br /> <br /> When the team became frustrated, Alex's brother turned Richard (Tom Raley) and killed everyone. . Tony Basil of "Mickey" fame shows as the assistant ghost of Sammy Mitchell, lead singer of the "Bodybuilding" group. He taught how to get Alex out of his body and interact with a rock music dancing with footage of the nightmare to pad the running time. All victims show America as a ghost of advertising like Greffin Dunn in Warhol's America. Script trick is full of plot holes, sticky dialogue and lame efforts. Good FX work and great opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only subject to achieve a talent. Basil and Deo ("Hip It") sing some songs to the soundtrack. <br /> <br /> Score: 2 out of 10
