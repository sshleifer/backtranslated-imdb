Not surprisingly, Pamela Springsteen left acting and became a full time photographer; It's a good idea behind her behind a camera. Although the film is not without its interesting elements (hell, etc.), it is very much by mistake. At the same time, the murder counselor Angela seems like the same kind of campers. An old, more threatening camp director has done a lot for the film. And then you have a murder scene. Most of the budgets were very few to implement them properly (no intention), although someone in the outhouse toilet must be drowned. But overall, there is a ton movie that is one hour and one and a half hours of your life to spend in Square / more fun.
