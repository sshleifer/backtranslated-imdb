Harry Ramese's teenage girlfriend was ripped through the slogan (The Night Walker), Rams became frustrated and consonant herself with sex with some lesbians. Meanwhile, Corte, who took a garment and dresses like a wizard, raped some women. Finally, Rams decides to stop him and end his criminal void. In spite of shooting and harmful embarrassment in the film, it looks like pornographic porn of another 70 and is arbitrarily executed. Rape / abuse scenes have been surprisingly resisted and tries to cash out "Death Wish" is ridiculous. R. Bolla ("Can not Holocaust") is a police game. The cott, who is usually at the top, wigs out in a few scenes, but he behaves very well for my money. This may have been rougher to the roughie.
