After another long chiche of this movie another. First of all, although they have shared them, there is an unauthorized snapshot where John wears such fools. Wigs and accentations are terrible. They are bad bad cartoons then bad. John is depicted as being in abusive Albert Goldman's book, ugly, jealousy, dormitory, Yoko slaves. In regular conversations, they even kept the title of the song "It's Always Both of Us"! John did not mean the money to his fans like this. He was shown something like his death that he was some very nice. A funny scene where a fool beetle fan only recognizes John and tells Paul to sing yesterday. A humiliated person says something like "Sure and when I'm jealous, why do not you kneel, kiss your wife, and stick to my lizin". Let me smile for that day. Interesting funny how it tries to do when really coming off this movie ridiculous. John and Paulo did not sit for posting all day, they were funny people, who broke even more personality during Beatles, then were illustrated here. Forget it
