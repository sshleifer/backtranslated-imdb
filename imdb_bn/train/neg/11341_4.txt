He said "Casanova" had left me cold for the set and nothing more could be added by Bukowski more adequately: <br /> <br /> "Casanova is dead, an old man with a big dog and died. Long tongue and no frustration, saying that he was realistic, I want to say that his spit on his grave can be true, true ladies usually The biggest fool can get, so the human race is standing where it is today: We gave birth to cute and lasting casanova, all open inside, such as Easter Bunnyies we foster on our poor children. "<br /> <br /> As far as I find it I could not have created this position; I did not discuss it; With more sympathy, grant, but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> The Casanova environment is made from degradation and cruel behavior, the theme is more closely related to the filiny "Saturnon". The suicides of the plot are the soft pornography characteristics, not just the suitability; And Donald Sutherland's confusion point is ugly and slimy. <br /> <br /> However, Casanova can be a point as portrayed as a vague idiot.

More than that, he seems like a dirty old man - an intelligent, sure, but whose own feelings are more satisfying than anyone else. I find it hard to imagine the viewers who enjoy this image. It was not worth telling the story.
