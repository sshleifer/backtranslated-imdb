It was made in 2007 and is bad for a movie created in 1998's Cgi. There is a stop motion shot of dinosaur in a section of the movie which looks really good, but it only works very amateur in CGI staff. Bad <br /> <br /> <br /> Writing, acting, direction and everything else in this movie is just terrible. Bad as this, Raptor Island is no worse than 100 million BC ... pure crap! Again, like other movies, the only scary part of this movie was actually created and now it is being circulated in the sci-fi file. <br /> <br /> I still can not understand how they can achieve some acting skills to act in this film, and then anyway they can act as terrible as everyone else in their movie. <br /> <br /> Those who are uncertain of you, their posters must have been ridiculed by their poster ... or one person who has worked in this movie.
