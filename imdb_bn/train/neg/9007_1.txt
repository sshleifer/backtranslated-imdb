This movie is some of the worst shit I've ever seen. When I was watching this movie, I literally got sharp headache on my head. CGI was awful, and the story was a waste of ink. The character of Dean Kahn was Mr. He can not work his helicopter properly, except super-intuitive-e-anne-anti-anti-out. The biggest problem was to work on split screen cameras. I thought, seeing Brady Bach, there were not only individual people in the box, but just close up and opinions of the same thing. I only understand the images that actors really need money, because the movie is not considered worthless to the movie.
