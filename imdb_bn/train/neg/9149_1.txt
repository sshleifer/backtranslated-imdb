There is absolutely nothing in this movie which even shows the smallest scrap of the competition. Nobody has tried to play it before, even the addition of the coffee shop looks like they have been glued to the place. Nothing shows recharges. The film quality is terrible. Most 'action' cameras are held in narrow straps or apartments, which are later compressed into thinking, some cheap cameras retreat and provide their lines as 'actors'. There is no trips and no proper microphone, there is sound quality terrible. Even 'mental' rent was even better, at least they had the right tools. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> You will be looking for a long search to search longer than you find a movie.
