These long-lost thoughts are sometimes available on the web. So I bought a copy. Well, of course acting is terrible and the story line is in childhood but its moment. I think those who have searched for it also know about it. It was created for an extreme low budget by a greenhouse movie owner. But he certainly did not waste money money for me. The make-up is for kind of flick that is. Zombies are watchable and grave characters. The only problem with such movies is Peelikul's quality. It's terrible, thankfully no hes over the word but sometimes it's very dark way. So you will see clearly to see the eagerness. In a fun way, they did not really try to sell it. A voice-over is for a movie and tells you at the beginning of the movie to find a man appearing with a green flash, which tells you that there are grooms. Of course this does not work, I think Kanibal girls, that was the boring bell when the red stuff began to flow. Their main idea was that cannabis girls were created a year ago. Do not go for the story, go for zombies and aim for a continuity wrong. The girl and the guy first love when she takes her bra, then they love and suddenly her underwear comes back ... try to do it, or I'm getting a little offline ... ... eat it ugly body.
