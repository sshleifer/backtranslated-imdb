I have been a fan from his debut album. This picture is a benefit to him. Except performance of Rufus Waynewart and Teddy Thompson is just terrible. <br /> <br /> Those who were Martha WayneWaright, Nick Guev, Anthony, and Jarvis Kakar, were particularly annoying. Even McGarill's sisters were destroyed by the so-called similarity of Martha WayneWaright. <br /> <br /> I have never seen my wife getting up and going out of the house in a movie before and I found myself fast forward to perform some interview segments, which was difficult to show due to poor camera work. <br /> <br /> There are many people who have been able to explain Mr. Cohen's songs, Jennifer Warren, KD Lang, Billy Joel, Haroon Neville and Willie Nelson, but the people selected for this performance were right. <br /> <br /> I hope another attempt to stop Leonard Cohen in the film, which will illustrate his insight, talent and intelligence. <br /> <br /> Very sad
