A woman requests for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hear two ghoulish stories related to both zombie local kinky. But perhaps his luck is somewhat nasty ... <br /> <br /> Zumboni Chronicles is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Indeed I must admit, so bad I was quickly transmitted through most of the garbage. And that was a lot, believe me. It runs for just 69 minutes and still has plenty of fillers. You've got some skinheads pushing a lot, lots of fools kiss-kissing, lots of fools in the scene (that rhythm, hey) and some good examples why some people will not have to act. <br /> <br /> For the title characters, they just have a footnote in the film. Why you get more unwanted action in the role than the previous feature! However, considering the eyes and eyes of the brain (the other 'joy'), perhaps it is a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> And to stop it all, it seems to be portrayed on YouTube's mobile phone for broadcast. Jerky camera-work, scratches on the prints, flickering lights ... When I was rubbed my eyes I was made in 2001, and not 1971. Even the look of clothes and fashion spectrum around three decades! <BR /> <br /> If you think I am not eligible to see the whole movie of Chronicles, then proceed. If you try to sit through it, I will not even have to do it even before you make your excuses and blue-smart colored freaks before leaving. It's really ridiculous that anyone has decided to leave it, and honestly you will enjoy a lot of fun for your drink on the disc rather than torturing your DVD player with this dirty excuse for frustration. In fact, if it packs its bags and pages in the morning, do not be surprised, keep you from watching VHS tapes for the rest of your life. You have been warned ... 0/10 <br /> <br /> p. come. What kind of 18-strong horror woman puts a huge game bra during compulsory sex scene? See, the film can not even get that part correctly ...
