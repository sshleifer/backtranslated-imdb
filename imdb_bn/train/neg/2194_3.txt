Dry courtyard Very unreal What I learned from this movie is that it is not the fastest idea to go to the cabin on the weekend, after all, without the best idea. How easy was the bill I got out of the car without any injury to the bottom of the mountain! Unfortunately, the same can not be called for his daughter. Oh, the police could never find the car or found the owner of the debris. <br /> <br /> A lot of scenes with visual stripe dragged (still have nightmares from that scene). The poor assistant guy and his crummy vain hand. I acknowledge that I was curious to see what was behind the mysterious "things" door, but when it was published, I laughed. HA HA HA !! The girl seemed sadistically angry about being really revived Personally, after an exciting experience that I really like a new body!
