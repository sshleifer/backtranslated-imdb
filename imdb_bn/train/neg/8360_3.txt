What do you like about this movie ??? <br /> <br /> color it! <br /> <br /> <br /> It has some influential water photography! <br /> <br /> has a genre musical score in its background, which works well sometimes! <br /> <br /> So 3 out of 10! <br /> <br /> Sometimes music increases! Especially when sharks or baddies are removed! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it becomes slow! It is time to listen to the audience to be sympathetic! <br /> <br /> <br /> Another dust bite! There are many similarities to "Spaghetti Western"! <br /> <br /> It can not produce the quality of Italianians! The series titled "Octopus" was a series of series from 1 to 7, which was seen on the Australian SBS TV in 1990's mafia-type conflicts! And they were nice! But well, you will not find it here! <br /> <br /> I think it was made in the 1960s! Sadly, it was 20 years old, as evidence of a funeral scene at the end! <br /> <br /> Then there was a rapid shark rage-sharp bite, which is red dirt repeatedly in the blue water! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He was bored of his relentless role even in the absence of many proofs of the development of the plot or somebody's character! <br /> <br /> At least the hero expresses the passing concern for his ex-wife! <br /> <br /> Of course, if music fails to awaken our perception, then there is a terrible word among our unfortunate voices, so that we have to do another dark work! <br /> <br /> At the end someone thought about a twist! Just when we thought it was completely expected! But stay tuned, guys, you can find another twist! If you are closely watching! Your heart is warm, more or less! <br /> <br /> Follow the advice of the hero, and some beers on the way! This will make your "shark night" look more enjoyable! <br /> <br /> Then when you're ready to do something like "007", when it's over, the reality is to come back!
