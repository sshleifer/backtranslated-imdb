Claire Dennis's film seems to fall into two categories: Violent and bloody or calm and intimate. "L'Intrus" definitely falls into the first division, but it is not so awful as "Trouble day" or "Jai Pass Somale". <br /> <br /> From now on, "Chocolate," I've made it a point to see every new movie Dennis makes. And I've always been frustrated. "El Intras" was no exception. She has yet to make a movie as personal and moving as her first one. <br /> <br /> You'll find Dennis regularly many: An old but still fantastic Batris pulse, who simply show her full lips, her tooth, her ample humility, and a couple of nice coats; Black people from "Trouble a Day Day" and "Jai Pas Samil", Gregor Colin and Lithuanian or Russian Girl. Michael Subar's character was fun enough, but the camera inserted it so long that I was bored with a curly swing hanging over his forehead and Korea seems to have ended somewhere in the cut. <br /> <br /> There were some things - terrible killings, a man in search of the boy - and maybe even a plot, but it was not enough for one to see, and the two philosophical questions are, I'm scared. For one, the score was jarring and unauthorized (eg "beu travel"). For others, the seasons have changed very suddenly, even you are becoming more confused about what is happening. Oh, there were some fantastic shots, and if you like "Friday evening" with a shot of heavy drapes and bedsheets, you can appreciate the aesthetic of "El Antas". Otherwise, clean run. <br /> <br /> I have seen this movie in French and it is possible that I missed something important. But there are rarely five pages in the dialogue dialogue, double quotes and ample margins. "Chocolate" is better in silence; "L'Intrus," It's just dull.
