I read all the reviews here after seeing this piece of cinematic rubbish and it does not seem to me to find at least 2 pages that this unexpectedly unreasonable Montage 70s or indeed had no comedic shape in another era! If this is not less funny set of sketch *, then I saw it until it comes. Half Skits have been working (and infinitely good) by works like Monty Python and Woody Allen ... If I used to say that a beautiful part of the animation is in 90 seconds, then this film's highlight is 75 minutes of waste and dissolving It does not come in contact. Seminal Comedy? Only the world where seminal really means semen. Scale humor? Only in a world where scat is actually feces. Prixar joke? Only if we understand the meaning of how this comic book handbook will not do. Tits and bums and weird beaver. Well ... if you are at least one hand free boy and did not find the playboy present. Give it a break because it was at the beginning of the 70's? No way. Sketch Comedy was back at least ten years ago. The only way I could even forgive this picture was if it was on a gun point. Retro? Hardly Sketches on children's disguises in disguise may be overcome in some circles (and it was actually fun), but it is really off as sad. Have you kept me for the whole 75 minutes? Relaxed that they could save a really fun skit for the end. I gave this image 1 because there was no low score ... and I can only recommend to insominic or coma patients ... or perhaps people infected with lokozoa ... their jaws are open in disbelief.
