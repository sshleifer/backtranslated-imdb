There were not really many stories in this movie. It is merely the basis of itself close to the first Lion King movie event. It is supposed to be how Timon and Pumbaa meet through their loneliness. But there is not much more than that. <br /> <br /> This mixes some scenes from the real point, then how it removes it from how the movie changes them. But still, what is it? I was expecting a little more. Instead, it should be shown to me that an empty plot with little explanation <br /> <br /> I think if you want to see another Mirror in Lion King universe then it is. But since the other, it does little justice for animators. Disney really should stop producing this direct-to-video. It was really annoying and could use Jason Statham. "D-"
