The story worth ten minutes spread over two hours. When nothing happened at half point, I should have given up. But, I was always hopeful, I stayed. And left with feeling guilty for the time being wasted. Acting was okay, but story lines are so transparent and weak. The script may be like a lam, but it can, again, extend the ten-minute plot and leaves plenty of room for good conversations.
