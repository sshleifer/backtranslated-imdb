It starts with an attractive premises. I always like civil war material and ancient secret society. The more progress the movie made, the more I realized it was a great movie. Next half, it's a C movie quickly, then D, then F, then "I wish that it does not rent it so I can keep it on the microwave!" I can not say that in all cases acting was horrific, just the most. Writing, but ... I have never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The script was written by a 10-year-old. It was ridiculously shallow, dialogue poking and reluctant, letters about 5 pounds of bags were as interesting as the letters. I really hate this movie, as my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with a film that propagates or supports Christianity. This image has caused a great misconduct. Terrible, terrible, worthless If you like it, I strongly recommend Superman 4.
