So Angela grew up and got therapy and an operation that could bring her back to life as a real-life girl and is waiting for her now - wait for her - Shibir Counselor! How accurate, right? I know, I love it. However, the first episode of the slideway camp franchise follows the rules of Harry Siegel - more blood, more imaginative killings (which is not fantastic, more than the original), more nudity, more broad plot and generally worse than the original. <br /> <br /> It is as entertaining as it is, characters and wordboos are so stupid and so proven 80 that you can not help you smile well. At one point, a man asks Angela, "I'll call you," and then quickly go away. The person himself says, "How can he call me? I do not have a phone!" And then she softens her bumper, how she forgot him (it's hair, baby!). It is a well-known fact that in 80's slash movies, murdered teenagers often are not punished by their murderers for any kind of bad behavior, usually to be very different. When I entered the first horror movies and on Friday I saw 13th movie in the middle of the 9th century, I did not understand. I learned it in a film class after a year or two and was surprised that some of their crazy methods were. I was very impressed, not just what movies were sending messages, even though there was no one without a nod, but actually there was some thought. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! At one point, just before Angela killed one of her victims, she said, "Let it be a lesson for you. Do not talk about drugs!" There are fine subtle texts written, boys. Then again, dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie. Angela (who, for all the therapies and problems that had been done to clear the operation and its past, and reviewed herself as a normal and better person, and then changed her name from Angela to umm, Angela), at one point, "I I do not like to keep the evil rivalry in the West, but I know what happens when things go out of control. " (People started killing me ... by me! HA!) Then, he claimed that one of the counselors, Murray, apologized, whose daughter answered, "I'd rather die!" Sorry, Murray, but you actually went in that ... <br /> <br /> I was a camp counselor like one of the illustrations in this movie two years ago, 15 or 20 councilors had to have three children and there were rules, Which is not the movie). This Camp Life has really noticed me with enormous inconsistencies in the movie from what opinions. <br /> <br /> Well, although you can rarely follow this movie for 9 years old, even though some 10 or 11 year olds have died in this movie. I did not see that kind of thing before long. <br /> <br /> A bad breath for a Chess 80's slasher movie, even worse.
