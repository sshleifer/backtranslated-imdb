I am a great fan of Lon Chan, but the screen writing of this film did not work for me. The story goes oddly (I have learned from now that the film is missing a section), and the letters suddenly get excited and disappear. Some intertitles are highly explanatory (for example, "Why, you are no longer child!" - go back to the film for a long, slow beat - "You're a woman!" Yes, we got it the first time) but there are some conversation sequences that pray for explanations. Never exist. (Let's hear the argument of Luigi and her blonde girlfriend!) The plot, which involves abusive wishes (if not transformed technically) was difficult to see. From the author's credit, this issue was considered a problem, and a May-December match was not portrayed as Mary Pikford films (for example, "Daddy-Long-Legs"), some correct and good inevitable. Chani naturally gives good performance, but it seems that she has been well-managed in the past - she has overdried here several times, IMHO. I've enjoyed the intriguing sequence, and were very impressed by the stunt. Loretta Young was charming, although wonderful young. The movie is at its moment, but so far, this is my lowest-favorite channel photo.
