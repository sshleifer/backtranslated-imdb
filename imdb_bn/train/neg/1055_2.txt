* Spoiler Alert * <br /> <br /> At first I made this image 2 ratings out of 10. <br /> <br /> The idea is good, but there are many stupid errors in the movie, failing it could be that the attention plays it out. First of all he will never kill. After a very strange suspicion (which after mother does not prove so supporter and loving in the movie) starting from her mother, is not alone in rape <br /> <br /> She is incredibly silent, always falling into the strange traverses of the crew. <br /> <br /> Her friends are incredibly nasty. <br /> <br /> The thing that I found most incredibly is that if the Ethan crew fails to control it, he will change his opinion. Ethan is the leader of the crew (hey, they say so), and people think that another man is a quarrel, but when Ethan changes his opinion, he does not even allow the person to convince even the single person that he is correct and his former friends are wrong. Everyone just hates him ... why ?? The movie provides no explanation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
