Well, my goodness, I'm disappointed. I was initially scared to hear about Robert Wise's 1963 film "The Hunting" that the visual effects of the summer film size would be greatly diminished. But, deep down, I was confident. Of course, with such a gifted cast intact ... De Bont and the company did not destroy a movie, which was a fantastic and horror movie which is the subtlety understood in the fine art. Well, subtlety, now where are you !! ?? I'm afraid ... a committed movie is wrong. Yes, Jujube drop production design of Eugenio Genetic; The movies are photographed nicely; And the composer Jerry Goldsmith can never make mistakes. However, this script keeps it nice actors for testing. These are just for providing controversial dialogues for movies in conversation. To the end, always the prestigious Lily Taylor is the only actor who escapes with some dignity ... and it is only so. However, the crime of all crimes is shown to us that horror is the crime. We can no longer use our imagination, fear of fear of fear of unconsciousness No, we show some visual effects that we should be afraid of ... and what do you know? As they have come to understand as wonderful ... the effect of visual effects comes off as shameless. And Climax is a phantasmogic mess ... but some things have gone wrong before. <br /> <br /> <br /> Everything has been overdone in hunting. I am scared to have any real thrill or creaks in this old spirited house monstrosity ... only groans See the original instead. <br /> <br />
