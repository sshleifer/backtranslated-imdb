Six different couples. Six different love stories Six different love corners. Number of audience in the movie theater is eighty. Looking at eight different parts of the silver screen. <br /> <br /> I'm sitting in the middle of them sometimes to know what's going on in the movie. All the stories have a link to each other, but somehow they are trying to show some relation between them. I tried to find a few lines that I could write as a review, but at the end of 3 hours and 15 minutes nothing was found to write. The film is a poor copy of the Hollywood blockbuster love. <br /> <br /> My suggestion. If you really want to see a beautiful movie do not see movies.
