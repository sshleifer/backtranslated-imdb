Final scores (average of the qualities of various classic movies - acting, visual, creativity, salary, humor, fun, ect): <br /> 4.3 (among 10) <br /> <br /> <br /> Atlantis: The Last Empire "It seemed like a bold, serious new direction in Disney Animation a few years ago, however, just a year after the innovative and almost gifted" emperor's new groove "and Disney was released from its repetitive" Disney Formula " I have stepped down one step, I'm a big fan of the length of the design animated film, all of them love or hate to see it. "Atlantis" is an animated forward and "50,000 ligs of seas" and live action science fier similar to the 50s and 60s. The problem is that this version has only one basic idea. It seems like a designer, even the real Disney remix (Tarzan, the Hanback of Nottre Dame), more commonly, such characters are strangely floating on the usual suspicions of walking floors (strange Mechanic, Geng Ho Ho General, Sassi Ruthless women), Cast Flat-out supporting Millo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner). Objectionable The film is also suffering from its short speed. Instead of musching it in an epic story, Disney jams usually have a lot of risks on development opportunities with little running time ... doubts, letters, whatever. They make fun of us in this new and wonderful world and just give us our baring. The painful pace sometimes makes what is a relatively easy story confusing. Animation is dark and dreary and inexpensive. This thing looks like a cartoon slapped on Saturday morning together. I hope they have forgotten that the 2D traditional animations can still be wonderful. <br /> <br /> Negative: The uninterrupted lack of visibility, speed, and fundamentality. Positive: Perhaps the best death scene for Disney is a long time villain. This is the creative highlight of the movie.
