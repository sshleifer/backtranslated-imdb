If this film should be named, it should be "Hazar's Jacques". For this number, nothing more than this movie is 88 minutes in the beautiful country, in the city of Duluk Charger of 1968 and famous around the country, behind the girls and enjoying the law. <br /> <br /> What is the character that I am fond of a "dwarf" and what the movie is pulling? Superstition, sexual references and excessive use of drugs, has transformed the name of "Dukes" to the trash. <br /> <br /> It was awesome to compare with television shows as well. In 1969, Dodge was the famous actor known as Charger General Lee. Others have narrowed the role of character, which spoiled the film. <br /> <br /> "Duchess" is one of the biggest accidents in the 21st Century Hollywood Television-to-Big Screen Transit Tragedy. Skip this movie and simply buy a television series on TV. <br /> <br /> My grade: F
