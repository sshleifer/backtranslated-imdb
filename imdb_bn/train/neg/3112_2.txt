I'm not saying that I will try to place more spoilers in it. Normally I enjoy the Robin Williams movie, but this jewel was not among them. It was billed as a suspenseful thriller. The night was something but the audience. On the opening day of the spit, 6 people were killed, two good reasons, and went out. My opinion of the movie was badly written and directed. Acting was right but there was nothing to do again. The film is about a storyteller who reads a good book by a dead child. But * insert the spooky here * You can verify the existence of one of the children. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, however, he gets a headache and the excuse to the caretaker of the boys. That's there, that's all. You wait around half an hour and the end of the movie. It was as many thrills and cold as a dentist's office. There was really nothing with the story of homosexual practices, or overtones, and the movie was a little prejudice but it seems to be thrown out there for absolutely no reason and little knowledge has been made. In conclusion, I can not really write a decent review of this film because there was nothing in it, it was attentive to see the paint dry. I gave it a 2 because it was just played for its price and it was not managed by Uwe Bow.
