Imagine, tell it 12-1 - in your home, your bored, you are not tired. This scene happened, say 4 years or so ago. I started the TV and slapped a few channels and saw that this film was going on. Oh my ward is the worst movie I ever seen! A runway car that can not stop (the breaks have been cut or something) It can freeway down - what will happen ?! This movie was really fun - I think stents can cost about $ 2, there was an example where a child / young child is being won by car in a helicopter - to excite the viewer - a conveniently placed bridge coming forward ... This is the best bit bit of a film - it shows the child has narrowly lost the bridge but it looks so bad - you have to You can see that the dummy used - the total budget is classic! I remember the ending of the film, though I was a big one. <br /> <br /> I suspect that they will again see this movie so I'm happy that I have seen this part of the trash!
