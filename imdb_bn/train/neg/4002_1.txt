The social commentary went astray and the mystery itself was created and resolved through a series of unbelievable incidents that were totally unbelievable. In the past decade, there is no change in Fita's personal life, which makes it attractive from a distance. <br /> <br /> I was also complaining about why I was staying in Australia compared to the chance to solve the mystery in England. Does he not recognize the Australian police himself? It seems like a very artificial plot point that involved him in the investigation of the crime. The next episode of the original series was quite muddy and impossible, sometimes with cylinder borders, and it got on top of that soil, instead of returning a focus of the series. Sad
