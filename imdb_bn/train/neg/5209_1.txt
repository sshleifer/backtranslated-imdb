OK so I was bored and I saw it all the way. <br /> <br /> This image is light, irrational and unimaginable. The story is so sugar, it removes your teeth in opening titles. The story of a parrot story that actually hit me with a tail of two 'sad' children learning about 'God'. It uses the Irish 'Blare', as it never sees a true Irish. Keep an eye on the children who are clearly closed after the first attempt of the word 'OUR'. All is why they did not pump it out.
