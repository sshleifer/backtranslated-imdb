Eight Academy nominations? It is beyond belief I think this is a very bad year through Hollywood standards. Under the leadership of Houston and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner, I've probably swallowed Bete, but the Oscar nomination has really sold it to me and as a result I feel cheated. <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy? Can anyone tell me where is the humor of the Prize? It must be stupid (shooting a policeman's head, but the mafia is related to any other joke in this motto of life), but without a joke about 'your favorite Mexican cigar' (which I think is an old joke.) Cuba for the last 50 years Officially forbidden Americans from purchasing some) I failed to spot some of the nature of a comic - and I tried to Echilama. There are many mafia clichés but Clich does not humor my book. <br /> <br /> Is this a romantic comedy? Ever. Characters and their relationships are so incredible and shallow that they are similar to Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez in Gigli. <br /> <br /> Is this shiny designed parody about mafia? Not one million years. Humor is strange oddly weird, and it is usually a bad (and cheap) mafia movie feeling. It seems more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one dimensional letter and a little way of humor written for them, the actor has dodgy accents and the left pulling face. Well it's not enough; Even if Kakik pulled the face in front of the master of the face, Jack Nicholson (pumped up is full with the top lips ... is now meant to be a parody of Godfather Brando's Paddock Jolise? ... Oh! Who care? ... I know it's funny Not). <br /> <br /> Return to some slow, placing direction (this movie lasted for 2 hours), for some frustrating and clipped conversations like; "Do you remember the camera? We're too big, we'll follow you wherever we go", and clichéd methods and you "capiche?" Before you can say you will reach for quick fast button. Prize honor is far from the "best composition" of Houston and it's rather a poor end job. This must be a great work done in Canon's director, who should be given a concrete overcoat, and should enter the Hudson River.
