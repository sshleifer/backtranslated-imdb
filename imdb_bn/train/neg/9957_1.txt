One of the most fascinating usable romance movie plots is this: A deadly man falls in love with an intimate sick woman, who surrounds his life before he dies. Sometimes this story is good and in fact (done as "Flight theory", a nice jackfruit) is done, but it is often the same as it is, where naturally the heroine dies of "old movie disease". You know, terminal illness which has no symptoms but is a harmful spell and you need to lie down as your boyfriend's farewell forever; And your face is not affected by a bit (and it's not even 70, not your sex life). This is one of the worst versions of that particular story, where a very silly script puts together two incompatible and incredible characters, and they play with full sea actors. <br /> <br /> It's got the worst performance of Al Pascino's career, and I say that just two days before seeing "The Devil's Advocate"! He used Control-Fikk, emotionally, to play the race-car driver on wrist, and played silly characterlessly. He is constantly asking himself why he is staying around Murray Keller (so the audience) and spent most of the movie ... standing there, usually lying in his mouth openly. The only time to show any signs of life, in which his character proves that he has been mildly transformed for release by imitating the bad Mother Way West. Hey, it was seventy * <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Its character is bold and free and sensitive and uncertain and despite death It took a lifetime, and perhaps it was supposed to be played with an actress, which meant sensing, Vanessa Redgrey or Julie Chris. Instead, they found the remarkable face and strong words of Mr. Keller's German language, who wanted to make a terrible tetrikic stereotype ("You eat gym amlet!") Like a lover, he wanted to reform the pasino and fill it with courage and spirit, but it does not work, More than that, he is harping on the defects of his most influential fashionable fashion. At least one of the strongest romances you make is that you can not believe that he will be with someone who feels so worthless, and you can not believe that he is with someone who gets more in his nerves. <Br / > <br /> This is a ritual classic because of some mis-film fan parceno's stupid "free" Mae West imitation. The scene is a scream, After finishing in the context, but for the rest of the film, it is not worth the price. No, see only the film if you are a serious bad-film fan, who is particularly interested in studying the major lack of chemistry among leading actors, or extremely poor casting (not just deadly aspects but Another girlfriend from the passino shows an actress and just says Keller with little hair Whom I loved, I totally misunderstood them). Not one of these humorous bad films "The Converter", it's just a really, really bad movie. <br /> <br />
