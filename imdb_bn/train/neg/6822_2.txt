Drones, ethnic drumming, bad synthesizer pipes, singing. The most sponsored "world music" is imaginable. It is a tourist movie, and a lousy. What is really it is sliding sequences of murder. There is no transition in India, Egypt, South America, Africa etc., why we are suddenly 10,000 miles away, no idea has been published in any imagery. Another critic said, "A basket of Third World War footage" with "a basket on their heads". That deep deep meaning was walking continuously. If these people want to create 3rd World Music Video, what they did was hundreds of miles south to the right where the best part of the quo was shot and the movie was in Mexico. I said, what they decided is a scary tourist itinerary that covers half the globe and mindlessly overcranked filter shots. . The only thing to suggest this picture is that it does not suck enough as a designer. <br /> <br /> <br />
