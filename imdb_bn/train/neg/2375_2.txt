Freddy Dead: The Final Nightmare, Elm Street series nightmare is the sixth custom and yet another bad series. I think this is bound to the last continuation of the Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get nightmares on Elm Street Series Box DVD set for my birthday, so I saw all the signals. I can say that I'm getting more frustrated with these series, at least in the last two, it seems Freddie has lost his edge. The authors are trying to give the soul to Freddie and instead of reviewing the story, they are simply destroying it. It was not necessary for a sequel, Robert was sorry for the England, but it was much more than Freddie Kr√ºger's representation. <br /> <br /> Franny has returned, but there is something that we do not know, a daughter. Maggie, she does not know that she's her father, but soon she can know what her dark secret is, and she asks for her help. He has to do all he can to stop his power, but his loving father is difficult with all his good memories. Well, right? But Freddie is not leaving her without taking him on his way. <br /> <br /> Freddy's dead: The last nightmare was presented to 3-D, fundamentalist, hayo? Make annoying notes. This is one of the worst signals, it is connected to the fifth player of the nightmare of Elm Street series, I would rather see Elm Street's second nightmare to be honest. It was just bad acting, stupid editing, and only a bad idea for a story. I did not like the idea and Freddie Kruger actually destroyed the real concept, the master of the nightmare's death, did not know the Father well. <br /> <br /> 2/10
