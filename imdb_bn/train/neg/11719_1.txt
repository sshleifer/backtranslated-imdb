In this picture, in the words of Charles Dance, "Bocox!" No plot, no character development, and totally incredible <br /> <br /> <br /> The complete mistake (the Bulgarian train in London?). Dull and synthetic dialogue is complete. And the direction / editing is awful - a handheld camera shot that does not add anything to the movie; Confusing jump-cut; No framework <br /> <br /> <br /> Wesley Snape's character is totally disrespectful - why should she take care of him? Video directly? Dustin directly!
