Satan's Little Helper I've seen one of the best B-Horror movies. When I say good I understand the story. The film dragged a new plot, something that is not so good in the horror genre - something fresh. But there are some ridiculous questions that come with it. The questions you ask yourself over the movie. <br /> <br /> This picture attracted my attention when I was playing the HRV category. I was tired of the so-called "horror" of Hollywood blockbusters and asked for something different. Cover art for Devil's Little Helper immediately caught my attention. As you can see, the picture attracts you - it's cool! I knew it was the direct release of the DVD - but I took an opportunity. I mean, I just saw "Boogie Man" at night - so it can not be worse! After watching the movie, I was half-satisfied. I like movie plot The murderer was pretending to be a friend of younger boys, so he was really amazing, so he could kill. As he got sick, he thought he and his younger son would become partners - two terrorists The Halloween night was a great idea to set the film. In this way, someone would think of a masked man next to small children. They would think that they were simply her guardian. However, wherever "plot hole" starts to originate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> If you did not think like that - if he was 9 years old, or he was of the same age However, he appeared with a strange person in a mask, you will be flashing and protective of your child. You will ask the guy to remove his mask and identify yourself. You will ask why he is with your son. She does not know him. Tell him to leave him. She is not a family friend. She is a stranger. Now, we do not want to teach our child to talk to strangers. In this case, Mam is completely fine with it. is not it? They do not seem to think that it is not that the "man" They think of women's lover in mind, but after 10 minutes of talking you will loose masks and ask him why he is not talking a word. <br /> <br /> This image descends from the mountain. The thing that I got the most, all maem said, "do you want some sider?". I can not count how many times I'm in the movie. It's okay, oh you're going to die - even though there's our side, it's all good !! The movie started the commitment, and failed to deliver. It was more of a horror / comedy and even failed to deliver it. I think you can call it a "dud", "flop" etc. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is the cover art. However, some say that there is no value of $ 12!
