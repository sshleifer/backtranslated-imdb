A very good story, it's a good thriller ... but 10 seconds to destroy the whole movie ... what happened? Very well made and a good story has been destroyed in the last seconds ... Sorry to say, but 1 in the vote ... which he deserves, I think Chris Shadley may well come to the end ... but maybe next time: ) Gore all this meaningless blood for nothing? The story will take place around the last 10, but it did not happen ... the last story has ended, I think most people are not lingering and when they go to a movie you want a good finish, even if it's complicated ... but only here Late last ... sorry
