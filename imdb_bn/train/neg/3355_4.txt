There were only two things I had about this picture: I was waiting for Oven Wilson to die, and Catherine Jeta Jones. <br /> <br /> It was originally a female show. Catherine Zeta Jones was just there to provide eye fat. Liam Nisson was completely destroyed in this film. Like Jones, he had no role, he had no role. The film was all Lily Taylor (ransom, ready to wear). He was an original part of the David Volunteer script. All right, it was his first and he freed himself with Road to Perdition. <br /> <br /> I do not know what was the problem of Director John de Bont. He did a great job with speed and twister. She really went down here to work down here. Maybe he is still recovering from Disaster Speed ​​2: cruise control. Thanks to his lucky star for the Wild Wild West, otherwise it would be the worst picture of 1999. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> to avoid all costs.
