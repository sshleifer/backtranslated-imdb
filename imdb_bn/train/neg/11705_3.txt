This stuff Mellodrama I have seen quite easily the worst movie starring Ingred Bergman. Even the presence of its bright screen can not save the slow and slow film even faster, which is almost impossible to sit without moving very fast <br /> <br /> Just for Bergman fans to die; Most likely to fall asleep to others. I suggest you see "Bell Tolls for Cars" instead.
