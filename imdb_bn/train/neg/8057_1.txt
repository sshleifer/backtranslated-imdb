Is this photo wrong? Many, many things The edit tries hard to look good and confuses the viewer and provides him with a strong headache. The plot was broken and probably prolonged from being started as short (story or movie). This plot creates only for less than ten minutes for a better story and it is painfully expanded until it reaches only one feature film minimum. We all know how we extend them, right? Properly. They get slim. Finally, the plot is so paper-thin that you can miss it, if you do not give attention, it is difficult to see the movie. Acting is not even slightly impressive. The letters are poorly written and dull, reluctant. One of the worst things wrong in this film is apparently that anyone who was in charge of the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or should not have been supposed to be about it (I do not blame it, it is out of the picture ). As a result, the music of the film does not fit in half view. Also, what was the relationship between Elisa Dushku and the main character? Naturally, this was to attract the young man, but it was done very cheaply. And there is nothing to do with the rest of the first movie? What level of concept? At all? Two unclear boys did not seem to do anything with the film, they were there for some Chase scenes. I really doubt that anyone really enjoys a film so that they are weakly assembled and try an interesting concept such as a shameful and horrible Hollywood. But I have no hesitation. I recommend it with less attention to the Spanish who do not remember the worst horror-thriller until there is some sex and roar (although it can only be true for killer cut). 1/10
