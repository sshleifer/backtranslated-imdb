This, and immoral tales, both left a bad taste in my face. I think that is hateful by bodied sex, and be careful about what happens if these two films are sexually explicit. As a movie, it is not done very well - some acting is really bad (like "American" woman with French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being interested in marriage (when it seems that it was about the other way), and the aunt understands the hidden secret of the young man - they do not explain all 'explanations. I also do not like how the girl's relationship with the black girl was marked by distorting her family or symbolizing paternal behavior. The central idea is that these "sexy beasts" have ideas that, if you live in the forest, they live in the jungle, but it can be the foundation of a reverse but interesting story, but instead it is a painful, negative, ethical game.
