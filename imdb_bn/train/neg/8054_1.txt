Oh dear, what a horror movie <br /> <br /> The production was so cheap and nasty ... Remember the shot from "natural", where the power tree hits (leaving a burning stamp) that makes a bat from the royalty ?? The producers of this movie used the same scene where a tree branch entered the house. <br /> <br /> I wonder if they could use footage from natural, or did they expect it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> This kind of acting cabin. <br /> <br /> A bad picture, a really bad picture.
