This movie is AWFUL. I am not so frustrated in a movie that was strange for a long time. Leno should stand on TV and stand late in the night. The film's cars were quiet, but the movie itself is the movie I've ever seen. It is unfortunate, terrible to act, and may be written by plot 4 years old. Do not make mistakes, Jane Leno is ridiculous, but not in this movie!
