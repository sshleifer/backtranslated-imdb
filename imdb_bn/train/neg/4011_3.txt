For each series created on television, 100 ideas are made, 50 scripts are written, 15 pilots are made and one can only produce it. Through this selection process, we believe that the final product must be of crop cream, for any other reason, we can refuse to give a single television series. <br /> <br /> So it goes with the true blood; All were together and were conceived into a series of novels, a screen game, a pilot, and finally a series of what was started as a series. Unfortunately, this can sometimes be a long journey, as well as many changes that eventually make good and pure changes and shows that the producers are best for ratings. Oh, how wrong they are ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> International actors of relatively unknown actors struggled to find their voice, but they kept smuggling on their counterfeit South. Not so much desire for Allan Ball Ryan (Jason Stackhouse) gives us a new nude shot every week though it does not have much to do with its story. The stars failed to connect the angry black female character and you secretly hoped that the vampires would bring him out quickly before going to another lecture about white suppression while attending a ceremony for the death of Confidence. Sam is pressed for Shaki and in the morning we believe that despite the years of working with him and avoiding such a relationship with him, he has to keep an eye on the morning and afternoon and night. <br /> <br /> As the bill, Vampire surrenders the first opportunity to love his moral highlands fast dry, and there is no problem in making his quick blurring (though he is somewhat uncomfortable). We do not look at other vampires in the mainstream as a bill, but we look forward to seeing people as happy mails too much. <br /> <br /> Despite my best efforts to suffer through the first six episodes, I have come to realize how long you do not see a bad show, it's still bad. Somethings die for a reason, even for the vampire. Maybe this show should be done.
