... or, more accurately, so bad that while you smile at your neck during your life you see it! James Sawardlatti's "Deathstalker" of 1983, certainly created a sub-section of the sword and museum among most of the terrible productions, but it is ridiculous. Terrible acting, pure shit of conspiracy, and effects and photography can not be more amateur. But it's bad acting, the influence of Chess and many errors, which makes this movie so ridiculous. <br /> <br /> - Spinner Ayad <br /> <br /> Death Roller (Rick Hill) is a very strong and skilled warrior. One day, a good witch combines to create chaos to free him from his brutal ruler, evil king and magician Munkar, and combine three powers of a sword, a sword, a leopard and Chelice. It is easy to take the sword, but there is limestone and driving in the land of Munkar. Fortunately, the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county's most skilled fighters fight to each other until the war. The winner is then to take the place of the king. Of course, the king does not want anyone to take his place, so he plans to kill the winner (instead of just arranging for the tournament in the first place). The executioner is not only to achieve three powers of creation, but to save the old, beautiful king's beautiful daughter (Barbie benton) from the foot of evil Muncher. Fortunately, he will not be disturbed when he goes to the tournament, because he has allowed a decent female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) to threaten at this time ... <br /> <br /> This picture is a great, incredibly stupid and funny scene. Some of my favorite scenes include: <br /> <br /> - Deadstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword. The head that falls is not the head of that person. There is a red goat on the falling head, while the head of the Deathstaller was dark hair and no beard. <br /> <br /> - When the character of female warrior Kaira (Lana Clarkson) is presented, she first sees black dress, her face and body secret Destiny's travel companion Ogrees (Richard Brucker) assaulted her, and her breasts showed her breasts (under which she must be helpless) open, her breasts. His breasts we see Lanna Clarkson's first thing, even before her face. <br /> <br /> - The last soldier will have to fight in the Deathstalker Tournament, a pig a monster with a body of body and body of a head <br /> <br /> - Evil Muncher on a chest The lock is a ugly little creature. She eat that small animal human eyeballs and fingers. <br /> <br /> ... There are many strange funny, ridiculous, and great scenes. Actor is terrible but Barry Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eye-fat, and although I've described this movie as 'strange funny', sometimes the idea was that some actors felt painful to this movie. There are several beef meat to keep visitors entertained, and most women have nudity. "Deathstalker" is an incredibly awful movie, but I still highly recommend it. Humor people will have their time in life!
