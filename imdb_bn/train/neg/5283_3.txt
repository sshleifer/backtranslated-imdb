I was given the DVD on Christmas, I was waiting for the first screen of the film. Last night, keeping a special slot for it, I was sitting to see it with my daughter (17 years old and film studio student), chocolates must be enthusiastic. We love Jane Austen. <br /> <br /> Just two minutes later we knew we were running. The cone camera shot and angle, general poor cinematography, direction and wooden performance have already been felt flat and disheartened by us. Neutral, we have seen. <br /> <br /> Ally, played by Sally Hawkins, weirdly and for a specific purpose several times in the camera, our hard-won 'imagination of the moment' and the engaging we are direct about one 'I'll find you' fashion stalking <br /> <br /> The bad Rupert Penry-Jones, who plays Captain Wentworth, bless him, scripting and doing his best work in the direction. I hope they paid her a good salary, but in a sense, she was drowned by a huge wave, which probably violated Seval and broke her and her co-actress. They were almost swept out of the sea. Health and safety were a field day! In order to supply its line, the incompatible Rupert sprinkled water in the sea. Perhaps the key does not have enough money to re-shoot this scene. Except for Mr. Penry-Jones, Alice Crease did give Russell's only credible performance, but with his efforts, his efforts were consistent.

It seemed as if he developed memory barrier, for which he forgot his own reason. In contrast, Anna running Hyper-bhentilatim, better to post in search of the captain, already, about three minutes or completeness of the often baht was able to call in, even in addition to working in a sweat. <br /> <br /> We experience someone in the charms of screening bring. প্রকৃতপক্ষে, আমরা অবাক হয়ে গেলাম ক্যাপ্টেন ভেন্টওয়ার্থ কখনোই প্লেইন, স্পিনহীন, মতামত কম অ্যানে দেখেননি কেন এবং কেউ কারও কারও কথা বলতে পারল না, স্যার ওয়াল্টারকে শুধু হ্যাক আপ বন্ধ করার জন্য ডাকা হত। <br /> <br /> Important kisses, usually our favorite feminine moment, were painted painfully. When they went around, Anne's lips were finally chewing gum before filling her face as it had an impact on the screen to open her mouth and hold off. Eww! <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable thing on last night is how bad the strange films were in exchange for half the opinions of chocolate and mother and girl. <br /> <br /> What's sad to express? Destroy such a great and intriguing story as one of the finest scenes in England. <br /> <br /> Sorry Zen.
