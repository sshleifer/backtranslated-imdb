I do not remember seeing this as bad as another murder / mystery movie. This film, a medical examiner who is investigating the mysterious death of his friend in a car accident, has got a bad movie complete conviction: bad acting, annoying stories, lack of mystery, poor humor and no drama. Looks like this movie at Pax, it's a TV station that is less budgeted and made for camps-for-TV movies to delete as such. TV screen, of course, from the Big Screen to the edge factor as film or no doubt. However, this movie sure hit all sour taste. The makers of this movie are excluded from the opportunity to create a great TV movie "Recep for Murdere"; The title suggests some mysteries. <br /> <br /> So, if you want a good recipe, do not see this movie. This movie can only starve your TV. <br /> <br /> Grade F.
