Do you pay enough money to trap free people into the rats and hate them? Homeless people no one answered. They have no mortgage, rent or stupid. Homeless people do not have to worry about IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments. However, rent a apartment and buy a car and give them enough money and suddenly think of their rat race, buying gas for transportation, paying insurance in their car and working for someone else. They get the chance to become a "productive citizen". This film was about to absorb as it could be as a film. It's a way of saying rich and middle-aged sheep, "What happens when you try to help the poor?" And it restricts capitalist arrogance. <br /> <br /> Why is a movie that does not ask, "What happens when a rich man takes everything?"
