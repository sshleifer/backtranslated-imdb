"Sudown: Reprate in the Vampierre" is a garbage. The act is terrible, the atmosphere is not existent and characters are selfish. The only terrible thing about this harmful part is that most of the IMDB users give it a 10. It's really scary. There is no gore, no mystery, no violence, nothing. Bruce Campbell ("Evil Dead", "Infiltrator") is completely destroyed, the supportive shield is terrible. Yes, some people might like this picture, especially a mainstream society but fans of hard-core dawn or Gore-Hounds will not enjoy the brand's enjoyment. Personally I hate scary jokes, I like to see serious horror movies like "Canibil Holocaust" or "The Last House" on the left. My opinion, a real horror film is scary, it seems to be too bloody and annoying, without stupid humor, which usually destroys the whole idea. It's not a scary, not ridiculous, not even funny as a comedy, so do not waste your precious time.
