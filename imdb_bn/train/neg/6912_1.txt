The only reason I even gave it 1 out of 10 because the option of giving 10 to zero was not allowed. The biggest waste of time I've ever had to endure was For roughly 75 minutes, you played the greatest role (and I do not mean it in any good way, like the killer NERD was a terrible act) and such a plot that is not just ridiculous, but there is absolutely nothing to do with a genocide. The reason I rented this piece of title was also the genocide in the title. That said, the whole movie was only one killer and it was that furry. Spend more time watching you kids bickering and doing yard work than anything else. While talking to the kids, the little boy actor is probably the most annoying child actor due to the cemetery in the house. Did I mention it was shot in video? If you want to throw money and spend an hour in your life, always see it. But if you enjoy your hard working dollar and time, then go as far as possible.
