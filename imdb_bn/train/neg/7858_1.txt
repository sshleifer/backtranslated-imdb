I appreciate the need to renounce unknown rent for such 'horror' films, but at least some of the right actors should be employed. The sergeant is guilty of using his single line, especially his single line in the bulldozer. But let's face it, the line is not really important. There really is not a recognized plot, so most of the text contains f ** k, s ** t, m ***** f **** r and other mixed bad language in place of appropriate dialogue. <br /> <br /> The story like this is mostly made up of Random Gore and Death, with a few cringe-worthy 'surprises', it takes about 10 minutes to see what it is going on. Not only this, but there are several shiny plot holes and continuity errors (why are they going there? He did not die? He did not die?), So the whole picture looks like it was <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br />
