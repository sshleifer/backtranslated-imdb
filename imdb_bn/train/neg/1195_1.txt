This is the single bad movie I have ever seen. I can not express how bad it is. I honestly wanted to kill myself several times to end pain through this painful experience. Instead of watching this movie I recommend that you bathe the acid, but you will know at least a fraction of the pain without pain. <br /> <br /> I was behind the DVD as much as expected, and when I was following them at the beginning, I was very excited ... then finally I wanted to kill myself. I think a thirty-minute role of the most annoying characters in the history of the movie ... all right! Monkeys can do a great job of editing this trash. At least they will touch the ointment and some of the garbage will be gray. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, the bar. Apparently, not a little funny, until you see it millions of times. <br /> <br /> People rated 'Mans Hands off Fat' as the world's worst movie. I've seen it and agreed that it's bad ... but Alice is the second worst. 'Fatty drives bus' is much worse. <br /> <br /> It's all kind of tough language, but I can not write here so imagine that I swore the whole bunch.
