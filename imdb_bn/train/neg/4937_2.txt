It's a joke about 30 minutes. The trick, the cavemen are not fairly treated. Hahaha !!! He can not dial a phone as a cave. Cavumans are not as smart as humans. Oh jiz, those cavannons are so irrational. There are no comedies in this show. They can run this joke for so long and they already have GeoCore ads. This event is not eligible for a time slot on the National TV <br /> <br /> This show tries hard to be fun, but it's not right. Seeing this show, I was thinking that it was trying to be like "Bachelor's Gone Wild Show". Meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. Crying cave is annoying. The cave with glasses is very smart to be a cave (wah !!!). They all have personality, but I do not understand why I'm not worried about them.
