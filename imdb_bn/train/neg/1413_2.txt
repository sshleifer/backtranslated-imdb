I love Morgan Freeman. Paga Vega is an interesting, interesting and gifted actress. I'm sure it's a good movie. It happened something happened. nothing. It's short (less than 90 minutes). It was 75 minutes long. After an hour of frustration, I scanned the remaining 20-odd minutes. <br /> <br /> <br /> Frean plays an actor - who did not work for a long time - researching the part he can play as a Checkout checker in a supermarket. He is the supermarket where he works. Nothing happened. He decided to travel around him and he was heading towards a car, a target, car wash. Nothing happened. They talk about their lives. Nothing happened. Never <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not get it. But I did not get Bill Murray Flix "Lost in Translation" and "Broken Flower". If you like these movies, you might like it. Many people find this instant, charming, or - for example to find movies - make the dialog interesting. A common device for such films is to take long-lasting silence after supplying a line considered meaningful to an actor. We know it's meaningful because it is followed by nothing after two minutes on the screen. Sorry, I will be a philistine. I do not get it. To me, this kind of movie is funny, not charming, or worried. They are just boring. Why? Because there is no comedy. There will be no drama. Do not worry. No smile There is no doubt. No action Nothing to see. In short, I go for whatever movie. I could be bored for free. I see oddball / quirky characters in real life. I go to target, and fast food restaurants, and car-washes. These elements do not make a movie, even if they are doing these elements. I pay for entertainment. <br /> <br /> If you're crazy about Morgan Freeman and want to hear him just not hear anything, have fun. If you want to drool on Paz Vega, you can hear her and hear. But nothing will happen, I promise. A total snoozefest
