Why do any legitimate actors participate in this piece of scrap to read scripts? My God is embarrassed to even see it. I can not imagine the shame that this person will have to feel to be part of it. Also, there are some debates about what was apparently a cameo in Phoenix movies. He was unaware of the list of his role here (IMDB) to give him credit. BTW ... rain is the ones who were asking before his sister. This film proves that no matter how big "name" there is. Do not ear ears of silk purses. I love Lorraine Bracco but it's just sad, sad, sad ... Maybe someone could explain me the reason for such a movie. It has no respect, recreational, even playful characteristics compared to all other bad ones.
