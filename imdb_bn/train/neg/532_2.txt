Just this is PPV'd I do not want to waste a lot of time here because most of the posters here are better than me, but I want to say something. <br /> <br /> I did not know what was funny: Redgrave chasing small moths and tripping over her nurse; His "precious" son (whom he and Mr. Mr. decided to be drunk) cried in fear he became a street; That tone schmoozed with Deaf Ann Peggy Lee; Or the Cripple Caper's awesome CGI Annie sees his little soul! <br /> <br /> I did not buy Dennis as a small redgrow. I did not buy Richardson and Colette as a sister. Mary Streep's daughter wants to be an actress, she likes Mama more to give her some lesson! No girl (or Buddy) would have fooled themselves on vapid studio du jour Harris because I had no idea why. As Ann's daughter as she whiny and thoughtless, Luc cracks on a cracked slacker, and I do not friction about them in one! Evening chicks give a bad name to Flix!
