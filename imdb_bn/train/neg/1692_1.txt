Well, if you have seen the ring, you have basically seen The Grood. It is trying to get scary camera work and loud sounds, but it unfortunately fails. Plot, if you can call it, weak and rather full of holes, for example, how did the care center know that Yoko was not there for working when there were people residing in the house? And what was to do with Bill Palman's character is not really clear. He just came out of nothing plotters come out of nowhere. It does not have much knowledge of what the original family has happened. Who was sitting in the house, the little boy or the father? And Yoko was alive or dead when his care center found him? There were many unanswered questions and I was very upset thinking.
