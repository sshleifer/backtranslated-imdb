Seeing this I mainly target advertising placements. DHL, Aquarius Strip, Rockstar and more. After it is another product placement. It's quite clear how this movie got its financing. Jessica Simpson's "acting" is ridiculous. Any dick can never work because he can play the same song character. "Story" is just a backdrop for this very long commercial. I can not believe I was considered for the release of this movie theater. The more time you engage in this film, the more you feel embarrassed for everyone involved. The only small saving grace is Larry Miller and Rachel Lee Cook, who did not get nearly as a screen time as Jessica's cousin. I feel embarrassed I have seen the whole thing. I would recommend avoiding this one.
