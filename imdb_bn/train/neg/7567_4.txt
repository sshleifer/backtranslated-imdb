Story: Young-Gone is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. He is actually a cyborg, believing that he end up with an emotional organization. In the company, he met Park Il-Sun, a young man who developed bonds with him. <br /> <br /> If you read this, you probably know how talented Chan-Walk Park is. But 'I'm a cyborg ...' known, and (sad) is a big exit from the strong zones. I'm a big fan of any film or story that is trying to make something different. God knows, we all get enough nonsense on our local cinema. My main point about the movie is to say that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or creates a character that you care about. <br /> <br /> This story will be one of the weird things. I have seen in years ... but not strange enough. There is no heart of film ... just superfluous and confused. The confusion seems to be the main theme of the movie. All of the characters try to understand their own problems, but it proves to be the most confusing of most of those who own the Chan-Uck Park.
