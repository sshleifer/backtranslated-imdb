This movie is faulty in many front. Like many others before, it also portrays Alao's mythological story more than history. The printing of welfare projects for many actors who work in poor, overall, can work in Hollywood squares. It was the biggest mistake for me - I know the age of real characters and the general person and the acting TV actor Zerchtic Establable does not give any indication of credibility. <br /> <br /> Texan, I grew up with the mythology. I later learned more about history. I can take a decent product from both perspectives (although I like more historical accuracy) but it did not allow me to enjoy. Even John Wayne or Face Parker's version had more life than this strong mess, though it was a little less accurate. <br /> <br /> Avoid it - very frustrating.
