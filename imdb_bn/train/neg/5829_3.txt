I saw this movie as a preview of a Matthew Barney art exhibition. It's definitely ready for me. I often dropped the show and, in the past, probably have to stay. <br /> <br /> As well the score was great (lightweight) and photography was rich and colorful, the content was mostly tedious and expected. Yes, I needed to see someone wearing pearls to determine what pearl diverts were. This film was a shameless blend of most Japanese cultural references and the use of a knock / crop in industry shots of modern wheeling technology. Picture "peak" to turn your stomach with enough odd shock-industry. <br /> <br /> What was the movie? Others may argue that this is an anti-wheeling piece, but it can equally argue that it supports wheeling anyway. Personally I think Berne's audience was trying to "glow" with his hips, fathom, self-separation and canobolistic fetishes. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: Don does not bother to see this movie until you really stop the feeling of Barney's art. The message is unclear, slow, slow and cultural pretentious reference. If you are behind the shock-art, you will do better in one of the many "unwanted" movies or hustle old Hoostler's copy and take a fix-cartoon.
