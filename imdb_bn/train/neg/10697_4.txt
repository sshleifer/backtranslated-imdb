First of all, I thought that stories and scriptures that were described as mischief by Prosten Sturges. Until he was submerged, he was one of Houston Screenlines and retired. However, it was not Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. Originally this story was based on the Robert Lewis Stevenson short story "Bottle Eyes". When a good man comes to grab an evil object, he will give him a desire, but ultimately he will cast him into hell. That's okay Someone said that the screenlights would have to be the main. Actors are usually given a great skill, which gives medium text to translate into the front of the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the end. The hero believes that he has found a way out of his contradiction but trying to solve the problem slightly differently in an effort to save an innocent person. It worked in the first place but seems to be true to the modern horror movie code, they think that at the very end of the movie, they want to provide a terrible dead end to the doll. This is a stupid convention. The old horror films just got to get fined with permission to finally win. Despite the current crop of filmmakers, there is nothing wrong with the good victory over evil. You can give visitors a good healthy fear and still make them happy in the end. Actually, I think it's even better.
