It's 1978, and yes maybe there are many black players in the parties! Fans will be frustrated and certainly 75,000 seats will be filled, so little players are very happy at the field! This TV is watchable made for the Super Bowl movie. It's not too much, but it's a wonderful cast of such an amazing act that is a look (for a period), probably the most notably Tom Selley. Unfortunately, no one comes to the screen, Shalek is quickly trumped by "actors" like Dick Batkas. <br /> <br /> This is a silly story about super bowl stalling. PJ Jackson is accused of "New York" (Mafia Predatory), to ensure that the game is played on their behalf, in this case 10,000,000 dollars in betting. PJ seems fair enough, and there seems to be a loose perception by closing a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, unexpectedly, took lanyi charge.
