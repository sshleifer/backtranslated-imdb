Waiting to tell me that I used to read several reviews before renting this movie and knew what to expect. Yet, how bad I was. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of fanboy, and when one looks at someone very well used to apologize. Most of them are sub-performances, poor performance and weak storyline (best rehearsed in best movies). So far, it is much worse with the possible exception of the next few "Haoling" series films. <br /> <br /> First, the story. It has been cited several times in reviews on this site, so I will not go to the precision. However, it is very clear that the author (s) had absolutely no connection to the lycanthropic monsters. It happens in such a case that when a filmmaker is given a horror movie that he considers himself to be "above", they tried to bring a new spin to Viruwal legends. It's okay, but a non-terrible fan trying to do it usually ignores the awful audience's intelligence and sophistication and ends writing down them. The plot seems like a parody of Vertubol films, and the events illustrated are so false that I think my intelligence is seriously disgraced. For example, TV news footage, the reporter pans them away from someone close to the crowd behind them. Give characters and visitors credit to be able to spot the bad guy without using a flashing neon sign. And it's just ice tip. <br /> <br /> For the effect, I have never seen less credible useless. I want to be happy with Lon Chaney Jr. in Crop Hairstyles. They show a great deal like the animal they used to ... well, like some people with some cheaper glasses and some really awful animatiles, like a man in a cheap rubber suit. And, I know that many people have already criticized CGA, but my God was terrible. One scene changes a woman, and the actress starts with a full CG version, naked but for some reason without breasts. My first thought was, "Hey, why is one of the characters from the reboot turned into a stupid looking warehouse?" <br /> <br /> However, I want to see a positive outlook on any picture and there were few. Cinematography was passable (the movie was shot all the digital, which was interesting) and some performance was not terrible. It was also interesting to see TP Header as the world's best made homeless woman and as a bad title for Ken Holder. Also, all of the Yellow Power Rangers have grown and ... good, great. And you are looking for the skin, there are some pretty tasty examples. This review ends the male-pig's part. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want a nice barefoot movie, try "an American Werewolf" in London, the original "The Hawling", "Dog Soldier" or even "The Wolfen" ( Goes). If you are full of a lycanthrope, then take a gander. Otherwise, give this a miss.
