I was not the big fan of Rajinikanth in the first place, but my father was very disappointed. In a horror story, action and songs were only medieval. The story becomes very promotional. Instead of running an office like NTR or MGR, Rajni continued to be the next guru as the next Guru of Tamil Nadu. My wife told me that after coming out of this film, Rajni is doing any other movie! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That was a great movie, which was made by buying this wicker ... Makes it! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
