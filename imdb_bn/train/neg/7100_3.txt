This movie makes a promising start and then gets very confused and muddled. Kamal Hassan has tried many times to show this time right, he did not spend much time in this plot. Smaller characters in the movie are not shown for special reasons. <br /> <br /> Overall, very frustrating, I would recommend avoiding this movie.
