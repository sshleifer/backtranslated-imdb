I started watching this movie with high expectations. However, one hour later I left the movie because it only raised many questions on me. It has already begun at the beginning and only got worse. <br /> <br /> Why would they kill Hollander under a statue? Why is an Italian comediant present? Why did the farmer wife saved Hollander? Why did he live, instead of starting the love of a farmer's wife, did not go for life? Why did not the farmer wife Hollander save time when the farmers were not around? Why can this possibly unclear farmers realize Italian? Why do Italian comediant Hollands know about gold? Why was he hidden in the property center of the evil farmer? These and many more questions pop up, and none of them seem to get an answer in an acceptable way. So I guess I totally feel the point of this movie, and I'm not connecting the story in any way ....
