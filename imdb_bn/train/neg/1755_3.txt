This film is not uncommon and it displays a warmth, but eventually this effort is very vague and strongly focuses on leads. There is no doubt about what to do with Mary Tyler Moore's screen, but she is moving away from the rest of the customers. <br /> <br /> Another problem is the script's overboarding cliches. The college which secretly goes out of college, gets an old woman's good job (and the first works fairly desperate), with her executive toy, a shameless network executive, who reads the glitches on the material, the journalist who sticks to her faith, etc. . None of these are really wrong, that is, they are all basically root, but in combination they leave us with a lot more and djuice and few surprises.
