Usually I like dinosaur movies but this one is pure shit. No scripts, no dialogue, no acting And the brave colonel was trying to show him hard and his face looked like a stupid proportor of a young police academy. So it was a full time waste (thankfully I saw the movie on TV until the money was wasted). And I do not really understand who made this sh * t 10. Grade they have fun. My suggestion, if you see this title run from it!
