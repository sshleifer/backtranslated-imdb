This review is the most talked about by all speakers. If you plan to enjoy this picture, do not read this review. <br /> <br /> Nowadays kids are having trouble on TV. It is all so sponsor and condescending. 'Wow, have fun, is not it?' No it was not. And unfortunately it seems to flow alongside children's films as well. And this is the 'Flight of the Rainier'. I have not seen 'Flight of the Raininders' within a few years, so I can digest some points, but it seems that at the time it is completely disrespected. <br /> <br /> Of course, following a story, Christmas is given a book for a professor. Now, a respected scientist on the flying habits of some lecturers. I think it's bullfrogs. However, through this book, Mr. Lecturer / Family Guy can learn that the Rainier can fly in the same way as Bulfroog. Apparently this book has written a scientist hundreds of years ago who has disappeared in the North Pole. Now, if it was, then I would have pulled out the book from the nearest window. The flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring event, but flying rider is a fantastic and completely unrealistic concept. But, Mr. Lecturer is not mine, so I guess why he decided to fly to the North Pole where he has kept his wife and goats in the house, no idea where he left. Of course, things became scary and before knowing it, a flying reindeer crashed into its own private plane area and was trapped in the North Pole. <br /> <br /> are you still following it? Well <br /> <br /> <br /> His family, of course, has been destroyed. I will be very, I mean, what a suck-tacular Christmas. Elsewhere, Mr. Lecturer has found himself in a hidden town in the North Pole, who lived in the middle and a scandalous person who was wearing only red and white clothes. Instead of trying to run away immediately, I greeted them with open arms, just as I did. This secret civilization of cute monsters, and he wishes them with open arms. Oh-kayyyy They return him to this story that they are Santa Claus's Elves and they have no idea for children of toys making toys throughout the year. And Mr. Lecturer took all of these. Even the Santa Claus is actually a scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago, or whatever. There is only one problem - they do not want to leave him. The world does not know about their secret existence. Finally, they could already know that it was in the corners of McDonald's and Starbucks. <br /> <br /> still with me? <br /> <br /> Now the house of Mr. Lok's family is finding out the book and he has gone to the North Pole. Boy, if they find that he's just gone for a quick walk, would they not be embarrassed? Before the audience knows it, they jetting off a Christmas spend to the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet. Meanwhile, Mr. Lecturer gets all the famine midgets ill and decides to leave. I can not remember exactly, but he kept Santa Clos closer to the gun. Fire fight started during midget attack and he escaped through Santa's slip. Santa is hot on his heels and with blood in his eyes, whatever he is, flying through his side of the plane with some extraordinary millennium flying towards him. So they go to their plane, the planes go back and everyone lives after happiness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And this is the glasses that are completely disconnected from 'Rainier Flight'. There is not much wrong with this; Anything that insults the intellect (well, probably there, but it can go away from a child film and thus these things) or something particularly objectionable, but the problem is nothing good about it. It just does not fear Christmassy. And for a film that's all about Christmas, it's a pretty major flaw. But hey, I do not think the target audience of Ryanada? Why should they? They've been so stingy on the sidewives that they probably can not spell 'Christmas' <br /> <br /> I can give three out of ten. If it was a TV movie then I would add another two stars to it. We all know how bad they can get.
