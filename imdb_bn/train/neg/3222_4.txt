Based on the story of Bernard Malumud, I was very disappointed in this 1970 film. It is basically a story of an incomplete story based on potential liberation, racial bias and disbelief. <br /> <br /> A black Jew angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. Morris Miskin (Zero Mustel) will believe only Angel (Belmont), his wife Fannie (Ida Kamska) will recover. The problem is that Maurice originally gave up life and believed that Belmont is an angel. <br /> <br /> When he believes that Fanny improves, he ultimately doubts him and Fanny enjoys accordingly. If the English translation in the last comment was very good, when Morris died with the death. <br /> <br /> Jane Kader, who performed brilliantly as Oscar's nominee, also refers to the 1966 film "The Shop on Main Street". Comunce is reduced to movies with most of her bed scenes and her generosity, which she does not reveal disappointing situations. He called Ruth, his daughter, who married Jewish religion, and called them. In most of the film, she does not realize Angel's appearance in her apartment. <br /> <br /> The scene in the pharmacy has been damaged and the scene where Angel's girl friend confronts Belafonta in their apartment, memorable but all too brief. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> We do not know why Bellfont was in danger and why he died. <br /> <br /> Those who watch this movie have left the theater in depression position.
