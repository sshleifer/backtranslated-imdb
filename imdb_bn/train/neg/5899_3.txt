All fawning people are doing on Miike and his work. I sit through this flick tonight. As I figured out the penguin as well, I could have guessed from this comment, it would be worth my time. <br /> <br /> Such fate <br /> <br /> I I look forward to finding the next Director General (or the author), but I do not think Miike is one. I did not have a masters degree in New York University graduation, but I know a lot about this: a horror film has to be paused. The viewer must be more creditable than this film. <br /> <br /> This picture pansing me shook my head. Some of the last few scenes were dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and stayed there, when Kiva Shivasaki looked at the camera for a few minutes, looking at the camera for eyes, eyes and face. One famous director once claimed, and I'm imitating that the camera can be made by bending a beautiful woman and rolling it out to a movie. Kou is not a good enough actress to do that. She wanted to remember that the unwanted stares for more scenes paralyzed stares. And he is not only making a deer in a hedgehog a camouflage; Other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives a little room to do a lot for a long time. <br /> <br /> I like Asian movies. Hong Kong Action Flicks for the last 30 years, Korean horror "Phone" and "Coma", Ang Lee's work, idle sex and war, as well as other trashies, but with other fun Filipino movies. Without glittering array I could work.
