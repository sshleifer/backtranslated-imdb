Setting up in the 70's, the "Seed" accused of the serial killer Max Seed (Will Sanderson), who killed 666 people in 666. He was sentenced to death, but he did not die on an electric chair, even after being frustrated three times. <br /> <br /> Detective Matt Bishop (Michael Pare) and other officials have hid this secret by killing living seeds. . After the people kept in his living coffin, the seeds break and they go away. Illustrated by the world's worst director (Uwe Bowl), "seeds" expand the envelope of the appropriate society and fail to provide a direction to a storyline. And he said that this is based on true facts because if a person lives on an electric chair after being frustrated three times, he will be freed. This is an urban legend, and it does not happen. Other weights of the ball ("in the dark only" for one), "seeds" are just terrible.
