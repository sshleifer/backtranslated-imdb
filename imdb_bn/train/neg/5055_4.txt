Two years ago Sundance I liked Josh Kornbluth's debut-haiku tunnel. So I was looking at Jacob's, his brother (and often associate), the best side of the world. It's a drama about an exceptionally good child growing up in the low-class areas of New York. The movie is not without its brutal moments. But occasionally, Koranblood is working very hard to work: life may be very difficult for some people. And life is not fair <br /> <br /> More subtle, and more importantly, to our understanding that all this is something that can be creepy cultural underpinnings and anti-social behavior they all spawn, there is no shortage of these characters, goodness and humanity. We can go back to their language and their realistic position, but we can not leave their purpose. And in fact, there is a certain ambition among their struggles to maintain a family in such a problem that most of us can appreciate. Cornblut has grown up around this, and his compassion for the people is clear. <br /> <br /> After saying all these things, there are many painful mistakes of the world's thieves (including the title). Characters are not very reliable. Writing is dishonest. And the plot line is just noticeable. And many are the most annoying to use two young black boys by imitating Gangsta Rap in the Kornblood scene. Everyone's own: But I do not question the possible reality of this phenomenon, whereas 5-year-old children hurt me by talking about women's sexual relationships. It is a mandatory bit of unnecessary shock value and credit.
