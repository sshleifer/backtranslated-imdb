I am glad to read many negative comments about Tieter Plot. I say everybody say the same thing. They prefer the nature of the House of Gryph and its intelligence, but really dislike the vindictiveness of this ongoing plot. It falls into the real nature of the story in hospital and makes the police authorities angry. Everyone in the hospital needs a more careful nature rather than a rebellion. Also, there are many suspicious legal aspects about what Trita actually is doing. He can not submit a single account and can not prevent doctors from writing prescriptions for patients. He sees that most rebellious hospitals are attacking very sick patients and it is not a good story to illustrate. I did not vote this episode with scary because the story itself, but when you insert a piece of tritter it closes me and the rest is hurt, people say that they hate watching the lines of the story. Change it. Get the Treater out.
