This is the first time that Adam Sandler's film could be compared with his life as a Kunic in the same period in 1989. Continuous recognition of her character's hidden comic talent and frustration of fun stuff seems to be more than Sandler. The film is nothing compared to its blockbuster feature films like Big Daddy or even Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, while creating this image, Sandler did not find any way to express himself in a consistent, consistent, successful, and fun way. Most of the "joke" of the movie communicates with Sandler, usually his unrecognized comic genius and beat himself, because he is not very ugly and can not get a woman. The film is very difficult, because it does not treat itself like a real movie. Sandler speaks to the camera and to the audience throughout the film, often referring to low budget or questionable content in the movie. The film is finally awkward and embarrassing to visit. I want to forget immediately that I saw this picture even after the end, for fear that if it gets more about it, it will destroy Sandler's career. One pass in the video store, I rented it free and it was still waste time.
