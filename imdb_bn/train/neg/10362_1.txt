Disney? what happened? I really wish the movie was set to 60's, the books were there. And I could actually tackle cheap special effects to make the budget more appropriate ... .............................. .................................................. .................................................. ................... People with exchangeable red eyes as IDs? And what's up with the emergence of the volcano? Where was the book? Peter Jackson! Protect us !!!! Long ago (1978) I heard that this movie was European version. I'm sure I could id it. I can only imagine this could be closer to real stories than poor adaptation. This movie needs to be X'd.
