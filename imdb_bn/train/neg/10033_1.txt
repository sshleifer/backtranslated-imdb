I was very dissatisfied with this step. Everything was terrible from the beginning. The comedy was disrespectful, the act was over, the songs were disrespectful. Even the storyline was weighed. A writer who wrote successful script like Guru and Dhum, I had high expectations. Actors worked very hard and did not help the film to everyone. Of course, Kareena put a screen on a bikini but for two seconds. I think Hindi stunt directors should study how action films should work. They tend to exaggerate the way too much. In Chinese movies, this style works because it's their signature piece. But the signature of Hindi cinema is the song. A good action movie can not last for more than two hours and may not be unrealistic. But, in the future, I'm sure that these action films will be even more sharp. Also note: comedy and action films are not mixed until done properly. Good luck next time.
