If there is something that bothers me to see bad movies, it is done by experienced filmmakers who will know better. Apps can use some imagination to tell some of the essential elements of this "re-thinking" character of the planet's development. The original planet's daughter, Nova, had a better and better character than the version that was given in this version, which is not a single word. There is a great expectation from Tim Burton, a person who has added incredible visual imagery with intelligence, intelligence and humor, which is not all of this production. <br /> <br /> The basic problem was the development of the plot. The first big mistake allowed people to speak. It was a fundamental difference between apes and men who made all the differences * in the original film. Even when he was silent, his ability to contact Henderson Taylor was different from other people. In current cinema, Mark Wahlberg encourages people to talk (talking) to rebel, but there is no reason for their rebellion and their recovery. They have the ability to communicate in order to create modest tool-users and plans, some silent people can not. There is no need to make a person fall from the stars to save them. In fact, he came from a technological civilization and found himself in a pre-technological age, without any gadget (firstly) to help himself, it should not be disappointing Wahlberg, not for the people living there. <br /> <br /> Helen Bonaham Carter is very sad to see yourself and the reactionary brick wall Mark Wahlberg working to create some surprises. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The boy suddenly changed from a part of the background to a fascist gang-ho freedom fighter. This was poor development of the character. (Especially Estella Warren, it seemed as if he was capable of doing more than that in the script). Wahlberg's fascination was shared by me till the end of this man who saw in him, because he rarely contacted people with lifetime. Creating apps: half-plus point and two minutes: AP make-up was great on men, especially Michael Clarke Duncan who had incredible sensual eyes (for this reason he was so good at Green Mile) and makeup The design allows him to use it completely. But the woman of Epe could not see anything in the world, neither Epe nor man. Minus were apple jumps that seemed to be realistic as Flash Gordon's rocket: Jumping apps seem like they were fired from a catapult, they did not have long-term grace of real apps. Second, combining poor sound - when the Gorilla grows, it can be obviously dubbed from some animals, perhaps it is lustful, ridiculous, and unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Different "human" things in the original film are operated as apes do and light relief ("I did not know an eater like a choice." "People look, human work!"). Here, the apes just say the thing exactly as a 21-century man, and there is no laugh at it. The only true original idea was to write an array on his legs. <br /> <br /> At the end of the film, more than "Star Trek to V-gaar" did not let me do anything. First of all, apps have been able to read the Roman characters in the past in order to know the name of the forebreaded zone in the hidden form. Secondly, this mysterious inscription is covered with sand only, which only moves the brush away in Wahlberg, can make a saip several centuries ago. At this moment, for me, the film is much worse than the most harmful completion. <br /> <br /> The nature of the themes is like most of today's science fiction films. In the 60's and 70's, they generally did not have the budget to build a trustworthy future, but they were really fantasizing about the true original ideas and ideas. I'm thinking of 2001: A Space ODC, 1967 Planet of Apps, THX1138, Soilant Green, Silent Running and Solar in 1972. The first planet of apps also uses the only scientificly legally and physically possible method of travel over time. However, this movie is taking only every bad science fiction that: space storms, contrasts and insect pores outside the star track; The solar system's planets and their movers are likely to be visible together on Thursday. (In fact, from any planet, to all other bodies, even their own moons, the level of light); A conventional rocket powered shuttle travels from Earth to Saturn in a few minutes instead of years; Firing two thousand years old and pressing the button on the button works fully. Do not say anything in a convenient bulletproof internal glass door. In contemporary settings, you have to explain why * why * it was proof of bullet, but it does not have to cause you "science fiction"! <br /> <br /> Overall, Burton's most frustrating movie.
