This film is mainly about a girl in a Catholic school, which may be in trouble due to the red color of her schoolmate shampoo, and after blaming for this law, she decides to go to Florida for vacation. On their way they meet some people in the local diner and decide that they will meet with each other. The girls stand beside a road near the wood and stops for a while and when a girl walks around a little while, then I see that a murder is happening where the local sheriff itself is involved. He is scared and runs to tell what happened to others. Other girls decided to go with him to a glance and two of them were killed by the killer. Then two remaining girls were captured and murdered in local jails. Deputy Sheriff is monitoring the girls at this time and despite their strong demands as Sheriff's killer, he ignores both and works for everyone else in this film, who can not do some violent detective work together with two and two. There The best part is one of the girls of the killings and one of the girls where she decides to rape her in her prison and it seems that this girl is actually being raped by this man and the bare chest view I acknowledged but it was good to see their lips have other things in her mind. This movie reminds me of a low-budget thriller "Blood Song" in which Frankie Avalon roams, the same purpose is just part of a different character. This is not even a rental movie for a budget of less than 80, and at the end I saw the worst in the movie and it wants me back my money!
