I've chosen this title from a friend who was sitting in the collection of his entire DVD / video / laserdisc, so thankfully I was not personally paid for it. I thought it would be a bad film, but I know that after reading something really good, the children have read the bad movie, do not have to play with the dead, and incredibly strange creatures who are alive and mixed have become taller and now <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Basically, which is going to release a huge solar flares toward the sun's normal plane Will be destroyed. In order to deal with this imminent threat, humanity has assembled a space ship and crew, because it is burned by an antimatter bomb (which is described as the first "greatest explosive of all time"), in which some complex sci-fi arguments will be dashed in different corners, The world will be brutally thrown out. <br /> <br /> Do not think of what I described as a bad episode of the original Star Trek. Even a fraud (Charlton Hesson, Peter Boyle, and Jack Palance) Solar Crisis can easily manage the mediation level, thanks to the fact that the plot starts simple, but when the time comes, it becomes increasingly non-conformable. <br /> <br /> The main success of this film's disappointment is the sum of a villain character (played by Boyle), who called for the mission to be threatened. By the ways in which they are not interpreted, they send a bad tiny decay with an embarrassing bad hair to control some obscure electronic minds that have been played by Genetically Engineered Scientists of Space, female lead Anabel Schofield. Why is he sabotaging the mission? Because of his moribund attitude, he believes that the sculpture does not happen and when it does not happen, he will become very rich because he dug his evil bird in the stock market. As a result, there is a villain imaginable in your most terrifying intelligent motivation. <br /> <br /> The plot of the film is progressively developed gradually and slowly develops, the beginning of the story, when using characters that are merely vague or vaguely in short, I can sit here and explain in detail that the painter's relentless inability is to actually create a plot that actually clicks on or holds you, but here I am writing this review in Microsoft Word and I know the fact that it will take three pages, And I will only succeed in losing your interest. But again, you'll probably get the same effect from seeing the film. <br /> <br /> However, the film has been poorly curtailed with extremely bad conversations. Imagine if this is what happened to Star Trek Enterprise, the characters face each other with science-fixing. Yes, I know, they already do it, but imagine what they did and they used it in a vague and often unusual view that stimulates the tension, excitement, or the interest of the audience. <BR /> <br /> A good example is given when a character of a Zero-G environment returns to a metal box and returns to a metal box before continuing to cry for a few minutes of sudden bursts. The script initially adds the character at the risk of an explosion, but does not stop giving a difficult answer to why and how it happened and for some reason he could not escape. Overall, you have a sorry cross between wicked and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Then there's a lot of scenes where dramatic build up leads to nothing. Jack Palance's performance was destroyed on a character that works around the desert to run the son's hero (not asking), before going round and killing with a bunch of cases. At the death bed, the palace finally tells our son's hero his last name (when a horrible hit makeup works after someone puts a balloon on his eyes), which he has been silent before. Colonel Trives J Richards It ends quietly after the boy's expiry, giving the impression to the visitors that the name has some significance. Perhaps Charleston Hesson's Glazeled Admiral character identifies him and once the name is repeated, the plot will continue. Something Something <br /> <br /> No. Sorry At this moment, any hope of your loss will be reduced when at this moment only a lot of kindness, failing to make plays ?? It's so flat and hackneyed that it will remain forever in the career of Palen√ßa, just as the rest of the cast is equally fatal. <br /> <br /> This movie is completely surprisingly ending in a way that Shufflefield is bombing in the center of the sun, resulting in Villain's spellings, the last of which is one of the sequences of the most well-crafted visual effects of the movie, even for their wide-ranging care, Yet it is always just like the movie to watch the movie. The most tragic part of this movie is that most of the big budget, sadly, a script's stencher and Boyle, have been completely destroyed due to a supporter cast behind Haston and Palance, who manage to turn the hobby purely in pure acting. <br /> <br /> Grade: D-
