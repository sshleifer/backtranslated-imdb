I read somewhere where this film was considered "remake" of Film Noor in 1949, "Chris Cross." I later said frustrating but it was still better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is "Neo-Nir", since it's modern day and it's color, two things which purists will make it disqualified for the film's doldrums. <br /> <br /> <br /> The biggest negative movie in it was cinematography (it was not great) but imagined stories. Hey, there was a similar story in the 40s, but I did not care for some of them. Here filmmakers did not support the situation by keeping flashbacks in every three minute story. No wonder this story was kept with. It was ridiculous! They do not worry about what happens to the 45-minute mark, so much confusion about them. I do not know if I do not.
