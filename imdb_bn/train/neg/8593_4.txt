Well, I finally saw it. When I first came out I could not go because, well, really, I was scared. It may be bad, or fear of despair. Not bad as Menace, and Clones is not good, it was not particularly memorable or satisfactory. <br /> <br /> I was 11 years old when I saw Star Wars. I'm still sitting in the theater. From the opening crawl to the final credit, it was a movie experience that I would never forget. When the princess and galaxy were protected from evil damage by the advice of the wise wizard, rogue pirate and various comic relief, she is an indefinite story of the indecent farmer boy, which is understood everywhere. Open Settings <br /> <br /> And Lucas does not have to be punished for using old sources. It works because it is an old formula correctly. And for its achievement, he makes it very special that it has new special twists. <br /> <br /> Then the empire came and the story became more than just a fairy tale. The dark image enters and we have learned one of the best movie twists of all time. Greatly renowned, gentle, Luke's father. Wow, anyone saw coming. Of course, I did not see Lucas until I was convinced. Go back and see Star Wars again. In particular, know what you know in the light of the first three episodes, whether it really matches. <br /> <br /> which brought the problem to me. Revenge is an entertainment movie - extraordinary impact, lots of action, some good fight scenes But a movie still dies or dies on its plot - the story is saying. Oh, of course, really well played can save a weak plot, but a poor plot combined with bad acting - that no one can overcome any director, certainly as bad as I was forced to understand George Lucas (Liam Nisson, Natalie Portman , Samuel Jackson) managed to manage some of the worst performances in their careers. <br /> <br /> ***** Spinner Array ******* * Segment Eat It is understood that he has already been disturbed by what has happened in the first two films, so this is an incredible burden. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Being found as a child as a product. Well, these details do not get a remote explanation. Indeed, the closest interpretation is that Yoda's observation that they were probably wrong. Oh, well, okay then then. Our mistakes <br /> <br /> Now, this turned out to be the same wunderkind C3PO Creator. Hey, what's a coincidence? And did he know Tatooine would come back and he was there from there? How nice! How about that Check out the old deliberate suspension, what is George there? However, to us, this brat baby, moody, patulent, the key to young adults, who will certainly become one of the greatest villains in cinematic history - Darth Bhadra's great tragedy - good people who fall from grace, only achieve the end and finally release them. <br /> <br /> How do you say it is happening? Why, he has dreams that his wife will die during childbirth. Now, sure, he lives in a star-civilized civilization, which we deal with asylum, as we treat petrol, but it can be "may be of darkness", so that maybe a physician may meet, perhaps it may be, Is this future society maybe something about this problem? Why, no, the only thing that he can think of is killing some children, because the bad guy is going to pursue two films, told him that he is the secret of immortality. <br /> <br /> Well, of course he is ... <br /> Can anyone expect to take care of us? Hell, why anyone wants to save this brat or to be released in the first place. I wanted Kenybe to be killed because he was not bad, because he was terribly stupid. <br /> <br /> Oh, Amila has finally died. Child's birth Why? Well, they do not know. The doctor, who is direct and this incredibly high technology indicates that this society has improved, only offers to conclude "he has lost his desire to live". Well, oh, all right, of course. Maybe he was finally sleeping with him. <br /> <br /> But here we are. We have Kenobi present for all of these. He knows about the birth of Luke and Lea. Who knows their father and knows what is happening to them. Also, both know the role of R2 and C3PO. And yet, for a few years, Luke looks at such manhood and shows with 3PO and R2 (oddly, 3PO's mind is wiped out, but R2's-why ????) says "I think these drops are related to you" , Kenby, who knows that the Protocol Dyed was made by him, which was considered "designated" and the Emperor as the guardian and believed to be built on this planet, "Odd, I <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < As the identity of Vader, sadly, the story began to tremble beyond control because he did not know what the story was. Episodes 1-3 plot can not be easily understood, and some of Palapetine did not create a reasonable feeling, and in this story, Basically it is not called. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, it reminds me of Triple X. To watch a fun film, but to forget completely Star Wars. My heart will stand forever. Thankfully, this one, and two before that, will soon fade.
