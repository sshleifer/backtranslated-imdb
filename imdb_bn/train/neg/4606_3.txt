This movie should not go to much of the place and probably should not enter it. This was similar to the one that was revealed from the viewpoint of The Cell-In-Kays, although it is not deeply and well-illustrated. The plot is simply built with a primary camp feel. Then, the film is considered to be its "dramatic" turn, and the plot standing some feet to stand in the first place is different. <br /> <br /> The idea is for a child (Chris McKenna) who needs money. She takes the role of a hit man, accounting for a city accountant. Then he did not pay for his work, but he instead tortured for several days because he saw the "brilliant" concept of trying to use a backup file like leverage for payment. This stupid step in trying to force him to give him backfires as this horrible and endless misuse. He started to go crazy (some very annoying scenes). Then, he paid for his sins and thought that he had killed his wife and went to the winner's wife (Curie Wuer) in his love. After the boy followed his persecutors (Daniel Beldwin, George Wende, Vernon Wells) for his previous "kindness", he discovered who, tragedy strikes, and revenge goes through the wind. While asking, what is it with curry rehearsing and horror / cow type films? <br /> <br /> It seems that everything he wrote has been consistent. Imagine, I liked him "eight-legged frames" and he was right in "Anaconda". But all his sharp grit and attraction (wow, he's hot!), He can do a lot of good and can choose a good role. Or maybe, I'm wrong and it's a misconception. For all your people, you will see his "totally Monty" in this movie, although it is weird and short-lived I often felt that he did some soft-porn after seeing this picture (Curry is not foreign to his career). Sex-simulation is such that it makes you wonder what really is going on during filming. <br /> <br /> However, I will say there are some good acting. Do not expect it only from Daniel Bellwin, whose career is forever like his second brother Alex. Although George Wendt (Cheers to Norm) and Vernon Wells (Commando, Wired Science), the film highlights some old man. Above all, Chris McKenna's main character, Shane Crowley, works best to play. His short acting experience and yet a perfect young man of treacherous nature brought some elements of the film's material. <br /> <br /> I will not get out of my way for this. If you are annoyed and tired of the old episode of "Hitachikar", then I can suggest watching it. <br /> <br /> and Curry, please start acting in some good movies!
