There's really no way about saying Bush, Lady Death: Motion Pictures just sucks plain. Sometimes the graphic violence is a good-looking blonde who walks around the Hell in leather bikini, which is the main character, it seems based on a line of painting with cartoon mentality of the 1980s. The bad guy himself is speaking like Schlatter Vanban, the compulsory unknown Henchenmann and Blackstone cartoon seem to have been patterned after the villain's domain since Saturday morning. Sometimes we do not expect any other comedies except for boring bad conversations. Other times, it seems like a good anime story for Heinthey, but despite the physical appearance of the title character, there is no gender, there is no terrorist rape (love!) And very little sex appeal. Until you count this half-naked heroine and bloody death, there is no adult end to this element. Basically, we have what we have here, the length of the character of the Prince of Power, but with skimmium cloth and more Gore.
