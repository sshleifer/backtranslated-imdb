This movie has a lot of adult stars but you failed to be interested in an adult movie. In all the adults you can not get your kicks from any scene. The film shot in a dream like a middle-aged set, which is shameful. Worse than acting Qion Reeves, sex scenes are exciting to hear your neighbors in college at their kids, and the dialogue is bad in a film I've seen. Plots were also 10 times worse. I like the amateur root stick. The audio commentary was ineffective because it was a skin sparkle, even then that was very bad. Unless you have a ruthless twisted James Fan here a little. 4/10
