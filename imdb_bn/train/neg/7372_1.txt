I'm very hesitant. I have been a huge Sigal fan for 25 years. I have seen all his films, and they are dozens I can only describe this image as "malicious". Steven Sigal shared screenwriting and credit creation in this film, but I have a difficult time believing that he will choose a dub in his own voice for many lines, the voice of a thin, ugly imposter is not low. I do not even know if they have to drown some lines, why do their own voices appear on their remaining parts? I hope the Seagal age like us left. But this movie of this movie has just passed a part of the same shedding, self-confidence, barbarism, curiosity and sexual appeal, so she has shown us so easily in all the previous films. I found myself missing that most of her nasty, confident attitude and intense that her ass is so easy to consume in that modesty. His face-to-face and joke that made him such a huge star ??? I hope this movie does not indicate what Siegel has left to offer us - if that is the case, then in the lifetime of the fans, it must be acknowledged that we all knew that Segal and love went away.
