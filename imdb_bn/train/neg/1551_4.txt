Ladies Man is a funny movie. There is not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from SNL movies? It was actually a lot better than most SNL movies (i.e. a superstar or a night at night in Roxbury), Team Mido and Will Ferrer were both very interesting. Chris Panellell was also funny in his small scene (one of the most interesting people in the film). For the rest of the other, the rest of the cast is OK and Meadows is okay to support. I've definitely seen the funnier movie, but I've seen more than the dumber too. Again, this is not a deep movie, but it's good for some laughs. It was as funnier as a skit though. But still, if you are looking for a beautiful funny movie, I'll recommend this one. Just do not worry too much about it, or you'll hate it. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 6/10
