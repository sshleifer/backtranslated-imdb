Well, I had to sit down on the computer and after seeing this pandal of adulteration, I had to write the review immediately. Why? Because I have to tell you how bad it is to say all these movies. It's incredibly bad. To tell you how bad it is, I will offer this little detail about the movie. During Mymensingh's scenes, which is usually associated with shooting or kicking people, they can remove scenes from video games. Yeah, you've heard it right. This movie really sucks. Actually, I think about this incident that the cost of ten dollars to go to the theater this day. And look like dead fill? There is no story to talk about, and the film does not offer occasionally foolhardy shots. I'm really frustrated with this, knowing that I saw it. OK, I'm dumbstruck. It's too bad I could not find the word. Ratings: Zero ***** out.
