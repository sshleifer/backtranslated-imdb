I saw this movie by accident at a movie yesterday. I had some expectations for the movie because I really liked the book based on Spurlos (The Vanishing) and it. The movie starts right there as it seems to be a great thriller at first. The movie is quickly becoming a mess with unintended plots, letters that will never swell and none of the listeners (like Marjok) will take care of terrible editing. The film has made black bits very long, which is too long, a catastrophic growing fantasy that goes back and many scenes that do not add anything to the story and can be easily dropped. After suffering the story you will be seen to be a bad treatment very longest. It should be noted that the film has a few explicit sex scenes that you can use to watch most of the Dutch movies. It is difficult to mention any good thing about this movie. A third of the audience had already gone out of the theater most often in movies and after the film ended I did not hear a kind word. Avoid all costs to this movie. It really damaged any belief that I was left in the movie movie industry.
