As soon as I can, I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time. I did not find the film as 'warm, mentally satisfied'. I'm annoying at it, with music that is confused to the film. The story was thin, characters overdown, and pedestrian on the side. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to write more about this movie, so I will create 10 lines minimum. It is not true and discipline is very important, but IMDB has the worst medium, so it goes away. <br /> <br /> The young child finds a newborn talent, looking for adolescents despite his father's age, cartoon homophobia. Aged, confused counselors drink lots of drinks and teach very little. Conflicts are created. Although I do not think it is an explosive, but if someone thinks this information is too much then I have added the warning. <br /> <br /> In most cases I was annoying and inciting this image. My time is a waste. I do not really understand what this movie looks like about the great quality of this movie. I'm really worth it to avoid. However, Dennis Miller said, "Maybe I'm wrong."
