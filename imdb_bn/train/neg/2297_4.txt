I have started 700 clubs in a short time and have only agreed with a few statements - I am one of the many believers who is considered liberal by most Christians and most conservative by non-Christians. I voted my mind, and it usually rep. Or DM. - I do not believe that the 700 club will tell people what to believe, but it represents many older Christians who grew up in a very conservative background. I think many people have misunderstood about 700 clubs. It bums me out to see the name of the direction call. I think the 700 club people really love Jesus but are so busy that they are trying to vote conservatively that they have forgotten to show love to some people and promote peace like Jesus. Please do not judge Jesus who believe in him based on unconscious people and will not be unaware of our opinion about them. Why do people mean each other?
