I did not expect this going to go much, but still came disappointing. This was the production of the most beloved favorite hologram I have seen in my. I thought it was a comedy, but I was only snickered 3 or 4 joke. Eating donut and seeing a fat guy falling over over is really a fun joke? What was with the mussel in the scene of heaven? Fred Wilde was pleased with some Christopher guest co-operation, but it did not work. Because of the negotiation budget, they have to spend all the budgets to attend "known" actors. It looks like it was portrayed with a video camera and most of the scenes were too dark. In fact does it take many movies to actually shoot a movie and make baskets, such as cutting and editing with a basket? I do not try to be very critical for low-budget comedy, but if you want to watch something interesting about playing a real church basketball instead of this movie.
