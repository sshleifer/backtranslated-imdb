I hired this movie because it was pretty interesting but my horror was the worst movie ever seen in this movie! I read the comment from Gambie 8 and it will be a part of cast or crew. If Gumby-8 is not a demented honest member of a 4-year-old or some of their right minds, no one would think that there was no possibility of this movie. <br /> <br /> I could not believe Gumby-8's comments. Cited: "DUN" inspiration to launch the animation at a faster pace ... This image is moving eyes and works so well that the viewing frequency is not unexpected. <br /> <br /> The animation was the only aspect of the movie which was interesting and it is true that the movie keeps an eye on, because it is looking for any kind of suspense. I mean that I was shot with a break break Halloween with $ 100,000.00 budget and became a painted mask as well as a classical classic. As long as "Repeat viewing is not unexpected" I think he has created a type. <br /> <br /> <br /> Another quote is the only fame from Gambie-8: "Acting is also a powerful aspect of the film." <BR> <br /> With due respect to the actors, their performance is nothing more than Robert Knapton's genius. Interesting tagline: "Eight hours in the evening and in the dark" <br /> <br /> There is no evening or darkness in this picture. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you do not see a sheet on a dead body is some red paint. As far as I know it can be a storm of grass. <br /> <br /> In short, I saw horrible flickers between 50, 60 and 70. I have seen that I was really bad and a little better. The director of this movie did not make any effort, was asleep, or hit acids. Whatever the reason I think the actor's direction deserve respect for trying to save very poor work. I'll give this rating a rating of .5 for the movie 'B'.
