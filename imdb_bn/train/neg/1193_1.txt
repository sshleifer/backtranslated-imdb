How do you ever see a crappy movie with friends and can laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well this was beyond that. I bought DVDs at Tower Records because it was like $ 3.00 and I heard it was a movie that you can laugh. It's a really sad little thing. About 30 minutes in the movie, my friends told me to stop it. About 45 minutes they begged me. After an hour, we compromised to proceed to the end, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and we were looking at Matt Walsh for a full time). Seriously, do not see this movie. It's painful outside.
