LL Cool J has done a great deal in this movie which I hope! He did an excellent job acting as a "renegade" policeman in a "renegade" section. From the very beginning, he has done a great job to develop his sympathy for his character and the accident in which he is in. He acts as a "gentle giant" - a person who can scarcely fear anyone outside, but whose heart is definitely the right place from the very beginning - and he does an amazing job. He was quite clearly the best character in the film. <br /> <br /> This is a performance that Morgan Freeman will not win any prize. This film was certainly a step down after acting in Powerhouse movies like Shashankank Redemption. His role in Edison did not just allow him to display his true talent as an actor - and he kept sadly a back burner in the role of collector of the character. His character (Mushher Ashford) has many ways that can play a more important role. She was not disappointed and let down a true. I was hoping to see more from him in this film. <br /> <br /> Timberlake lived in the music industry. The screenplay of a young journalist was poorly played and irrelevant. This movie is a common action movie (which is initially initially compatible with corrupt police incidents). An action movie, its shoot-up scene, blood and share of the share. This view is usually unrealistic and painfully predictable. At the beginning of the movie it appears that there is very little doubt about what will happen in the end - think of what you usually expect in a good-police / bad-police clash - and it is not compatible with a real police start-out <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Then he finally gets around to use one when he is firing a gun in his entire life as he fire it. Then he fired and did not have a gun - after 30 seconds, without moving or anything - suddenly there are 2 fully loaded guns and extra verandah? <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a fantasy fantasy plot in the world where everything goes well, then perhaps you would love this movie. Personally, it does not matter to me what kind of movie it is realistic as long as it does. Believe me that the story is true. This story was so unclear that I felt very unhappy.
