Can anyone carve the carpenter continuously and deliberately destroy his reputation? How can you go less? It seems that this man lost any self-esteem. <br /> <br /> This episode seems to have been done by a student of a photo, it is not okay to start talking about what was bad, because it is not only boring as a film maker but without any talent or motivation Guided by somebody ... <br /> <br /> Come on, Mr. Carpenter, please retire immediately with confidence and stop trashing in this way. A bad tradition to escape from ghosts of Mars from LA. <br /> <br /> be drunk instead
