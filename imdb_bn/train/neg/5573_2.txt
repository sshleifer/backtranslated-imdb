Godzilla fans feel so nice, really one of the best Godzilla movies. This movie is terrible and I can stand to meet again in some of the Googi films (the other is G. v. Megan) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Those who tried to transform the older Goudizila franchisees into fully functional films, from 1996 to 1974, there was much more to be expected. It just seemed ridiculous, especially with some topics, such as the WWI scene praising Godz's death by accepting Japanese soldiers, a mournful and serious voice, bright former commander counter-capitalist and accepting his death; serious seasons in a movie, his fans smiled As a fool's ramp on miracles, some indication as acting for humor Ray. I've easily seen one of the most tasteless films, though I think it was the only talent lack of filmmakers and it's a direct face-to-face movie. It's much worse than the bad effects, especially from the Jet Packs to Android, the effect of the words emanating from everything from hockey, it is impossible to take something seriously, and still expect you to film it <br /> <br /> Almost all of Godzilla There is an unmatched romance like film, and this is no exception, though it is particularly stupid and unreasonable. There is no literal reason for romance, it only happens and promises 360 degrees. In addition to this, another horror view of this movie is dialogue, both Japanese and English are awesome, confused, and perhaps inspiration for the battlefield world. <br /> <br /> The Tista DVD compounds the problems that make everything look great I first saw the Japanese Zone 2 version and the differences between night and day, real vibrant colors and textures, significant scores, especially the war scenes are really visible. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the Gezi series is frustrating, except for the Gaddijila 1984 (Japanese version) there is little praise, and Godzilla vs. King Ghidora is the case in case of this failure. It does not even come near the fame and fame worthy of the fans. <br /> <br /> 10 out 2
