Once a friend told me that when an independent independent film ran in a movie - when the film was closed - the audience was so angry that they had to tear the seats before filming. Of course, my imagination ran Amok, trying to upgrade the contents of such a piece of work. Well, now my imagination can be rested. <br /> <br /> I am the fan of Andy Tarkowski forever and a bright fan of his work. I've seen a lot of people who are playing Tarkovsky movies slowly and inactive. Opinion What they are getting, I do not get to be true to this late director's wonderful work, which is made with meaning, beautiful composition, and complex philosophical questions. After the hearing Alexander Sokurov called Tarkovsky's successor, I was excited about his film experience. <br /> <br /> Without exception of the open air journey through field (STK), Tarkovsky has done some of this movie has no relation. It does not even seem to possess even the slightest amount of a complete stupid level. It's supposedly "gorgeously stark" cinematography ineffective any composition. There is no balance, no ratio, and the exposure meter seems to be running low on frozen ice batteries. The main character is so neutral and unknowable, it makes you wonder if his father can not keep alive if he does his mind as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> I'm not progressing in progress or story lines too many non-linear fashion. But there is also a non-story. Someone can not see the movie with the movie. If someone does not get it, and nothing gets lost, like the only possible answer to the hair, Tarkski might see the time sculpture as Jerry. <br /> <br /> I said, this might be one of the Sukruo stickers (Tarakovsky's Solaris), but I will not make any decision to be one of Tarkovsky's heirs. Paris Hilton will be called the successor of Aristotle. Mom, do not be afraid to say No big impressive word is secretly going to bring back the dead body of celluloid. I do not fully understand the Russian culture and I probably do not have Russian prices, but I immediately took Tarzowski's work as magical, a treasure and gifts to the audience immediately. <br /> <br /> There was no name of Socraura, and it was proclaimed Saturday Night Live, I'm sure nobody will be able to "read" this awesome analysis in this wet noodle of this flash.
