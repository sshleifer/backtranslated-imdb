I enjoyed Billal's graphic novel, when I came out, I was surprised to see the trailer of this movie, even when I saw that Bilal himself had instructed. However, the film was a big disappointment. Visuals are not near the rich and silky textures of the original artworks, and the story is called bad. Bilal seems to like to focus on the more confidential aspects of graphic novels and he does not work very well at it. <br /> <br /> The most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was friendship hatred between Nikopol and Horus. They both compel them together by the situation, out of their proper time and place. Most, they were fun and favorite. Not so here. Nicopol has no visible personality, and Horus is simply a crazy crazy who just wants to get laid. The picture is French, but it does not have to be Horos! <br /> <br /> We all saw the movies we enjoyed, but none of the others would be recommended for anyone. I will not recommend immortel to anyone other than a warning not to overreach your talents and resources. Bilal is a major story-story, but obviously the master of every visual medium.
