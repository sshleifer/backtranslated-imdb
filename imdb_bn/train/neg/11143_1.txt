Hi, I'm a friend of Verhuvil movie, and when I saw the title of DarkWolf, hit Takbir, then I would like to see the ham, simple and beautiful name at least. Althu ... I'm surprised why I have not heard it before. "<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>" > <br /> So, about the character of mysterious dark doll (little spoilers forward, but really care ...) He ascended your average motorbike every day. Even the strange looks, but the old bij As the film says in the movie, "It is much stronger and more dangerous than before." Only a tattoo bike type is described by a guy, a beautiful piece, for the first time, I was looking twice while using the special effects of "red burning eyes!" I say My creator is saying, "Let's go with the computer-plant-red-dot-eye-computer" effect has been used for seventy years, it's here. Bright looks ugly! Do not start with me, bherubola 3D-CGI. As I told you, like a bad and old video games. <br /> <br /> And finally, I like movies like oyeyaraoyalera, as I told you. They prettymuch always build a variegated legend of their own. Darkball also produces Vernuboard, hybrid-bearwater and some stupid legends of ancient blood pressure. But then It often begins with the intention of selfishness, "Anyone who kills the person kills the girl and starts" random-slashing. Which just does not give any idea, why bother the rules of killing us, even when they can not even play by them ... Wolf-point-of-view shots include Sony Handycam or some, most of the floor and wall painting. Just add boom noise and you have a super windfall effect. Gore is partially okay. But when the wolf breaks everyone with open hands, only basically puts the hands on the victims, then it does not make me a joke ... <br /> <br /> In fact, WHO makes money from these junk straight-to-video horatilals Make them, they're not even funny-like bad movies, just sad.
