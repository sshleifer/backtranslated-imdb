If it is not Barry Diamond and Art Evans' ruthless stoner, then I have no reason to recommend this to anyone. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A supposed abandoned high school (less than a 1950s low budget horoscope is more like a prima Shows), and deranged students drawn on a very traumatizing gimmick. This student wants to kill the whole class for revenge. <br /> <br /> John Hughes loves his character too much, because a student dies and Lunch Ladies (Goneys of Anna Ramsey). We believe that horny couples are killed, but no explosions happen! This is a horror film that continued the downward spiral of National Lampoon in the 80's and 90's.
