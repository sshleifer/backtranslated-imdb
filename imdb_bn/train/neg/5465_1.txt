This picture is a special place in my heart that I have ever seen. It is almost as fun as hard manual labor with stomach cramps. The movie starts bad (I'll rate 1/10/10 in the first few minutes of the film) and then it gets worse, minutes in minutes. The only way to rate it is ninety-nine, something like the unstable negative numbers that are growing for a long time. Unfunny is not a real word, but it best describes the humor in this video. Somehow a video that drives even intelligent, gimmicky female and sexual looks to be extraordinary and annoying. This movie is amazingly bad. I would say it would be better to lock in with your drops on top of your ear rather than overview with TITNAIX theme and viewing your movie with the SSSPA's BASAMI character from LASK. Sequels are not nearly as bad. If you are hiring a tromba movie then get Tromso and Juliet or Combat Shock. I would rather look back at the NUKEM High Class Class 5 Tony Little Infirmals back to see. Do not make me wrong, it's a crime genius for making a terrible movie, and if one ever gets a qualifying qualification for being a movie horror, that's it.
