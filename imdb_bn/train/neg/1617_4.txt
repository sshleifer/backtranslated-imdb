What a wonderful movie <br /> <br /> There are certainly no special offers for Hollywood special effects or entertainment. No background music, no special effects or advanced sound. <br /> <br /> The face expression of the face is usually covered by a thick beard and the Spanish language is a weird monotonic slope which speaks in a war or around a campfire. <br /> <br /> I saw these movies (part 1 and 2) as an educational experience, really nothing to go and entertaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> I suspect that due to lack of any plot development, I do not think it is very educationally. <br /> <br /> It is also difficult to understand any story from a movie conversation - a good idea to read a little over the history, so that you understand the context of what is happening, because for some reason the director is not able to tell the audience why Che's band did what they did Moving around - As a result, groups around the woods seem to be spreading and getting shots for a specific reason. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie a bigger star anyway, I have more sympathy for myself and develops depth of character, but the way all the characters are still unknown to me. They find what they get for the reality and the trouble of guerrilla warfare.
