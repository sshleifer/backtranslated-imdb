Squimish came to a new town as 11-year-old Luke Benver (Billy "Worm Boy" Forster). In his new school, young Benverah was picked up by other boys. They kept the worm in its thermos. Under the control of his Gaga reflex, BenWest tosses a worm on the face of the weird face Adam Hicks (as Joe Guue). Benward bets he can eat 10 worms a day - without regurgitation! <br /> <br /> Tally, Halley Kate Egersberg (like Erica "Ark" Tansi) uses her arrow skills to help her BenWard. Director and former SCTV writer Bob Dollex promised, "There was no worm in the film making." In a related note, SCTV star Andrea Martin has a funny scene. "How to Bright Worms" is based on Thomas Rockwell's popular novel. <br /> <br /> **** How to eat free worm (8/25/06) Bob Dolman ~ Look Benver, Adam Hicks, Holly Kate Egersensberg, Alexander Gold
