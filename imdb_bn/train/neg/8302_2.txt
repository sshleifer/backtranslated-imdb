Funny is a studio that can do a make of a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and think how it float. Of course, he used different actors for Batman, but in the case of an actor, before being released his Cape Batman was a classic character. In this case you had a classic character in the horny horn horny rimmed glasses wearing bullfight that wanted a red rider BB gun for Christmas ... just as we will forget him and accept another little boy who has a similarity with the root. If I did not know it There was a signal but I could not guess it by throwing ... Of course Barrell Gradin Darren McGavin's favors Trying so hard to fight that you constantly feel that the original was great ... <<br /> <br /> Finally, it has made the movie even better, but it may have work. They should look to see a choice or simply ignore the parent and should not try to copy his appearance and feelings. This one is just a cheap imitation. Ralphi does not show any sympathy for her character to shoot or die in her eyes.
