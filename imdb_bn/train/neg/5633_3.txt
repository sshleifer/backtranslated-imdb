The Italian-born Elonora inherited from his dead boyfriend Karl, a modern and isolated house in Jessore. It is winter and meets the mysterious caretaker Leslie, who eventually watches the house, but also trying to cope with Alonora with increasing attraction between her new surroundings and couples. What am I expecting Indeed a thriller, but it was not quite so. That's just package advertising packages! I'm pretty annoying about everything. Headlines, stories and motivation. So how can it be classified? Well, the story of this wooden character is a wonderfully story of the separation of moody romance, occupation and reliance between two masked people into a complexly enthusiastic relationship.
