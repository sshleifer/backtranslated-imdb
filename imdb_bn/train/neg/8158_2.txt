What is the point of preparation for the sequel, without any relevance to the original movie? There is no point. That's why Promo's Night Signals are so shamefully bad. <br /> <br /> The original film is a group of dark secret secret children that forced them all to be killed, in the cruel treatment of revenge. Could anyone please explain to me that the rise of Israel from grave in the dead dead will be the crown of the first movie? There was a continuous plot hole in Promotion Night 2, which continues to surprise audiences how it happened and why would it happen? But in the end, I guess you can call it one of the movies that is so bad, you just hang out on yourself.
