Need the name of this movie for Speed: The Movie For those who are not playing games for Speed ​​Speed, most of them are hot cars and beautiful women and there is almost no plot. This redline is perfectly applicable. The only thing in this movie of A-level was the car. Acting was compulsory and written, the court was the best flimsy, and the plot was almost helpless. I actually saw this movie how bad it was and when it was bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just saw Edgie Griffin crashing Enzo in the movie. Above all, do not pay for it, do not go out of your way to see it, but it is a decent distortion if it is not in Showtime or HBO and nothing else.
