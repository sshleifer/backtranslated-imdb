This film is about a woman rapist / comic book writer in New York who decided to move away from this giant big city Glamor and decided to leave a dirty, small town where it finds shelter for a single wide trailer on a floor. 12th and somewhere in the middle. The dude is mentally ill, yet he is invited to invite crazy men in his trailer. The annoying incident is that he has the power to do the right thing to keep himself in dangerous situations after under dangerous circumstances. DB Swine Performance was the best high school. She is one of those kinda-cute young actors with a sweet grin. Unfortunately the job has not been done and the nature of the mother has been right in the rope. I well agree with the previous commentator that the act was "so real" Actually it was not acting. The two main characters are really mature, making healthy decisions are weak and incompetent. In short, this movie sucks like something else, lends it to laughing. Real crime scene? Plugging the trailer in the woods - killing me enough to kill. And ultimately, he is an artist / writer, so he could not afford anything else without a double-wide trailer and a sun-yellow shaver Chevette for the love of God!
