All hip! Which is a good way to embarrass a movie that they are annoyed because they can not publish their movie through mainstream distributors? As a result, they do it themselves. Otherwise, the film campaign does not justify the content of the film. The story is missing and can easily be a short. Acting poor, but animations and music are quite good. Do not waste your time otherwise - do not believe the hip! However, if you get a chance to watch the movie, please do so. Then you do not have to waste money. Still, filmmakers do a good job of claping their story and creating Cliffhanger with their self-liberated small series. Otherwise, they were the one who hit the wonders who ever hit.
