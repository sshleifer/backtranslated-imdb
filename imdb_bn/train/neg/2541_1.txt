I have never seen the original movie in Syria ... I hope it was like a better film than the 1980s or the same as in the 1980s, that it was not just how these two awesome signals were fair. When this movie is really shown in one of the old independent stations of the past, it was a really good leadership in the advertisement. Anyway it looked like it would be a pretty scary movie. This is a movie that some Walt Disney movie will look dark. Actually, this film was simply a bunch of light lungs that could not be seen. Near the end of the only real philosophy, when you see its shape during heavy rainfall, there is no trace of any other animal that is really frustrating as a child. The story is essentially the story of the old predators who have to be killed, and the cottage animals and the children are out of the help of some random men who like to help or drag random boats in the water. I do not really want to see the real, but its creator will create the evil muscular creatures of 80, but have created a very good slasher in the 70's "The Town The Dredged Sundown".
