This is one of the many films shown on the afternoon after noon in the afternoon to entertain long horse dresses among these people. Acting second rate The poor Matthew Modin seems to be sleeping through the whole film. And God helped Gina Gerson. Its pronunciation is too much above. It does not seem like a true english woman. It's a lot like its acting, forced and swelling words. What he wants to do best, is the label Weberger Con-Artist who plays a rock and roll band and has a drug problem. No other letter is any good They are two dimensional. Empty, vapid and silly How are we supposed to take care of these people? At one point Christie Scott Cashman lost in Central Park. Really? Central Park is not difficult to navigate. Just follow any path. I just do not care about any of the characters, I hate them cruel. I was the only reason for this movie's train-ruins, with Fisher Stevens Even his brilliant humor can not save these dead fish. Each scene is usually rented romantic comedy and nothing is left to surprise us. The script was terrible. If you catch this fish throw it back!
