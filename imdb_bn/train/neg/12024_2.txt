Most annoying surprises I have seen several times. The plot was full of incomplete, and the long time I played was the worst. To make it even worse, camera angles that made me sick were used, incidental music was terrible and the conversation was sinking (probably not a bad thing), and a shot from San Francisco seemed like they were The promotional video of the city tourism board was stolen directly. <br /> <br /> Oh, and mandatory sex scenes did not even work well in half. Good times, good times
