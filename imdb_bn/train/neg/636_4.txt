In a small village in China, some farmers struggle for life. Wang Fuong (Paul Muni) bought O-Lan from his future wife, who became his slave (Luis Rena). The American star appears in leading roles, talking to fake act and emphasizing the old stereotype and patriotic ideology. Good things for a good wife, many children and land men They are seen as property and investment. Because it is a big budget movie, many of which are cooperative, big sets are made and special effects take place, filmmakers can not risk the recruitment of less popular actors. Louis Renner won the Academy Award for this role, which is certainly the worst in the movie. His unexpected face created an obstacle between him and the audience. O-Lante is supposed to be the best character for the heart and sympathy of the family. Paul Muni, on the other hand, gave a good performance, again showed his talent. Another problem with the movie ends. Franklin does not seem to know the end of the picture. This film can be dangerous if taken as a true example of Chinese culture and heritage.
