I just did not get this movie ... was it a musical instrument? No .. but there was a choreographed song and dance ... <br /> <br /> It was a serious drama ... no acting was good enough for him. <br /> <br /> Huawei Goldberg is a quality serious actor .. clearly not. <br /> <br /> I had difficulty keeping up with this controversial movie. The alphabet and "tribute" message of students who died during the compromise of the students were mentioned. But as entertainment it was very poor and it was bad as a documentary style movie. <br /> <br /> See for yourself, but justify I hate it
