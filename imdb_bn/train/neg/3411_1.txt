Extremely tropical locations, Skinny dress blasts, explosions, handsome doodle do-right clones, behind her best years (Murray Shane) is a movie star, a little martial arts and a sexy valentines (Tracy Laure ..... Tracy Elizabeth Lords) and you think you will be for some escapist fun. is not it!

Girls spend too much time posting and try to prissy very look and it gets annoying after a while. There's this good consistent stuff out there. Oh yeah, and "babes" they do not feel as they feel hot. Awesome soundtrack ... when it's there.
