The film was not waste without some annoying scenes. But women's castings give commendable good performances than ridiculous men. <br /> <br /> But Christa Allen really entered the movie. His voices were so seduced and sexy. Cat's scenes could have been involved in Christ, but it could make it so much more spectacular and sex workers than anyone could. Crete is truly the best of such a role. In the last 5 minutes he has made a quiet calm law as Baddie, which is an interesting part of the movie. <br /> <br /> Bert Reynolds was not good and it was not his best as the action star. She can choose a better script than this. He thinks he has done for money.
