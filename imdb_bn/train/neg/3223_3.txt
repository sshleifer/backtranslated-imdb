Ha ha ha! It's not a bad way to start. I was originally at it, but then I discovered it was a clone of King Kong's 1976 remix. I have never seen King Kong at the age of 15. I saw this movie at 9 years of age. Fakki disco music can be stuck on your head! The pilgrims do not mention the theme theme song. This is the worst animal effect I've ever seen. At the same time, this image remains a sacred cove of B-movies. Remarkable quotation: "Take a tranquility and go to bed." "Keep your tails in the tank and have the power of your pilgrim." I remember seeing this movie in Movie Makro directed by Elvier. There is a scene where it was against King Kong! She held the girl in King Kong and climbed up the building, but in this film she kept the building high and hold the girl (who was killed)! Also in the same year, another con clown Maiti Picking Man (1977) came from Hong Kong. There are a lot of travel Matt's view and motorized body parts. This film can leave you smile I said, just another King Kong Clone. PG Rate for Violence, Language, Thematic Material and Some Scary Scenes
