This picture was bad because it was not something interesting about it. It was a rebuild sort but then again, not really. I was very disappointed by Tim Burton considering its settlement tools. He got lots of make-up and CGI and got a lot of money ($ 100m), but can you really say that what we got was just as good as the original movie less than six million US dollars? Not hack So in this case, the film failed. At least in the original film, the image of the scene of freedom was frustrating, but the last scene in this movie was also not a cause for disappointment because you can see it coming. And, however, if you think about it, and I have, you can determine how it might end. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> One astronaut (it's really much better than Marquee Mark) It was because he was not good enough to take care of a movie by himself) So I thought I could have another planet, people would face (not silent), a city governed by Afghanistan, was hunted, some Closed with good apes Creating, discovering that they are on earth through the destruction of some destroyed ruins, running between the dead mutant people living under the last earth, a war break between mutants and apes, and then .... well, you want to end it, how your imagination is wild <br /> <br /> But my point may be much more in this film. Sadly, Tim Burton is really a good thing to destroy. Took. He considered what to do with Batman. Despite what people think he is a weak manager. He is thought to be common, so he's good. Sorry, but not If someone else did this film then it would have been better and they were even more satisfied.
