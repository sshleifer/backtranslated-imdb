After we calculated using the word within the first 10 minutes or about 22 times, I heard some bad actors about a woman and a horse, and most of the 12 year old boy is naughty together, well, we turned it off. Depending on unwanted prejudice and soft humor, a sure sign of Holding Hollywood, products of unimaginable and non-talented writers. <br /> <br /> We gave it a second chance, thinking it would be better. No pasha Later, my boyfriend ran through the rest of the movie, if it gets better then there is no dice. <br /> <br /> The main character had a cool bike. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend any other than the really unexpected teenager, or frat boys.
