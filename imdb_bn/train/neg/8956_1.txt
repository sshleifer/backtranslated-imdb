Very disappointing for the first two films, the first is no doubt, the first is no doubt and the second is not interested. By focusing on the horses 'whirling', it mainly removes the significance of any tension in the cube, because we simply do not take care of the letters inside. Most of the film is just boring, and it just becomes terrible with the glass-eyed upper and green-eyed crazy marine roles. After that, though, it's just above unknown strangers. Although the last is appropriate, it is the first type of back in an indirect way. The script is terrible, the best performing medieval, and unexpected aspects. A very few follow.
