This movie is not made by fans. Wonderful moments of looking at Tommy Models half a hour in Tommy Models are only missed or shiny: On Christmas, they did not show screams of dirty after the line "Tommy does not know what day ..", they showed almost no * Townsend guitar shots in the Pinball Wizard, At the best moment there were lots of crowd shots and the worst was, in the second half we are not going to take it (listening) you ), They robbed us of almost every shot of Pitt's burning guitar chords. The bulk of the pictures shot from the back of the band. It does not offer a very frustrating movie and products to watch. I do not know if director Muri Lara is not a fan, or worse than that, at least for him, if he is a fan and this * eight * camera can provide for him. Its credits, some rare numbers before Tommy, as well as some faves, that are very good shots, and sometimes editing is brighter. It can be enough for the viewer to be happy, until you're Tommy estimates. The transmission that I saw from DirecTV was a moderate medium; It can be different from video or DVD.
