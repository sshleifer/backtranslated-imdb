Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad What else can i say Kate Jackson will be frustrated directly. Maybe he will have to act ... On second thought he was a bad actress. Who will make sense to produce these bad things. I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good smile and strange fear but it's just bad bad. You were played by a soap opera bigger than found out. Special effects, where you can call them, ridiculous. If you act in a slow scene, I would not be surprised if you can find blood germ in the tubes. We only had to close the disc after 30 minutes. These so-called films should destroy original prints, all discs and tapes have been destroyed, and all people associated with the filmmaking need to refund money for film rentals. Then those people should not allow movies, direct movies, or movies of their own home movies.
