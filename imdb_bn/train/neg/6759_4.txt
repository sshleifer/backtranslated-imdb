Better betting on video shot-on-video quality in another case of a suitable DVD case. <br /> <br /> It was not bad. Rokon is a job and it's great! Throwing is looking good. I have not seen many musclebound guys that hangouts together on a regular basis. This movie really wanted to remind you that Rokon was a killer, but it would not have been. My biggest problem with the film was that, ultimately, I did not take care of the killer much and the real killer was a little intelligent, because it was out of the blue and the filmmakers thought, 'Hey, do not worry that's coming, sucker! '. Yes, there was a continuation error about it (mainly Mr. Rokon's always changed clothes), but it is not bad for an Indy Scassar. At the beginning I was sure that it was just a thin stylish excuse for the girls to wake up, but it was just a hostage. The dialog was mostly thought-provoking and painful. <br /> <br /> Just high expectations are not going to do this, and it will not be bad. And Lloyd Kaufman's Camio is surprisingly different.
