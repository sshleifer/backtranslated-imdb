So, Promoting Night was supposed to be a horror and thriller movie. I got a big wuss and got scared to watch this movie at the beginning, but after watching it, it's not horror nor thriller. <br /> <br /> It was so expected because I was basically having fun in the movie on my seats. You can predict what's going to happen in the future. Young actors were right to play their characters, but I said the killer must have been at the top of the game - the actors. <br /> <br /> Yes, I will offer the plot because it was good, but it's not exciting or scary. There was almost zero "jump-in-your-seat" scene. So, do not waste ten dollars to watch it in the theater, it comes to the DVD.
