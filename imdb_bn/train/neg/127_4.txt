Due to all the controversy surrounding it during the first liberation war in 1967, I became quite annoyed with my video store. I also heard that it was first seized by US Customs, as if it tried to enter this country, so a fan of films considered "controversial" had to look it for myself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> He particularly wants to focus his view of making some kind of documentary about Sweden's opinion about certain political issues, such as the United States of Vietnam War and ethnic problems. When politicians and politicians with the opinions of politicians in politics, while asking ordinary citizens of Stockholm, he has sex with his drama teacher, classmate and married man. <br /> <br /> What can I kill for? Before, this is considered obscene. Indeed, sex and nudity scenes are low and far, even then it is not shot like some cheaply shot-shot. Although my countrymen think it is frustrating, reality sex and nudity are a major staple in the Swedish cinema. Even Engmer Bergman, the old son answered John Ford, his pictures had sex scenes. <br /> <br /> I commend filmmakers for the achievement that a sex act shown in this film is shown rather artistic. Shown in America's pornographic theaters, rather than shocking and earning money. I'm serious - a good film for someone who is not wanting to study Swedish film meat and potatoes (for any punishment purposes). But really, this film does not have much of a plot.
