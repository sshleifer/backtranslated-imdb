I'm not saying a big fanciful fan. However, this picture is not for me. Many remote arguments are trying to support this movie's claim that the dragon probably probably existed. The film mentions connections in different countries, but failed to investigate them more thoroughly, which could give some credibility to the film. Using the film (beautiful!) CGI is a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon life to tell. It matches some of the popular TV-show-CSI-Style Flash-Forwarders, which is something to look like, which is not clear. In many cases arguments / sources are remotely. In some cases, dragons are probably used to exist in the perfume, or the flames or fire spills are simply illegal. Seeing this makes me just get cramped in my toes. Even some fantasy film requires some degree, but it does not have it. The following line: This is a provocative imagination-CSI documentary, not valuable.
