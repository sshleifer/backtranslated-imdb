Yet another "boy will not be that big" flick, and just like other recent entries. Another bad wedge for Haidar, Napoleon to the channel, for the third time, what? Anna phiris always forgot, as always; Jeff Daniels has called this one from at least another country; And Dean Keaton ... How does this type of writing get delayed in a career? Do not disturb. It is not said here that it has not been covered for many times. I'll say it; This is hundred times better than "failure to launch". There are very little bit of movies in the movie, unless you think Eli Walach curse is funny. Haha He is old and he bombed! T hey, hey Poor!
