When you now see it and hear all the languages ​​here, it's amazing that it was rated "PG", but it's a 1970 rating system for you. Peter Faw announced the name of God six times in the first ten minutes of this movie! Still, some people feel objectionable and of course, not all of the film makers scammers and those who "rate". <br /> <br /> How silly this movie can be: Folk, Peter Boyle, Alan Garfield, Warren Oats, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino are not just actors who can not be found in "Sound of Music". <br /> <br /> I like the Hastic movie, and many movies by the director William Friedkin, but this script does not distribute and thinks it is "visible and audible" in many ways of "Sleazy 70s". For those who liked Folk at TV's "Colombo", he would have been shocked to use such filth as he did in the film. This is far from the only case.
