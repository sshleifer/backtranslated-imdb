The original Lensman series of novels is a classic series. It's pure adventure SF with some substances (here and there) and I've always wondered why Hollywood has not filmed it verbally, because it's just the kind of thing they want: huge explosions, excessive arms, uber-heroics, heroes, girls, alien Great CGI potential), pure vs good evil, etc. Instead (and remember I'm Japan-O-Fail and Anime Lover) we get this awesome Kiddies movie which rushes out the story, mixes with Star Wars (mocking occasionally bursting books) pastries and the whole thing in the 'Thundercutts' stage Drops. To see Kimble Kinson, the character of the Galactic Patrol Officer and the second level lensman portrayed as a little boy, kind (etc.). I do not understand why the makers did this because perhaps they had the right to story and could earn more money directly (FAR!). I do not understand it.
