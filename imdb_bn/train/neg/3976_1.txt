The plot was frustrating, the girls were very ill and the supposed Italian man's obviously not heard the Italian accent. Some said these boys were very nice to boys, but it seems like they were filled with medium people. <br /> <br /> I think there is no freedom fighter about this movie. <br /> <br /> I think it is a graveyard for actors who will never work, due to the unfortunate exception of the lazy couples who can impress people for obvious reasons. <br /> <br /> I hope the Olsen couples find something to stay away from the entertainment industry. They have no place in it.
