This violent film has some terrific intriguing ideas that if it is explicitly executed, it may be something special from Spaghetti-Western Bloodnes. Unfortunately, one of the worst editing movies imaginable in a Town Hall of Calligl. The scenes start and end, the characters leave for long stretches, the performance of the actors (and accents) is quite inconsistent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To erase a village, be a priest! (!) ... Ten years later the village is run by "Mayor" Tele Salwa. Stella Steven came to take revenge for killing her husband. Colonel Martin Landau is searching for the Shao! They all shout to one another and they all shot each other. Fernando Ray is it too (as a blind man) too. Performance is not bad, but they are extremely unbalanced. Sometimes Ladowo (as it actually hangs here) has a pronounced as savalas. Shaw ray proves that he does not make himself embarrassed and Stevens looks very nice (if a bit sweaty away from the place in dirty).
