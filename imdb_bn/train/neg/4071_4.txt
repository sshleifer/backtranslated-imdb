A young man killed a young girl for no reason. He was imprisoned for his brother's accusation, but soon ran away. While fleeing, innocent innocent kidnapped three people, and soon he kept his girlfriend on the plot. If this is not bad enough, the situation quickly makes a sub spiral. <br /> <br /> This picture was somewhat good and very bad. Her strong point of view was lead actress Emily Hack. In this film, he is giving up the naked truth, he presented himself as a capable actress and a very strong character. I have not been able to accept this experience and in no way have seen no reason to make it a career. I am convinced that he was a cruel person. <br /> <br /> Also, the makers of this film were very brave and no fifty pieces were drawn. Graphic nudity (both male and female), hypophia, and extreme analogous violence are not shy away from. I like to restrict my scary films, and they ignore them absolutely, look at the misery towards happiness. Maybe it was too much, but I think they did what they were looking for. <br /> <br /> But now the negative direction. First, and most notable, this film shows these at very low budget and film quality. I can excuse it - the plot was honest, the acting fine, and the low-quality movie in some scenes actually make the movie more annoying (a more realistic feeling). So, I will not be scolding them for having low grade equipment. What I would scold them for using the poor choice in the shot. For some reason I can confirm (in addition to the film), there is a large number of footage in a cemetery. I do not really know why, and I definitely started dozing off at this time because it was so long and vain. <br /> <br /> I take issue with the title. Here the idea is to deceive people that this film was my relationship with the classic "I spit in your grave". Now, there is a line in which the main character is the daughter of this other movie girl. And the theme is very loosely similar (being a woman revenge on men). But there is no strong connection and to buy this title, the video store customer feels that they have got a sequel. It was deceptive and dishonest. <br /> <br /> My last big complaint is that this plot does not make any real sense. Not too little For some reason a woman dies at the beginning. When a fisherman escapes, he finds time to kidnap people to torture, because for some reason (because they resisted his girlfriend?) The same man goes from bad to worse without explaining. Likewise, female leadership (hacks) can not be natural to cruel and sad person for any reason for some reason, and in most cases it has only small meaning (supplying narcotics to a neighbor sex is wrong, but should not be tortured for any benefit). <br /> <br /> This title does not claim to fool you or the film is incredibly frustrating. Yes, some scenes were frustrating, but the vast majority of the film is soft and you want to take a repression. If you see it in the video store or netflix, just keep browsing. Or rent it, and we can sit around and fly around it for hours. You have been warned.
