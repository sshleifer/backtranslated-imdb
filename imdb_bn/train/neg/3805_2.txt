Err ... this movie sucked. A little tall <br /> <br /> I'm reading some other reviews. There are apparently many people who think that Woody Allen has written or stars among them are automatically ... <br /> <br /> I saw some of his films, hoping for nothing that I lost something. But no, they just suck. Wrong Written Trash All of the characters are very stereotypical (rather than mentioning stupid). Plot ... I think it is considered mysterious. That's not sure. Mr. Allen's character ... Woody Allen, you've been seen in any movie. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Woody Allen, check out this movie. Do not get annoyed if you are under 50 years old. (If you are a fan of Woody Allen and you are under the age of 50 ... well, you are unusual. I do not know what I want to say.)
