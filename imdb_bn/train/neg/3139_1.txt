Firstly, as a member of Titanic's disaster for many years and as a member of several titanic clubs, I think I am entitled to comment on this film. I really do not care how much the film has been rewarded and played, but for me it is still a terrible movie. Cameron's disaster was the property to produce a 'decent' semi-documentary film, but unfortunately it was chosen to turn into a purely romantic face. It has decreased for so many people all over the world that only my mind, sadness of taste, and film critics and viewers have common ideas in these days. Anyone will say that the hero and heroine love fall in all movies? In fact most of the actual events were romantic addition and the Titanic disaster was certainly not. I think it is a good script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little as possible to require a little artistic license. I nearly threw the last sequence where 'dead' lovers ended up in the meeting between other lost passengers and crew who broke into applause. Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.
