If it is a 2008 product in one of the largest production houses of the Indian Film Industry (Yash Raj), I think it is too long for us to reach the right standards. <br /> <br /> If you can Anil, Akshay, Saif and Kareena go wrong in this length with such a big star cast, then the film creation will still be studied much harder by everyone associated with this film. There is a lack of cinematography and almost all sections of the film except Akshay Kumar. He has some good dialogue, but that does not shine with great expectations. <br /> <br /> The first scene from the hills to the river is a very cheap graphics cartoon film. That was itself a clear indicator of the director's vision. Other actors who are otherwise easily spoiled a resource in a movie. Anil Kapoor's fascination for the best English effort is flat on most of the time. And Saif must think why he signed this film. <br /> <br /> It's the biggest asset after "Hurry repeatedly jum" after childhood. I would like to say that even "Aaja Nachle" was a much more enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> No one can understand why such a script is written and approved. The flashback sequence of Akshay's love story was most unwanted. After the faulty script, the weakest aspect of the movie is its music. Only a few fillers of each song of huge learning have tunes. The songs start very well and suddenly the melodies drop slowly. The only song "Falak Rak Rice" is so good. <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In the next scene, they are looking for Kareena of Haridwar and then looking for their car at Karen Hill. <br /> <br /> If you can sit to the end, then climax is too long with stupid and unnecessary stunts. All the heroes who walk through a bullet storm can see if they are not Allah. Are we still watching a 2008 movie with all these technological achievements? So there is no sound on this sad and downgrade movie, but sincere request from senior fans to their fans. <br /> <br /> Dear Anil Kapoor and Akshay Kumar, if possible, ask for the preview of your movies after their first copy. As a comedian, you have some responsibilities towards your fans and visitors. People are still blurred for you as you enter screens in your first scene. I think this kind of movie can not be seen in the light of day because it frozen all the fame related to both film, actor and production house.
