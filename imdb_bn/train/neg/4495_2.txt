Follow the spellers of both this and matrix. <br /> <br /> I like the great matrix a great deal. It was not a deep film to try fishing, but it was quite fun, funny and I had a soft spot for fighting Hong Kong. <br /> <br /> Originally, Neo was a secret life, rather unhappy working worker Anderson. Day, corporate drone, and night, brave hacker. Finally, finally he is forced to choose between these activities through his actions - whether he has been war criminal against the instrument, or he has returned safely, forgotten world, he is back again. Interestingly, he discovered that once hanging the delusion, rather the life sucks. She has her daughter by her side and her groom escort, but she swill the process, sweats dresses, and really skunky bit equipment buses. Yet the truth makes him free. <br /> <br /> The fun part of the first viewer was raised in the minds of the audience, "What was" if _I_ is impossible? I was "one" if I was. It's a matter of what you do not even have a problem, with a great title like this. Also, Agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy, because he pretended to be scared of the authorities we carry with us. He was unstable as a terminator, and as neutral. <br /> <br /> At the end of the matrix, Neo must return to the matrix to share the good news of independence. <br /> <br /> This film fails to completely complete the original film ideas and it works with the lack of a teacher, such as writing poor scripts and such bad edits as I can not believe they planned these changes. When the dialogue is in the fifth grade level, while the lengths of the various words are randomly reduced, I believe that what they say is difficult to understand. <br /> <br /> My short list of characters' failure: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No, cute idea, but not just a character interesting . <br /> <br /> <br /> Fishburn loses its "adviser" role, and gets nothing to replace it with. <br /> <br /> People of Zion are particularly fond of, or are you really running them in the world _want_ <br /> <br /> Special effects problem: <br /> <br /> The war scene is pointless and intermable. In the Matrix, you felt Neo could defeat, and she had to be bigger in order to survive. On the Matrix Reloadload, he is simply a particularly vulnerable plotting video game scene. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Because we do not think of good dance and good fingers, we knew about the people we portrayed No, and we do not care too. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A hacker should be blacklisted by the builder's soliloquy business. It is frustrating, the words used by Sprite are not clearly understood, and were wasted time and a pasic killer. The Creator's statement can be completed within 10 months and with more danger, "Zion gives a place to let the rebels go, so that they do not destroy the Matrix, now many people who do not believe that despite the killing and killing of every person who has caused the catastrophe, the people of Sion Can not support, others can be alone. You are a person from Zion Who can choose to form a new Sion, when I delete memory memories, people in the Matrix are now. <br /> <br /> Instead, we got a long, stretched touch. If someone argues that it is deep, ask for a transcript Try and break the sentences, using words with very long, and clear, short synonyms by multiple clauses. <br /> <br /> I do not think it is valuable. <br /> <br /> I've seen the third, and despite what the number of critics have said, avoid it. This does not save Turkey. Critics think that The second and third films are "deep", some to see deeper films. Perhaps reading a book or two on rhetoric and debate, and possibly a bit of philosophy. This movie is not difficult to understand, but it is hard to stomach. <br /> <br /> Scott
