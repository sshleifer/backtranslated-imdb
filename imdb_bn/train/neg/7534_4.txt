A mummy narrated vignettes about men, women, and sex between them. is not it? Initially, Mummy randomly asks the viewer, "Think of having sex with this girl." Think of sex with this boy about 37 times, when the pictures of half-naked young people are blurred. Then said, the mode boys are drinking alcohol ... vegetables? If you override Mummy's rating (or move forward quickly), then the shorts are not bad for their own rights. I did not find anything interesting about them. One of my personal favorites where sexually transmitted people are attempting to have a girl contact her when her pet is sitting on the bed. This is one, good, diverse movie.
