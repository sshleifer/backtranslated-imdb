First of all, yes, animals have passion. If you do not already know, then I believe you are a fool. But let's assume that one of us is silent. We all know that animals have passion, and now we want to see how these emotions are manifested in nature, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Human". Filmmakers search high and low for footage of animals involved in human behavior, and when it happens, they say, "The monkey is almost human!" (Which is actually a direct quote) <br /> <br /> All things are human. They do not have time to make the dog "happy" But once they do not mention the meaning of a quarrel, it is hateful to these researchers, they may even go so far as wearing chimpanzees and cowboy hats, dressed in human clothing. <br /> <br /> I used to have animals I hope for an insightful documentary. I would like to know how the animals speak their own language. Instead, researchers have called pedantic, anthrom Continue reading on the assumptions behind marphika and monitoring. Ciji soundtrack and a "Christmas" add images chimps, and this was enough to turn my stomach. <br /> <br /> But it is not the end. Half of this document is not flooded but illustrated in laboratories and experimental facilities. All the cameras of the chimps are shot through the steel bar and we can see how these monkeys are combined in their sterile concrete pitchers. Start at the beginning of a special moment (although you will have to show it fast) where a captive monkey says in the language of speech, "Get out, go fast." <br /> <br /> Blurred references are "pressure test" and mental exams which I imagine shadder. The children's monkeys are separated from their mothers and they are given to wireframe puppets so that they prove that the children think of the monkey as the "mother character". And after 40 years of testing, smog researchers went back to reach their brilliant conclusion: Monkeys have passion. <br /> <br /> Since 1966 there is a cone called "Washo" in a concrete cage. , And this day he remains like this. We get a brief glimpse of a concrete wall rather than a leaning (via bar) with its unimpressive expression. Personally, I do not see any experimental data. Washo, I apologize for our entire species.
