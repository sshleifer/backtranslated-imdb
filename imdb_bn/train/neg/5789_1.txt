My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a big disappointment. It was Mr. Magu is a native American version. A merciful father who he tries all fails, such as fishing, hunting, in a clear way he is his wildly fantastic subject in his family. His "outlook" is not only ridiculous but in the process he lied his son many times over the obvious things. This picture can not be expressed how bad it is. Children and wives are very real, which makes the film even tragic. I'm not ridiculous ... unless you like to laugh others by fooling others. I can not get how it could come up for the prize. Save your bucks, it is not worth the rental.
