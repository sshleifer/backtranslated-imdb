The foundation of this film is so simple and clear that only one million people on oil smoke and whiskey can understand that it is shouting around a provocative parking lot. Briefly: If cahoots with the oil business government (or gamint if you prefer), Gummint is cahoots with despots in the Middle East, and CIA's double-deeding son- (Insertion word) willingness to wear a line that comes in their way to a single festering pool. The only people that have finished the job are Mr. Clooney ("Bob"). Oh, and terrorism is the result of poverty that creates globalization when wicked multinationals look for delicious takeover or three of the world. That really fits with 9/11 criminals good profile. <br /> <br /> These lovely political tales of political half-truths and Hollywood Hololamas have become excited in composing an overwhelming discipline in Sarayana; Gopipas roamed through their own unrealism in disguise until they went alone with the conclusion of the despondent audience: <br /> <br /> 1. "Director" (good joke) should ever be given around a camera again <br /> 2. People like Clone and Heart can know how to work, but they are not sure what script they can choose. <br /> <br /> 3 If you want to see a movie that is related to the big business and the corruption of the state, see Claude Chabral's "El Aivres du Poovir", which plays insightful, fun and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> Empty, destructive, suffocating people rush towards evening-destructive length.
