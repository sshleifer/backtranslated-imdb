I bought Blaude Custle DVD in Ibb, I did not know what to ow know and I can say that I was not frustrated with this purchase. Bloody Custels is one of the reasons for the European horror films, which are virtually no liberation quality except for the best of all the bad reasons. The price of the DVD was worth the Academy: our heroine, Dr. Evana came to the castle, where she was supposed to help scientist Baron Dalmer, who examined the dead tissues. On the way to the palace 1) A man tried to rape Ivanna. 2) The owner of the castle's house fighting with him. 3) The maid wants her dead. 4) And finally, the baron pauses almost spit upon him and next day he wants him. Hmm ... something he does not welcome. With such a tragic arrival you will think Ivana will leave the place in a NY minute, but not like a big trash movie, decided to have our "Headstrong" heroine and even enjoy a candle cooking dinner with candle baron. The same eventful day. This article is very punchy (it's more than the first few minutes of the Canadian film junior), which I knew I was going to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> there ended. Whenever he goes to sleep at night, Ivanna is repeatedly impressive, only to wake up from senseless, naked, bound and tortured in light sessions of S & M by strangers. Even after the experience of this night's SS & M session, Evana remains in the palace, and she is firmly convinced by the anger that she enjoys nothing more than the dream she is enjoying. In order to be expected, even after getting so bad from going, Ivan, in love with Baron. Ivana completely ignores something negative about her, including the obvious fact that Door Baron is popular with young women. Every woman in famine (I think there is only woman working there) loves the unfortunate Champa, who does not pay attention to the good young people. If someone hid around the property and killed (and killed) then even silen. Basically, Baron's physically-adjusted brother, Igo is responsible for everything. In a very long wind scenario, Brother warns Baron that he will not be too involved with Ivanna or he will enjoy the result. So what will Baron and Eva do about this? Well, they must be married! At a very short wedding ceremony, Bernanke was shot dead by one of the angry locals (the father of one of the dead girls). But not all this prevents Eve, who oppresses all the dead women and their surroundings, gives pleasure to the wounded Baron with "healthy body wounds" and both can go and the castle can enjoy their honeymoon, where the murderer / rapist / abusive brother is. The whole thing quickly swings into a wonderful love triangle between Yannana, Baron and Eger. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It becomes annoying. But for most of the movies, the director or writer came back in a strange trash moment after the other. I really love these types of movies, with all of the smashes on the head with Slaydhammer, and the characters behave in a rude way. Even those who have made the RetroDDI DVD realize it and when you go to the Selection Selection section, then we continually hide one of the most fun bits of Dude movie conversations. <br /> <br /> The price of production is neatly visible. Open and closed credit, those with candles and red screen ... ah, the class is a soup√ßon. Sometimes the music seems like something like Tim Burton, which only adds to its curiosity. And traditional for such movies, when young women wear their clothes, they just want to kill. <br /> <br /> As a standard movie, I rated it 2, but a "It is so bad it's good" movie, I rated it a hard 8 star. If you enjoy trashi film then see this one. It's a must see. The only thing left for me to remember was: What would she do to get out of that lady?
