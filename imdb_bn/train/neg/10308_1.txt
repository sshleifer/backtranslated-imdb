It's really really bad. Lamas shows exactly how his actors acted in a second rate. But what seems to be valuable looks like where OJ slaughters a colleague by the throat, as Jackbox plays a song with the songwriter, "I have found you!" (I want to hear the rest of the rest - is responsible for David Gregory and Leslie Oren but I did not find it in iTunes). Talk about watching in the future ... very funny for the word. Do not forget the rest of the movie. Scores and songs are more interesting than scripts. Sequel ditto Ask the question of why they will make a sequel. My understanding was that these B movies have driven many overseas sales. I do not say much about the habit of watching the world.
