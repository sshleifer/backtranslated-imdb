I have been watching this movie hoping to find a beautiful and interesting story yet the story line was not good either. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This film was based on Flabbert's novel "Madame Bauvery" yet it does not match the Indian mentality for me. <br /> <br /> In general we have bought the movie to dream and good times, do not waste our time and our mood changes between bad. I can not understand how it can get the "high" vote with an average of 6.8 / 10. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you have to escape and ignore because there is nothing to be thankful about it! If you like "dark movies" with "strange and unconscious stories" you will only waste your time.
