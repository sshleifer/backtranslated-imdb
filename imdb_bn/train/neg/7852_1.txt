I have no horrible movie buff, but my wife's nephew and niece are. So, I saw the first movie. It was terrible, and tense, but not my taste. Still good though. For the same reason, at this moment, I'm going to open a signal. <br /> <br /> The premises itself is stupid. I can buy that catastrophe can happen in the desert. I can buy that mutant existing. I can also buy that the events are so weird and weird that the army can be involved. It is unlikely, yes, but I wish to suspend my faith. However, I am not convinced in any way that mutants are unable to stop the military forces that have been recruited to rebuild such areas. Being a member of the United States Army, I can assure that when there is a lack of comfortable eyesight and war veterans' experience, such employers will be included in an able squad. <br /> <br /> Armed group soldiers will not be expelled by a few mutants with a knife. It works that way. The squad's movement, widely, will ensure higher firepower, and of course, radio support, less than the total victory. I'm not saying that you will not be a victim of casualties, but as soon as the area was judged unfavorably, military training would be preferred, no one would be left to use their own bathroom. <br /> <br /> And if it was discovered that the regions were so cruel with such adversity that the team could not manage the danger, they would use the radio to back up. And believe me, their radio will not be jammed, but there is a chance to do the normal radio, but the squad's military problem will be the satellite phone. Chances are, if they can not check every hour, a search will be called. <br /> <br /> To accept this film, you must admit that our soldiers are incompetent, unfinished leaders, and a command disadvantageous order. While it may still be true that one of the most dangerous things in the world is Lieutenant with a map and compass, our military is filled with intelligent, trained, skilled soldiers. The mutant with knife is far from the ability to deal with us. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to think strongly with the complete execution of the film, failing to deliver the film. Instead, we believe that our soldiers, crew and air force are unable to deal with even the most intermediary threats. <br /> <br /> I like the movie insult, like the experience of the war.
