There was not much hope when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Festival this weekend. It was another option when two other films were sold. Yet I hope. It makes a little more sound like "Bride and Prejudice" (LA man falls for Indian beauty, parental conflict, Lord Allah). B & P was not perfect, but it was an enjoyable movie with some mockery and favorite characters. <br /> <br /> "None of my Bollywood Bride" was there. Acting stilted by the to-do and seemed to be the way. The characters were so cliche that the story seems to be written by a new drama student at high school. Technically, the sound really bothered me. Dubbing over the conversation seems to have been a lot. I mean a lot. I sometimes needed it but sounded like half the film was shot in a closet and it became very confusing. <br /> <br /> The two stars are somewhat generous.
