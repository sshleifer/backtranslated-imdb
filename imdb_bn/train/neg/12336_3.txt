I gave five out of 10 For all the five Hendrix who provide a very modest set of the next day's element. Unfortunately the quality of the camera and editing quality is verging on the horrible! We are probably doing something where Hendrix has countless whole-face shots, perhaps taking a pee? We can not see his hand on the guitar! Also we are given lots of Hendrix shots from behind? Hendrix has three cameras, but the amateur fool manages them all. Hendrix seems to be interested in floating his attention lazily on the stage as a mere confusion of Hendrix on stage. The person behind is imagining some girls in the stalls that are actually recording the work of the incredible guitar, which is making the ampex bloody (thanks to Sound Recording Wally Haiders), clip losses on students cluttered in tracks, vietnam machines etc. Machine guns, complete waste of film! If Hendrix lived for two more years, then Berkeley had never seen a thing which was never fully published in the light of the day. It's a jewel that is incredible Johnny B. Great but wonderful both for both Woodstock and Isle of Wight, great people and a poorly poor visual document.
