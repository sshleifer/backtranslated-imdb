I can not see why filmmakers can rebuild the film. <br /> <br /> The 1972 film, with McQueen and McGraw, is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an extraordinary actor and Belvedin was simply an incomplete actor. There is no emotion in his play. The actual "gateway" operation was fantastic. But there is no action on the remake! It was more difficult than the 1994 film production in 1994, but it was almost boring. <br /> <br /> I do not understand that Beldwin is imprisoned in Mexico. <br /> <br /> I think it was not necessary to rebuild it, or if they decide to make a classic rebirth then they must choose a great actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt ...
