After reading the DVD case, I bought this image cheaply and thought that I could not lose any way, if it is rubbish, then there is no harm, if it is any good then ... <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Christopher Walken. <br /> <br /> I have given very little screen attendance in this film, it seems like it does not do the whole thing, even if the event of his friend's death at the beginning closes the "action" in the plot, it rarely affects him and his last vengeance is simply It is boring and surprising. <br /> <br /> Generally a film that is a theme capable of catching grand viewers as a revolution and retaliation, and preventing them from feeling something for the character, but seeing this movie a series of confusions and almost the last random events that are combined in its final conclusion Looks like getting together ... <<br /> <br /> I started crying at the moment <br /> <br /> I thought this picture was my best The difficult part is scary. When a person wants to kill a civilian, the pilot refuses to leave the loaded truck, which is self-condemned, the scene is not sadly sad because it is strange and painful, although it is a very serious injuries to emergency surgery on the girl. All of the acting was poor, the scripts and stories were weak, "actions" were even weak, and "visual" but visually that was not all that visual. In short, those movies are bad, movies are so bad that they are good, movies are terrible ... <br /> <br /> And then the new level "Macbayne"
