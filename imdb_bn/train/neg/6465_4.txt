This is decent outing Charles but this is a pretty low-key performance. Marlon Brando is standing. Mera Sorvino and Donald Sutherland have forgotten to develop a sub-plot and it's a little pain in the film. I'm still trying to understand why Charlie wants to change her name. Every movie with "Charles" has been quite bad.
