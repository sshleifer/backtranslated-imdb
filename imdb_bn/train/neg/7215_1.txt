This movie was a stupid piece of crap. Bad everything Why did we get nine jillies ten times to love western movies when we got Western rent? It seems that if you do not see the name of Robert Dual, Kevin Costner, or Tom Selek's names, it is impossible to associate with it. In 1829, the main activities of the Silhat Fruit took place, but the revolver used was 1860 model. Even shooting was bad - at one point, Marshall had defeated his six shooters at nine feet and could not hit just three feet big, which was only 20 feet away. About 15 minutes after this disaster, I had to stop it. Perhaps the participants of this film can take some lessons at the Sunset Carson School of Acting.
