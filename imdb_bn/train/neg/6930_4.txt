Dr. Tarar Torture Dongan is a journalist who travels for an insane asylum to write a patient about a new technique used with his patients. However, journalists soon find out what they do not seem to be, and shelter from patients, and doctors are in the cage. First of all, some parts of the movie are simply annoying and you just want to fall asleep and interesting parts are all the wrong reasons (a guy who thinks he feels like chicken) is interesting. I must admit that the story is really quite good, but the film itself bombs The music of the film is really weird and like some crazy comedy that you can hear, and yes, there is a scene involving a dance chicken man, which mostly wants me to close the screen. See this picture at your own risk! <br /> <br /> Rated for violence and nudity.
