Japanese film began in 1840, in which a man executed his wife and her lover and committed suicide. This is a very serious, bloody sequence. Then it goes on today ... well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little child moved to Japan for work of husband and wife. They rent a house and - surprise! Wonder - this is where the killing happened! Three dead people are almost as scrawl (bad for harmful makeup) and to make life hell for the family. <br /> <br /> OK - but it's really hopeless. A bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in it. There is an attack by giant crabs which are just shocking! They look very fake - I swear I saw pulling along one of the strings - and they're muttering !!!!! In the first 20 minutes (probably only to show George's body) there is a pointless penis sequence, another about 40 minutes later (but it was necessary for the plot) and at the end a genuinely disenchantment. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McCullo should be believed. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < But George - as always - is horrible in a lousy film. He gives this film a much needed lift - but it can not save. I'll give this for a 2 just and gory opening and closing for him. That aside, it's a very annoying film.
