Yes I will accept it I believed that all of the pieces around this piece of work, about the sexual abuse of the people living in Mexico City and about 6 people about their sex life. And so, I was hoping to finally see a Mexican movie (in the age) which was both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately the picture was frustrating. The story presents us with two couples, with both very marital problems. When a third party comes into each couple's life, their problems reach a key point. Or absolute illogical Then the intrigue turns into a war of sexes. The position taken by each group (yes, they are literally groups, girls and girls boys boys with boys) cute fools and children (I think humor was supposed to be there). And it gets worse from all bad. From performance (Miss Javalata) to the medieval (Mr Bichi), Serrano is doing an acceptable job in her Opera Prema. However, the film fails to realize that flat conditions that create platforms, one-dimensional characters, very poor (if not stupid), represent sexual relations with a sexual relationship. Miserably. A well-received (impressive) reception at the SPEL Box Office. Trust hype at your own risk.
