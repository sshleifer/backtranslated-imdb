This is a fascinatingly terrible movie. It is such a small idea that it started to create its own strange internal argument. Well, if it does not ultimately reduce the weight of your irrationality, it will not close the side-surfaces. The film can not accept his mind that it is directly related to 'Man transce into monster' flick (like the 1950s 'Ingridible Inbuilt Action, InG Man'), or a terrible big business conspiracy theory film, or a mysterious underworld story ? Take your It's just a mess. Surprised from the top and firing off from all sides, flapping all over the place with loose touch. It seemed as if that Tov Hooper David lynch pills took. Unfortunately he did not accept enough.
