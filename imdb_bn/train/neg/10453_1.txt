This film has more than 1 qualification but I give it to one because the son of many Ficon fans gave it a 10, which gave it a rating, which it would take to the top 100 list. Seriously it is not bad that its not bad. It's ridiculous to have a stupid ritual classic with many ridiculous fan boys. This type of Chuck Norris is still kind of laugh at jokes and still says "I Rick James B! Tch" no matter how old or annoying gets. I heard "I am tired of MFN snake on this MFN plane" and trying to narrate drugs. His unclear plot acting impolite etc. It's okay to love a bad movie, but you still have to accept her a bad movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie cinema, Marine actors wait for John Senna.
