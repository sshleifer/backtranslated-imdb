This movie was frustrating. It was incomplete and dull. Alex Belvedin tried to present himself as the Perfect Meyer and tried to challenge the audience only through a realistic debate about the prosecutor (not to mention the executive producer), the film did not show any defense advice or how a country could be. <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> br /> Four hours just clash over the Nazis Come on .... is! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said,. That movie is higher FAR.
