The brain that does not die, is a terrible piece of film that bothers with opening credits. It has all the classic signs of getting worse: incredible platinum, terrible acting, low-grade set and light. The platoon goes like this: When a doctor and his fianc√© are caught in an accident, he becomes frustrated and he takes his head and takes him to his lab, where he sets his head in a special panel which keeps it alive. I'll defeat Virginia Lith, who played on the pawn, spent the uncomfortable time wearing the pan around his neck and sitting in the table. However, the doctor then tried to find him a new body, and appointed two stripes so that he could choose one for his new body. Bad all the way badly, this mystery science theater was broken into 3000 pieces.
