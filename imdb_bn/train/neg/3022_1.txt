I was very excited about this film when I first saw the preview. Usually I can see this preview and I bought the movie directly. Some told me ... you see it first. I'm happy i did Keira Knightley destroyed all future films for me with this introduction. When it came to the second pirate film, I went to see it. I saw Domino Harvey and I hated more for him. I think that working with her hair and cutting it for the domino. <br /> <br /> Who is Domino? Who is Domino Harvey? I still do not know or care about. I do not know who he was in real life or who he was in this film. I did not take care of his character and even somebody is not partially nude making the film valuable. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was quarterly and shallow. The edit was terrible. I do not mind the style so it's poor as overuse. There is a place for it. A good example of sticky, MTV style, colorful editing (not sure if there is any official name) Fight Club; Just off my head. There was also a semi-similar editing style in the enemy part of the state. It was used naturally and was not used as a crutch. I point out this same guy who sank the top and the tidal tide. Tony Scott Give me my time. <br /> <br /> I understand that there are many people who like this movie. I think it's a fair assessment that you completely hate this movie or hate it. Really, I hate it.
