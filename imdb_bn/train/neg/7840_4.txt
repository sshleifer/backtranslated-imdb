This film is said in the eyes of a young teacher in Catholic school, Ravanand massacre around him is seen as non-lungs. <br /> <br /> This movie started with a brief explanation about past history and rivalry. Rawanda Then it leaned towards a story written by the eyes of a young ideologically "new-comer" young man, a young teacher who does not take life or situation very seriously. He and the driver blocked the road blocking as he plays almost with his driver ID. I do not understand that this is a serious moment and if the driver can not identify himself as the right tribe of the soldiers, they will die. And how he treats the unfolding chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly he realized that every rawa (including his driver) is involved and European soldiers and tourists can not help and will not help. Media cameras can not stop the match, and militia-men too have many matches to fire. The headline comes from the captain of the army that he is going to eat the dog around his compound, but will not shoot militia-men, killing people around the compound. Mainly because they were not yet fired at the soldiers. Finally he realized the situation's frustration and the person who told the Equitating Team that he wanted to leave his seat for the accused hunter, fleeing with his bird on his feet, rather helpless death with school kids <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> This movie does not have to take place in Rawda, it is any time that any genocide in this world is known as Jahanna Mom can take holes.
