I do not usually comment, but there is something that needs to be said. Where to start <br /> <br />, Jeremy is a terrible part of London! I do not think she could be so bad. The plot could be good, it was also a good solid performance from the good actors, the lead actor. Unfortunately, the movies you've read and think it's likely to be entertaining, but be frustrated from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Well, at least I got a good smile. I would not waste my time if you were.
