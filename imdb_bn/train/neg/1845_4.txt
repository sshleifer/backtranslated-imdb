Holding Control is another proposition for the erotic thriller genre that can be considered as a pop fiction movie. Generally, they involve a circular route to killer intentions, interspersed with charming disrobing. This is not a complaint, especially when it is done by incredible beautiful women who live in this faithful world. <br /> <br /> Kim Ward (Kira Red) is causing the writer's block. Just by chance, (or is it?) He met a man (Doug Jeffrey) who is involved in a more risky sexual encounter with him. People refuse to disclose any information about themselves, but Kim strongly refuses to stop the matter. His agent, Alexandra (Annalisa Scott) thinks he will do wonderful work for selling his books. Like most of these movies, restraint comes near the end but some things do not get involved. I've seen such a film, there is no change, but - I like them. They are so indifferent. <br /> <br /> Cast performance changes. Doug Jeffrey carries this movie as a psychotherap that you do not want to cross. What Reid looks good but fails to satisfy as dangerous woman. Clay Greenbush is not satisfied as PHP is not. Finally, a note of caution about the DVD under review. The covers and disks both state R and running time are 93 minutes but the run time is less than 86 minutes. Perhaps why this scene explains why sex scenes are torn apart and why Jennifer Ludlow's performance has started. 4 stars.
