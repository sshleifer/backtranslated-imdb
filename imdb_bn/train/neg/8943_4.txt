John Wayne and Albert Decker competed for oil rights in the Indian region, and this Republican film shot fired from the United States Utah for the attention of the head sketch. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In its more modern setting, Wayne and Decker are playing new and new sections of the West. It is based on a story by Thomson Barties who co-wrote the script along with Allan Griffin and Athel Hill. Albert Rogell indicates the workmanlike way that befits his career. A beautiful old story is truly stored by its final third, where action is taken with gratitude and we are treated like something similar to a pulse. The light-hearted view of the romantic strand can not fit properly, and Stant men working with a glorious boxing fight between the two leaders can not hide in the disguise. But hey, stunt men always deserve their moment of glory. By George Gabbi Heis and Owen strong support comes, naturally he has many screen charisma, especially when his pistol closes. But it is even better than the budget of the general republic, but it is a movie of interest to the Wayne enthusiasts in the 1940s. 4/10
