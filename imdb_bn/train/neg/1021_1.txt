The film is a strong, police officer in the LG Coolidge (Did) partner Sergey. Lazerov (Dylan McDermott from practice, miscast as bad guy?) Robbed and killed. Deed refused to set up a dirty police conflict with drug conspiracy, which killed drug addiction.

This movie was so much promise. Completely frustrating.
