I want to be honest to hear this show first, though creating a show can be a bad idea that Muslims use ethnic jokes on themselves but it is just the opposite. I understand that this program can help people understand that if a Muslim uses such a word in real life, it does not mean that it is a terrorist thing. It also shows how people give bad name to the Muslims, because they play their stereotype, and regular people will see the show that even though bad Muslims can all interpret it, it does not mean that we are all bad. On one day, how difficult it was for Aamir to become flat, and how he used words like "Blow Up" or Zerah says that we will remove the competition, and people take it wrong. Because of being a Muslim, I know that such things will not usually happen, but they and many people think of Muslims as bad or bad about Afghanistan or Iraq, their exact things are not the same. People will see how we did bad behavior by showing this program and how it might think of their behavior. I am delighted to air a show like this. There are many shows that the Piyitra people as Muslim terrorists, many think it is funny for their abusive behavior, now it is OK and then, because there is a lot to do about joking about what we say. Wrong, but it is often done and in fact the Muslims give a bad name to the people.
