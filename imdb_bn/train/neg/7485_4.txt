Approved, it seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Haun, and John Stays a Neil Simon Comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch movies, and you'll find out. <br /> <br /> Actually, Martin, Leader, Wrong Custom. He is not doing famous chappicious films like "The Zerac", but instead acts in a kind of character that does not work. Haun, no play, but terrible. Cleese is only partial fun member. <br /> <br /> To top it off, the plot is quite stupid. I can not say how much it has changed, but the letters seem to be a little bit lacking in general. They make mistakes through New York, do not fix anything, and uncomfortably, nothing interesting. Not only is absolute unbelievable, it seems that people living in New York are not very bright, repeat a theme across the film. <br /> <br /> In short, instead of seeing this, rent the original "weird couple" again.
