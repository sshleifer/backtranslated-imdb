First seen 11/7/2002 - Between 10 to 2 (Dir-Jan Bianco): A family of beautiful gangsters in Brooklyn's Godfather who loved four words to say a lot more and kill people. The only thing about interest here was that the pawns like gangs were trying to show a lot of things. This is the only effort to make good films. The rest of the movie was left, and made cheaply. In times and fluji joints, some of the visuals in the scene often seem to have a problem with your DVD player and some actors were hard to hear occasionally due to bad words. The acting was better than most of your favorite gangsters, including Vinnie Nichols and hostage `tattoos', and plots also followed those patterns. So, before you get out of your money for this, watch a good gangster movie.
