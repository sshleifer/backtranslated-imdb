Man, I really believe that the amazing Alan Ball was about to do something about this mess. I have seen the first two episodes so far, I think I can safely say that this show does not have to see my list. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Anki Pinchin as the main character of suki Just awful I think I've seen him much more so that he is better than him, maybe it's just writing. Look at the look he really does not have much fun, the moment where there to be honest he looks cruel ugly. Actor actor Bill is slightly better, only his character is considered to be wood and lazy. Other actors do their best but it is difficult to access with clich√© letters, they are given a solid job of it. They see an absolute sorrow, Rutina Wesley utterly killed. It's like a bad knuckle on a chalkboard. Nelson Alice is almost horrible, she is sometimes hard to understand what he is saying. Alongside his character, both of them seem to be a bit racist. I do not know why, 'why' seems to be a bit weird because of a character that is 'wire' on an HBO show. Shakira's drunk grandmother, her sexual addict brother and the only bit of curiosity casting, which I saw in William Sanderson, like Shariff. The story of <br /> <br /> seems to look at her. With no real thought about keeping interested visitors, destination at this time. The romance stuff is very dark shadow-c. Although this show ten times the camp factor from something like that old dark shadow episode, Sometimes it was so relaxed to me that I wanted to assume that it was going to be. But opposite a show like Buffy, that masterfully pulled off the camp, do not show this. Outside the place with camp is the ultimate gorge and the show is graphic sex. Although I did a lot of good work on them, they did not have the many HBO shows, but here at least they have prolonged sexual relations with Jason Stackhouse and seem to be top and uninterrupted. <br /> <br /> I can tell you really about this mess about the only wonderful thing that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO recently got bad luck with their shows, hopefully they will cancel it after the first season and try to do better in the air.
