Why did I go see this picture? Sincerely, because Jim Carey was in it and in the past he made hilarious movies that made me laugh and cry, do you blame me for hope again? Alongside, the involvement of the fun trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston, and the fact that this event in a huge hit state encouraged me. However, my "suggestion of a line" has been proposed, however, I was disappointed. For various reasons; <br /> <br /> Reason 1: It was not funny. A 2 hour movie, I laugh for about 5-10 minutes ... all together, the rest of the time I thought "I really got some ice cream". I acknowledge that perhaps it is wrong to judge Jim Carrie in his earlier films, but what does he really expect when he calls James the 'The Truman Show', 'Leer Leer', 'Me, Maiseph and Irin', 'Dum Dum', 'The Mascus and 'S Ventura' films have made such kind of middle-class movies in Bruce Nolan's own words? Reason 2: The role of Jennifer Aniston was underwritten criminally. I mean hello! For nearly ten years, he has been around the public eye and he has got four lines in this film. Wrong: <br /> <br /> Reason: 4: A casual installation of American references specifically - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Crowkight 'Happy Week of the Week' - This is a formula specifically for the movie Home grown application. "A teenager does not say intoxicant and says yes to education - it's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon! Be a miracle!" God told Bruce that there is a feeling of heavy intervention that seems to have stopped in the United States, but may face severe resistance to the market, which puts the risk of damage. In addition, I still go to school, and the statement advises me and the miracle of all my friends ... or maybe it's just our brains? <br /> <br /> There are enough fun carri moments in this picture to prevent you from shining and a total disaster of Bruce Almighty, but you are advised to start correcting your expectations below.
