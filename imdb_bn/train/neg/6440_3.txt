This was one of the worst WrestleMania I saw. It just does not stand at all, really. Card wise, I think it's going to be quite good, but each match just takes a short fall. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit vs. MVP is one of the best matches. Benoit carries it. I just think MVP was not that great, but Benoit saved this match. <br /> <br /> Cain vs empty wah, these two boys do not match. Or is it a Khali and no other living person? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> I said,. Really, really frustrated. <br /> <br /> Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs Matt Hardy v. Kennedy v Finley v Randy Orton is the worst MITB match. Just a major, many people in the ring at the same time are below. It was not just alive. <br /> <br /> Bobby Lashley vs Umaga OK Not very impressive, but the night is not the worst. <br /> <br /> <br /> It's probably the best match at night, but Batista v. Undertaker. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /> <br /> Mr. Senna vs Shaun Michaels I really think this match is worth the end. People filed a case for Batista v. Undertaker, but this match was just right. Although I started to get sick by seeing Sina win every match. It's a little old. Now, I must say, I think this match is the best of the night, but I'm a huge fan of Michael Fan, so I'm a little favorable. Batista vs' Bike is good, but I favor, so ... sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best match of the night and everything else was really short.
