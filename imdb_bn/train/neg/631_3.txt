Amazing If you are sitting through this picture then you will say. Only, incredibly, amazing. It's really awesome that anyone is fool enough to make money for this intelligence that you just can not believe in what you see. That is, my friends, really scared about this film. Someone had a good idea to put it in. Another amazing original story: Here is a high school student (sometimes looks like a college?), a prostitute for a mother, a trailer park, and an "artist" is ridiculed for " Everything is different. " Well, of course, this poor humorous boy has finally died and here is the main part, his soul lives in a scary (under which he is murdered by his slutty uncle last night). Then he goes with the killing of killing people that killed him killing nearby. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br/> <br /> - This series of Walmart discs is $ 5.00 Bin ?? So it's just a little more expensive. <br /> <br /> It did not hurt, Didn help: <br /> <br /> - Sub-standard type of violence and cow. One person is stabbed with a corncob. <br /> <br /> - They sound like putting some effort in the music ?? But does it really fit the movie ?? And not good at all. <Br <br/> <br /> Bad: <br /> <br /> - Terrible, terrible acting. <br /> <br /> <br /> Another slash is to leave with sexy girls? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Arnold Schwarzenegger Bliss. <br /> <br /> - The standard intimate love story goes out of nowhere, and is done badly. <br /> <br /> - Some people have been killed as if they were selected in random ?? You do not really know who is there and then they die. And you only guess that they're definitely coming in it. <br /> <br /> Undeclared <br /> <br /> - Just rent an average slash, with just a killer scarecrow ?? Well, that other other crap. <br /> <br /> - Freddy Kr√ºger, "Junk" Which is the best of these tortures. <br /> <br /> - I have ever heard the worst dialogue in my life. Carrying the script with a level of disaster that I could never imagine. I serious here ?? It's a complete step beyond horrible. Do not make me wrong, is it funny as hell ?? But I have never heard even more stupid? Even in "slum party genocide III". This image "Jason X" looks like Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> - The person who kills a boy is scared: the worst. Dialog match <br /> <br /> - The memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - Where elementary school youth spread their own malicious conversations: "Hey, let's find out the little creatures to torture." br /> <br /> Acting: 3/10 Story: 3/10 atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 1/10 character development: 2/10 Special effects / make-up: 5/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 No nudity, mother's whore, no bridal of girls) Violence / Gore: 5/10 (low quality , Medium amount) Dialog: 0/10 (Very funny, bright, top-and top fun?) So bad it's my first rating for a movie dialogue!) Music: 5/10 Guide: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Chaitanya: 10/10 Crafting: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10 <br /> <br /> <br /> Just for people like me who see pure shit Enjoy Or slash-film completists. This is not a good movie. The ridiculous dialogue and the characters continue to be completely annoying. <br /> <br /> www.residentHazard.com
