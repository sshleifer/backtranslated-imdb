The image was not valuable in this movie. The words like the dialog flats, the clich√© fill the overwed line and distributed by amateur actors who read their scripts for the first time. Sticky, sticky, film style "The Ring" style is a cheap imitation of visual effects. Characters do not even work like a normal person. For example, the person who is looking for his eldest sister, keeps his way through the door of his house, roams around the house and is very scared, and once he calls his sister's name to see if he is at home. What? Instead of searching for him you just buried his sister. The way his childhood is very flashback. Many unnecessary flashbacks are a common sign of an amateur director. It is actually funny to see a number of shots that were driving the car under the street, around the corner, on the road, on the side, the side, and a front view on the other side. Already enough You will feel like watching a TV commercial for solar! Terrible movie 0 out of 100 I really please someone who spends this person or who spends it watching.
