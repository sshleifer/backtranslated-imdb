I saw the original "chorus line" on Broadway, know how often and emotionally the emotion, frustration and joy felt from this live experience in this theater. Michael Bennett knew that he had to imagine the "chorus" for the screen but could not determine how it would work. If the guy who comes with the show stumps - then you have to answer the question. With viewers - Some shows that are easily seen live. However, Richard Attenborough operated this movie to dance with the musical dance of "Ghandi" and the animals of "Doctor Dulilit", which is not compatible with the stage show. Awesome songs have been added (Wonder! Surprise!), Great songs have been omitted or given in other characters (which can not be understood). Michael Douglas was wrong cast. Those who could not dance, tried to act and there was a sexy "landers" woman who could not sing, act or dance - I guess he was Ghani's wife. Jeffrey Hornady's dance moves "Flashdance" and seems to see something that does not work. I have seen something so much that the writing and emotional things are lost. If you really like this show and it's coming back to Broadway in 2006 - but watch it but there is no relation to this long-running musical event with "A Chorus Line".
