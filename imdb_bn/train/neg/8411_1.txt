We expected something great when we went to see this bomb. It is basically made on a Broadway game film. The music is terrible terrible. There is no memorable song in the film - which hit the hit of this movie? There will be no reason not to cause you. Some musical numbers continue for so long that I went to the rest house and went to die for some pops, and when I was coming back, it was still going on! If they were good songs well - but they suck. Slow speed, terrible character development. The lead was acclaimed for his song but he sounded like every song screamed - stood almost impossible to stand. There is no one in this movie but there is nothing to offer to the hard broadway enthusiasts of the dead. This is my suspicion that I have seen in my whole life the highest ratings movie. A complete waist of time and money. There is nothing memorable about this film except Danny Glover - who was not quite screened and whose character was not well developed. Rent the video and you agree - this movie is like a costly, produced, polished dog.
