Well, what is it ?! I found Nicholson's character shallow and most unfortunately uninteresting. Angelica Huston's character drained my energy. And Cathy Turner is a good whore in a messy. It's not that I "get it". It is not that I do not think that some ideas may be more. This is nothing but a movie, the idea that we were supposed to accept these ideas, and this is going to the movie for it. That nicolson falls for Turner, it's weird, but still, it's going to be like this. This does not strike me as though.) Funny, or B.) ... even remotely interesting !!! This was a waste of my time, so hype does not get your best ... it's a waste of your time! It is said that the order of the open churches is quite beautiful ...
