The ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is that it is frustrating if he is a saint, he or his family and his or her significant others live forever. Let us forget that for a saint, the saint must die, and there is nothing significant in the virtues. Because, for a millennium, Jolie Elph in Nick Fred's scrooge never even indicated! How to make Nick learn how to make toys, then Fred can learn how to run numbers; Nick a sick child, give a dolly, Fred Dolly, repossessing along the family farm! After a few episodes, Murphy is carrying Fred today to his sister in lawless brotherhood with his classmate's sympathy. There, I wrote a story more intimate than this stupidity! <br /> <br /> This Santa, who is hello, yes, yes, yes, yes, away from a huge coronary, it is a neurotic wiss. Harpies queen, straight out of a mega-mal hello operation, and the board (huh?) Which just gave Easter Bunny her pink egg. Oh, and her right hand is a leather-tight mini-dress a ditzy blonde and boots to go on. Ho ho ... ho ... ho ... ho ... ho <br /> <br /> <br /> But what really sent me to the end is that Slam is named in the # 1 list. Should not a naughty list be preserved for future Hitler and Stalin? Are the children a true evil spirit? Nope, Old Sauges-Fingers, a good boy, who is unexpected and unexpected, because he's the seed of Deneman! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The farther Nomorode behind the Fred Clauses should warm their own puddings! Ah!
