The first five minutes of this movie were shown possible. After that, it's probably moved from some extraordinary comedy to something simple. The best part is that I could not thank thank you for Zoar Karne. I would recommend watching this movie for the perfect truth to learn about not making movies. There are so many scenes in this movie that just stops and surprises that the whole cast and crew are taking care of at any time. I am most surprised about this movie that it costs 22 million dollars at the box office and spent only $ 1.5 million. Congratulations to Lion's gate for being able to pull that off.
