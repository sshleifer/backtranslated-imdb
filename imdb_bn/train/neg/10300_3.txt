I am a fan of aunty film, but sadly I have to report this film from the chaotic drill. Based on a committed premise an agonizingly slow, experience, we would try, to develop an existential plot. Even after the bad movie, I think that I can learn something, or enjoy some aspects, but there is nothing to be grateful there. Premiere was not reluctant, but the movie started and ended there. The acting was okay, although the letters were completely annoying. For the playwright to see such a disturbed goal, he is very empty. Mercy I usually enjoy unsophisticated movies, but the lack of formula should not be distracted with empty content.
