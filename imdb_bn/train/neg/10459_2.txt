Controversial, blurry, bad screenplay, poor photography and direction ... all very clearly TBN is the first attempt to make commercial films in good people. <br /> <br /> TBN pictures have been great, helping to bring the story of "China verb" in the past, the big screen, the story of Nora Lam. But the "omega code" is an unfortunate mistake. As a Christian who supports TBN and many of his programming and loves "China Kriya", I still think it is impossible to recommend this movie to anyone. They work very well with their ministry, but this is not an example. Do not waste your money ... Instead of hiring "China Wishes" go.
