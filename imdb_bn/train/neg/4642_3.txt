I saw "Rachel's Atik," I was thinking that I would be pleasantly comfortable. However, it was not. Comfortable, yes, but enjoyable? That would be a big, fat, not! Actually, the only reason I gave it "3" is because Gunnar Hansen (sometimes so briefly) appears as one of the overwhelming character of the film. How did they ever m Hansen was broken into pieces ... job, I never knew. The story idea is interesting but badly executed. Direction pedestrian and acting is medium. That's the only thing that's worse than that, special effects. Dad !!! I saw the good effect of playing a grade school. Leave it, Mr. Wow, it's time to change a career ... I have heard that they are working on a mail dinner! Indie movies from Michigan are very few, well made, and ... "Rachel's Attic" is not one of them.
