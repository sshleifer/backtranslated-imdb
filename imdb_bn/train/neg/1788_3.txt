Due to its credit, only technical honors, clothing and sets deserve respect. <br /> <br /> It is undoubtedly the lowest point of the long career of Bing Crosby in Paramount. The script is almost unclear, as you might imagine and can not do anything about the occasional bing, William Bendix and Sir Cedric Hardwick can repair it. <br /> <br /> A page of Bendix looks extremely stupid in the boy wig. And poor Rhino Fleming's stock costume role is in the role of role-playing, which she sees strange at Bing and otherwise has to be present in any other ceremony other than fighting against some unknown ballad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mark Twain's intellect is not displayed on any screen. Only dead-hard crossbish fans can probably appreciate this mess of a vague guided movie. Even the extra looks that they do not know what they want to do. <br /> <br /> Swimming: Dishwaters like dust. Even for children, is not recommended.
