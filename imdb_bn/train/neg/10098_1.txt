Video rental or time or occasional effort is not worth it. <br /> <br /> * A child who can makeup. * Acting ended ... poor directions. * Editing was very sticky ... Much of the feeling made in sense or felt just felt. * The sound is dabbed badly. * The music was extremely inappropriate. * Casting was very close ... cracked. * Those logos alone say ... drive, dance, work ... just shut me down. * And bad guy ... Holy strap! As he casted tremendously ... He was the best looking zombie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The cover art was like this but it was very deceitful ... like the main menu of DVD ... great artwork and music <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> Don "T. Botha!
