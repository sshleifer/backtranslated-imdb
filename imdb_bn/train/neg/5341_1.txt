Loads with fine actors, much more than expected from "Deceiver" than I would have distributed. The plot is highly concreved and manipulit. Many flashbacks just add confusion. The credibility window flies out and ends with intolerable and cruel ridiculous. I would strongly advise that those who make their movie plots based on a topic that can avoid at least possible "divisive" because you will be very disappointed. Maybe I do not have enough lips to get it, but I suspect that many are completely confused by the story line and especially the end. Blurring the line between reality and false simply does not work because the whole movie has no ideas. - Mr.
