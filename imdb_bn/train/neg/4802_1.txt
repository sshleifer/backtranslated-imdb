I give this marriage 3 years and extend it. Adrian Curie's face was lost, spoiled, controlled, loud, and her two sexual past smiled me. He told Chris that there is an image for his protection and to avoid the strip club. She married her. Chris has less self-esteem and a different time to warp. I have nothing against Adrian Carey but will never be happy after this combination is over. His mother said that he was an old rapist and thought that he was the last attempt to recover his young man. Here are two very good people who end up in a nasty divorce. I do not think his old "Brady Family" will fit in his new life. I see them being closed. Chris said his friends were more important than his family. He was supported and there for him.
