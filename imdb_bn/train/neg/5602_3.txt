"Pandemonium" is a horror movie Spuff that comes off more stupid than the funny. Believe me when I tell you, I love the comedy. Especially the comedy spoofs. "Airplane", "The Necked Song" Trilogy, "Blazing Saddles", "High Concern" and "Spotsballs" maintain a special trend among my favorite comedies. "Pandemonium" is not there with those films. Most of the scenes in this movie kept quiet while I was silent because the film was not funny. There are some laughs in the film, but when you see a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and these movies are going for it. Geez, "Scream" was more laughing than this film, and it was more than a horror movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
