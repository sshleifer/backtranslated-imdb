Other viewers mentioned that this image was an interesting experiment in photography. Coloring comic books are bold. I think that the director has taken away his "artistic outlook" with the look of the film and gave poor attention to the content. Despite its star cast, performance is relentless and the story is almost helpless. Madonna was originally cast as a stunt to get the pre-release press. Here's a good thing like his appearance, his album "I Am Breathless" (the music inspired by the film Dick Tracy), which is based on the stratospheric hit (mostly for the dance-hit "enjoyment" - which is not what it does, not with this film Have little relationship). I came from Madonna's "I Am Bretheles" album from Ti-Ins, a large part of the money from this picture. <br /> <br /> If you look at it at home, by the last title, you think, "I want to come back for two hours of my life." Save yourself time lost - do not bother with this.
