Since I'm not a blood donor and fanatic, I find poor scenes absolutely unnecessary (you spell it) and have found very practical for my choice, if you're a person who stops their stones in the headlines on the Internet or delete the movie. Say, go for it, the beggars believe that the kind of sick forehead is a dream. In addition to <br /> <br /> it was a great movie, the music was also the highest class (through movies) and especially the last credit). While some parts were a little unbelievable, as you are waiting for torture and death by your girlfriend's faith and what you are doing is told what happened and how did you go there, why did not he ask him whether he was a tissue or even some wind fresh Or was there a piece of gum when it was?), Now come, most will only shout, "Get up early and bring me If you can get me the f *** out of here. Quick! ". Where was the fly, maggeta etc, and when the girl eventually came across this place, surely the harmful flesh touched the alarm bell! I will only recommend this movie to the friends of Daniele Nilsson, and I am sure that the video like this will become sick like Christmas is very happy.
