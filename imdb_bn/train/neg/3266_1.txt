When Ben (Red Fox) discovered that his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) escaped with his own brother, he went to download his sad story with his son Norman (Michael Warren) - only the Norman secret boyfriend discovered: Gerson (Dennis) Dogan.) Needless to say, Ben does not accept it well and follows many complexity - by fixing him with threat to Ben. Ben, with efforts being gay yame naramanake (Tommy dobasana.) Unfortunately, this description makes the movie much more than movie theaters seems. <br /> <br /> Originally written for Ron Clarke and Sam Bobrick, Natman's theater ... are you? New York was a complete disaster in the stage. Because of this for playing, I actually saw it outline a community theater production in the 1970s - and when someone complains to do something other than a shallow wound, it is quite interesting that the cast is so broadly and as played in the drop-dead system . This is a sad picture, this image did not do the same thing. <br /> <br /> This photo of a brutally performed motion picture. Here's the funny thing about the Red Rex Fox in the most ridiculous comics of the 20th century, competing with Michael Warren (who later saw the television series Hill Street Blues have a better effect) with Fox who can see who is the worst performer, and Pearl Bailey is far behind. ; To be honest, there is nothing surprising in Dennis Doggon, Tammy Dobson, and Weimann Flowers in one room - and sadly, this is just a comparison of the rest of the cast. <br /> <br /> Just the movie is not performing badly, it looks bad. According to the film Lower, it was the first big screen effort to film in videotapes, which was later shifted to Celluloid for the project - and I believe, it shows. The film has been focusing on the bad synthetics of the 1970s, which is seen in the picturesque skyline of Norman and Gerson's apartment windows. <br /> <br /> Some pictures are so bad they're funny, but Norman ... that's you? Not one of them. I can add feedback to this two response to my words: miss it. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not touch it with ten foot poles. Just go away slowly and then run like hell. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
