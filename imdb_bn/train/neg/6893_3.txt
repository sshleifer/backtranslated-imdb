I had high hopes for this movie. Theater is a very attractive man in greatness and Nick Bathshend, with so many experiences and knowledge when it comes to the movie. <br /> <br /> I am a fan of many Belgian movies, but this movie is bad. The 34-year-old actor is playing the role of teenager, it's totally unbelievable. "Linguistic Games" were violent and at the top. Nothing about the film seems real to me. <br /> <br /> I was very frustrated and I lost one and a half hour of my life.
