I was not a fan of the 2005 Gore Festival hit "hostel", and most of these lamps were bad or bad - still "live feed" minimized me for some fun about the first 30 minutes. Starting with most sexual and comfortable settings, following the Chinese organized crime squad and a 7-foot, skin-eaten good death scene ... which has kept me out of the movie is 'tough' hero. Gun and annoyance to save the day ... I will call this movie as mediator, because of the fact that due to the involvement of killing of overwhelming young people in a painful porn theater, the secret for the Mafia is double, I am being requested. If the prosecution is prolonged to be sufficiently effective, then my rating was very different. Unfortunately, most of the unpleasantness is united in one scene, the rest of the film goes to the conclusion of the revenge-trend scene. So, basically, this is a low-budget "hostel" rip off, with the use of unwanted sex release, the first half of the film is almost constant ... Overall, I would not mind being bothered about it.
