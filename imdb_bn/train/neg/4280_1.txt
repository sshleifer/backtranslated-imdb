It must be accompanied by a special rating and caution: not recommended to the general public. <br /> <br /> The panic of Danieluke's most dirty body activity has become a real nightmare here. Also, it is proved that the person is a misconception, he hates everyone - his country is his people, his actor, his work. And this hatred makes him blind and he forgot what he knew long ago. <br /> <br /> This so-called "movie" is just a scary string of artifacts and images of hate with any professional knowledge. It's a shame in good taste and good sense. Shame, shame, shame!
