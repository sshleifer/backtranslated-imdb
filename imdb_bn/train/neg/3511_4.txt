'I'm working for a brutal corporation to spy on artists in the future and I'm really confused about me, s * #! I've got a headache and things are going on a stroll, oh no other miraculous fast-cut word has come here but instant still mysterious picture .... <br /> I hired this movie because some of the reviews have been optimized. Why? Cipher is set to be a cheap, derivative, lazy film, a weakly predictable happiness prediction, wood lead and a ridiculous ending. <br /> <br /> A fun sense can be something that can happen that can happen to you. In the continuation of the growing stupid and uncertain events, filmmakers face you face to face, which combine the worst bond with a hard and fast video. <br /> <br /> It has painfully assembled the production of Dr. K. Some improvised special effects for the style (if little Babylon 5) included pieces of CGI set. This sub-fight club, Sub-Philippe Dick, has tried Nir's thriller for a much more broader chance than its decent budget. <br /> <br /> The quiet blue mood is heavily served with shamelessness - frustratingly stupid. This is not an intelligent Sci-Fi, it's a computer game plot.
