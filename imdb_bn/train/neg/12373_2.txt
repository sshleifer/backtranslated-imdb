This script is so ridiculous ... As a result, the lines of the actors believe the hard and the illogical word and can not be believed. Repeat phrases - "Daughter of my sweet little god" and the small diversity of the lines that come to mind ... and it's just drunk soap opera conversations. <br /> <br /> Bad, yet the music is so bad! Plus, the main bluesy "theme" is terribly and completely wrong for this. And it is used mostly in most cases because the materials, textures, and arrangements of this theme never change, even in the psychological context of the scene it does not change. Later, whenever it is displayed, it turns from one scene to another, like a serious organ. <br /> <br /> Music freak, and the writer writes music for soap or sitcom - it's less than the budget of the 80's Canadian Citcom - and it seems to make it feel like we're always on the skeleton of commercial throwing. <br /> <br /> It's too bad, there's a lot of pressure here and it's a real extension that many of these characters are doing just one type of NY accent - a thick bronze accent. I do not know if this is only a question of limited power of intelligent actors * One * NY accent - or is it the question of the competent skill of targeting such a fuzzy inconsistency? <br /> <br /> Finally, this is an amateur script whose led lines create this whole "movie" ... blow. When a foundation is unstable and unsteady, it is impossible to build it based on its flaws that are released more harmless and unnecessarily.
