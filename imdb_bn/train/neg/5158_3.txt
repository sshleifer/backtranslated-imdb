Sometimes, creating something weird and contemporary always does not always work its advantage. Although I acknowledge that the design and concept of film set was rather interesting, these ideas were not to be performed in a consistent story. This image was so slowly and dull, even Robin Williams could not save the trash. It is clear that Barry Levinson's dream was flat on his face, but he should warn the rest of the world about this hoop.
