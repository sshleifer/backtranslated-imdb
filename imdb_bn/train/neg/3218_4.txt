I think this image is an interesting study because of the cause and effect but a little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of some people of the people and how their actions (deliberately and otherwise) affect the lives of others. The film's firm commitment pledges great promise but I think it failed to deliver its promise. It is too much time to tell viewers about the theory of chaos, and in fact it's very short time to show. As a result, I did not really get real sense for any character and never had a good relationship with them mentally. At the end of the film, I had a "attitude" about them all. This film could have been a strong part of the character's development, but it just stands out that
