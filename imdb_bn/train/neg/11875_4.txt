Mr., a big stack of pancakes is not good? Maple syrup and fruit are stored above. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another one. Another one. Eat Eat it, you !!! It keeps pushing your neck down until your face becomes vomiting. You just got the experience of Ally MacBell. <br /> <br /> I pushed this event into the winter of '98 and was instantly fitted. Like Pankeck's stack, I put myself on it. But the pleasure was soon started because the character of the Ally McBellel (which we see as clever and respectful in the first view) is very annoying, insecure, complaining that you have ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I like that my woman produces the spine.) The hug and the prints of this show become hackneyed, the music of Venda Shepherd (which is really fascinating in your face) becomes frustrating and continuous character shifts changes and rewrites Turns into an amazing soap opera. <br /> <br /> Take this suggestion to you in small doses and leave it hasty (and it will be). I made it through the 2.5th season before my joy was completely soured. It was long, but it turned ugly after a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend like it just overstayed her welcome. <br /> <br /> Next time you go to IHP, skip pancakes. Order something as healthy as the fruit cup. It would be a lot better to sit with you.
