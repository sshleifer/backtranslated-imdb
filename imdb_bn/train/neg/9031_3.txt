The packbox is being played in this play and the revenge plot has been restored by the unreasonable story line, which later determines the level of firearms that came. Why would a man suspect a ruthless public trophy wife around the ruthless Henchen in his palace? Why would a unhappy wife encourage a whole newborn's attitude and expect to carry her with her and let her husband and Boroda live happily after her new love? Surely Kevin Coster's hero certainly expected a reaction from helpless husbands, which gives an excuse for the film to be stupid roaring and violence. Anthony Quinn, the great actor he was, was even better, and Madeleine Stove was the tragic personality who kept quiet to his prince. Stowe is ok but its Spanish accent does not work. Less players are well-suited to Kyos, especially Miguel returning and John LeGuZamo and Sally Kirkland are fierce as a fading rock star.
