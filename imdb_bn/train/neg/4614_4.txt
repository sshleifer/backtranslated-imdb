This film has been nominated for seven Oscars and won one by one. Because it is not uncomfortable, because it should really be given to the collective certification of creative parties behind it, but it was nominated for the Prize Honorary nomination in each division. Someone will say that John Houston, old Hollywood pioneer, lost it in his career, but I was buying it. Only last year he had a fantastic sign under the vowck, a dark character research in Mexico, which he was among the greatest achievements of all time. On the other hand, a movie loaded with the honor, star power, good intentions and a decent script proved to be a big fall. <br /> <br /> The overall tune and plot of a Girlster is that, in the early 90's, the violent criminals who were caught by Hollywood stormed the hit-man's appearance, but the script itself has narrowed down, the motions have stopped, and the whole It looks uncertain about what the story is really going to be: a romantic comedy, a crime drama, a gangster So etc. Jack Nicholson (a Brooklyn accent that works perfectly for De Niro but seems impossible to come from Jack) and Catherine Turner's main role seems to be in pitch mode, sleepwalking around their way through some part of the motion. Angelica, on the other hand, offers better fares, but her character is hurt by the motivation of her character: She starts hunting for her father's misconduct; She is proven to support her ex-husband, then becomes a ridiculous dog who desires her head. A plate. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < There is a promise behind the story, and perhaps a director may be accustomed to the hungry voice that it can do something better, but the rest of the film looks like it is not really interested.
