Dietrich Bonhofer's writings have had a profound effect on my life as a Christian and I have waited long enough to see this movie and eagerly inquire about his life. The word seldom can express my frustration. This film was isolated ... it did not give a background to his life, in a historical context and his great writing (except for a reference to "the cost of discipleship" by a colleague at the beginning of the film). Instead, we enjoy him jazz (obviously in the US) and joking with his friends before deciding to return to Germany. Apparently showcased her human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. He stands where he stands for his faith. Instead of emphasizing, we get very bad romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Actually or not, it can not be a big part of the movie. Now ... still waiting for the dramatic part, or some descriptions that explain everything in his writing ... or something to tell us about this man's glory. Drum-roll ..... Wait ..... ..... Wait ..... zip Nada This is a film that gives a bad name to "Christian movies". What they had to do was to create a framework to follow the film, some backgrounds ... even some voice-over, or flashbacks for the promotion from his work ... some stories that he was and where he was. But not ... this is what we got. Fit tightly for a hero of faith.
