Poor hype goldberg Imagine him at a friend's dinner party, and he deeply deeply added a comment on political discussions. People just looked at him, "Oh, you know, you were the star of Theodore Rex". How can anyone take him seriously after this tremendous shaky staring himself as a star? Even little kids will be cringing in these things horror. It reminds me of 'Sigmund and the Sea Monsters', especially the bad episode. In fact, come to think about it, there was a lot more than 'Sigmund'. <br /> <br /> But it was made? Before telling him before running the producer with an illegal substance? See this hateful hate at your own risk.
