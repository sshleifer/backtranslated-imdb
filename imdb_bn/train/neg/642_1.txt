After all, if you are a comic fan, you will be very disappointed I am sure! Low budget movie !!! Largo is supposed to be a Serbian in comics, now he suddenly falls, PFF! Chicken producer, it gives some torches and haats to comics (by the way, in the film, his father speaks in the Serbian language and he speaks in summer ... Lol). Interesting NY Wechch building became a common average-small yacht. Well looking Largo becomes some unshaved Tzigan / Turkish looking guy. Freddie Cold 'Squareface' pilot became some fat, shaped, sad, average person. Simon, the best friend of largo, does not exist! He gave some pepper! Largo does not throw all knifes, but only some snakes stares ... the whole story is confused and looks like a provocative TV-film. French directors and producers, if you do not have the money, then the ability to adapt the comics properly, please contact some romance in Paris. Very bad picture, the best thing I just paid, do not rely on me to see the seagel (if there is!).
