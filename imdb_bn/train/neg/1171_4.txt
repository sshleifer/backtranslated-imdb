I can not believe that this neutral, Turkish and poorly-directed film is a filmmaker, whose other work I enjoyed quite a lot. The experience of tolerating The Lady and the Duo (and any other word but "will") left me in a vague mood, a condition was released by reading IMDB user's comments by LI-112. Rohihis did not try to successfully see the world through the art of 18th-century French style, but Ali has said that showing the effects of both the class consciousness (shown at the cost of isolating its audience) and the revolution it inspired during the time of an extraordinary elitist woman. The director has done a lot of hard work, but I ask whether it is a proper effort for him - or the question to us to see the absolute results of our labor.
