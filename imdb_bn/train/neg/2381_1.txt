I'm not surprised if this film is going to go but cowgirls get blues. I hope something good from Uma Thurman, that is why I enjoyed my way through this experience. An awesome film with only music as a redeeming quality. It is a shame that we are unable to provide 0 out of 10 in these reviews. This movie deserves it.
