I'm Scooby where you grew up, and I still love it. This is my favorite cartoon with Darking Dock, Telespin, Peter Pan and Pirates and Tom and Jerry. Although this show is good for kids, the voice is good (Don Messik and Casey Kasem Schubi and perfect as a shaggy), theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animations. But it is rather frustrating. I usually do not think Scrappy, but when he looks like the main character, it gets annoying quickly. CatchPrase is complete with dog power, scrappy is somewhat annoying than usual. Also missing the gang after the first year, in any way it does not feel like Scooby Doo. And the lines of the trick and story were unmasking ordinary hair and immune, very little chasing monsters or baddies. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo: Get a source, but this show is frustrating. 4/10 For animation, voice, tune the theme and it's great for kids. Bethany Cox's Bazar
