There were some underneath kicks in this movie, but this is an old story that can not happen only. Navy protocols can never be broken that a crew is too low that the XO can sometimes go against the captain. If I want to see this plot, then I'll take Dr. Strangelov. Sidneyot - The US Navy did not support this film.
