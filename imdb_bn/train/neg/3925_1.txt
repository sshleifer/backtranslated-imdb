After it was released in 1986, I saw this "hot" movie. It was an x-ray rating for an overview with an oral scene, but in mainstream theater (it was an "art film"). It looks like this is a first sex scene actress. It is never seen that I am a boring story about a high school boy (Federico Pittajalis). (Maruschka Determers). Ditmars was mentioned before being very nice with a good body but he gave a very good performance. Pitzalis was (poorly) to be quite poor. It's no wonder that he never made another movie. Nonetheless, despite the notorious sex scene (which is clear but quite short), this is a slow lazy story that made me fooled. Perform well by Determers only to help in a certain point. Mostly I was waiting to wait for my watch to finish it. If this sequence is not there then this movie has long forgotten. Dust and slow You can skip this one.
