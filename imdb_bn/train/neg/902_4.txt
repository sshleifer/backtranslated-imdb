I think this movie has a relevance today because it is an early Sofia Lorraine film. In 1953, when the film was made, he was 19 years old. <br /> <br /> I saw this picture because I wanted to see some of the primary tasks of Sofia Lorraine. I was surprised when he came to the camera when he looked like an Ethiopian prince, his skin had bronze on Brown makeup. Of course, today, it will be seen as a slim and avoided making movies. In fact, it became annoying to see Miss Lorraine in skin-colored paints throughout the film. <br /> <br /> Yes, if this film is created by true opera singers then this image would have been better. Then, the singers of real artists and genuine facial gestures became apparent. True orthodox singers, without commenting others about whether weighing weight more heavily. <br /> <br /> Miss Lorraine was just as beautiful as 19, and today the film gets better. Although it is being run at the stage Finally, we can not see the beautiful young people on the screen, "old opera singer" is coming back from the back of the screen! Do not discount the success of the use of heavy weight opera singer. Only J. Yes. For the company of the Weinwort, the most artistic producer of television should be mentioned commercially, which is praised by the company's products professionally with the opera singers of Stage Gayre. It is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced so far. <br /> <br /> The quality of movie printing also makes this product a bit lesser. The color ink has faded a lot and it can not be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company needs to add an English language subtitle so that we can not speak Italian, what the songs can tell. This will help the story and the 30-second presentation of the scene will teach more to the presenter. <br /> <br /> This image is not an id story, or is it an opera? Alongside Miss Sofia Loran, none of her co-actors knew the author. Instead, check out this movie if you are a fan of Miss Lauren and want to see him at the age of 19 - no matter what. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
