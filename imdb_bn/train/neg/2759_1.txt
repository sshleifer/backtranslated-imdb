Smiling, laughing at the moment ... and not yet a comedy. I especially like the ambulance-laden Gaga "dirty left", who is angry when he says, "You are dirty left", I mean, some of the online degrees are being paid in literature! Imagine the worst scripts, an instant plot, with the funny movements of the story, with the development of character (even in the characters mentioned in it .. that they believe in each other for years and believe in) effect, and plot holes .. Oh God There's a plot hole !! I'm not writing this whole thing even though I see it, but I definitely hope at least 30 minutes or more to earn sincere efforts in the movie ... Thanks to God, we have forgotten that this movie is loaded ... well ... that special Use your imagination to finish the sentence!
