I'm a huge Stooges fan but this is one of the movies and only the redeeming quality that Kelly has it. He completed this before drinking plenty of alcohol, and this is his classic self (and Larry is not bad). Mor's character is a direct part (mostly) and this movie will be called "The Curley and Larry Movie". Stooges movie was no good (my opinion), but here a commenter says, how sad it was the actual prospect of this movie. The cast was good, it was well managed, painted and edited, but the story line tried to be a bit more serious with some of the stogies antics and musical numbers (which I guess was better after that). What you can do for yourself in this movie, you really believe that it should be better than digging the lawn and the trash (which is subject to the debate) is the Curley / Larry scene and waiting for sleep or finding something in the kitchen . It's time left.
