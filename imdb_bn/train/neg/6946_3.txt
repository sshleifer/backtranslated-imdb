I've seen this movie a long time ago (Approxers 10 years or longer) and like it. I decided to keep it in mind the other day and see it again. Almost the second time was not pleasant. Acting 'So, so', the plot is irrational, irrational and anticipated. <br /> <br /> ... I'm sure that those actresses did not extend to play those characters. Conspiracy ... There is no way in the hell that women got less than two robberies with the first robbery. (Next note: Why TT did not understand that he came with loadshedding for the date of the court, even asked where he got it and there will be no logical answer! Ding, Dung ... we have a crow!). Black-colored black girls are basically saying that black women can 'kill the system' or collect huge amounts and do not steal their intelligence or other resources. It played much more on sympathy and they all ended (Bar Zada) but not sadly (you think 'they were so stupid, they deserve to die). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />
