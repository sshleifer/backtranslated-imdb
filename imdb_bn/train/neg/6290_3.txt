Repetition: Ron Mail is about marriage. They are deeply and loving and some are perfect for each other even though they were just a few months ago. Tod, Ron's wedding is not so happy. He fears that the marriage decision of his family's bad business threat and Ron's bachelor party is arranged. But his real plan is to keep Ron in an abusive situation, to get evidence and break Ron and the mail. <br /> <br />: Though it is supposed to be a comedy classic, it's not funny. It is mostly a young excuse to show a young show and young girls. Actually, in a way, it's almost everywhere, because you can have many effects on it. Unfortunately, it is one of the symptom of a film that can not support itself. It's not just good enough. <br /> <br /> It has three redemption points, or indeed three actors, the better value of the script. It is directed by Chief Actor Josh Cook who actually gives an impression in some common sense. Sarah Foster knows I have more talent than this kind of movie, and Emanuelle Wogier seems to have much more talent than this movie. <br /> <br /> What is the suspicious absence of good joke? Indeed, bad joke is rather inexhaustible. It's not just funny. <br /> <br /> 3/10
