This will be one of the worst movies of the 1990s. When my friends and I saw this movie (targeted objectives were aimed) we were sitting only when our jaws were really bad, then our jaws touched one hour. During the rest of the time, all of the theaters started talking to each other, usually with their popcorn cry or cry that they actually paid, they came to work to see this poor excuse for a movie. It seemed to be a great idea on paper, but it seems like a source has started in the film. Whip acting, shit dresses I can not be embarrassed to feel embarrassed at how. Save yourself one hour and some of your life ... .........
