Once you see this show you see them all, the formula is exactly the same for each episode. Jim keeps his way to something good but he bothers his wife, until finally he realizes what he did for him really, he awakened his cheek and wondered a smile smiling. Actually the lines of the story are so long and formulas that I'll take a stab right now. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jim's Wife thinks that the salary of the Week Weekly Jim disappeared, he explains that he lost it in the casino. He shouted and how horrible the room was, he was crying. Then on Valentines day he returned to Limo with a ball ticket (hence explained the missing wage). He understood his 'wrong' and usual 'Oh Jim, you are very nice'. Another very obvious thing is that based on Homer Simpson's Jim Character, the cartoon character can become intellectual and unconscious, while trying to do it with the man is not working and Jim is just a proud self Coming as centralized oxidizing. <br /> <br /> IMO is the only reason for this success because in terms of man with just TV, we now have a lot of people, these days you can show a person about a person who corrupts the wall and you want to get an audience. <br /> <br /> 'Half male' on the other hand is fantastic and delightful.
