Dracula 2000 was a horror movie that was shown consistently in Sky Movies in Britain and it was considered that it was screened almost three times a week in a week. I have no idea how I will miss it until the first broadcast of the network. Tonight televisions Actually I have not been a fan of horror movies, perhaps it is going to be frustrating because of my theory. My theory has been proven correct for the most part <br /> <br /> !!!!! MINOR SPOILERS !!!!! <br /> <br /> Such a bad movie about Daraka 2000 is a stupid scripting mood involved in mobile phones. For example, at the beginning of the film, bad guys are flying Dracula's coffin from London to America (on a Twin Engine Turbo Propane plane!), And bad people have to live alone in cargo hold in Dracula's life. A fight breaks, there are many words, but the bad guys of cockpit can not hear any word until the script is claimed. It is also seen in the climax of this segment that Dracula can control the weather but forget about the film's progress. Problems with scrippy scripting, and structures are also seen in which New Orleans has numerous scenes of Mardi Gras characters, then the characters are in a different place, like the following scene, for example, they are coming back after the Mound Grounds, which means the lack of credibility on the plot has been increased. /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In multiple scenes where there is a specific record The Bell / Retailer Discipline logo is in full view. I did not have the courage to preach the company's brand (except they are running a train company, which is Britain's national joke) but I think such advertisements were against British broadcasting guidelines and I was surprised by the BBC <br/> <br/> <br/> < <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Intu the last few years, some of us should expect from Hollywood - looks very good, which is very silly movie
