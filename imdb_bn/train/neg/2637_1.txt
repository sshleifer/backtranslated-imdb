Seriously, I do not even know where to start. It seems like someone has given an autistic third-grade budget for the Bazillion dollar and says, 'Make a movie about secret services'. The film was ridiculous, the cinematography was always random, the conversation was completely blocked and the direction was ... well, was there a manager? Everything was just so vain and hairy and dull ... and shuffle .... and lam. <br /> <br /> here is a spinner for you; This movie is the most dirty thing you'll see. <br /> <br /> However, if you like these pieces, you will also enjoy; Deterrance, dark blue, and a partial frontal lobotomy.
