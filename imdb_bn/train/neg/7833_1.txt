I only saw Stephen King's Nightmares and the third week of the Dreams cap mini series; I mean, I've seen 6 episodes so far. I want to say that the story is really weak. I've read Steven King's Skeleton crew, a collection of his short stories that were published. I think most of the stories were poor average but one was extraordinary, if not outstanding. <br /> <br /> What I'm trying to say is that from a collection of this mini-series, the story from Stephen King means that it will be a good one. In fact, if the previous collections of his short stories give no indication, most of the mini-series in this mini-series is the average of the poor. <br /> <br /> In Stephen King's defense, I did not read these new short stories. Perhaps they are as good as a book story and are not easily readable on television, or it was probably the fault of writers written to write a fun script. Who knows Also, these short stories were made for this mini series only and are not intended for printing. Maybe there could be problems. If Stephen King submits this editorial writer to the editor, I'm sure the editor has asked him to make it more interesting, because it is just boring. <br /> <br /> <br /> This problem is not with stories / scripts, not actors and actresses because some nice people in this mini series are acting in it. Seeing this mini series really shows me the old "Twilight Zone" series. Each series was just half an hour but it was compulsory and riveting. I can not understand why this mini-series could not achieve a similar achievement I was certain that this mini series was a good deal for creating a good mini series. But unfortunately, some should not have clicked. For example, this week two The first one is a horror story writer who has bought a picture pictured by an artist who committed suicide.As a domestic worker is driving, the author begins to see the picture change, it seems uncomfortable that he threw away the painting but kept it near him. , A person's portrait of a person is killing the person and killing him. (I am this snake Taher's second episode is not to mention the involvement of criminals and their plundering, because it was even more annoying than this episode!) <br /> <br /> This episode is interesting and the story should be good, but after seeing it, I was disappointed Because there were many spaces in the external materials as well as the stories which showed that the story did nothing to help. After the last scene, I kept more questions than the answers. <br /> <br /> I tried 3 weeks to enter this mini series, but it was very annoying because of bad stories / scripts. If it was a movie, then I had given the suggestion that the film should wait for the movie or the movie. I will not even suggest to rent your video store. However, this is TNT, given to a cable channel, I would say if you have not already seen it, then try it for a week. If you do not like that week, you will not like the past series and future things, because they all share the same annoying features.
