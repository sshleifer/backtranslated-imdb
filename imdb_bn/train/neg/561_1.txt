Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it was - unfortunately - worse than you think. First of all the plot is stupid, it has no sense. The script is full of deliberate fun conversations. The audience was smiling a lot of times. And mystery is very low. Actors play with it, with the exception of Sharon Stone, who have some good moments but some bad acting moment. The most deadly part when he tries to become aggressively sexy and says "I want to * beep you" and it seems like it is a very mature woman acting abusive and not quite sexy. That loving tension has completely gone from BI1. A medium film from the technical aspect of Basic Institute 2 - usually better than direct DVD, but much lower than the original movie. For example the crazy joyride scene is done badly. The Director of Basic Institute 2 is a Paul Wehrhoven and it shows. The new composer is no longer the Goldsmith and his show. The script is made by people who are not related to Joe Jossey. There is no alternative for Michael Douglas. The film is cheaper and badly displayed at times. I'm sorry, but after leaving the theater, my first thought was: "Why did they make this movie before and after the success of the first movie made by genius?" Why is all the original cinema being better than Citizens? The first Basic Institute is like a break between a classic and popular movie. It was provocative, sexy and controversial. His career was the best Sharon Stone's performance. It was this particular Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately, Basic Institute 2 is a strange movie, badly operated and a surefire Razzi award winner in many sections. It's a sad that they made this picture.
