Oh ... yes, this is heartwarming and it was taken by some unfortunate family ABC / Sears and their house "renewed". Where humanitarian appeals end. I like to run it early, but now this show has become frustrating. <br /> <br /> In the disguise of each episode of this show, with many advantages for each family, ten essential families can be given relatively luxurious houses. . Accommodation for humanity must be shaking their heads in disbelief. For example, a healthy 16-year-old boy needs to have Jacuzzi in his bedroom, or does he need to go out of bed with "low rider" hydraulics? Does the mother really need to "recover" her mischievous, miraculous and old pickup trucks and "pump" California's best customizers? A new job is quite nicely, and probably worked for one-third of the price. Do people really need 50-inch plasma screen in each room of the house? And then there are problems with paying additional property taxes and utility bills. Even after "Junk" on holiday, someone still has a living income. I doubt the friendly folks at social friends will look ridiculous in this suspect down. <br /> <br /> This show is nothing more than a rating grabber for ABC, and a tacit commercial for its sponsors.
