Not very good movies, but it is quite accurate by describing torture techniques according to the information. The purpose of the film was to demonstrate the cruelty of NK Pau camps and it has been surprisingly effective for an effective period. There is a technical error (and lots of) by this, you'll see a forgotten angle of forgotten war and some pretty nasty things - again, nasty because it is being answered to the DMZ and not Guantanamo Bay. <Br /> <br /> I do not think any Korean officer has increased his torture while running, and if you look at movies like this and Poker Chip Hill compared to Vietnam movies. I did not know that in 5454 the man was trapped in the WWII concept (boys are very much known) or war or what, but after 16 years it is interesting to see it from the same procedure. Make a film like "Secret Spartans".
