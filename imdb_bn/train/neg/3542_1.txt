After reading the comment on the site, I was compelled to write for the first time. Looks like this movie is like marmite and has divided the viewers. I say that when I agree to the film, I do not have to enjoy it (see Muhland Drive) they still have to attach you with letters. Now when I was completely absorbed by Lynch's tears in a homosexual relationship, I would have to say that I could not give anything boring about Mr Green or other cardboard gangster in this summer world. Also, many people try and say that you are not enjoying because you did not find it, but I would like to disagree - I did not enjoy because I was bored. I wanted to finish the film and did not help again to hear those quotes. But <br /> <br /> The main reason for my writing is the question of all other critics - the picture I saw did not have any end credits. . Just music on black. Did I see a ugly print or proof of GR's ugly? Or everybody involved in the movie saw rough cut and their name moved ???
