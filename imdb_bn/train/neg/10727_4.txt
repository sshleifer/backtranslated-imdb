If you stop the film after half an hour then it is only worth seeing. It starts with funny conversations at a bar and it is a good hope, funny stories have to come. Well, I can not tell you it will not come. This will be reduced in a few minutes that will increase your embarrassing feelings for your patience and the actors, probably you will not be pleased to testify. <br /> <br /> In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express the feeling of the feeling of expression in the film, according to him, most people in this world-wide world experience. I was surprised to hear that. Do I live in the same world? Well many people roam around the same clothes like me and listen to the same music and all, but I do not think that I lose my identity. What do Khrzhanosvky think, we wear clothes and movies we meet are not that much? Am I shotsighted or he? <br /> <br /> My vote: My conclusion is that if the film starts well, it can get 1, a decent 4.
