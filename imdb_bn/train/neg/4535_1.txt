Slow, senseless, annoying Three enthusiasts describe the book's movie. This is certainly an event where the film should never have been created while spending the film. Scenery in the best part of the film was wonderful. The worst part was the slow-moving interaction of actors immediately combined with meaningful glances. The editing is casual and patchy. However, despite this, the actors are trying to be less believable with at least one scary script. It is frustrating that even though Peru was set up, only one of the descendants of the Peruvian was floating inside the set - even in visible scenes painted in the 17th century Peru. If you have a sense of history then try to avoid this movie.
