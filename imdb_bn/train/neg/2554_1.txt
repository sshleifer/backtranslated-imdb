I'm not really kidding when I say that it's one of the worst movies ever! This movie will not have a single ounce of basic radioactivity or linear storyline of its slow-moving storyline. I can not begin to count the numbers of this film, which has been explicitly closed from "Omn" and other movies. For example, in this film the grandmother "Lucy" is actually the smallest one of Satan sent to protect and protect Satan's cyclone ............................ .................................................. ................................ Another thing is that the orphan child first received a few months as "The Omen" Then it was burnt to the ground. Thankfully, a priest started to burn and was burning on his body ... there was still another incident ?????? And it was placed in the top of the burnt priest, on the walls of the hospital with a picture of Jesus on the wall, much like the priest of "The Omen" sponsored by the Bible on a wall like a wall. Please do not let me start the comparison of this movie and "The Woman" because I have mentioned above that there is a lot to mention here.
