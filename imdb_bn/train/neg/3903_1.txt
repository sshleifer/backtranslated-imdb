Emma is my favorite Jane Austen novel - Emma is well-meaning, despite her mistakes, so readers can forgive and love her and her relationship with Mr. Knightley, which is warm, familiar, respectful but playful, with warm, vague, romantic tension. Mr Knightley is a perfect man, and Emma is as close as you can to a freelance, clever, confident woman - remember that she was only 21 years old and her flaws were sure to mature. Emma does not want to be? Do not tell Mr. Knightley? This version of Emma does not give you any idea of ​​how to love Emma. I could not even finish watching it, I found it so terrible. I did not see the warm, liberal aspect of Uma which led the reader to love: patience and warmth showed to his father; The intimacy between her and Mrs. Weston, which she wants to keep her friend on her own happiness (since she forwarded Miss Taylor's marriage to her family's only equal companion). In this adaptation, Mr Woodhough's character appears to be rather strange, rather than a grown up and a bit of effort. <br /> <br /> This adaptation leads to the relation of Mr. Knightley and Emma's relationship with the most important failure. Their relationships are built on mutual respect and affection: Mr Knightley believes in Emma's little less consequence that her intelligence and genuine care for others will not let her misguide misguided; And Emma shows him, though the game has been hidden and he continues to use his judgment. At the beginning of the show, he completely disputes the right to his right and destroys all possibilities to illustrate the nature of the relationship described above. Mrs. Nightley is unexpectedly attractive to bring sexual excitement in life for a lack of life (or encourages any praise from female viewers). <br /> <br /> Really awesome. I do not understand why anyone who likes the true novel can choose Amma, unless it's miraculously stopped after I close myself.
