Although the film must contain a bad film stitch, it is surprisingly observable at several levels. First, for the old movie fans, Dean Jagger (not related to Mick) plays an interesting role in the main role played. Jagger later played an extraordinary role as a supporting actor (even won Oscars in this section for 12 Oklah Haiyy), here its performance was really unique because he was actually the whole head of the hair (I have never seen it before) and because he is the worst of the film Was the actor. This picture only shows that if an actor can not play in his earlier film, it does not mean he can not finally learn to be a great actor. Another good example of this phenomenon is Paul Newman, whose first film (The Silver Chalice) is considered to be one of the worst films of the 1950s. <br /> <br /> Another reason to see the film is its glasses. Everything. Writing bad, acting bad and special effects are bad. For example, when Zagra and an unnamed Cambodian are entering the water, it is clear that they are really walking and there is minimal tendency behind them in the background. Plus, once they leave the water, their clothes dry up 100% !!! Deer continuity and silly bad conversations are so huge all over the film - so much so hard to imagine why they did not ask for Lugosi or George Zuko to star in the film - because they both acted in the grade-z horror movies. In many ways, it will be a perfect example for how a film class for a film class. So, while giving it a 3 maybe a little more generous, it's fun to make fun and small so it's a look price for bad film fans.
