You will not care about that flat character and. Cringe-inducing dialogue in places No twists (they think they have one, but if you do not practice it after 40mins, you are not too bright). Many good actors role and performance know that everyone involved in luck, will be forgotten as the last credit roll. <br /> <br /> I do not think of 'slow' movie, but they've got _here to go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As you write, 37 (!) production of ten (10) ratings The concerned people will be there.
