I saw this director's "Women on the Beach" and did not understand the great reviews. This film is one such, two people who are very little dynamic and related to even less interest to someone else. Like her other movies, you have to be enchanted with very strange characters, wade through and less underwritten, very few want to hear the zero dialog. If you think you might like this movie, do not let my review stop you. I like the introverts of the film, but I think Sees Ming-Liang's films are much higher. He is a roughly awesome actor in his film Lee Kang-Sheng. There is nothing here. I like the IU, but I do not. Well good
