Swedish action movies have become something that has been "heat" like hardworking action films in the United States, but imitations in a lower budget for the last few years. This film follows the same prescription as "Null Tolerance" and "Leisure". However, it is trying very hard to create a clear and solid film. <br /> <br /> The story has been shown earlier, the dialogue is artificial and the performance is very poor, especially from the main actress. The film tries to draw a picture of the military-like robbers who fly strictly and the female investigator does not completely lose the past problems, but at the same time works perfectly logically. This is not very well successful. <br /> <br /> The blue color picture does not look fresh, and it does not look good in this picture. Only a very few scenes actually looks good. Also, the term seems quite strange and it is recorded after many actual conversations. <br /> <br /> The main attribute of this movie is Stefan Sock, although the leader of a SWAT-team does not make a strong portrait, there are some really funny lines. Also, the music is quite good.
