At the end of the movie, I felt it was very technical. I felt I was in the classroom how our Navy rescues the sea. I like to see the engines have fire extinguishers. I think I should have figured that before, but I do not think about it. Using a 747 to transport precious old paintings with very little security is not strange and realistic. Acting was great, because they are mostly seasoned professionals, but if you want to stretch far enough from what is going to happen, it can be an imaginative, ridiculous, etc. Everything was taken very seriously. Felix was angered as a pilot for at least the movie, Bak Rogers, Night Stakker and Dracula were on board. The movies were filled with well-known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to be exaggerated for the drama, but it strikes a movie quality when a serious matter becomes a curiosity. So I said it was more ridiculous. My pets are just unexpected about me that peeve with movies for plane trips. They roam around with drinks, put it down and pick them up after 5 minutes, just as they have a building or something, and act as turmoil, but it does not exist. Also, I know it's a disaster film, but after some injury, suspension 30 seconds does not have to be included in the crash. However, the skilled actor and actress kept this weak script after being turned into a movie that was later canned after its first screening. I like Lee Grant, but it's fun to see psychological person get docked :) :)
