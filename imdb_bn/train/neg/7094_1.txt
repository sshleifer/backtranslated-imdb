This Trashy B movie tries to penalize sexual assault, but it is really a poor excuse for sexual harassment. The story revolves around Sammy Horn (exquisite name) by Michael Des Berras. Sammy is a disgusting wife, Grace (Rosanna Arquette) and a small child owner of a restaurant. She has sexual orientation and every five minutes her attitude should have meaningless sex with any woman who would agree (and, of course, every woman on this planet thinks that she is old enough to collect social security) <br /> <br /> The story is about her therapist (Nastassa Kinsky), where she describes her sexual exploitation through flashbacks Icchena. This is nothing but a convenient launch point for a parade of series of sexual activities that can be at least 75% of the screen time. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to start criticizing any film that is bad. Production quality is abysmal. The film shows a video of a TV soap opera (Best) and some amazon porn flicker in somebody's garage. Direction by Joseph Brutsman is awesome with bad light, uninspired structures and poor actor aspects. The script vapid and the dialogue is stupid and vulgar. <br /> <br /> Women are generally presented as sexually abused nymphomaniacs while just waiting for the arrival of Sammy to come like an addiction and feeding their insatiable appetite with some unreasonable coupons of their humiliated ones. For example, Grace's sister became angry and asked Sammy to know that she knew she was asleep and that she would tell her wife. His reaction was to throw him against the wall and start rape him. In her nearly three seconds she has an epiphany and immediately her sex disciples converted her into a beggar disciple to give her a further. Just as Grace ended and Sees said to her, 'Oh, you look good, you have to run to pick up Timmy.' And Mam's statement about Sammy's conscience. Loyalty ties were sealed with a good hazard. Here's no spoiler because it's obvious nature of the film so generally someone that saw that first fifteen minutes could predict it. <br /> <br /> All of the illustration of sex is overdone, mechanical, and so badly is simulated that they are more ridiculous than erotic. Most of them are fully dressed with both participants. The acting is bad. Michael Des Berras presents all the depth of a rainbow. She seems to really get into thrusting sex and profanity, but when it comes to acting with Arquette and Kinski, she is adrift. Rosanna Arquette is one of the closest thing to an actor in this movie, she provides an extraordinary performance and finally discovered that her animated animal is an animated animal. Nastassja Kinski as a therapist is much more compassionate, but at least we have some acting here. The rest of the cast is simply a collection of higher body doubles, which gives them the worrisome lines of 'excited hit', which you can do? And 'oh, god ?? Yes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the worst, I found a suspicious difference in seeing thousands of movies. I gave it rating 1/10 extremely rare dishonor. No food will be seen in three hours.
