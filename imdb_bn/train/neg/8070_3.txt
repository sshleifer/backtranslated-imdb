This is not a very good movie, but it's not a sticker. It is very confusing and unnecessary to rent it at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My gf and I found this movie (we think) so here it is: <br /> <br /> * ** The big spirir *** below. <br /> <br / First of all, this film is quite easy after removing the confusing unconscious-dream-state junk (95% film). <br /> <br /> ignoring junky, what actually happened is: A group of school friends goes to a revenge one night. They leave and die in a car accident where everyone without the sanitary and sun. That easy-cut version (Okay, I told Shane, bear with me) <br /> <br /> After this accident, Casey stuck to life and death until the end of the movie. This dream section begins. <br /> <br /> This movie is called Soul Survivar, is not it? Cassie carries after interacting interacting along with images conjured with her in mind with souls (Annie, Matt, Reno, 2 Weirdos and Jod) and other souls (Sean, school and everything else around him). The souls have been defined as: Annie the Rave-Ging Chick, two strange killers (from the scene being opened), Father Jude is still helping the people <br /> <br /> We were a very long journey, a lot of pictures Shown (in which my gf and I still can not tie it) but it all goes down that does not mean the death of Casey. <br /> <br /> Finally, Casey wakes up in the hospital after being "dead" for a while. Her family and hone are there. This is the reality again. She's okay. <br /> <br /> Then the director tries to confuse a small dream in a wheelchair and adds a little extra torch. But this part is really just a nightmare, and she wakes up on the side, apparently dealing with her tragic experience. <br /> <br /> Because of space restrictions, we did not cover every little thing, but free <br /> <br /> If you want, please send us an e-mail.
