What could be the run of matches otherwise, in the sixties, the middle film about betrayal (the delicate "free-love" period), the makers of this film pauses on ridiculous scenes after the ridiculous scene and put them on the reverse side with little cherry, happily never ending . I never felt any sympathy in Diane Lane or Ana Fakhin's boring middle class's caring life, or I did not even feel the feeling I felt. The story line gradually concludes its expected, unfortunate and interesting about this movie and the only thing to watch is the stunning Diane Lane Topless. Here is an indication, it takes about 30 minutes into the film. Skip that part fast forward and left.
