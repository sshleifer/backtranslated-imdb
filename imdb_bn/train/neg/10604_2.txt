At this time the protagonist of the first film has become a man, and at that time a computer and a foot combo used against super universal soldiers, the computer has become terrible and ready to accept the world. I'm sure it was a double team, which knew that John-Cloud Van Dam was not reliable and reliable to provide guardianship. But it was forever its credibility. Universal Soldier: The Return is not as neutral as the Double Team or The Quest, but it is still quite awkward, without any style of style and original and any star pair. These signals are made for kids who enjoy professional wrestling. As I look back, even that action sequence was not that exciting at all and seeing this movie is a valuable ugly. In other words Van Damme is another partner of the assembly line. <br /> <br /> * 4 (bad)
