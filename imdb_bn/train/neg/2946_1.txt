I must say that during my childhood I am proud of several of the renowned movies. Theodore Rex is an exception. Any actor's resume talk about swindler movies all the time. Can you just imagine that Huawei's expulsion agent asked him to sign in to this shit, "Hey hoop, you never see those dinosaurs, yes they are making a movie of this and you can see them in Germany!" Then the agent must be of Star Wars Should be mentioned. <br /> <br /> This picture was so bad that I think HuP would buy the copy of this movie and it was destroyed. I could only do the same thing in my memory, because my sister still falsified me for that movie. I mean, I saw Mr. Nani and Kazjam in the theater (I have seen good reasons for leaving Halkan and Shake for a while), but I think this is the worst. Childhood, and the biggest rent of my life, sorrow, and that 16 years ago. I want to math now 24. <br /> <br /> Whenever I think of the list of the worst movies ever, I do not mention it because, like a raped midwife, I have tried to suppress the pressure. You screw the hoop, just glad people admit your most lucky as Eddie and Sister Law 2 are difficult for you.
