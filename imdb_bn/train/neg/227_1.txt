Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This image starts with a light hearty banner of three women. Fine When it met a woman it moved in a conflict between women. Fine There are a few antics among them. Fine But when the plot gets frozen and eventually turns black, I start thinking that I have misunderstood the first part of the movie. It continues this vein for a while, eventually, it tries to return to the original light-hearted banner. But so far it's too late. Why are these women still talking to each other and it's hard to see why the final is incredible. Actually do not create a lesson (whatever the British filmmakers do). Producers never believe in themselves how this film will work harder And box office proved it a real flaw, because I have never heard of this movie this weekend (four years after its release) till this movie.
