Less than the length of the TV movie of the 1970 movie, "Love, American Style," decorated with nudity, "Supercook" (1973) is a light-colored part of the Fluff, which still drives to entertain. And the main character here, Big B is really a kind of supercritical. A stewardess (Flight Advantant) looks so beautiful that his autopilot passes (!) Even at his port, and with a violent boyfriend at every port, this wing 'swin' gull is really "lei" "layover." His Zerfofob Surgeon Beau in New York, challenged the Miami gangster problem, and challenged Rock Star Dude in the L.A. in his creative way, he is definitely busy. And when he does not ruin these lively power of all his vigorous powers, he learns as a visitor, he is responsible for halting carpet classes, mile-high jerking, flushing and rapists, joining Groovy pot party and stopping hijacking efforts on his plane. . I said, light laughing, and good for the night, when you are feeling a bit brain dead and want to get out of the tube only. The future astrologer Joyce Jilson brought some nicely to her role as the star and the film is graciously appealing enough. Unexpectedly, Buxom's 70's Uzzah DiGard and Mary Gavin (Uric Kinky Sample) have been lost in a very small land here, but they can still do what they do well - show their bookmarks! Although the picture is not loud-out-loud, and there is not much thought on its metaphor, it succeeds to be consistently fun and I think it is something. It is astonishing that the last credit will attract Mrs Jilson's body twice, however; I do not think I've ever seen before!
