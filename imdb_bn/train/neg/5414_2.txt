This movie has also become a big step, which has generally come out of Bollywood. The performance was horrific. Even the bombshell, who always shimmers, go completely as the arched arch. Soundtrack is not memorable. And despite hard work, the ladies lead does not lead to "sexy". Though Vaibek is capable of a much better project, Fardin Khan seems to be stuck with the same tenant for the same time. But this monstrosity is even below its limited power as an actor. Ishar Deol and Amrita Rao are horribly terrible in a written tale. It took time for Indira Kumar to hang her directory hat. Hope he does not point to the eyes of another eye like this. The future of Hindi film is now in good hands. To add it, stay away from celluloid waste.
