First off, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. She is as well as the leader of the religious leader. The illustrious actor of Igor believes that while crying loud, smiling and laughing, a miserly smile is a great way to scare people. Eogor cried aloud loudly and loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly. She would say stupid one liners. For example, when the manuscript leader saw a group with one of his followers, Igor saw this saying and said, "Paul, why did you do it, I could have cleaned him so clean!" In another scenario, Igor told a victim that he had to get his own equipment for surgery because it was time to manage it now. Along with bad acting, the end could not be understood, because the story has grown when it has created a slight steam in the climax, which has got a crossover arrow on Egore's head and the rest of the crazy friends are being killed, and again the other two 'good boys' kill . The film does not give any explanation, only tells the viewer that Igor escaped to psychiatric hospital. What ??? The following line does not waste your time while watching this movie. I want to get this observer back in the moment.
