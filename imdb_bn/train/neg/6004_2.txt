Generally, you know what the best thing about camp movies can be. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a soap opera or a Jerry Springer show during a day: You can follow the schemy plot immediately, locate cardboard letters and see the satisfaction of filling all the clips. However, sometimes, the director does something unexpected. It can be something extraordinary, stupid, or something weird, or something insightful. Director McKinnen is there with the best camp directors, and this is his best film. <br /> <br /> Eon arbitrarily, everything looks together. There is nothing good about it, but still managed to be a consistent whole. The movie does not slow down - the action continues and the fifth is coming. <br /> <br /> The wonderful thing is that there is no time: Some characters are doing something for a few months but other characters have only spent one hour at a time. This is partly due to the summer of the summer where the sun never sets, so you do not feel the sights to travel on any night. Finally there: there is a plot. Even though you will have to watch this movie three times before making it available.
