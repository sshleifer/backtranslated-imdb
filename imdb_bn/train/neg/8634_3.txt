I saw a picture of a man attacked by zombies, hoping that Lucio "Zombi" Fulci might be up to his old tricks. Unfortunately, except for the closure of the rolling body, there is nothing to find in this story of killing a rich man and finding ways to kill him in search of his daughter. No letters are appealed and when you discover that they are taking care of you (at that point, at least, calm down), you are taking care. The only good thing I can say is that it makes more sense than nightmare concerts!
