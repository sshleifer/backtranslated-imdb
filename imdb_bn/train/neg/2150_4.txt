You must immediately recognize the plot. The daughter of one of the divorced couples is trying to get together again mother and father again. Yes, it was a parent trape theme in the 60's, 80's and 90's. But the things piled here are. Dana Durbin was younger than the 21-year-old Healy Mills, although while playing the role of marriage girls, Durbin looks old, like the elderly. And so do her so-called siblings all. <br /> <br /> And this confusion between adult and child goes through the film. Girls wear cute small sail fancy dresses but the ridiculous look of them as director directs them to point out the point of their painful top and tusies throughout the film. So you're constantly breaking into their thoughts as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start "hit" you feel they feel that they are pedophiles and you can be one, as well as leading to instruct those tunics and top executives. Child or temptation, little girl or little fox, you are not sure about what you do not want to think like them. <br /> <br /> Parents seem to be very old and the whole picture seems to be very date. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
