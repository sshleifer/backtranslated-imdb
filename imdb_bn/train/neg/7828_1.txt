In Valley 2 days as well, I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Another line of Tarantino Rip of Long, grown from PL fiction. The filmmaking atmosphere is fun for the first five minutes, but then the filmmakers make incompetent flaws to allow "hip" quotes of unnecessary and extraordinary violence. You're good off skipping this one.
