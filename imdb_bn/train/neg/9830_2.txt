I'm scared that you will see that the vast majority of people identified this movie as 10 are very Christian. I do not If you are looking for a Christian movie, I recommend this film If you are looking for a good general movie, I'm afraid you will go elsewhere. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed by letters, and by their illogical behavior. The fundamental foundation of the film is that teaching without morality teaches that Jesus was the basis of morality which is itself wrong. One view tells a boy that stealing is wrong, and then the character says that this is Jesus who taught us this. I find that offensive: Are we believed to be "not stolen" that came from Jesus? I think he wrote ten commandments? And before the theft that was acceptable? I rent movies to Netflix. I have to understand the nature of the movie from the comments. Well good
