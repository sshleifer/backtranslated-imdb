I've seen Warren Oats in many movies, I've come to a certain conclusion, here's a talented person. I first saw Mr Otce in the 1960's television series Stoney Chef. Since then, I followed his career closely and believed that he played a great role. This happened in 1974, when Sam Pekinpah gave him the top billing in a film called 'Alfredo Garcia Bring Me Head of Head of'. Of course, his biggest claim was that he played the role of 'The Wild Bowch'. I always thought that he was able to bring a certain witch to a character until I saw him in this flop. The film, known as "Chandler", is a dedication of iron fixed detectives made by Ramand Chandler in 1950. Because, onset it was about a hard nose Private Eye, I was immediately interested in. However, I sat down patiently throughout the film and thought that it was a neutral, disrespectful, gradual, cyclone, and confusing Saga, if it could be a theme or plot, but there must be some room behind the dark. Together and with the best supporting stars of Hollywood, like Alex Drey, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pincecent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo, and Scatman Crothar, the film had enough power to reach five, but it got blurred in the launch pad and where it went. As a result, my favorite actor stuck in a weakly made car which never stopped the ground. **
