Kozak fills the mafia. Telly Savales seems pretty good at those guys from the past. I was not all that great at all of his occasions. This is a quantitative characterization of a criminal owner with its expected outcome. If you are in the car and are in a general street then there is no plot development or action. I think mafia films are neutral because I have no respect or interest in ordinary criminals and their activities. Hollywood, and in this case, Italian cinema, these guys behave as heroes. I saw the movie and in a few days I will not miss a lot about it. Lots of shooting, innocent tolerant mortality, betrayal, and that sick adherence. The film is quite good pictures and the acting is decent. But dubbing is so bad (due to the voices that can not get out of body), I was looking for nearby Godzilla.
