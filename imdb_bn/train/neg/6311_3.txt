This is a bad, very bad movie. <br /> <br /> Well, a real realistic movie for people is a good thing. It's not for me. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, stupid, sometimes. Maybe this guy will say that this movie is true. <br /> <br /> A lot of common places: you are black, you are a criminal, you have been damned and cursed, you do what you do shooting or ending with a shot by someone; Do not let the kids play with arms, it can be dangerous; And then those who go to church, and then they are good, very good ... <br /> <br /> Before this, I have not seen such a bad movie. I never noticed how important photography is itself. This one, every view of the scene, outdoors shots each scene, clean and boring blue. They do not even care to fix even the color balance. Oh! I've "rating" more than 300 films in this database, and this is always my lowest (3/10).
