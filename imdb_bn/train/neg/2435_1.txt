I will warn you here: I thought that critics would believe that it is not an action film in a normal sense but rather a mental drama, so you should appreciate it on its basis and you're right. <br /> <br /> I'm telling you here that they were wrong. Completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Well, no, not complete; It is very frustrating if you are looking for an action flick, they were right about that. But it is also very dissatisfied at other levels. <br /> <br /> Tom Barring was not too bad, I think, there is nothing worse than usual; But what is there to cut off Jane? Was it the desire to die in any kind of producer? The way to make their film a sure flop? In that case, it worked. <br /> <br /> If they really aim for success, why not throw someone who can work? Oh, and as well as a screen writer who knows how to write it. Ah, yes, and a director who knows how to handle. <br /> <br /> Anyone sitting from this mess, actually believes that it will soon free himself, I can not guarantee that it was never done. Sire, it could be a good film.
