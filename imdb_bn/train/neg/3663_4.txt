The Spanish horror Icon Paul is one of his most vulnerable Wearewel movies, but he has tolerated me for a moment. Most people will be familiar with the title of its most common television, The Furry of the Wolf Man, and have many home video versions over the years. Although you want it to be serious about giving a decent shot, I found that the most effective version titled is Waf Man Man Sleeps and it's a free and full European version which recovers some annoying scenes and is missing from the print of FURY which is the original nude There are shots. It's also letterbox. <br /> <br /> Naschy plays Waldeme Danninski, returns home from a trip to Tibet only to discover that he is in contract with a vedu and is related to his wife. She takes care of her and her lover while animals and forms, but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant. Apparently, Doc tries to "make a joke" to Veruveal, and a very strange Saddo-Massocic love scene between him and Horseshoe, and at least blurred Danisque under his transition to the original version. Finally we got two bends for the Denninski war for one price! <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < The Wolf Man observation is never a waste of copy, it is not difficult to do what is happening, although the shocking remains in the edit spot remains. The worst is that Sharp has been swimming directly from other previous films of the non-intermingled football matches (El Marcel del Hambre Lub, Ur "Frankenstein Bloody Terrera") and is mixed in it for some intelligent reasons! The wolf gets white from the black shirt and comes back again, as it lacks; One moment wolf is walking slowly into an hypnotic triangle from old, next he is running bizarre and around from the purple terorrhoea. Really Wicked.
