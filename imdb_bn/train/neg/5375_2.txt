I have seen this movie, my life seems to have been lost for two hours, but I think everything is good at all: <br /> <br /> If I could rate it as another movie, it would only be 1 or 2 top But if I index it like a low budget. Film, it can get 3 or 4. It is supposed to be a movie complete 'and' without annoying or a long way to waste time. This is not the movie. But I think there are a lot of highlights in this movie, considering that many independent movie movie skills are being shown. If I want to comment on what I want to do with the managers in their next project, I think there is some quality of distorted sound effects. They also manage to create some characters, but it takes me to leave what's next in the next project, because the character takes a lot of time, because it is irrelevant to the plot of the film. The lasting time of the dedicated time to walk around will not continue in the next project - what is the matter? I think this movie tries to make a little bit of all (characters, mysteries and a plot), and nothing ends up (not much) <br /> <br /> This movie is very hard and very difficult, and I guess it should cut a small film. I could easily manage an hour or two for running an out-of-the-box conversation. <br /> <br /> There is a lot more irrelevant issues in this movie. The story should have been more relevant. I know there should be some mystery in this film, but the killer is somewhat surprised, it does not make a mystery. The story behind the "mystery" gets almost no attention in time, which leaves the final "dots" as a quick conjure up one. <br /> <br /> So I want to say that this movie was a great effort, but I could not. I hope the directors learn from their mistakes, and the next time they will produce a good product. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the desire to learn the bench from producing low budget movies but it does not need to be seen - <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, 10 movies given for this movie came from the people involved with the movie. This film could not take "10" judgment from a remote motivated perspective.
