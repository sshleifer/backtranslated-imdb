This movie is a joke and it will be one of the worst films ever made of Staloons. This is a common 80 movie, where one of your men destroys the whole army by itself. "First Blood PT2" is similar to "Shawngegner's" commando ", but Arnold has been killed in the terrorist place, although here you have been shown a certain race as a bad guy. This movie is a common American anti-Soviet propaganda. It was true, the cold war was at the peak, but I am sick of seeing the communists or the Nazis as always enemies. There are so many American films that this thing is common. Why is there a movie to show Americans as an enemy? Who would believe that only the army will destroy the entire army? Do you really think that something like this really happened? This, on average, the brain must have washed the American audience.
