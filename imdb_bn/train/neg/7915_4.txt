The X-Men movie was all great. And I want to tell them all that there was their strong character with long scary X-Men 3. (Magneto and Xavier had my opinion), and a good story arch. <br /> <br /> I was all excited when I produced this movie and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until the movie was seen. I was very frustrated <br /> <br /> Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie, The Fountain, though you will not be able to hear about this movie while talking about the actor), and he is not acting <br /> <br /> The whole picture is damaged by many nonsense characters which have added nothing to the plot (like blob or gambit), which gives viewers the belief that it was the original comics of filmmakers<br /> <br /> I'm a fan of Xmas, I've read a lot of stories, many of their stories and this film did not respect them. None. Not even the continuation. It does not respect the Happen X project, or there is no relation to the relationship between Volvoirin and Siberoth, or Emma Frost, Volvoirin's motivations are stupid and in millions of movies: Revenge of a loved one's death. <br /> <br /> Oh. When the striker's man came to school, he had a barrage of barchers for the same type of Volvoin with him at the school's school. He reduced the enemy forces alone, but hey, it's Fox, it's a family flick and you will not see clear violence from the most violent and horrible marvel heroes. Also, I was feeling constant with this movie because Volvoiren's sources are already explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so that it can not create a movie which is We already know. <br /> <br /> I personally believe that WALAWARINE is one of the few characters that do not need a solid back-story because the mystery character is nature. We really want to know how the Joker got his stain?
