Crispow 2 is George Romero (rising), the unfortunate series of Cristo. Romario Films in any series of Romeo films that have got some big shoes throughout, mostly because of Romero fans who think that he is God. I was not funny enough for the first photo and was funny, I did not care too much for the seagull. There was so much of a film series, but it was short-lived because both films were less than stars. The biggest problem is that in Crispow 2 it was only three stories (apart from the middle of the story), and the first story was spread beyond belief, it only gave up about half the movie opportunity * Really * To be good I saw CS2 in movies and the first segment was really sticky. Some dramatic things with George 'I can not act' Kennedy automatically gets destroyed and the Indian statue story was very hockey and not only was this signature. So after the really intense and relentless start, there were only two other stories left to reverse Fissko's disconnected start, and unfortunately, two other stories were not big enough to forget my first story. Rफ्ट and hitchers are moderately successful, moderately because they have their moments in two parts, but they are still flat. The two last stories are basically expanded for very long. It is not that I wanted to speed up the stories quickly and in the end, but both of the good ideas found in those stories were slowly and steadily slowly, gradually, when they were able to make them more powerful Need was more uncertain and with the punchier end. Also, if the two last story movie is not expanded to pad or three sections are better with better editing and direction, then they can add a fourth story to the group. There are only three padded segments created for a boring festival. <br /> <br /> The acting and writing of both sections of Rafting and Hitachiakara are better than horror. I like the last segment Lois Chiles. This is probably his best moments in the screen from Munacar's bond girl Holly Goodhead and his role in Neil's death. But its role is also difficult to understand due to timely direction and unimaginable story. Are we supposed to hate him or sympathize with him? We are supposed to sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker? If Hitahai's body was found by other people on the road, did he attack Chiles? Was he a scourge or a zombie or what? How did the presence of other people rescuing dead bodies to attack Chilsey? The whole thing is not very clear for the supernatural story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The characters themselves played more interesting. Some of the actors believe in their particular role. Paul Satterfeld shows intelligent than his intelligent joke and his girlfriend is not very convinced of acting actress as a malicious slut. She seems very awesome. At the same time, the same can be said with "plain" thirteen players. Slick idea of ​​slaughtered oil is interesting and vague but does not execution well. The story should have been a fifth character, probably homeless people or Ranger who hid around the lake and knew about oil spikes and could be arrogant instead of a water-monster. As odd as the oil slick, it is not made for a compulsory "character". And the last way in the story, everything seems vain. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
