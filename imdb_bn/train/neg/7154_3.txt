This picture contains lots of cooking dishes for stew. Based on the autobiography of Shealah Graham, it seems like the powers that can not be enough alone. They could not determine whether Graham's story or the story of Fatjagard could be compared, and the story that they had made should be compared to the soft-pedal. So, a movie which has two fascinating (Fitzgerald) and notorious (Miss Graham) personality stories, has become an overwhelming soap opera about what some of us say about it. It has been added since 1959 that there is no other time period. The strange scene follows the strange scene and we have no idea where we are talking or how much time we spent. Anyway - and it has saved the movie for me - Care never seen a boyfriend, and Peck is always very nice people They really create a beautiful, mature couple, and I wish there were only good components for working with them. A scene that works - Scott goes after the fox during drunken state, and these two refreshed stars are very annoying to watch each other and they get a quick idea about what's happening like their relationship. Nonetheless, the film has reached a truncated scope and near the classic joke of the other rock production of 1950 (Pity Place, the best of all).
