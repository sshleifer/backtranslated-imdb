I was terribly terrible in this movie. I was Chinese, so I was completely wrong in everything. Many information was wrong. The only thing about Chinese history in the film was when Wendy's mother explained her husband about Shi'ongdi's protected statue. I thought the war scenes were very impressive and fake. Many actresses and actresses were not very great. Fantastic "funny" some joke was really stupid. I think this movie will get the worst possible rating which it can get. Disney really wants to make a Chinese movie, if she wants to create an extraordinary movie. Mulan was quite right. If you want to waste some time see this movie.
