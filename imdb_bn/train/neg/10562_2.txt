This very low budget comedy Caper movie is only successful in having less budget. The dialogue is stupid fools, chase scenes are annoying at once, and in the last five minutes of the film, the crash of the parking lot and the series of explosions seems to have been preserved for the screen (briefly port-a-rattie breaks the ruins of the film's main villain in the early part of the scene and Be sure to scream - there is no propose here without any purpose). The whole movie frustrates reminiscent of those who came out of Roger Simon's studio when he gave some money and a camera to the first director - but do not do it without discipline.
