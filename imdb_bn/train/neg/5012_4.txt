Amber Benson Rock and Nick Stahl are usually pretty, I've seen this movie - I think the two actors of a movie that I like and respect can not be the worst of all. And in that sense, I was right - considering the crunching conversation they both performed properly. Not good enough to stop the movie, you understand, but enough that I was able to make it through a movie of 75 minutes (and it is the main sign of a horror movie: when, in 40 minutes you're already praying for it to end ). <br /> <br /> "Still" difficult to know where the problems will start. Conversations, mentioned, are scary; Wooden and completely irrelevant. Jan Jones's acting is incredibly bad, and since he spent most of our time sitting in the house from the character, so this is a flawed error. This plot is so firmly guided that it does not give any idea and at the same time it is so cleared as it is absolutely expected (literally, one of the main 'twists' of this movie will not surprise anyone other than a child). On one hand, some of the interesting shots, the director tries much harder with less success, the strange tracking shots and shocking camera-work are confusing from the small elements of the story. <br /> <br /> The three stars of this movie are thought to have Amber Benson, and at the end, a joke in this joke gives me a little scandal. I will not recommend this movie, sometimes, in any case. To avoid all costs.
