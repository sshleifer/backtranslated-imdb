The problem is specially added when your character has tons, all of whom die. Okay, so if you are not bothered to make characters memorable or sympathetic, why do you die at least why they are shy? No Here we have a battle between two Nija clans, not even knowing why they are fighting each other with each other. The emperor said so because they killed each other. Nevertheless, it is very well seen that the Emperor wants all of them dead, they still refuse to abandon their meaningless mission. It does not happen suddenly ... it's just a little stupid <br /> <br /> All right, all right! There is no character development, and the plot gives no reasonable argument for the war. At least they die, fighting the cool action scene? Yet again, no! Indeed, in many battles, even the fierce fight does not happen: the super ninja movie that has started to die suddenly and effort (and according to my opinion). As I'm saying, "I'm walking around, and I end up gradually slowly and slowly, slowly and slowly, in my neck, through the film, even half of it, I threw his hand in curiosity. .
