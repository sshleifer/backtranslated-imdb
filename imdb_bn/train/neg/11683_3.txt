Three lines of story and not enough to draw them together, "Inside Man" was very shocking and incomplete effort to be artistic and realistic. Despite its moments, the film began to look like a fast thriller that swiftly swiftly, jumped into the speed and height and only steam around the last 20 minutes. I will give credit to Denzel Washington, he played his part very well with his fuller understanding of the north, and with all the answers not only "super-detective". Clive Owie also did his dual piece as "bad talent" and "criminal mastermind" (not the same in both reversal). Overall though, each person individually created a great sub-section. Yet, when the part was finally assembled and everything was counted, suddenly "Ah-ha!" Was not there. Or summarize everything. It has very little amount of energy, plot-hole, starting from its beginning, many questions, and as I said earlier, there is no place near Spike Lee's normal level. I would totally disagree with the so-called "professional critics" ... they are not like this movie.
