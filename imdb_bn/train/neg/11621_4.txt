I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian-based. The director had a good idea / purpose while creating this film, but it could have been better. I understand that some of the others think that the greatest love of their life. However, I did not understand why the director made his friend so sensitive, average and rude. He had his meaning when the main character apologized to his friends. They did not understand at all and they used God to explain their behavior. The ex-girlfriend is divorced, the main character still married, nor did anyone know, but they were against solving the old feeling that they needed to deal with. His friends should have been supposed to be Christians and should be portrayed as supporting whether they agree with his decision. Many times we do something in our life that we do not apologize for the past losses, and when he is trying to do this, all of them were against him. The ironic section accused her new female friend, she was accused only of being attractive to look at an old friend when she did something really remarkable to catch up with her name, address and phone number ... She seemed to be the sticker. She did not feel like a friend at all but was only looking for herself. God is love ... and I think God wants people to be with him and I think the movie has done a bad injustice that seems like God does not think about true love ... Stay with someone who has a bad taste with you. We all make mistakes ... This is about what steps you take to correct it. I said the movie was potential but I was tired of the one-sided perspective, constantly repeating and its so-called ... pushing the audience to the throat by the well-established friends. The love of this movie does not hold true to the Christian faith but I give it a c for her efforts.
