San, you know that you are the world's greatest actor, but I can not praise you for that. Comedy is not just your strong case. <br /> <br /> However, it was not all your fault. Some things were very hard to understand. Alfred Lynch did a good job, but you would wonder how the lines came from from the beginning. <br /> <br /> Again, Shan ... I apologize.
