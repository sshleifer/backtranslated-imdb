Let's see where we start ... bad acting; I'm not sure if I even call it, it will read more with a try-line script. The actors do not even seem to be part of them and feel quite lazy and lazy. Certainly there was a scene or two with nudity, but it could not save the film from its lifeless character. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/ The song did not have any rhythm or flow and stupid rants looked more along the line. <br /> <br /> budget? Does this movie even have a budget? It seemed that they used less money when watching the Home-Shot YouTube video. Bad light, props, poor sound post production. Bad special effects, if you want to call them so far. The story could have been good if the story was really interested in creating this, but there was no life in this flash; I do not care who manages it <br /> <br /> I saw some really bad flicks last year and this one is very perfect at the very bottom. Do not waste your time or you will be willing to hear this neutral review. Check the rating, you will see that 1 of the very few of them are moving fast with Fluffy 10. I'd like to look a little closer before losing my time. What a suck-festival!
