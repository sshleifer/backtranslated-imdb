This one is one of the worst men ever takes on the conceived. How can such a mesmerizing issue turn into a completely uninspiring story? It's not so hard to do properly ... Overall, a vampirefilm is not a vampirefilm, it's a dark and dull environment with a beautiful sexy touch. There is a lack of these things in it .. much more light - the spots! Hello my God, why was this in the name of Christ / Judas? <br /> <br /> Every time Dracula came in, she swallowed up with the light (to keep her weak in the script, only for the record: only the weak) near the end of the movie (with her amazing winner and her new victory with Dracula) Only one scene is seen. I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-Twist was originally originally called, but it is not only good but not in any way. Hopefully the third will be Kerry on the favorite Vampire-signature of Herod's Nasefertu, like Coppola's Dracula or even in other classics such as interviews with the vampire.
