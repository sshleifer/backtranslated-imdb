It seemed as if I had seen this movie thousands of times before. It was completely predictable. Each time the story tried to get a little distraught, I was just waiting for some interesting, every time I did not see anything than I expected. Like "Bread factory opened another facility, because there was not enough bread". In two words: flat story, it has become a clich√©, bad acting, bad influence ... only fools, Russian police, wald, were somewhat funny when bad people were punished. The muscles of the muscles were so incredibly stupid, that smiled to him for a moment. I was surprised that I had wasted my time for that shame ... it would not be worse (because it is not possible): D
