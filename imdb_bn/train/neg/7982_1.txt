It is difficult to know whether Nontan and Marshall Abbott and Castello, Martin and Lewis, Curley and Larry, or any other comedy team trying to sneer, but whoever tried to imitate it failed with failure. This incredibly stupid movie has only one poor smile. Noonan (who wrote "script" conversation) and Marshall has no chemistry; Martial dean seems to be trying to cool the care of the devil's daughter-in-law, but she did not even come close to the remote. God knows what nunan is thinking, but it was not funny. He thinks that his arms and legs are very fuzzy and everybody looks at the stupid comedy's height in the screen. Probably for him, but not for the audience. I think when I see it in the theater it seems The three year old Jeff Chadler was Western ("Skill Pillars" which was quite good) and was under the Double Bills with three Stoggies Short ("Shappy Bulfighter" which was not) and this stuff is stuffed on the screen for all children in about 20 minutes. ; It was so strange that it did not measure up to the worst of three studs shorts. I finally stayed around (not what I wanted to do, but my men could not pick me up until the end of the movie), and till the end of this time I was the only one in the theater. I saw it on a wire about one or a night more than 15 or more years ago, and wandered around to see if it was bad to remember. It was bad. It was the only thing for Julie Numar that was hot like smoking. Other than that, there is nothing to suggest this thing absolutely. Among them, Japanese soldiers also play, and what they compare compares to the thick-skinned, stupid, gibbering mental defects, like the infamous players of the Japanese characters of Jerry Lewis. Marshall went to host "Hollywood Square", and Nayan was trying his hand to create films, but most of them were so bad. Although quite a bit, I do not think there might be such a bad thing. The film is a really unfortunate waste. Do not waste your time on it.
