This kind of "inspirational" saccharine is enough to make you sick. It telegraphs her feelings like the world's largest safe-sector. It feels liked by the audience for its own interpretation and feeling. Big finishes will work like a jumping wire on a dead car, which is swimming orchestrated orchestration; I think if you feel stupid to see such a movie then you think you need such thinking. Streep glows and if you wonder whether you really have a deep feeling on the display or if it's a --- show, turn on and off like a light. Because of my life, I can not see how he might find life in such an ugly life. Although it's based on the real story and I'm sure it's an inspirational one, set-up, execution and performance can play like third-rate TV movie or half-school high school drama.
