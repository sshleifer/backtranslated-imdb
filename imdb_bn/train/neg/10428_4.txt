Did anyone else feel betrayed? The first hour or so was quite difficult but ended. O god It looks like guessable and delicious. The show's full run has not been grandiose and epic like. Most reviews have been sparked but I do not really understand why. I had already predicted the general way to end, but then it was withdrawn because I thought, "No, they will not do it, it is very hair to return." I can stand it I feel so dissatisfied. I think I'm going to walk out of the door to sell my own season. Someone please Change the mind. I want to love this. very bad. Someone tells me why I'm wrong. Great show Terrible end
