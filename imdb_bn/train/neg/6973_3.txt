I never knew this movie until I found an old VHS copy of it, deep in my dusty terracotta closet deep. The box's title is called "Worm" and the following illustrations have made it clear that it only made an irrelevant and bad 80 horror films. They must be intelligent, of course, expect an intelligent scenario and unless you are excited to see the huge amount of fat make-up effects. The "blue monkeys" here are low in every important aspect that creates a horror movie that can be seen here! The plot is ridiculous and extremely irrational, performing performances is painful and lacks suspicion. Following the popular trend of "big-bug" movies, "blue monkeys" manage a new and unknown insect species that detect doctors and patients in a remote hospital. The creator can not be more surprised about the actual origin of this larger, larger crater! We know that it is not from outer space and it originally came out of a tropical plant. Apart from this, there is absolutely no explanation for this new kind of insect that comes suddenly! As I said, you do not get the hope for your intelligent playplay. The first half of the film is beautiful enough, with some nice Gore and a couple's decorated characters (80 years old blind and alcoholic lady!), Enough to be entertained with the introduction, but the second half (when the whole hospital is quantineed) is terribly annoying. This "blue monkey" started to exaggerate the old (and better) movies exaggerated. In the final measure, they apparently ran outside the budget, because the light became very poor and the giant suit did not spread any longer. If you are really annoyed, "Blue MacKay" is a shiny pricing or if you really want to watch the horror movie of 80's. Supporters of B-movie John Vernon ("Outrunners Killer Clowns", "Cartes") can accept Roger's small and meaningless role, who is in charge of the clinic.
