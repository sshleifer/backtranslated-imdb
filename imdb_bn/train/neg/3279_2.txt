Oh geez ... there are so many movies that I want to see ... at the weekend I got stuck with my nephew and this is what he wants - yes ... <br /> <br /> I used to have used this program when I was in college See ... it was stupid, funny, and somewhat action-oriented. The show was in good heart ... and the letters were clever; No one ever died or even hurt badly ... It was like a cartoon life. Cut in 2005 ... what happened? This does not work. As others have said, there is not just a consolidated story and the performance is weird ... almost nervous - of course not faithful to the main characters ... The whole thing is like Mad TV skit and it lasts for 100 minutes! Several times I was one of the MMRRSSD while watching this picture. What did they think? As far as I can tell, there must be a necessity for product marketing, toys, etc. I can say, it quickly dies. It looks like the original Ducus Masterpiece Theater of Hazar ... <br /> <br /> I think leaving the remake from the TV is only the Galilean Island ... Good luck!
