This is the worst sign to face the film. Again it is not made. The killer still kills for fun. But this time he killed people who made a movie about what happened in the first movie. This means that it's never stupid movie. <br /> <br /> Do not look at this. If you value a valuable hour during this movie, you will not see it. Do what you want to ask the director and the person next to you. Because it does not combine the horrors, actions, and actual creatures of the crime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
