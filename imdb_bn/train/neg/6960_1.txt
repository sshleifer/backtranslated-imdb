After seeing Blanche's first 20mn (sorry I could not take it more), I'm sure he is sure now. <br /> <br /> In essence, this "movie" is an insult to the real French actors, who are participating in this harmful junk. It starts with a concept that was successfully used in French comedies ("Duques Hures MÃ©ien Lee Quart Abort Jesus Christ", "La Folie des Grandiers", ...): An Historical Movie with Anaconic Tone / Dialogue. Supported by this outstanding actor and awesome "heavy comedy" scandal, the "character" can give brilliant results. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Horsey encounters Lou Dillon instead of destroying everything and Blanche. Comedy, activated only in a horror movie. Cineffill's terrible frustration is due to the obscure actors such as Deacon, James or Rochford, struggling in the middle of this doll burlesque kitchy-prissy farce.
