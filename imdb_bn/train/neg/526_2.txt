Often it's tiring to read, and a nicely produced failure in the evening ... until Merrill's stripe walks and quietly shows how his other cast members do such things. Vanessa Redgrave was surprised to be surprised by her role, Anne and Claire Dennis are a cipher. Perhaps in the role of Vanessa and Claire, we were able to see the young Anne tremble, which entered the rare world of the story, and we could imagine that the old anna was actually being dying. <br /> <br /> I hope Michael Cunningham's connection to writing credits will make the story of a frustrating story easier. It gave me a headache.
