The first of the series is bright, easily one of the best horror films of all time. This is the crappiest. When I was sitting to see this, I actually thought that the fourth and fifth was bad, it would be better after the previous fearsome. Boy i was wrong Incredibly incorrect <br /> <br /> When I saw this for the first ten minutes, I was really tempted to stop it, but I did not think it would probably be better. It was not. <br /> <br /> This is not just a terrible movie, it did not need another sign, because the last two (fourth and fifth) were already terrible enough! Also, how many times you can bring Franndy back! It was terribly terrible, the story line was predictable and shit and it had errors as well. The way they made the Springwood was just completely wrong. The first one gives no respect. To add this, the whole thing really got up. <br /> <br /> Some people say this picture is "funny". This film is not all "funny". When is Freddy Kr√ºger being "funny" supposed? I would call it funnily shit This image is not a joke, it is supposed to be a horror film. If Freddy had a daughter, that information would not have surfaced like the first one!? The end was also just simple stupid and Chinese like the rest of the right. This one completely destroys the first essence and uniqueness. Just looks at yourself <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were not even annoyed to make this film. No third sequence, third one. The only one civilization in the third sequence. <br /> <br /> If it was a DVD itself and Elham Street did not have nightmares in the DVD, then I got it when I had it shiny. <br /> <br />: A kind and poor effort in a continuation. <br /> <br /> - The complete film of the first movie <br /> <br /> Please, do not waste your time on this junk junk.
