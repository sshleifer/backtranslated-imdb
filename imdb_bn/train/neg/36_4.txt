The film was very long for more than 75 minutes. The problems of the wild films of the jungle are to walk on the walk while walking on the walk. The film is a sunny and bloody eyes, which are always accompanied by sound breathing and heavy sound and large amounts of soundtracks for watching the nude native zombies. Eurotrash fans will be entertained by the worst English dubbing, unrealistic female meat and very stupendous makeup work on the giant and local extravagant. This was quite light on Gore for a zombie / cannibal flick but then perhaps I did not see an uncut version.
