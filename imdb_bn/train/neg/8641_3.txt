Grand Central Murderer (1942) DR: S.Synon Simon <br /> <br /> This middle class 'B' mystery is one of five films released by Simon in 1942. . Of course he could fit two of his Red Sculpton film or his schedule! However, the pride of the Central Central Murdere Thin Man films, the shameful rip-off of subdued chemistry and Lead chemistry. We're treating a paper with a thin conspiracy that can support 73 minutes, bad acting and tiring gags. <br /> <br /> Van Halin and Virginia Gray game Nick and Nora Charter, Rocky and The Butcher cast. She is a PI and she sleuthing her wife and colleague. They are involved in "ridiculous" ridicule with each other. See? It's already completely different. Haflin is the only one here who points out great and good things, though he has come close to such a quarrel. Virginia Gray was another slim person, but again, please put me in, this film is not any one, sir. And if we start thinking that this film is absolutely nothing like any other film (say, Thin Man) we really like, Sam Leven Lead has popped up as Detective and he has directed Van Halflin carefully to him. All important leadership. Hmmm <br /> <br /> Fast, 'murder' is a miscarriage designer, Mida King, who does not like to do business with rich people until she is more prosperous. He played Patricia Dan, who is like a C-version of Hadie Lammer, until he opens his mouth and turns into F. There are a whole array of vaccine suspects with their own motivation for McAid's death. There are types of society, solid conversations, lips, ex-boyfriends, and a galaxy's theater Impressori (Tom Conway, associated with 'Frankie Sero's unreliable character'). Roman Boehnen played a nervous, ridiculous type, I believe he already did. Milled Mitchell plays a stupid police, who can not resign in an ongoing stain, he can not think about the piece of the ass that once the case is wrapped (which is Milled Mitchell, Swordman). Finally, in the complete breakdown of the story, which we have never seen before, all the suspects have gathered in one place where they tell their story (as a flashback) detective, as Rocky takes mental notes, finally the guilty is forced to play dramatically for confessional obedience. <br /> <br /> On the mood of the real picture, I certainly thought that some of the Grand Slam positions in the 1942 decade may be central, but not lazy. There's just one very short shot at the beginning. Thanks for doing nothing, Grand Central Murder So, sum, a bit bit formulas, but hefelin was just fine. <br /> <br /> * 4 out of
