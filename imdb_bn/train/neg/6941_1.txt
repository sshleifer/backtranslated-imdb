This movie is not only annoying, it is really done badly. The graphics are very bad, they are not even the second rate - they are awesome. Characters do not show any facial expression, voice acting is empty and without any soul, and there is a complete lack of plot ... good ... everything and everything. My 5 year old likes it - but it seems a bit annoying. I agree with her.
