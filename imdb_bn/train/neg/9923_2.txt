I write this review in 2008, we are thrown into a remake culture. The film studios seem determined to destroy many classic movies that may contain completely unmatched updates, including 'King Kong', 'The Wicked Man', and indeed every movie that Michael Keen has played. This lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon, but 'Dow for the Do' proves. The complete colorless version of 'Masterpiece', 'Purky in Wakayland', 'Duff for Do-Do', protected by Bob Clampettes, destroys life through splashing colors of all colors throughout the original footage of Clamps and adds some new footage under the supervision of freeze frames. Frankenberg was totally unnecessary inappropriate with the source material of Clampett's material, although he did not really expect a director to come closer to Clamps' inspired insane. Of course, 'Dough for the do-do' is nothing more than a great new-title classic rape. For cartoon fans like me, it's equivalent to coloring 'Casablanca'.
