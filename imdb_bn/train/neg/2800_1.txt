One of my best friends one night wanted to watch this movie 'Warner to see the worst movie?' I always enjoy a good smile at a bad horror flick and say yes. I was expecting your usually cheesy b slasher but this was beyond b. This is the Z-slasher, the lowest minimum. Clearly low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, a plot, really bad so-called 'special effects', cone cameras and a terrific soundtrack, it looks like the Oscars-winning skills like the House of Makes. The only good thing about it is that the character of about 15 seconds is becoming helpless - it had some beautiful tits. Most of what I said during this movie was 'Wow, this is actually SO Bad', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not drunk enough for this.' So conclusion: Do not waste your time (or money!).
