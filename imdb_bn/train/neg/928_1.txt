This movie is so awful, it's hard to find the right words to describe! <br /> <br /> The story is so ridiculous at first. A narrow man could write a good plot! The actors are annoying and uninterrupted, perhaps they are forced to play on this Chess film. <br /> <br /> National Forest Cameras reception of this national film is only good. I feel hopeless, because I paid for this sunny picture. <br /> <br /> Hope no one will make a signal or create similar movies with such a bad story :-)
