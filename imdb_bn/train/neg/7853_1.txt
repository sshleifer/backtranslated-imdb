No plot, vague acting, and pointless glory ... <br /> <br /> Is it supposed to be a horror movie? There is no fear, or mystery, just boom Bang Gore, then done. Some of the mounds are in the desert for some weird, ugly, and they should be hunted out of the first film, which has been hunted by modified animals, which was good, and let it be released. <br /> <br /> This is just another excuse for money, and the use of uninterrupted violence, just as the "saw" series. They know how stupid they are, and they can add more, people will see it. I miss good suspenseful horror movies. Come to Hollywood, you can do a lot, much better.
