This one is like 6th movie. The movie is really bad. It does not give anything in the death section. Something that does not have to be a liners bad and a NOES movie. Freddy comes close as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still one thing that makes this one worth. The letters are highly adopted. One of the best 6th, but still the worst movie in the series. My rating is 2/10
