At least it is not full of timeless violence or fluff. It's not too worrying or a smooth storyline. Some of these stories were feasible but the director seems to have lost the green sites. The story turns odd and weird <br /> <br /> Instruction, no conclusion. I do not believe the director spent a lot of time near a golf country club. Drawing is something weird. Not very compelling.
