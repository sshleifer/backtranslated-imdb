I do not know this is one of SyFy Channel's original movies, but it's exactly what's exactly like. A cheap, low-budget action movie, which was probably created very quickly, has a humorous effect, a lam's dialogue and a vaguely pale star; it can recognize some names in the brand (funny that most 90210 kids are now doing cheap TV movies). <br /> <br /> Ian starring Jaring Cortes, who from history we have learned that in some parts of North America, the entire population of the local population has been eliminated. Here, he is not acting as a hero or even sympathetic, but as a slimy opportunist; If this character is not dependent on the historical figure, it would probably have died. In this story, the Cortes are in a short survey mission trying to find something worth to prove the merits of funding for America's quest. He and his men found a small tribe of harmful by Diageos. <br /> <br /> The real hero of the story is Le. Prove to be Rhoos, who is respected, wealthy and wise. He knows the right thing in every circumstance, which he opposes with Cortés, as well as youth, ambitious Aztek Shaman. Of course, the native girl, supposed to marry the boxer, Shameem falls for Skying Raises, Spanish raises his anger outside. So it's all beautiful cliché. Dinosaurs are transmitted with relative comfort. Despite the movements that seem to be open, the story mostly took place in wood or in the village of Aggete, 95% of the time, so it is not surprisingly interesting. <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not recognize Ian Jiering too. They give him a funny wig and an incredible pronunciation, and the way he disappears in it. He does not see or spell the Spanish word on the other side, but it always makes mistakes casting. If this film was released in the theater, then he would have been gathered for Razzi, there is no question. <br /> <br /> Overall, forget.
