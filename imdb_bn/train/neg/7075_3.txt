It is at least the third rebuild of this movie, so while watching it, there is a sense of design, and do not be surprised. What they did was change the story setting and tell it differently, but the differences are not important. And it's not good because the plot is faulty at the beginning. It does not work. And like its predecessors, the role of moderate. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When this movie lasted 10 minutes ago, it worked and was very pleased and I felt more appropriate. But criminals are not caught because the explosives here and ultimately crime is offense. I do not like this message as a result from a movie.
