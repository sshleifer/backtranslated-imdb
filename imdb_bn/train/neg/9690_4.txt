Jean Sargberg's acting talent was not an iota. Like all his movies, 'Bonjour Tristes' is not completely affected by his appearance (though he is probably the first of the modern women who described Gam Oh as the "boy with breast": the publisher, of course, the word "gamine"), but Seberg's inferior , Monstrous, horrific of voice killings. When all his films are playing angry, the whole of hearing, confusing, in Sarge screams pants through its uninterruptedly flattering words. Array <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> There is no scope for black and white employment for today's scene, through which the monotonous look of service will give us the past and the background. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a brief moment on Clever Grayo, black and white spotlight, the words distributed in the comet Dietrichesque, the lyrics of the lyrical existential singing tone. At this moment right now, the retreat is more than an acute bit drôle. Of course, if you are French - especially if you are interested in the glorious day of the Barricades around French "68-E" - and your children riot and rioting to keep life safe for France's ruthless living. Economy: You still believe in Sarreter and Foucault and all such unknown, irrelevant theorists. <br /> <br /> David Kniven has the most difficult role, Hip, Cold, Swin, about Sagan's teenage children! Papa Deborah K. firmly plays that firmly in Savest's youthful bachelor's degree, through his usual, conscientious professional presence (the fierce fantasy of Segan fills the classical theme of "The only queen bee everywhere"); Actually, this picture is the only wonderful and memorable screen on Care. <br /> <br /> Conversation is unusual - I agree with previous critics, who said that it seems "bad translation" from French; Combine irrelevant scripting with Seberg's incompatible, unreasonable montoons and you can save Valium on another night. Unexpectedly post-production voice dubbing is almost all, more than obvious and almost boring: This is especially true for Dubbing for the Mliné Dementiot, because it otherwise spoils the fancy blonde blonde performance very pleasant. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ hunky> (Horn, we say, only enough was enough in the 'River River Bridge'), perhaps its last film was held instead of being unsuccessful by William Holden and Jack Hawkins, unfortunate Segba). <Br /> <br /> The final 'Forestry Trieste' looks pretty good but it is shallow, essential soap: suds with thin gruel.
