According to the budget and time limitations of cereals production, Butman and Robin, there was a place under the "Clifaners" list, which was in the style, imagination, and complete lack of atmosphere of predecessor Buttman of 1943. <br /> <br />> Producer, Sam Katzman, known as "King of Quickies" and like his director, Spencer Bennet, looked more concerned with speed and skill than the excitement of excitement. (Unfortunately, this team created two Superman Serials, which starred Kirk Allin, with their strong flying animations, canned music, and low support players.) Each chapter offers a taste for the opening issues: a perfectly inactive title ("Robin Batman Released, "Batman vs. Wizard"), mechanical music droning, and our two hero cameras Looked around, struggled or confused by seeing their cheap Halloween masks, Batman's beef with the back of the horn of the devil and the eagle fits it so that Stantman needs to adjust it during the war, whose "utility belt" is a broken strip of cloth, There is no part from which he still has a botchorrh and an oxygen tube tension in complex moments <br /> <br /> In any case, the main players are wrong, Robert Loye displays a small charm or personal flick like Bruce Wayne and does not particularly focus on moving figures as a Batman, he has impressed that he Want to be somewhere, elsewhere! John Duncan as Robin has enough difficulty in managing his limited conversations. She is too old for the part, with an even old stuntman filling for her. In addition to an Ion of Chemistry between Louis Wilson and Douglas Croft in Syria in 1943, Laurie and Duncan have become excited as tired businessmen. <br /> <br /> While the serials were not known, for the development of the character, the previous Batman was able to present a more energetic cast. This one offers the group going through a motion, the filmmakers do not provide much support. None of the hoodlums are standing, and they are managed by the most annoying villains of all time, "Wizards." (Great name!) In fact, someone is taking someone's curtain, shawl, and a knit on his head, and someone is taking a sound that is trying to hear a deadly sound. "Major Suspects" - A brilliant professor, a radio broadcaster - just boring. <br /> <br /> Even the established comic book "Regular" lazy. Many romance in Vicky Vale and Bruce Wayne is difficult to understand. Despite the dangers facing it, the wiki shows virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is not very bright. In contrast to the previous serial, Alfred Butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is "Residence of Mr. Wayne." They are a drawn-out, props for hostage-laden, incoherent plot, more uninspired, saddled with repetitive music and amateur production designs. Wayne Manor is like a middle-class outskirts of a city outside the outskirts of Citikom, inside the inside of a cheap street side motto. Batcave desperately needs an office in refurbishing (The dresses are rolled in a filing cabinet!) <br /> <br /> The creators of the film can not do much more for adventure. Availability of two serials in DVD plus a serious "button", but should not be fooled by nice boxed images. Compared to all the 15 chapters of Bitman and Robin, the comic book has more real mood. <br /> <br /> Now for good news - this is not the 1997 edition!
