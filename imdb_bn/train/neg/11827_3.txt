Just came back from a free screening and I'm very happy that I did not pay to see this very sub-parameter movie. The theater was full and the crowd was a mixture of children and adults. It seemed as though there were only those children who were smiling at the frustration-stick and thrilled curiosity (the good deities they liked to kill this poor mouse in this cow's meat!). The film is very young, intelligent, anticipated, and mostly annoying. The letters seem to be thrown together to fill the empty space, and the relationship between them seems very compulsive to any charm. Apparently, the film is actually roughly average with average averages. They did a wonderful job of imitating the face of Wallace and the Groomeite, but even more forgotten imagery. <br /> <br /> Although I was really annoyed throughout the film, I did chocolate several times. It's not a complete failure, but I do not want to see it again. If you are a parent with children (and your children do not see uninterrupted cheer-humor), they are free to watch it but others do not waste their money.
