This TV is only on TV and I have to admit, even I am surprised. It's better to see an old episode of Street that has many ghufs, mess, and bad editing. Acting was okay, but please, you really can feel the "straightforward video" feeling. Cast / crew made this movie a bad melodrama. Yes, there is a message in the film, but wait ten minutes before it's over. Trust me, you will not even tell the difference.
