I first saw a live musical at Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and it was a full-blown, stunning, and fantastic line of plot and conversation that I saw most of the music that I saw on stage. The interesting thing is that you will not see the face of the jac. He was always in the dark but his presence was strong and the whole production direction. I have heard that they are making a movie from it, I have waited for a while to sleep, but when I saw the movie version I was very disappointed that I felt that I was cheated. The film is lacking in the fascinating mood of live product and does not allow you to fully communicate with each character. Personally, I want to see the live version again, and if it should be revived again, I would sincerely recommend that you get out of your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy.
