I'm a big fan of Fred McMurver and Carol Lumber. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this movie, so why did not I enjoy it specially? Well, despite a good cast, it's one of the poorest most written and most clich√©d "one picture" I've ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to create this image, how suddenly the text was slipped-shot. I knew the film would be tedious when I predicted the beginning of the film in the beginning, what exactly would be next - and I was always right! And this is not because I had some sort of "Movie Savant", but it was because almost no imagination or effort has entered into it. Actually, it takes almost as if the film spreads only with a long string steel! Also, I felt that Fred Carroll was making so much of the film, and still, the convention is true, he ran to the end. Uggh! There is more suspicion in the film of lassie ("Does he rescue man from the team or he will give a hanging rope?") <br /> <br /> Despite very tired and cleared script, there were some positive reviews about the film. At the end of Fred, Fred was so beautiful to see broken - it was quite credible and he felt that he had not been eaten, shaved or asleep for a while. Also, Charles Butterworth's "bug" gave some silent comedies. But all these films were not enough to look different than a "B movie". It's embarrassing, it could be a lot better.
