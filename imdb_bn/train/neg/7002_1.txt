I have seen this movie and the other one. Trinity is my name and I think it's one bad first then one. I have no idea why they even made another film, it was stupid and stupid to say that I am with all of them. I'm sitting around them repeatedly and it closes me in the movie for 5 minutes. I like the Terrence Hill movie, and I like Bud Spencer, but this movie pushed me towards the wall. If it was a different story line or at least a plot and more comedy, then I spent all the movies buying 5 dollars funn and could be valuable. But you make a mistake so I'll tell you to save your money and do not exclude this movie or anyone who goes with it believe me.
