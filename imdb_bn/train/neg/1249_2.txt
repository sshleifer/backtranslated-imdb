Key frustration, especially in the light of budget, provides technical resources, and combine talent The basic rules for audience imagination / drama are not to create suspense willing to disbelieve in the audience. We started a curiosity in POA 2001, we were crushed, but then Mr. Burton has forgotten that his filmmakers are working on the brain. Helena Bonaham Carter's Chip's top liberal, lack of lockup, lack of escape, rush-of-riding skills (this is an astronaut and a group of humanitarian groups are suddenly running a whole cast), the huge and immediate human rebellion is all too incredible. Mark Wahlberg never once turned the real fear, danger, or any project into a project into a project. Compare to the original, among which Chalk Hesson's nudity is figuratively interpreted on his helpless helplessness and surprise during his events. Uniformed Wahlberg preserved his modesty, but his spontaneous view of management and control in his spontaneous conditions and we were never surprised about his goodness. Unlike Haysten, he never falls into the real danger. Team Burton should use some of the f / x budgets for some descriptive screenplay. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wondered why the hallowler producer never interrupted the threatening of the screentime and the director threatened the director. Let them walk. Besides making the train made monkeys, they could also work in the 2001 Planet of Apps. I will be stopping the repetitive views of this endeavor. It was a new franchise, and could be a wonderful new step for imagination. Lost another chance.
