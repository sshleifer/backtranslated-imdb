All right, if you have to spend a few hours, or if you really hate your life, then I would say see this movie. If something is good to laugh You are not only fat, cruel natives, but special effects are so bad they are mostly banned in most states. Seriuosly, 'PG' rating is pretty funny, once you see Native Porn Extravaganza. I can not give this picture to my disabled nephew. You can not even show it to the Iraqi detainees without violating the Geneva Convention. Plot sketches, and clich√©, and fools, and stupid. The acting was extremely awesome, and it was so tragic to look at the end that I started pouring salt in my eyes to take my TV screen back from the statue.
