But this movie was a bore. The history portion was fine but the musical parts were not. <br /> <br /> If the sweet Jesus "funny Jesus" does not seem to be a comic relief, it will not work. If John Adams seems to be a boring annoying one, then the rest <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> was interesting enough in the context but was not enough to overcome the lack of musical music. <br /> <br /> You should not be hamming songs, except some chips, nothing else except some chips.
