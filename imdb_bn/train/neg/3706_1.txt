I think the whole joke of the film will see some rich white people acting like Chris Rock and then watch the reaction of Chris Rock's people. Instead you are just being yourself in Chris Rock and people do not understand him. There are probably 2 scenes in the movie where they use their hostage. This should have been much better.
