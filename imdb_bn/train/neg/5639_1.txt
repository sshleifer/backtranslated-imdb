I saw this movie today at the Israeli Haifa Film Festival after listening to Ravi reviews, but I think the critics were only presenting Willam Diffo and his wife (director) at this festival. This is a slow movie which I have never seen, vaguely and laughingly. Alongside Defoe, along with half the people of the movie, Deafo's wife, Giyada, was ridiculously terrible (how did the seller's salesman spread out to me). This film is disrespectful and has a lot less plots with a crippling effort to stop the wall. The only scene was obscene by causing any kind of reaction to the crowd, and this has never come anywhere to add any type of shock to such inferiority. Sorry for being so strict, but in reality this movie is a valuable waste of time and money. I appreciate the good movie indie, but this movie is not worthy of the moviegracer's time.
