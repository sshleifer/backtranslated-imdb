This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is a movie that shows kids in school on rainy days when you do not go out for a vacation and you'll see something rather, something else. At least this was primarily when I was in elementary school. I just remember this movie hats. Imagine, I have not seen it in 15 years or so and they probably do not use it in rainy days but I just want to warn everyone: it will be better to use it to make your children sleep than to entertain children. Trust me, choose something else. Although the matter is controversial, but this plan is so slow and slow that I can not remember anything, I liked it so much that after 15 years here, I felt the need to warn everyone against you.
