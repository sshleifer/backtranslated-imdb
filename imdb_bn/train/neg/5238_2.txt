I do not understand the positive comments made about this picture. It's cheap and painful at all levels and I do not realize that it has never been made. <br /> <br /> Cartoon characters are a great example - Su's headaches, alcoholics, layabout, and Irish parents are a prime example. No letter is remotely sympathetic - except for short, Asian lover but he has even been able to support domestic violence! As both of them are unusually irrelevant, I have no idea why Rita and / or Mama himself would throw themselves in a shrinking crystal like Bob - but what should I expect about what they will be given to me? So many reviews keep carping about it "realistic". If this is true, it is a sad reflection for society but it is not a reason to keep it in film. <br /> <br /> I do not like this picture.
