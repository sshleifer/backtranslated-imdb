I have never seen bad pictures. <br /> <br /> It is possible to upload a video game and make it in a decent movie. <br /> <br /> False 1: There is no connection at all. You do not have to bond with a character in this movie because ... you will not get a chance. <br /> <br /> The only character that is sympathetic or even interesting is Deck Hand: Arbitrator Clint Howard. Except this unique character, the results of the movie are meaningless, because all the characters were useless from the start. <br /> <br /> Mistake 2: The worst gun footage. I love gunfights. When I love to read the annotations and clean house. Hack I sometimes want to see a badguy clean house. But this gunfight was strange because I think the best way to describe it is "worthless" I have seen people playing with more feelings and emotions to play video games. In this movie, it looked like "actor" and felt that they were walking through shooting only without any emotion. <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? Where is the trash talking? Where is the anger in the gunfight? These should be a kid that is caught in a rage of bad ... but even the actual soldiers are acting professionally and brutally displaying their humanity. <br /> <br /> Monsters, if you want a good horror movie about an isolated house, I reconsider Sam Ramm's Evil Dead series. The house of the dead will not see the disaster. I hope they burn the masters and all copies of this photo.
