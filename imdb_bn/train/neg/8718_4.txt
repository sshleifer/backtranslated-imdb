The third of the "Carnosaur" triangle tries to kill two copper-quality military commandos with two Velociraptors and T-Rex. I give it a 4 deep sympathy and my feelings for dinosaurs. The film is the worst of the quarter, it can not really be taken seriously. More significantly, I can not help seeing this film but can notice some interesting parallels between "Carnosaur" and "Extro" triangles. The first frost of both franchises is a dark, annoying film that has become a classical classic, the second is an "Allen" Reepoff and the third is a tongue-in-cheek, almost shedding (deliberately or not) movies, you are rolling on the laugh floor. Also, like the "Extro" franchisee, not all "Carnasaur" films are completely related to each other. They assume that they carry the name of the franchisee only to maintain interest in "seagulls". Obviously, "Carnosaur" and "Extro" are two different groups here, but if you've seen three franchises in both franchises, then you have mentioned yourself among the two.
