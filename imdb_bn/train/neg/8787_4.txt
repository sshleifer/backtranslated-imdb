I saw TV ads when I first heard about White Noise. Earlier I did not even exist it. I have seen the online trailer and decided that I will go and see. Now as a supporter of six senses, I thought that this movie will give me what I want. It's Michael Keaton, and he's the stone. Unfortunately the film was not distributed. It tried to be another six senses or EcoS steal, and unfortunately failed. It has a very promising start, but the midget just drags on the repetition, and may have figured out any monkeys who end up with a completely poor twist. Unfortunately, like most "horror" movies, it is nowadays it is very loud and loud that aloud loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly loudly. This film can be so much more. It was a shame because it was a good idea.
