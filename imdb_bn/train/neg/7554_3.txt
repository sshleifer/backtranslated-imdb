I have not seen the highly rated version of the old 1973. I played a Nicholas Cage fan (by the way, played fine as normal). This movie probably took five minutes to complete the whole plot (I see it done in a cocktail napkin in the dinner party), if you can not finish this drill in the first thirty minutes, maybe find this movie entertaining. It's a horror gem that Hollywood has dug its own with horror / mystery / thriller style, unable to write enough audiences to listeners and write new, smart, and tantalizing screenplay, they are some vague music and you throw a few things and your local Send final print to the theater. At least, it was not jiggling hand held camera syndrome.
