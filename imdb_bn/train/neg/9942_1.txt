At least the theater seats were comfortable and I ate as much pop-jewel as possible for the conversation to sink at least. This is not absolutely a women's film. Any block who likes it, can be sure to stay away from our women. Foolish stories, middle-class dialogue and overall cheap looking film. I have seen a number of movies, but this is the new winner in the bad segment. If you are going to see it, the thing you look at is the end. So you can run out of theaters as soon as possible.
