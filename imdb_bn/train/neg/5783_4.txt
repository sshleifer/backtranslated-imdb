Ah, sex-and-gore movie. It's too bad that they do not do this anymore (unless you're in Japan). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Have crazy sex with them, and then eat them (without first prey, they kept those around for no special reason). When she camped her husband in camp, then these complex mysterious women became very aware. It gets ugly real from here. In the end, two lights are in bloodstream that they are eating everything and their prisoners are driven to run away. Oops, much more for that secret existence <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </ /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a bloody, confusing mess (why their graves To their graves away?), Only a few minutes to watch during the vampire play. What I found from this movie is that these two valuable bit advice: shooting lesbians will not kill them; It will only turn into their vampire, and, do not take hookers along the road to a country; They are probably vampires. That's another, it really was not worth my time.
