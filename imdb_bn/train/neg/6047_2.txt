The French connection worked so well that there was a relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Rousseau (Skida). In this disaster directed by Frankenheimer (who brought us the Renderer Games and Dr. Moureau Island), this film focuses on Dual and Chernyar (Ray) on its single expression. An imaginary idea that allows the NYPD Doyle to go to Marseille to find the churchier with the help of the French Local Authority, suddenly a fun laugh Correct me if I'm wrong, but I did not leave the city with 65 pounds pure smack !!! A street value is 32 million but yes, I'm sending this guy to find out, it was his pinch after all. Thanks !!! The story was weak. Acting was terrible (with the only exception of Hackman, who completely surpassed his part). The direction was everywhere. Even the cuts in the scene were terrible. Do yourself a favor and see the first installment twice and skip this one.
