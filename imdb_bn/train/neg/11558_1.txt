Extraordinary horror stories that I can only keep in words. The best part of the film is to make one of the killer victims alive and well, but only to genocide. There are some chances that this baby may have a little less time during which I missed some important plot material. The box that comes in the film shows scenes of scenes that are never in the movie. I was brought up by the strange image of the assassination of the prisoner and the promise of 'Euro-trash, sexy flick'. I felt the feeling of this budget version and was about a quarter of the film left. Probably the best thing. I got the PG-13 editor, which was as intuitive as the end of the new 'Planet of the Apps' movie. See this one with a friend and a bottle of hard stuff. You will need it.
