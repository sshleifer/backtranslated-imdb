It should have been a movie of Sam and his wife, the glorious Peter Folk and equally glorious Olympia Dubakis. That has been a movie to see. Instead, it's a Paul Reiser car, a little foggy. The wonderful Elizabeth Parkes is also in this movie, but you rarely know it. I think Reiser is under the impression that he is a giant movie star who needs a suitable car. He is not Even more seriousness is that Reiser today hired some of the best female character actors on the screen and then shoved them all over their background. Duckakis can not be seen for the last 15 minutes, but when the screen works it becomes bright. The story is really about Falk and Dukakis, but we are under a vague, stupid, incomprehensible road trip, which the Reisier has shown with his mental insight (wrong!) Very beautiful, valuable and deep. . For example, I imagine in a scenario of a restaurant that the Reiser hoped "a kind of ridiculous ridiculous resemblance to cascatus" and a fierce clash between fakes, I'm feeling embarrassed for the fakes.
