The 1937 "Stella Dallas" with Barbara Stanwick was not entirely old - some wondered how a semi-update version of the story will now work, it really is a real culmination. Perhaps they thought the thigh, Bate Millarella could do some bravely rush, but this hello script defeated him. A woman, while having a child outside of a marriage ceremony with Bartender, and after a few years gives a younger daughter to the child's wealthy father, so that she can live a better life, can not survive with the tattoo, old fashion and feeling. Midlighter works best with movie directors, who can control his excessive control, but it fails here; Stephen Collins is strong as his life-changing man, but Cast as well as the daughter of the Trinidad Alvarado Miller. It is described as a "woman's picture" which is a wall, but it does not pass it strongly because it remains very faithful from the sources of the 1930s. * **** to 1/2
