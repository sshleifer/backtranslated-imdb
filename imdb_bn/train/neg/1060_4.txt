All right, so it was written before 9/11, so you can think of it for the terrorists and imagine that the CIA's director planned to destroy this debris before it was flown out of the sky. In the world, the presents are. That's it. That's the best thing Acting ... fair. Plot ... silly "Bend" ... unnecessary. As DOOOOOOOOOOOM thinks what ever it is when it gets corrupted on a plane. Do you think the bureaucrats are "tortured" and how can they be included? The exact execution of such a plan is always a problem, we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It is not sent to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, then why the plane's doors were open and "bullets" were standing without any protection? Actually, did anyone ever come to shoot on his legs? It will stop him but not dramatic. I'm a kid. Once I saw a movie to start it, once I started it. But it was time wasted, and in most cases, expected. I saw it using a recorder so I did not have to see all the ads, it was a plus. Why I see such a small TV network is a good example. Garbage.
