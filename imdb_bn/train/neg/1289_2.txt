It was a new all-time minimum in the west. The writing is very bad, it is impossible to emphasize letters and both are hateful or silent, violence is frustrating and technically not very strictly executed. And Tobi Maguera shows the flip side of our talent, sleeping in his part with his senseless eyes, and his stubborn voice betrayed the system here only. 'Raid with the Devil' is one of my five worst movie experiences, the West can never overcome negative rewards.
