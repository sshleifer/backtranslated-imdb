I first read "Lorna Doone" almost 20 years ago and absolutely loved it! It is a classic historical romance set that took several days from West Bengal London in the 1600s and it was very difficult to apply law and order. Sadly, this version of the book took many liberties with the story and in my opinion it was incredibly frustrating. The acting and production standards are fine, but the way the story got confused was terrible. Why does television adaptation do this? Why do they think that thousands of fans want to change their stories ??? A great mystery of life !!! The BBC has created a wonderful version of the Christmas in the early 1990's, which I'm still trying to track a copy! Take my advice, read the book and do not bother with this palli version!
