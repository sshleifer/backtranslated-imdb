This is a weirdly hacked movie, you seem to want to come to bond company with this feeling, I am not surprised that there is no credit in it, who want to be associated with this movie. Everyone involved is extremely awesome and the plot goes all over the world, it gives all very little ideas. As I said, the bond company seems to be coming in because it seems there were so many footage that did not need to be shot, and all the music was very sick library music (cheap I think). Very, very weird. Although I would actually buy a DVD of it, if it could leave me in what I was about to do and what happened to this movie.
