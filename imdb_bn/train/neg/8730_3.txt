The thing that is standing in my mind in this movie (sadly) is the launch, where John Berlin (Andy Garcia) is driving the city. Pass passes through the passage through a road you see in her morsaid's road with a barbine street on the street. It's pretty cool. <br /> <br /> Andy Garcia is playing a character with the last name of Berlin, well ... Andy Latin could easily pass it Latin. Perhaps a Caucasian father married his Spanish mother for this story? Who knows But I can tell you that when you keep him in a city of farmers and hicks, he stands like a throat, especially when he gets angry with his pronunciation. Yes, I know, the big deal is right? He is still a good actor <br /> <br /> The title of a serial killer who has jeopardized his victim nickname. The victims are all blind and he dismembers them. The killer took a break but suddenly a blind witness (not asking) when Helena Robertson (Uma Thurman) was shown. Thurman makes a good job of playing a blind person, my surprise. When I saw Lance Henrikine playing Sgt Freddie Ross I am worried. Henriquesen has played in a number of strange films, especially late. I still do not forget him in the purple movie, Pumpkinhead. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> When he found the body of the local landfill, he started investigating the murder of Jennifer. His illumination seemed to be blind in discovering one of the victims. So with the equality of the recording and name * Spiller * Freddy's mockery, did the mockery. I was very confused about how eight "Jennifer" came. And the simple thing deranged as a killer does not pack a lot of punch. In retreat, this film is probably true in life for a truly obscure person, because they have been slightly disappointed with the time, or perhaps Lon Ton was born. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Garcia interrogated her! Although no police allows them to rush strictly to any legal person and to run them out without risking them properly. In the end, it's a bit of a surprise, but very controversial, much like SGT. Ross' Murder. The killer likes to walk after his ongoing prey, instead I like to guess. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not destroy the end because it is despite the frustration, it is a good surprise. After all, however, you'll probably say, as I did, "the boy was lucky!" 4/10
