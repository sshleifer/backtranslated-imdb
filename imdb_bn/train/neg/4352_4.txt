If you have seen friends, writing will be very familiar. Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of a friend share the same comedy setup. <br /> <br /> This program is about a group whose connections they share at the same age when they were still young (I think about 10 years old). Now, they meet them in the mid-twentieth century, and they again meet on a class reconciliation. Where this series begins <br /> <br /> Police with multiple stories line at a common episode simultaneously. They are usually not connected in any way. Each story line is cut into multiple sections, which are then shown in a mixed sequence. <br /> <br /> My problem with this series is lying where sketches In the next season of Friends, it is often difficult to believe with the difficult situation. One of the main characters is really hard to believe that something really stupid. The situation is overly exaggerated, as it does not fool enough. If you like to face such a humor you probably would like this series. This is a great bond for me. <br /> <br /> I started seeing friends because of the first few seasons. There are interesting and especially credible story lines, there are some romance that makes you root for characters. Class has nothing to do with this. Characters are simply too forced and pushed too far to the stereotypes. So it is not possible to relate them and make them like them. <br /> <br /> With at least friends, it takes several seasons before going out of steam and the characteristics of the character are thrown out of all milk. But in the class, it seems that it has gone out of steam even before it started.
