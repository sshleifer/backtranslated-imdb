This movie is pretty awesome but I have some interesting information: <br /> <br /> It was filmed in the Azad Flagstaff Northern Arizona University in 1976, as well as in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona in AZ. Additional movies of the movie were then dramatic students of NAU. I was a new one there that year, mining in the theater, but for some reason I was not involved in production. Although I knew many people and could provide this amazing truth: <br /> <br /> There is a scene in this movie where their two guardians will have to flee naked as part of their stylish program. The pipe They are seen from behind the movie, just that. It's a matter of fact, they are not actors, but I knew from the theater division that two people. This "stunt posterior" identity will remain anonymous, at least on this website, until they decide, um, express themselves!
