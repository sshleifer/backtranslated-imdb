Cripple - "Your journey ends here." Some very graphic scenery and ... well, yes, almost all of it for this movie. <br /> <br /> There is no real plot, no story. No preferred letter, good, you do not have any sources based on consideration that 'letter' is not correct. I mean, they are being pursued by something 'strange' in search of something (who's this thing? Why is he there?), It's very scary in my mind, but I really care? No, I do not. Why am i not Because these people do not have any idea about me and I do not know if I want them to live or die. It depends on one dimensional and thunder and sound effect which makes you scared. <br /> <br /> This movie has no meaning, no purpose. I fell asleep and the build up 45mins like Miss Miss. It jumps right into the right Basically, some women and their friends are locked in the London Underground, behind a strange creature, then they finally escape from it. <br /> <br /> The moment of the cripple that gives you a jump, the art is good, the place is nice and the sound is okay, but it does not make a decent horror movie, so unfortunately all the waste can go away. <br /> <br /> This is nothing new. Another expected modern 'horror', where Kate (lead 'character') is consistently fooling "Hey, I'm sitting in a lot of homes, I think I should do this sensible thing in this situation, but, oh, no! I'm going to do the opposite work Because I'm a fool blonde "thing. I want them to do it, it has been done many times, it gets annoying and predictable. In fact, I'm not very stubborn, stupid, stupid by the woman, erm, gray alien-looking animals. <br /> <br /> "Your journey ends here" movie line tag. Well, the cripps journey ended just a few minutes in the movie. If you have a few beers, bring some mates back to you, then check it out in all ways. But you want something original and clever, avoid.
