This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars, which I have spent so much time in. If you knew how often I went to the movie you could probably say, it's hard to imagine, but not less, it's true! After watching the movie trailer, I knew that I had to see! You're a fan of horror, mystery, and mystery, why do not you? The trailer is nothing but playful and exciting; Unfortunately, this movie is not about any one. <br /> <br /> From cinematography, from scripts to acting, this film is completely flop. If you read this, I plan to get some thrill, mystery, action, horror, or anything other than an hour and twenty-five minutes to go to the movie. I think you are frustrated. <Br /> <br /> "Why it's so bad," you can ask yourself. I'm telling you The movie was mysterious or suspicious. Nothing about the movie made me "on the edge," frightened, or a bit strange. The script was the best ridiculous. Many times the dialogue was so ridiculous in the film that I started writing it as a comic relief after just a few seconds that it was not. Acting was absolutely awesome. I liked Nicholas Cage but this one was missed. Without exception, each performance of this movie was incredibly low down. Cinematography was awful with the mystery or mystery of a moment. Finally, the story is completely transparent. You can come away from the last mile of this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm not usually very strict critic. To be honest, when I'm going to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see any mystery / mystery / intimidation, I just want to be amazed. This movie is annoying, bad acting, bad writing, and a great disappointment. Do yourself a favor and go to see something else.
