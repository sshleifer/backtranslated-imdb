Am I wrong, or is the 2007 edition just a rip off of the original? I have to ask, because the DVD I bought is one of the worst movies. I have played bad roles, bad edits etc. .... The only "exploitation" aspect here is to buy us pieces of ribs. It's nothing more than a light weightless porn flick ... a real ghor, no scary picture, just a bit of waste junky. Someone wants to see a name with an actor, some thin cows and a beautiful story ... get the blood of the baby ... in the cheap budget but well made ... and a real story! I was spit money wasted but I'll just be laughing ... it's sad! New comment .... September 3 ..... I will keep this picture forever because it's bad, it's almost good .... In a bad way ... sometimes bad acting ... real shit-movie classic!
