I am a huge horror / splatter fan, I even enjoyed some horror films considering stupid people. I like Gore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is one of my most stupid movies for my frustration. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible, the conversations were stupid, the plot was in vain, special effects were in vain and the execution was probably done by someone who has been dead for the last 2 years. Generally I made all these features a great B horror movie. But this is not the case. <br /> <br /> I've Westward 11 Euro to get this DVD. <br /> <br /> If you really enjoy the pointless gore (for example "violent movie" movies), avoid any costs!
