Like most critics I saw Starz! Subject to demand. After looking at the preview with my girlfriend, she decided to not see it from the bad saw the preview. I, on the other hand, looked a curious enough warrant it was curious enough. I mean, the design of Des Maceo alone, at least one brief restraint in this title. After looking at it, I can say that it has some interesting aspects (ie browsing on notebooks and trying to find out the faint story), it is best to pass it. <br /> <br /> * Major Spoilers * After making their first video for their so-called CDD, their first video shoots lead singer, cassidy, her boyfriend Neil, to kill him himself. After 3 months, the band is trying to determine whether they are going to end the album. Try what the cassidy wanted, they are his old psychic friend. Try to see Mesoca and contact him through him. To read his card, Dr. MESO enabled four straight death cards for four remaining band members. Bad time ahead. (I just wanted to create a point that in the film, they explained that the Death Card really represents the change, at least to them.) Even without the approval of the dead, they decided to move forward. End of album But during the bathrooms, Cassidy's best friend Dora saw a glimpse of her dead friend. When another band-mate goes to examine him, the striker is standing in the dark, requesting his sunglasses. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Most of the effects of war crimes, unnecessary zoom, and other cheap influences are the brightness of this film. An inconsistent storyline does not help anything. The resurrection of the cassidy hanging together once described, everything is different. We are cassidy and Jump into Meso (who was mysteriously able to enter a locked building) and shows that they are connected in any way or with others. However, in that few minutes of revelation, we find that Cassidy is truly an independent from Meso. Then he turned the helper to take revenge and called Jack Nicholson as a joker. But not in a good way. <br /> <br /> At this stage, the cassidy has been shown somewhere, but there are strange laptops to move around from the place according to the order. One view we see Cassidy standing beside the desk, when a character enters later, he is not available anywhere. When he moves behind the desk, we see him at the end of a hallway. Then grab the key in another cell (which is already blue), then back again. Note that from one minute to the next, the cassidy's mood seems to be completely 180 without any catalyst. One moment, he wants to kill everyone (although he only injured 90% of the letters) - Later he apologized to everyone and closed the door to die again. The word is confusing? That's because of that. It's a jumbled mess that I'm sure that the author can not even find out. <br /> <br /> For performance, most especially wood. Although something interesting, but overall it is not known for a piece that plays it. Driven power behind this piece of story.
