This film has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as a ruthless dad. The film failed because Jennifer Jason Leigh was very upset like a girl and much more humble in Olivia de Havilland, however, for the old rendering of The Hirees (1949). The novel by Washington Square, whose author Henry James, disrespected feminism in some of his other novels, is also the feminist-baseless conclusion of the novel. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very frustrating.
