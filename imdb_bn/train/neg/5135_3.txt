I think scarecrows are horrible, so it does not make them a pity this movie makes them more. <br /> <br /> A robber will parachute the state of emergency in a large field. One of them is lost with looting, and the rest of the people follow him in the absence of a bad fear. The acting Hammy and the scarecrows are unimpressive (when they move). On the positive side, director static scarecrows get some mystery out. Alfred Hitchcock says, "A bomb has exploded under a table, and it is astonishing. We know the bombs are under the table, but when it will not stop, it is mysterious."
