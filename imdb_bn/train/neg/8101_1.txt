It is often said that the movies can not be the same as the original book. Well, in this case, this movie is not just "good" like books, but insulted by the book. I'd rather see Milan Kundar's novel be turned into a fire than "some", which is perhaps the "adaptation" of the director. <br /> <br /> <br /> All the beautiful philosophy that asks "What is the burden of heavy weight? On your shoulders, or being intolerable, the flexibility to cope?", and instead, all the movies are Daniel Day Lewis ( I can not say Thomas) her stupid wife, her ownership and sexual activity with her other ownership. Francois Truffaut already said it: Bad director make bad movies. Do not waste your time and money. Instead of reading the book, it's really worth it.
