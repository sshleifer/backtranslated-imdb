All right - I'll give this movie ... I'll give this movie alone - alone - to make me such a terrible terrible horror. I can not see this movie alone. I heard a lot of stories about the effect of its original expression on the theater on its viewers. Incredible masterpiece .... terrible, emotional material scares off my pants. We bless their hearts, who made this extraordinary film. I love it I was decent and attractive to the whole movie. This movie is so scary - this is the worst movie of my life! What happened in the film and the idea of ​​the movie is not quite scary, but what always got me - it was not a great deal of Brenda. The best horror film ever. Nothing can be scary again. Seeing at Halloween his evilest.
