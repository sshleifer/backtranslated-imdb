I enjoy the book written by Robin Klein perfectly, so when I heard that a movie was based on this book, I was very excited. <br /> <br /> But when I saw that I was very disappointed with the movie because it did not capture what I like for the book - absolutely ridiculous funny Erica and the interesting way that she sees the world. <br /> <br /> From the beginning of the movie, I realized that I did not imagine in the book. So, I just went for the ride. It was not bad at all, I guess. Missile Belmont was even different! I think he can not smoke and drink - Jean Kitson, who played him, is sunny! <br /> <br /> It was on my own, I thought the movie and its actors / actress did it good job, but alas, I was a fan of books (one of my favorite books all the time) that I could not help but feel frustrated P = P
