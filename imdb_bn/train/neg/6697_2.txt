Crazed Shotgun toting-incest driven revenge-truck driver and curse control disorder "Handbook of rape made me father at the age of 12" Handcuffs, all latex wear prostitution, this totally disagreement with this film is just some of the characters that you can easily play on Sunday 4am It can be seen at any of the TV stations (IE: Skinemax). (?? and yes I know it was a complete sentence, but lived with me; it's a long review for a short film) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Any budget No, the plot of this scary show is frustrating, in which police is clearly never heard of "State Odyssey" because they are Mia (hooker) and Trent (stupid, anus, genetic, unsafe college student) United States (and I could only do that in the FBI). The camera is unclear, sex scenes are moderate, and acting is so bad that it can be strange hyperbolic flashbacks in the movie "Esther" and "Leonard Part 6". <br /> <br /> As long as you go to the skin scene (the only reason to rent this movie, do not even worry about buying it) they have two. The first is the only one that can be seen, though the dominant sex scene with Curry Salin and ____ (unknown actors enter here, they have not done anything else for noticing) are in a painful, disgusting little room outside the drips and soda machines, which left only blue tonic water ). It is all S & M people (rolling crops, handcuffs, hot waxes, and underwear losses) and finally, they go left in a flat room, no money and the police are waiting at his door (which goes for telling you, or a whi ... Let's tie into the "total anywhere" in the total room). Sadly though, Curry does not show any skin to remember, and it can only create a deep-seeded traumatic experience for some gentlemen, so it must be bent towards this glow. <br /> <br /> To the end * Snicker * Snicker * I know if you do not reveal it to me, you probably do not mind, but I will not do it, you should work hard for it. Lastly I got it for a 1/5 action, for a 3/5 skin (see the last paragraph) and for the role 0/0, the character development or complex plot twists. <br /> <br /> - The ridiculous man
