I hope a movie like Dos Bicolor, which I enjoyed. However, this ugly ending forever. This is a flicker that enjoys the tragic position of PG-13 when it is not a suitable child. Curiosity is not just cold or f ** t jokes, they are unreasonable, ugly, and many actions cross the line from legal and ethics, not just bad taste. Most of the scenes seem to have been cut to get a PG-13 rating ... very bad ... if it is released in a funny movie then it can create big splash like a R-rated movie. (Too much condition? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It's a completely waste time ... and I'm ready to give something about a movie lover and a shot. Within 45 minutes, the movie felt like it should be reduced ... and we were ready for that boy. Finishing is not strange but a quote of this quagmire / tourist trap is not recovered. 1/2 star (Glad I saw it as a freebie ... It's hard to give greenback to achieve hard for this tripe)
