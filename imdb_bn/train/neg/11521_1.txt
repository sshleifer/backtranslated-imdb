This movie is really one of the worst pieces of trash. It's wonderful that something really terrible that can be made But, if you can stand on the mind-flexible plot, character development and direction, then you can come out of the soundtrack which is a funny thing. The movie starts horribly and quickly becomes unwanted. Some may give some comfort to this film because his career may have been destroyed due to his involvement in the film. If you end up watching this movie or have seen it already (I feel your pain) then these words are too late. For anyone else, stay away from all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will ruin your life 2 hours. Then at least you can clear it during the time to see or do something.
