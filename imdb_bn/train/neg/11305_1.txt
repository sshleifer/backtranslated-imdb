This is a very bad western because it is historically wrong. Instead of Jack Slade where he lived and died, Idaho, Colorado zones and Montana seemed to have shot a lot behind California instead. It is a mythical 'bad man', everything that is known about 'good man' is imagined. The scripts are horrible; There is very little direction, and lousy acting. Dorothy Malone is completely completely destroyed as his wife. Mark Steven does not think how to portray this mysterious Jack Slayd. In real life, Jack Slayd was a very good stage line superintendent. He was afraid of his local townman for his harsh water. If he is drunk, he will start fights in Virginia City and will cause other problems. To ensure that he could not make them terror again, Jack warned Slade, he immediately ignored his warning to leave the city. This is a horror movie. I can not recommend anyone else to watch this movie to see how the history goes on in the history of Hollywood.
