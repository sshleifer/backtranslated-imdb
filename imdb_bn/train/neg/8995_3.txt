I missed the start but mostly saw it. Got it in FYE's cheaper room at a friend's DVD. <br /> <br /> All of the skits are very small, and yet most of them still quite long. Most of them, they seem to have forgotten some fun! Among the most racist / sexist / "homophobic" skits based on humor, skit based on stereotype, or ethnic terms for humans. <br /> <br /> I'm trying to remember something that I was funny about, and I'm having trouble ... The logo of the tunnel vision network is a lipstick face with an eye rib. The mouth is open and closed on eyes like eyelids. <br /> <br /> <br /> What a disappointment? Most actors go to good things, and it is lucky that the bombs did not hold them back.
