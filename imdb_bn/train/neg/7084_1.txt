As others have said, this is a horror film from every aspect of filmmaking. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Yes, it was shot in video, but not 'cheap' video. It was bad, light, white balance, shooting technique and editing. <br /> <br /> Different shooting and editing techniques were used so it was a production mess. Hand-holding shooting (Ala Woody Allen), Sticky Editing (other Allen Tactics), but without real purpose, done badly, using unhappy lighting. <br /> <br /> The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen is shameful; <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It's valuable to be surprised if it's bad.
