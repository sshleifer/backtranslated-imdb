This picture is a huge steaming pile. <br /> <br /> I did not understand why the Gerland / Mason version needs to be renewed, nor why the Stryrasand likes to be a star. <br /> <br /> I do not think why our public (gay Americans) tend to tend to regard Stryasand as a bit of treasure. At least in my opinion, he was a professional figure on funny girls and Hawds Up Doc in Bogdanovich. Please <br /> <br /> on your own and hire Judy Classic or even real (a fine film on your right), but please please skip this stuff!
