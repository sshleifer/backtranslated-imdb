Title should have been walking. The man is running 90% of the movie. He does not know what he wants, or what he wants. Go through life to steal people's identity for nothing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was clear in this film that he loved his father and was a good boy. But the rest was shit. <br /> <br /> There can be a man who wants to be someone else. But what must he do to get a real job, because after his movie, I do not think he has the opportunity to work as a movie producer.
