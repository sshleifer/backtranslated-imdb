As always, this homeless is a mistake. The TV told a lot of lies about the panhandlers in the early 1990's, and everyone felt bad and claimed that each of us made more than $ 100 a day when one day was around 20-40 dollars. When someone offered me a sign for work and offered me to work, I actually went and I took the job if I was physically capable. And if I give $ 100,000 ID, then surely the investment will be invested in prepaid at least 2 years, and most of the banks have been kept, and the casino left $ 10-20000 for NL $ 1-2 and $ 2-5 cash games. I could always win and decent if I had always had a winroll. Instead of always gaming for the lowest purchase in almost every month I do not want to lose about $ 1000 per month. I was just homeless because I did not want to risk my money and went broke, sometimes I had more than 1000-1000 dollars in my neck when I was sleeping outside. I want to communicate with Yahoo Messenger at Satkona in 2003 that no one wants to contact me, although I was mostly apart from homeless people, because I never used to smoke or take drugs. I'm no longer homeless, now I've got $ 177 in government housing and SSI and most of my time spent time in winning online poker. Mom and sunflower diversity work hard to get me SSI. My day is hiding in the center of the sleeping casino convention center at night, concerns about security caught by the end are finally over. This TV crew has picked me long ago. It's embarrassing that they do not choose what they choose.
