True satirism is this: Joe Bessar was a top classical comedian, away from Stoges in other situations. He had a specific track record to be very funny and cute. Moe and Larry and Shem actually knew him or at least for a few years and liked his work. So when he joined the army as a "third stog" what was going on in the world? Of course, nothing. Most of the "late Stog" era, often not many, the boys push each other or Joe into the opposite and this is not the right stog etiquette. To quote the "one for one, for everyone, everyone for himself", "restless knights". A good comedy team, Lorel and Hardy, Abbott and Castello, are one thing about Marx Brothers, in order to actually enjoy each other or chips try to surround each other, they stuck together and came back to help each other. This special one, that happens to anyone. It's often about showing a dog's war, like someone trying to cheat others or is not mean for nonsense and nasty, and comedic effects. Someone might guess that there was something behind the scene here, imitating the art life. Messi and Larry probably did not live long with the base, so maybe there was. Just look at the history of other groups and tell me I'm wrong.
