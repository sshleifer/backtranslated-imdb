First of all when I saw the Teaser Trailer for Wendy Wu, I was definitely excited. Brenda, the hottest girl in the Disney Channel, is doing martial arts and I was good with her ... until I saw the movie. The action was poorly constructed, the film was not realized by anyone, the war was unreal and it was with the plot ... it was sucked. If you really war against some ancient evil of a Wannabe Left Vampire Slayer, a girl who wants to ignore her calling and wants to become the queen of the house, who was the mother of those other fighters, who wants to become a queen of the house. The idea was not just real, the film wasted time.
