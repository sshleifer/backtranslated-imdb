This is a painstaking example of a cheap, annoying and singular list produced by Australian TV stations to meet local content quota. The writing was really terrible and I am not surprised that the authors are responsible for the worst Australian movie in recent memory, the honorable Wali Norman. <br /> <br /> There was nothing interesting about this TV series - even - not even gently funny. It was just tired and BAD and the worst, it was really fun at it. It was just shameful to see. <br /> <br /> I am very happy about this event for 10 out of 10 events in IMDB. Try to review an original (original) Australian audience show (not many) and it is impossible. Or crazy There are delicious bread from this show. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs of this event and if it comes out of the DVD, keep in mind that the smile was unrecognized.
