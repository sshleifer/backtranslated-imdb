This series is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. Terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. The stories are so amazing from Robin Hood's legend. Looks like they wanted to attract an audience called Robin Hood. Maybe it's Mr. Known as the new Adventure of the Grand Acting. <br /> <br /> Someone commented before me that if you imagined you would like this show. This is a terrible approach to a TV series. A visual media like this should be fantastic in your imagination, you should not emphasize anything your imagination is doing to make it better. It will be like the Simpsons episode, where they try to develop homemaker through the promotion of religious campaign film and whoever or whoever or whatever. "If a movie is annoying, I just make my own story." <br /> <br /> Conclusion: The perfect human waste.
