I do not want to go too far, because I'm not wasting a lot of time to review this movie, but hopefully I have to give alternative options to help people avoid the film. Animation is angry and boring / annoying option in highly annoying. Humor was completely lost to the audience, and yes - ghosts among Shell fans, it is not an action scientist or anything like that - it was an attempt by Slezpic comedians, and did not work even after junk translation. The film was fairly curious to watch, and I had a great way to stop the film festival, especially considering how excited I was and how I was open - I did not expect ghost in a group of shells. There was some entertaining hope, and it simply did not achieve this. Yaaawwnnn ... instead of renting Kino's journey.
