So I'm not saying this as a partner partner in the contract. I really was a fine of 1997 and so I went to the movie rental store. I asked Clark what was the worst movie in his stock. Without hesitation, he "lucky to me." He told me that if he promised to watch the whole film, he would leave the $ 1 rental fee (he said it would be wrong to charge more). So I did it, see, free ... <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible. Even Allah is unconscious. I do not have to go into details of the plot, read other reviews. No sense of joke. Acting was terrible. I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but the stupidity of the main character was tiring. You can try to see something laughing at it, but it is so bad that it is not so funny. Avoid!
