The 2 points dedicated to the performance of Akshay Kumar. I say Bollywood movies do not really try to be realistic, but Walt Disney production is more realistic than this plot. Dad is going to die and what a good parent does ... he beat his son with his generation's wife. There were some things that were hard to swallow - 1. Priyanka was going to live a hungry living in the bedroom of her mother-in-law garden, from the cooling pool of the swimming pool in the bedroom. 2. Akshay suddenly got to work as a stunt man, gets bitten by rabified dogs, then just walking off. This image is an INSULT for our intelligence. I do not really believe that I have contributed financially to 'people' who have made this movie look for my family, we have kept the movie in the go, please do not keep this mess up on your own. Take my advice on this and do not waste your 'waqt'.
