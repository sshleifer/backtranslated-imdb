This show is not tricky. That basically boils down to it. These writers are trying to save "the real humor" from completely eliminating the rest of the world's anxieties, just unreasonable. Another comment, someone quotes a funny ridiculous line. The standout for me was George H. Bush tells the children that they do not want to watch a TV other than Fox News. How nice. I thought episodes were bad. This is a high point for line series that is unfortunate. <br /> <br /> My problem with this sad excuse for political satire is that these people are coming in the second season. I am a liberal republic and I know Bush was not a good president. We all do But at that time no excuse for putting poopie waste in this completely I put these authors in the same level as the genius of 'Meet the Spartans'. Their formula, as soon as you can cut out the illogical recent jokes and even throw them in even worse original elements, you will actually be able to give your writing credits. <br /> <br /> Again, just plain bad. Unfunny, and it is more and more displeasing to me that the strap like this is renewed, but the real show like the amazing and real development is canned after 3 hard seasons. Please do not see this shit, unless you are one of those green blooded liberal hippies that seem to have a word with bush and silly words, then gold is gold. <br /> <br /> Oh, and sucks Bush's voice. Everything he does imitates a little Texan pronunciation and its sentences are really hard to end. At least South Park acknowledges that the voice is not correct. If you like funny political satire, see the daily show / Colby. Or look for any political sketch of robot chicken, it's fun to watch, as the stop motion action image animation is done very well. See George Bush as a JD bit on YouTube. Invaluable
