And perhaps, as Fred Sandford said, "one over the lips". Who has released this film to a vague public And probably a person named "Rue Morgo" who said it "federhelbander" and said it was good. <br /> <br /> Five little girls are playing short-lived homes from high school football games, lost and asked about some small shop directions in the middle. Although the driver suddenly hit a parked SUV and threw the headlit, the girls decided to leave everyone and could not find the driver. But the driver comes out to find them, and not only gets the headlight of his car dunked, because of other reasons girls are still not able to understand. When the driver first caught him (he, he's one) shot gun guns and stripped them, and shouted at them, "What did you see?". Of course, girls are afraid of death and do not know what they are saying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gun blasts and screwers write exceptionally well where they do not want them. Finally, they see that something happened behind the shop due to psychological rage. And eventually they have the opportunity to take revenge and they can accept it as far as they can. <br /> <br /> The elements of this movie are rather annoying and frightening, but unfortunately, those moments have been reduced by bad acting. , Bad conversations, and huge loss of credibility. One girl is shot dead and shot dead, and she feels cold, her life is moving in front of her eyes, but she is better? And how far can a mini-van run approximately an empty gas tank at about 80 miles? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At least girls can learn something about what sets, and the driver is still worried about "quarreling over his mother's van", which is perhaps less of a concern for some of them. <br /> <br /> So it's not the worst movie I've seen, but it's very good to be very good and very terrible and sometimes it's very terrible to be terrible and terrible. However, it takes a lot of shoulder cake for violence and if you see it, then you have to keep two ears together. Which, by the way, I do not necessarily recommend. 10 out of 4
