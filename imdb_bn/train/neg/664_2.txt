I'm not particularly a remix lover, or can not steal the modern term "recovery", but this movie really stopped me. The main entertainment night, although I still can not understand a great piece of my guess ... Awful. There are some simple things to remember when making a terrific film. Suspense is very important for the audience to maintain interest. Sorry guys, but a white imitation film was not this! Scares were cheap, and terrific foreshadowed. (Now a terrible example that has got more fear than Clichad, the cat is going to jump from the cats, but soon after, but an unexpected appearance of the film's villain) could not stop it from successfully filming, so how can I fill up any other conventions in the optimistic movie? Be a favorite hero or heroine. This is not one of the pictures. The person I was most familiar with is a hack detective. Its cool practices, but what a killer was headed to the level of escape was what was more pictures of this type. Common sense methods to happen in the event. (If you are running from an axis psychology then you turn and spin the opposite. Not the world, sometimes looking at three seconds, providing the killer's progress, only moves each branch and the unknown object in your way.) If you are a friend Disappears, you are not alone looking for them. And if you doubt the criminal game you tell someone, do not investigate yourself. These clich√©s are tired and well overplayed. The horror scenes in general, and especially this film.
