You'll see Lamer is one of the wedding movies. His period smacks too much so it was old before it hit the theater. Ethnic stereotypes are like a Hennie Youngman joke, they are here at least bit fun without just one point. Molly Ringswald, what needs to be said well. Give it a formula of silliness, because it destroys a $ 10,000 wedding dress, "It just does not happen" makes it with straps and puts on a top hat, in this kid, and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy, rather ringwalding her neck. It's a helluva cast too, check out how heavy Hey Sheedy is. Wheeeew!
