This movie was absolutely unfortunate. A great screenplay and a lack of stories helped me see three damaged Duol on bikini children. Occasionally I felt that I saw an episode of Beves and Botthead. I could not even sit through the whole movie. Imran Hashmi disappointed, and Hrusha Bhatta is not impressive to everyone. Selina Jaitley was not bad. Anu Malik and Shayyar's passion are the only partners in the film. It was pretty ridiculous. The song "Sien Nay" and its remix version was really good. You can always rely on Imran's lips-locking and a chartbuster lip-sync. After all, it seems like there is no good script from Imran Vattars, at this moment to bring him back.
