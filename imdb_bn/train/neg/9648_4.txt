In the past, as a filmmaker, Vipul Shah did some interesting work. 'Walk - The Race Angst Time' and 'Namast London' were entertaining and interesting. 'Singh Is King' was funny, which he created. His latest acting role as a movie maker, London Dreams, his career became the weakest hired. <br /> <br /> 'London Dreams' is a medieval story, how it hates success and makes friendship. Agree, it is possible but when you watch 'London Dreams' you wonder what's going on? This image is probably the worst measure in recent times. Bhupul Shah's author Vipul Shah was the director. <br /> <br /> The first hour is boring, the second hour is good; But again Claymax is horrible. How can someone forgive a person who decided to destroy you? I do not want Ajay Devgn to go to India suddenly and ask his friend to apologize, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, instead of being ridiculed or abused, Salman welcomes him with a band and says that he was the reason behind the whole lie? What was the desire to show Salman's character as Allah Vipul Shah? If yes, you have failed completely. The only question is, I want to ask Vipul Shah that will welcome a person who has destroyed you with such a big reception? Write what you think, do not fool our {listeners}, knowing what we are good or not enough to understand. <br /> <br /> This is a musical instrument but the music of Shankar-Ishana-fad is terrible. The singing song does not have to be in your mind. <br /> <br /> <br /> She carries the film on her shoulder and really, the emotional scene is really really so. But again his character has been shown as Allah, which he thinks is upset in the end. Even today is equally good, but Salman gave him a complete shade. Has Osin been lost, and what is the great talent like Om Puri in this film? Ranvej Ham, though Aditya Roy Kapoor's excel. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
