Being bachelor in Film Studies, I want to think that I have seen different types of movies, some good and some bad, but I have to say that the 'summer rain' I saw as bad as the picture! I hope the film will choose that it's going to be a great British classic such as 'Secrets or Lais' or 'Lockstock', but oh was not so bad that my flat mate and I became laughing at the humorous acting. And cheesy scripts (remind me to produce a bad 'theater education' school). The main character Michelle and Gary started to disturb us from the beginning. 'Mitchell' faces the main character living with two of his friends that you will never be tired of tired and Gary was so wet (he kept tears in every 5 minutes) that I did not really give an enemy about any of them at the end of the film. I could remember, I gave 3 pounds for this pill. I have never written a review before, but after seeing this movie it inspired me to warn people of this deadly production. So please avoid all costs. Thanks for reading.
