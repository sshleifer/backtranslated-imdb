Well, maybe I've been running bad with Hindi movies recently. I asked the video store for uploading (Prakash Jha), but for the new release, it was not yet available. So I was lasting for this one. It turned into stupid Hindi cinema I saw (and I've seen several) turned into. Not surprisingly, ridiculous stock all over the world! If IMDB has a negative rating, I would like Garment-10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " All normal celebrities and their sideys showed up. For some strange reasons, people expect good things from Piadarshan. I did not like Hulul, Hungama, or his other films. Thunderbolt is likely to be a dub from Tamil or Telugu, on your face, among the tenants who did not understand much more than Bollywood flicks. This latest piece of CXXP has proved that this man has no Brian. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director ??? <br /> <br /> However, now in film. A romantic escapade starts off as a non-sensitized feminine turn. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (this is not the same as an entry where 2 dodds work for a Gospel magazine and share the office? Jezuz Christ, now they are copying their own stories!) However, there are Some cooks or chefs who try to help a dodo to search for multi-touching love (ur multi-tasking + multi-timing) Pm. What has happened to the end, I have no idea. I switch off the middle path What a ridiculous junk I believe they even released it. And how sad to enter their own holes! They made it for an audience - poor illiterate Indian people (700 million in the last count) or the well-established NRI is here for foreign? It does not matter any way. There is no need for a group that produces a good film and is probably worthy of getting such God-awful things. <br /> <br /> It is a short review, but there is nothing to write about the normal bag of F-grade garbage. Bollywood should change its name in Folio. And yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.
