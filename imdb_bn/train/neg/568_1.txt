This is "debuted" today in the SciFi channel and I can say that "I am stupid" I taped it today so I could see it tonight after work. I had high hopes, now I'm hugging the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself. Perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen I hope I could say something like, "This movie was fun to have fun" but this movie did not give me anything to work. I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with Eastern Warnings but I'm going to "this movie sucks" I said it! They will show this flicker to show them what their students will see! My nine-year-old nanny could make a good film. The only decent thing about this movie is to track words and / or words. Oh! I just found a rusty C-Clamp in my old tool box. I keep it on the thumb of my left hand and my eyes are not deleted until my pain is removed. I could just tape this on VHS but I think instead I will burn it to the fire pit. I washed with soap, but I'm afraid that I will never be clean. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people who hate you. -Mike
