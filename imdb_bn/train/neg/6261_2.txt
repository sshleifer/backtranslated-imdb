A couple goes to their dream home, aware that it and its neighbors have been built on the land previously used as a graveyard. The film is based on the real story, although it is considered to be true but it is not published. The plot is absolutely unique - see Spielberg's 'Poltestist' (1982) In a short time, they experience various supernatural incidents: Annoying - mysterious shadow, the girl's fatal illness - obviously ridiculous - the toilets are regularly flushing and the garage doors are out of control. There is a depth of the story: Once it was established that the land was used as a graveyard, we do not learn anything else. The plot does not seem to develop. Characters are not particularly well-drawn or memorable, especially in the atmosphere. The film may be boring to some viewers. Catheris has no idea or has no positive message from it.
