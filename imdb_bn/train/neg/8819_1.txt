<br/> <br /> <br /> Some people become crazy in this movie and Santa Claus kicks off clothes and kills people because he saw his mother. Her father gave oral sex when she was dressed as Santa Clara. Why is he insane? Is it just the worst cause of defeat like myself or others? And that's not the only thing. I am serious when I am not doing anything in this dam movie. It does not last like 1 hour and 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a complete fridge scene where she has a fridge on her Santa's beard glue. This is a fridge minute long. Hello, who wants to see? But I must say that the end of this movie forced me to laugh like this. So if you see this movie on TV, it's just like 1 hour and 20 minutes without any doubt, but the worst end in all the history of the movie. And I'm serious about that. <br /> <br /> It's not so good even worse, it's tedious, it's stupid, it wants to break VCR. This is not the same as your time, but I am sure that all other reviews have mentioned this, but the actress who played the role of home improvement, was the second in the film. Do you know how bad this movie is? I've made amendments to the home of the house for six hours, but these movies will be seen again.
