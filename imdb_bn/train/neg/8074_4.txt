Like a relative who gives you bad gifts, Soul survivors keep his heart at the right place but go on with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing / direction is one of the best effort films, such as Jacob's Ladders and Ab's Los Ozos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen this movie, I will not release the premiere; It is not about saying that it is almost not operated compared to these two best films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Segmillar is bigger than Casey, like going to college. Following his current boyfriend San (Ben Affleck) and ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Anabel (Aarabik Elijah Dushu) followed by two murderers (?) In a car accident in a transparent mask. He lives in the ruins, but when he is present in the college, the weak and dead man in the hospital reappears and disappears, leaving him in total confusion: Who dies? Who is alive? What is real <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Verily, this is part of the killer-hunter-looking scenes (fate, repetitive, and mind-fading) scenes, but at least it has tried to replace suspense instead of clips with ideas, unfortunately failed in a variant. This creates a lot of confusion than being integrated, because the story is awakened to the original points of awakening, dirty, and mystery. (<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A derivative teen goes to the presenter to try to create something beyond the horrific flick; The worst is that she has created a derivative mental thriller. Shezmila also has the power to show the central performance power. Worthy of actually developing his character and passion are some ideas as to unraveling Cassie evoking. The filmmakers have tried a little bit different, but the finished film is a mixed bag, and the test has failed. <br /> <br /> 10 of 4
