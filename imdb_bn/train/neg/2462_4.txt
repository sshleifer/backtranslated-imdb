Well, I like Gore in this movie - it's genuinely unknown. Anyone that knows why that has been a dentist. The story is not really bad, the inspiration for Carbine Berasen's character is far more sensible than most horror films. <br /> <br /> I saw more bad acting, instructions, scripts, but in the end this is still a bad night movie. So if you enjoy the type of enjoy or not. I tried to watch a siegel, but it was right, just like this movie. If you enjoy the victims of a dentist, remember that this is a movie for you!
