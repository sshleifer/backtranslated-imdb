Zimkata is one of the worst movies ever made without any doubt. But not bad kind of bad movie. This one is very terrible to see it and laugh fun. Kurt Thomas does not have a profitable job acting clearly. He will go back to the Gymnist. But at a slow pace, people can forget about the high-end memorable scenes such as chalk, stone pomel horse or five-minute chase scene through the village. I think it was not meant to be bad, but who can tell. It's not art, but if you want something light and flexible that will make a good conversation, rent Jimkta. The fun makes for an evening.
