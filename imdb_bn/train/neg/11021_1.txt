Hallam Phong tells us stories about a boy who lost his mother and later experienced some ways of Oedipus Complex. <br /> <br /> It will be ten good for anything like 95 minutes. In the middle there is an hour where he is walking on the rooftop and the habit of the church tower like Kasimodaro (only he is very less sympathetic). <br /> <br /> Here's a weird love story that 'has something to do with anything. She wants to look like her mother, so what? We know he missed his mother, which was the first ten minutes. They should just start and end together and it's an O.K. Has been there. Small picture Now it's the portrait of a character that does not change. He's a guy that happened. His only active choice in the middle of the movie is to apply for a job. <br /> <br /> This whole Odepass thing seems to be analyzing our character. She dresses her face, women's dresses and wear a dead badger on her head. A badger! You've got to see the end! He returned to his house with a badger on his head to kill his father's new wife (and had sex with him at the beginning) (and it was shot like a dragged hero movie). And anyway they thought it would not be so entertaining that they kept some indie punk music in the background. Although I have got to admit, allergies in films I want to write about on your nose are psychological. It looks like McKenzie's director / guy / who is trying to show us that he is studying psychology at school. You are so modern! Thank you for bringing these forgotten theories to our memory! You really dig! What a Walaraf! All right, so now I understand that this image is based on some random books, however ... .. <br /> <br /> The picture is annoying. Many talking heads. Plus editor changed the scene color to the scene, you know cold and warm etc. Why? Maybe "Nice Photo" is both a feature film and a test film for the blind people. Or maybe they thought that the drama would not be enough to make us feel lonely, so they grew blue so that we could really get it. <br /> <br /> I do not even want to comment on Clive, Indie-Oh-how-how-how-cute drawing in the presentation. And going to all the "cute" sex stuff This whole film is an independent clich√©. But I recommend it. I laugh a few times more. Although it is really annoying to be a film student and see how this strap gets through the machine.
