DD movies were a lot of crazy, stupid figurines and a plot that seemed to be slim, but at that time they were at least <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is not just a comedy But Meloduma, romance everything! <br/> <br /> The view of every play has emerged out of proportion. <br /> <br /> The comedy is funny, but the film still gives you some entertainment, while Govinda films are keenly interested. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, love chopper typing power is ridiculous
