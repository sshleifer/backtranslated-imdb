This photo was late at night when I saw it. It was interesting at the beginning but it did not fully satisfy me. I'm not a Tyson fan. Actually I do not like boxing at all. It's gullible, obscene and doubly confronted (by society) who gets money to kill each other. <br /> <br /> Still, I think the movie starts well. The actor is fine, especially George C Scott (as Cass d'Amato). I do not know how flick is reliable. I did not read books or books about boxing or tyson. I do not know anything about people, but it was quite entertaining. <br /> <br /> When I was in the movie, I felt a loss in its absence and I also lost interest. I was able to stay awake though but the last hour was not good enough.
