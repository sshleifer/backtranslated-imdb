If you read the original novel, as I did, you probably hate this thing. <br /> <br /> _ The movie version of Absolute Begone's was a nightly organization of 1980 trying to create a set of "piece of pieces" in the late 1950s and failed to renew or even pay tribute to that time - US The dancer power of DNS_9_9 is similar to that of 1963, apart from writing rich amateur screens, the film has been financially successful. In addition to being victimized by "looking for the 1980s", the characters have been modified, reorganized, and mistreated with novels that have their same characteristics as the simplest look, and of course: the name of the Shuja narrator transforms from the form of ex-girlfriend and diverse negrophil, who volunteers Undoubtedly marries the old queen (the first few pages à¦¼ own admission), a vain and naive "Eve" and the glamor, and anyway exploited by his boss in a Sham marriage scammed, who is surprisingly offered a van Dyke and hairstyle is not the point. He and the narrator, renamed "Colin" (for the film's author, Colin McKinnes) for the film. It also includes a relationship. <br /> <br /> The Big Jill's character, a lesbian seemingly distraught, is "young and bubbly-head mobile laborers working in the mid-20s, and one of the closest friends of a narrator, who provides authentic knowledge to the narrator, only Some numbers decrease as "extra name". Throw lines, and tons of comedies. <br /> <br /> In the film, a gay man and a close friend of the novel, Fableus Hoplite, has been reduced continuously in the film. , Up camp and all ignored The father of the novel's narrator is a tragic little character, but in the movie, he plays with hopeful and strange enthusiasm surrounding the shameless neighborhoods, and separates his marriage with the narrator's mother, seems to have been omitted for all practical purposes. <br /> <br /> The music (for this) is well written and inspired to write you a book, writing a line of the book ("... for a while, they write about music in the 1950s ...") To provide credit credit. In a musical, but bad camp up music world, this bunch is executed the most ruthlessly. In contrast to critical plot elements like _Shock Treatment_ or _Starstruck_ are treated. In contrast to __ Apple_, there is a sticky and uneven flow between musical numbers and conversation conversations. <br /> <br /> You can not really blame "the 1980s" because it was created in the 1980's. The film version released in 1981, nineteen-yearly execution of New York City's nicely executed execution of the appearance and feel of New York City and _Napoli Dynamite_ leads to a great appearance and feeling in the 1980s decade. Low budget in 2003 (although it was not explicitly set in the 1980s, but those who live in the decades can not deny the film "feel like the 1980s"). Obviously, it is possible to do something potentially, especially the source of the icon in the UK, but it failed to appear visually and visually, and failed in the treatment of its source content. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you can not read novels and have no desire to read, you can enjoy the shameful parody of Soho London's modernist jazz set in the late 1980s. I can clearly see how the writing team was trying, but they could work better. With the name of a family of the UK age of 1986 and boy-race musician and with the band of charts, they obviously did not have to _not_ bold the characters in their ending way. In fact, as far as I can say that the authors were criticizing both books and movies - it ended that a group of adults torn off the shit and made a quick bucks off two-bit stupid like the intended teen-age audience.
