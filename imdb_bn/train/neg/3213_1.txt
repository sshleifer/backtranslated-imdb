Well, I can honestly say that for the first time I saw a movie in which there was no literal meat or potato. The entire movie is felt that it is only salad without any original course The story line was frustrating and ridiculous, the characters were one-dimensional, the reality came out of the window and the animation was done by four years of age. Does that cover it? I have felt more embarrassed for an idea in my whole life. I have never read a comic with this character or seen other programs, but I am not far from the basis of my observation from the look of another reviewer. <br /> <br /> To start, the story has gone very fast. This character and circumstances require someone to create more, to find solutions instead of finding new ones. I saw another animation (if you can call it an enema) that works great with their characters because they take time for their development. There was nothing set for Lady Death. In a few brief scenes, we saw his train with the Crimea and soon became this fierce foe of hell. It was difficult to swallow me a few minutes before being known as this weak and weak woman controlled by my dad. Suddenly, he is submerged with hatred and can fight with an existence for millions of years. This was stupid. The presentation of Lady Death was poor, at least say. I thought that instead of a bad woman she was no more than an animated character rather than a violent woman. For me, it did not work. While training with the Crimea, he suddenly had more than eyeballs for the large number of radioactive boys with fat growing in his chest. Oh, I'm sick of seeing him. The same goes for the character of Cremator. Who was this random person? The explanation they gave was not enough, and instead I was more extravagant leftist than actual development. It's a tragic day in Helaly, when we show characters more violence and actions, especially in an animated feature. <br /> <br /> Lucifer himself was later. Tell me that I think I can fight with the King of Hell and can survive. He was weak, his voice was ridiculous, and he did not represent the picture in my mind. Disney was in control and wanted to do half-PC. Lucifer embodies that he lacks darkness and contaminated nature. He was not the ruler of Helal, but a realistic person who had a great place to live. Talking about living or dying, how can you die in hell again? That was an idea that definitely needed more explanation. Most letters express concern about death, even when they did not consider the option that they were already dead. That is how they went to hell. I think this is the level of thinking that destroyed the film for me. I did not think that your soul was still in the strong body of Hell, but could it be mine ?? Or perhaps there was no development in this story because it was. Nothing was created, just preparation. <br /> <br /> The war ranges were violently bad. This cartoon animation was felt that it was created in the early 90's. Nothing about that way to paint this picture was not impressive. Why are we, America, behind the animation? It's huge in Asia, and it's landed here because we're making films like Lady Death that do not challenge or use any part of the imagination. We are cheap, and this picture shows up. <br /> <br /> Overall, this picture was bad. The animations combined with the horrific voice work were cheap. I was somewhat like this that produced this movie for a long time, which is hard to understand, because I think I could have made this movie on my credit card. Production was horrendous as well as the story. Nothing develops, almost everyone has fallen, leaving huge hazardous plots. Character power was missing, and nothing is explained. I have wasted my time with this time and want to warn others, so that when the time of death comes, you do not find yourself in my position and you apologize about the loss of this junk for 80 minutes. <br /> <br />! <br /> <br /> Grade: * ***** Outside
