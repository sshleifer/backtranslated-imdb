Do not see this Shahrukh for a film. I've lost this time and money and I'm very good about it ** ** Close <br /> <br /> Comparison with the acting high school drama. The script is frustrating. There is no plot. At last twenty minutes (which I believe should be rewarded for reaching me) was my headache, crying and crying to five daughters. Most violence (rarely a movie nowadays) is recommended instead of graphical filming but I have seen letters so violent that I wanted to see them, and in fact, every single person involved in the preparation of this piece died in the most horrible way. . <br /> <br /> I spend more than 10 minutes of my life, from your very little 100 minutes of poor. Do not do it.
