I think if you prefer endless dialogue, which does not give the story and glowing camera effects as the transformation of the scene at the television show _ Angel_, you will enjoy this movie. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it was not. Pensing was virtually retreat, plot points were buried under the sea of ​​uninterrupted dialogue, and there was absolutely no fear, or tension, or nothing else. <br /> <br /> Is this Redeck? Is it Wendigo? No, it's speed cameraman. It's not awesome. It does not pull or make the unit a single note until you are afraid of MTV. Like those critics before me, I have also noticed that in the end, the film produces ridiculous smiles from the audience. <br /> <br /> terrible movie.
