There is not much good thing to say about Underneath about Soderbug's untrue effort in the silence. Soderbergh Robert Siodommak's Moderately Noor Criss-Cross revisited, the plot does not change much, but the adaptation drains every ounce of silent environments in its miraculous film, and sets it in the same story. At least interesting places, lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who later created extraordinary criminal films such as Out of Sight and the Ocean series, with great style and atmosphere, dangerously ruined the route of modernization in the early 1990s, with the most brilliant, dust and hugely fashionable rehearsals, Nightclubs have created terrible, rebellious garage bands, Peter Greigher's stimulating version of Bert Lancaster's anti-hero heroes has bought cinematic lifeless modern equipment to sell pieces of stereos, TVs and other up-to-date fragments by his Girl Fatal Girlfriend.

Unfortunately, there is no one of these things below. A fine director, Soderberg, did not use dry isolation for the benefit of his film. The narrative that was mentioned earlier in the photograph of George Clowne, or works like a traffic crime or sex, lies and videotape while protecting an crime movie with more tongue in his cheeks like a social or character drama. With a movie like Underneath, it's annoying bitter experience by the visitors.
