Awful a different look. Stunning differences between American and Russian films are interesting But this movie was not exactly that good from my American perspective. The playwright Antaraci Hill's maiden was not a beautiful character and it was time to introduce myself to her. He is mostly disrespectful and confused for some time left. A lot of time was spent to bring him to the film's main position. Then pass a long time before creating a real suspension. Once that happened it was more annoying than anything else which was used as the main effect of the volume. Most of the direct-to-video movies were original and they did not use sex for thin plot. All I'd recommend it for rent, but not for theater goers.
