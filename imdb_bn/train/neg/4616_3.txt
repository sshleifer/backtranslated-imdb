This movie is not well-matched. Perhaps it's just the dominant and impressive characterization, acting and directing what we have shown with The Spranyon, but I only saw Prize's respect for the DVD for the first time. The experience of viewing <br/> <br/> 24 years ago it was quite different with the audience, but I must say, to the end I was just surprised. Not only its violence, the only idea is that it will end in a satisfactory way. <br /> <br /> I enjoy a good shock, but this character was so felt ... Also, when was this step supposed to be set? In the 1960s, they seemed to see the cars, and the World Trade Center towers (which were completed in 1973), were clearly visible in the scenes of many cities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Somehow, in the mid-1980's, this picture of the audience seemed charming and fun. Mid-eighty, late oughts meet: only you can live.
