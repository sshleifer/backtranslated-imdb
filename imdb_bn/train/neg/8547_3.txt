It was a fairly vague movie; I found the music to be effective for this. The village of Mario was also ineligible. However, I had three problems with this photo. One that was too dark to light so it was difficult to say what was going on in some time, but this could be my copy. The second is not very well explained at the very beginning and I am not sure what was still there. The third problem I did not understand at the end, but apparently some people did this. Of course, the stupid things are the normal problems of humans, and the male lead is very 70s. All in all, watchable but not even close to be a favorite.
