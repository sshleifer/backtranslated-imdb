30 seconds into opening credits, I had the feeling that it's going to be a bad movie, but I just do not know how bad it is. Then the actor playing bad Nazi scientist his face and my friend and I would like to make this movie live, we will turn down the volume, make up our own dialogue and double the DVD speed. But that does not help. Almost half the way we turned it off. Now, I used to live with "Mystery Science Theater 3000" and "Sawengli" assistant and before both of them were very bad films, but there are some movies that I suspect can also save bots. The biggest part of the film that bother me most is that people believe that the jumbies are rolling on the green skin. I guess their deaths were hypnotized in death, then hypnotized themselves in rolling. In the original B-movie class classics such as "Plan nine out of space"
