I just returned from "El Otro" to play in Buenos Aires and I said I was very frustrated. The film is running very slow (do not make me wrong, I'll enjoy moving movies gradually!), You're slow at crazy speed. All you hear is Julio Chavez breathing loud throughout the entire film. It is a weakened film, but more importantly, it is a film without a letting of inspiration, I felt nothing for the story or its characters. <br /> <br /> "El Otro" was only requested for a film made ... forget it. If you want to see the best Argentine film, look up the movie by Sorin, you will advise to pass this one.
