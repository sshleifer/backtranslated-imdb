I gave 1 in this picture. I do not understand how Italian filmmaker Itator Scola created such a movie, so stupid and ridiculous! All the stories related to the film are unrestrained, annoying and not attractive. Very long, very annoying. What I am saving in this movie is Ziancarlo Zaynani and Vitorio Gasman. Hopefully Scholar will change the theme and style in its next movie.
