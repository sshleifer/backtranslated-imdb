The first two films of the series (for example the Ammunition War was last used), not only using the footage of the track footage, but also from Trader Horn, it is one of the weakest movies in the MGM series. This is a huge success after the classic Tarzan and his Matt, which is probably the best movie in the series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is coming to Jungle by Jane's cousin and will tell him that if he gets a fortune he will return to demand it. They are bound by relatives who leave their money away from him. Keeps a white white hunter who secretly wants to catch Tarzan and sell him, this pair goes into the jungle where they are naturally jungle problem (stock footage more so). After many conversations, Jane Jane decided to return to the civilization and we made long live Tarzan and James kiss face. Eventually the plot is going to catch Tarzan in the last half an hour, and till the end things are getting interesting because the plans become horrifying and everything seems very fatal for all concerned. <br /> <br /> Painful production of a painless film is a boring production. It seems that the film is running almost the same repeat of most of the first films from the first half hour of the previous movie. In the middle, the third thing extends and shows the signs of the final lines as they did not go anywhere. The last third where Tarzan was caught and the party was put in danger, the film finally came to life (it also shows signs of graphic violence which creates many requirements for redrawing the film). This is a wonderful thing to me about how the series can go on since the film is not very good (excluding series). I had to stress that it was a relationship between him and Osmu Sulv√°n Tarzan and Jane, who had kept the people to come back. It's a beautifully played pair and really one of the great couples in the screen. <br /> <br /> (I should probably mention that at that moment the image became more fantastical with the appearance of less practical and more fresh trees.) I really dislike this film the first hour or more and it's time and Find out the great power of energy. If you come to the end then I will try to give the film. Otherwise, I would only skip the whole movie and go to the next movie of the series.
