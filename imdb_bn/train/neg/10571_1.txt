My wife is a fanatic as respected in this show. In that case I was buying one of his seasons and four-season order. I personally think the show casts a big fuss equally bad. Alice Milano should be poisoned like Ivy stuck in other trash films she made, Vampire hugs for some naming, other female supporting cast members are equally equal in their imagery. I've seen special effects on the old Republic's picture serial as seen as a child. I understand why men's leads lie for such a short period of time because I do not know whether it is their own choice or not. Please Enough enough, please do not renew for other season as Bob
