Why can not I remember for my life - I had a free ticket or something - but during the liberation war I saw this movie in the theater. I went with that, I do not remember which theater, or even in any city. I remember how much I was dissatisfied with this film, I had the courage to call a movie, and half of the movie went ahead before the end of the movie. Unfortunately I finally trapped it, which is still considered as one of the worst mistakes in my life. When my crime came out of the back of a sign on the back of a credible credit card, it became very scary and said "Look at the problem baby 2, coming soon!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Receiving a "problem child". Maybe they think they can reform it, or something. I really do not know. If they had the intention, they sadly failed because this child is the greatest, worst, most horrible monster-spawn to hit the big screen from the first frame to the end. Forget the Damian, forget about Rosemary Baby. This kid takes a cake. The only difference is, we're sorry for her because she's a "problem child". However, perhaps the most disrespectful character this child could possibly have is probably impossible. You want to kill him with the whole film, and when (SPOILER, some of someone or someone of some of you, some of someone, some of the others) suddenly hate (like I saw it like a few people in the theater). <br /> <br /> This is the second movie "IMDB" given "1". The other was Superman IV, and I could not tell you to God who was bad. John Ritter gave a quote in the TV Guide that the problem was 3 children, which he was not, it came out. She said something like, "I'm dragged to perform a second [problem child] signage the only way if they perform my dead body back." Amen! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, 1/10, only because I can not give it a negative score, which it really deserves. Please burn someone original of this film, please!
