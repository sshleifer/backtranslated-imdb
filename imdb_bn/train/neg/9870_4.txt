I had many problems with the film: <br /> (1) Screenplay - In particular, Kim Basing Voice: Movies is not a book; They should show * what action is being done on a voice over what * is happening to us. Occasionally I have found a voice that works, but here's a lazy way of writing scripts. He was really looking at me as if he was reading a few quotes from the novel in his voice. <br /> <br /> (2) I did not feel any passion between Jesse and Brother Thomas, and Alex also believed Carter's performance was quite bad. It is an impossible failure for me to define the characters of Jesse and Thomas - there is no connection between them, it seems as if they just wanted a studio and for that it was a matter of being sexually deprived. If it is done properly, the relationship between them will provide more relevance to the story. <br /> <br /> (3) I have realized Jesse's mid-life crisis with the book. In the movie, it just seemed more like a normal background. <br /> <br /> Plus, the movie was not so bad to turn off the TV. . . Even though that thought happened to me.
