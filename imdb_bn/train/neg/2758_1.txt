I am giving this movie 1 because there is no negative number of IMDB ratings system. This movie was awesome. It was played very badly, the story was badly written, the action was incredible. I suspect that volunteer army can fight weakly as soldiers in this movie. I do not even write a plot spoiler because the film is not good enough for plot spoilers. Plot comments will be timeless to write. If I want to compare this movie, then I have to compare it with the Fire of Rhine, though I do not like the Fire of Rhine, but this film was better than this at least. <br /> <br /> Some people in the movie did half the movie before I was not the only reason because I just did not think I could do it. I had hoped for a festival and masterfully working CGI, but that did not happen. Martial arts were lasting 30 seconds and it was very frustrating from an exercise routine during the flashback scene. CGI is not working well. One comes to mind the scene. During the previous tank war, the soldiers were shooting at any direction? Some people forgot to bite the animation boy of that bit film, so there was a lack of bad boys on the road. I think the voice of bad people is dumped from the mummy movie to the voice of emotions. That was the echo of the same thing happening in the same scraggly. (Someone gave some royalty here?) Since I mentioned the war scene, I would say that it can be considered a mockery, but only purists I think. <br /> <br /> Do not watch it, do not buy DVDs when it comes. You have been warned.
