I loved musical instruments but as a Dickens fan I hate this one. ** MILLION SPIRIT ** Forget boys who have enough power to sing and dance in the workhouse? London's poor singing? Phagin and dosage walking in the sunset? Not exactly faithful from the novel. I think the dosage was hanged public and Fagin became crazy in jail. ** Spinners end ** <br /> <br /> Oliver is very weak like Reed Saiks, a little more than hungry to point out his evil. But worst, Mark Lester, like Oliver, who often comes across such a weird and passive, if he really thinks of the main character. Her screenplay does not help in any way that she can sing when she can sing the girl's voice. They do not think the boys' troubles were found in almost every church in England. Fans of confident Dickens: The amazing 1948 movie by David Lynn or the 6-hour adaptation of the BBC-80's. Avoid this bloated whitewash in a musical instrument.
