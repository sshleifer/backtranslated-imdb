In the 1960s and 70s I have seen this movie completely, yes it is great, and the popular "Fas of Death" series in the 80's and 90's could be a successive generation. Considering the so-called "driver education" status these days, it should be necessary to look for everyone ready to learn the drive. When you see violent deaths in all sorts of horror and horror, definitely (if you have any sensitivity) get a realistic view of the responsibilities needed to run safely, wheezing can take a moment of anxiety or immorality. I worked for Bell Telefon in the 70's and 80's, and at one point was allocated for managing a security class. I found this library in the library, showed in the session, most people have become physically ill and have left the house! Incredibly, most of them later said, "I never knew that the car accident could be so awesome!" This film, and the other, "Red Asphalt", is certainly the reality in its most graphic form. I will never forget it, I found a copy when my children joined the "Driver's Ed" in high school!
