Kevin Spacy is very talented, but unfortunately guidance is not his fault. Before I rented it, I had high expectations about the film and probably because I did not like it. I appreciate Spacey's efforts to create a movie that is mostly done in a small setting, but it is not an effort that counts. I found the film dull, annoying, and stretched. Acting was not something spectacular. Gary Cine did a lot of good, especially since she is aware of her other films. Skit Ulrich was frustrating, but it was one of his first films (I got this scraps star young and merely got a kick out). The only thing that affected me about this image was a car break from above. The central lines of the road were perfectly central and the camera moved along the line and past the debris. However, the shot that was "general suspect" ish and my guess is that Spesy got the idea of ​​his previous movie (which is very good in your mind). If you want to see such a great movie in a small setting, see Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Maybe Spacy should have seen it before filming this.
