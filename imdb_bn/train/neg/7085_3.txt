I really tried to like this movie. It works in an important problem in a society: sexual abuse. <br /> <br /> In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you are sexually harassed. In this case, our main character and hero, because of all kinds of women (crazy, strange, neurotic) non-stop sex, makes her marriage, jobs and even her life at risk. <br /> <br /> production quality is terrible; Mainly played. Oh, you will not enjoy sex scenes, most of them are very poorly flavored and you may think you are looking at a home made flickr. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the plot is only sensory. How beautiful and beautiful wife can all the nasty stuff from husband stand? How can he believe in him? The trio situation is worthless and you will be chocolate for a while. <br /> <br /> Also, the black cinema theater care scene is just pointing to you and "WTF?" Let's think. <br /> <br /> You will find plenty of views like them. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Please ignore it; It's not a soft core, it's not documented, it's not a dramatic feature. This is a so-called documentary director of a tyrannical effort or whatever. <br /> <br /> Only Mrs. Kinsky's legs are worth watching. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad it does not spend my money. But 90 minutes of my life will not return.
