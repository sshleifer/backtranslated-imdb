I was probably not the biggest Blair Witch fan but praised the effort, so I was waiting to change, especially after reading the public spreading on various IMDB comments. "Unique", "Intelligent", "Classic to the Future," and much more ... You will be amazed at the stuff that people bring for such poor effort. <br /> <br /> Because, yes, a poor, weak movie that is changed and fails to engage in any respect. Silliness is not funny. Awesome and the hole is not awesome. And whatever the "thought" aspect, some poor fellows seen in this film were due to serious confusion because there is no deep or smart about this mess. <br /> <br /> Well, we do not know anything. Is it at least bearable? Experience in any way? Unfortunately not. At the beginning, get very poor acting. Most B-movies are not a stretch as these better performance features these days. The volume? Boring and dirty The dialog? Many amateurs actually work well. <br /> <br /> Puzzle instructions that really are it. I did expect a big improvement on Blair Witch but at least small steps were not forward. Instead, our director seems to have been bad over time, completely unaware of the old experience. <br /> <br /> If this is a big error, then it is the main set. A major part of the plot is single, where the main characters are limited, but Sanchez failed to give any personality to any person. Blair Witch thinks, if the forest is a major part of the three students and a character (a competitor, if you like), you think the director will feel the need to understand the same thing. But not ... There is no personality in this place, thanks to the gentle direction and not paying attention to details. <br /> <br /> There are no archives here. "Blair Witch" died hard fans, followed by Daniel Michrick. Although his output is far from being golden, it looks better than Sanchez and some text is applied to Blair Witch (unfortunately, but still in weak tales).
