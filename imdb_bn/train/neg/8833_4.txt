Without acting at all without acting (they all played great role), the overall story did not work very well. The film opens with a great zinger: A crazy old man forces a young Aborigin girl's car out of the street. But then, we are forced to bear the full 40-minute character development of the new group of characters ... and we do not know why up to 40 minutes. It shows that they are the girl who eventually discovers her body ... and goes ahead of the story <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> The story was finally dissatisfied and felt inappropriate. Although it is played well, there is no strong strong backbone in the film to recommend it.
