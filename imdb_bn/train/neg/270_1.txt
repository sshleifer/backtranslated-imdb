I am now watching it at the Pink (Serbia TV station) and I would say this is a crap. Salah, no acting, very vicious effect, I mean, who made this series? <br /> <br /> The studio had a stupid endeavor to make more money for this movie's success. OK. It came in 1994 when the picture was great. But the series? <br /> <br /> A few times you can see the stupid line of letters lectures. I mean, did they really pay someone to write, some of the studio was relatable? This is not any SciFi. <br /> <br /> The film was bombs, suck the series.
