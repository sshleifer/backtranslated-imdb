This is Peter Falk's film. Duration <br /> <br /> I was 10 years old when I came out of this picture; I already had a film posthumously during the time. Of course, my parents or I saw this film out on time, but I love the typeface and the music of its advertisements that it was an important film. Well, after 34 years I finally saw this movie - I've never seen a cassette-operated movie before. He is a hack as a whole. Time Zero Sense, Editing. Gena's performance reminds me of "Rain Man" in Dustin Hoffman most of the time: Technically, but fully-a-note in the parameter. Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man", the Falc took the cake for this photo. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed with Gena's performance, indeed - it was perfect for "Awakenings" (blecch!). It's not his fault at all: he ended up in a basket case from the first scene. Why do we find out ?? But fakk's character seems to be real and educated as a serious man by phukk. <br /> <br /> Turn off at least one hour (an editor is needed!), and this is an arresting portrait of a woman, influential, Crowe-Magn, a man does not do things that do something that he does not work And her three children and her husband could not cope with the long hours of work. <br /> <br /> I said, instead remember the casites for "Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary Baby". He was a good director, he snatched extra trends for himself - as he did perfectly with this film. <br /> <br /> Bob
