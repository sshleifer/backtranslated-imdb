Belmondo is a tough police. He is a big drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, usually a great villain - see "Sharky Machine"; but here he is clearly dubbed and due to his lack of normal karimma). He went to the glittering places of Paris and Marseilles, asked some names, pushed some people, got names, went to more scary places, wanted more names, beat more people etc. Pushing the whole movie after the punch was a punch. After the punch. It seems that the French did not have any ambition than to create "the Diamond Harry" to create it. Belmondo plays some good stunt at the beginning of the age of 50; In addition to them, "Le Mergeal" is a violent, epic, triangle, shallow and forgotten police film. (* 1/2)
