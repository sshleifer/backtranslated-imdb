The sun should be placed forever in this movie. <br /> <br /> This is forever (which is not usually a bad thing - English Patient, Shindler's List) but very annoying. Actors age is increasingly unbelievable and so is a never-ending out-of-the-line story that does not seem to really go anywhere. <br /> <br /> In short, the talent and film waste.
