It seems to me that this movie has got RAW from Hollywood because sometimes it's a popular competition in Hollywood. When you think that people who love this movie can only respond to countless songs over the story. Yet, these pictures are overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy just looks ridiculous. Jennifer Hodson and Baines Nolls did not offer ratings of Oscars in any way, even before the film ended even more. I can not believe that Conon is set up to be nominated for a directory oscar when he combined the album he did. Glitz is not a few storylines replacing. A bunch of songs is not a movie.
