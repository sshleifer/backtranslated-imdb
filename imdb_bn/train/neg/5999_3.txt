I always thought that the biggest box-office flops are usually something to recommend them, but after 80 days and in the Thunderbirds around the world, I started to doubt. For those who are not known, this is a puppet show in the family of the astronauts, which is used every week (falling bridge, fire-fighting buildings, etc.) to rescue art rockets, spaceships and people of various disasters. Well, the doll has gone (replaced by a much more useless young man), and that is the court - only one strangely rescued, and a plagiarized hijack from spy kids without any signs of imagination, intelligence or entertainment. Young Allan Tracy looks to be saved from all the rescuers, we do not see another trace because parents do not let him play with a real rocket until he passes his exam. Grounded on a beautiful tropical island (some punishments!), When its appearance comes from the rest of the family - identifit a bunch of bleach-blondes who look like a gay neo-Nazi boy band without a single characteristic in them - are trapped in space During the day, around the jungle, making a phone call, shooting a hose in disagreeable comedy relief villains and after bad Keep them low in the gaps for the rig. <br /> <br /> Good points are few and far between. One of them is that the film is mostly focused. Everyone else was going to Seychelles, which looks beautiful. <br /> <br /> bad point: Where to start? Ben Tennessee's career lowpoint performance? Uploaded Comedy Relief Sidekicks who will humiliate Children's Film Foundation in the worst case? A total lack of action or effect in about 70 million science-fi-film? Horror scripts, lifeless aspects, stupid morality? But most of the fact that this film is potentially patronizing. Forget the feelings of life lessons and friends, it's a film that directly targets the under-eit, who knows that they are making a movie and always talking to their intended audience, throwing them into fifth-rate jokes and routines, recently mastered the lecture industry Those who most of the children will insult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is only summer In the case of not making the object, the object is only visible to the reader.
