When I saw that Mary Luiz Parker was involved in this epic novel, I was curious. Being a fan of the book, I think he played Tony, Rose, or Chorus, but much more, I want to see this title how he will turn this head-wie, almost a psychoanalyst (but not a mental thriller) Those who can not read novels will be accessible to them, and those who are at least satisfied with them. This book is a complex reflection of society, women and modern life, and I want to see how they used 3 different stories which reveal the story in a movie. <br /> <br /> The biggest mistake and confusing problem is: Why would an Oxygen advertised for women accept an excellent book about such complex, wonderful and horrible women? There is no real purpose to be involved in the story, and maybe some fools from 3 women can change the former police? It seems that anyone who adapted it found that it was easy to ask the person directly to ask for Resina, Tony and Choris, and by doing so, they reached most of the book. In this way, they ruined the story and cut out something amazing about the characters in it, and the audiences were not credible to distinguish them from each other. In the film, these women are not human, they are characters. <br /> <br /> Janea has fabricated her death in the book, but the book mentions it to be completed, even though the film has 30-45 minutes to focus on doing this last running around the police and doing nothing. They tried to try this complex book for an episode of law and order or CSI. <br /> <br /> It shows that Mary Luiz played Parker's geenna, which was so wrong. Genea Catherine, Jeta-Jones, Angelina Jolie, or even Scarlett Johnson. She can not worship a woman, and a woman who is curious and threatened with women, but "keep your enemies closer". And once he gets closer, he feels completely truthful and credible, despite your good judgment. She is like a woman who lost, she won: She is always beautiful, still rich, and there are still people who do not know her game. <br /> <br />, Genea did not accept the man of the person (blonde American draft dodder who first used chorus ...) but instead took it in August and tried to become her legal guardian (and apparently as her legion boyfriend Comes back as a linking) Kiss at the coffee shop means kisses). Before the arrival of August, Jenna had killed chickens, but it did not have any idea because all of its build was removed. It was such that anyone who wrote scrapple was spread to satisfy us for reading the book book, but I think I did not read the book, I would have misled the whole film, if I was bothered to stop it with it <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Rane's husband died and Jenna came to the film (which was strange after taking the Rose business and home life in the book Zenia, so Rajan was so scared of him And used to conspiracy to kill him and Joanna a few years ago and the husband of Rosh! And for the photo of Tony and West, they were dating forever ... Even at the party where the book of Geneya and West (black) had blackened the entire place and they totally felt it like Tony (and evil, wicked) and it is always popular for everyone. By the person was honored by Tony's character in this movie was so wrong ... he felt a little charming and like a mastermind behind any conspirator, he is opposing a serious, gently cooperative teacher like this book. The film is basically described, the women of smart women are evil, beautiful women are evil, powerful women are evil, and women who teach yoga break their rockets. <br /> <br /> They originally tried to make it so that Jeanne is essentially not as horrible as the book, and in the end, three women, this former police (who has certainly completed this research process, and has a relationship with them, To say the end). To hide the body of Zenner Barbados or something ridiculous that he knew) (which they spread out during the hotel, but the film meant that three women pushed him on one block, or they planned together to do this ...) and then Genio In this process, Rose could take all the money. At the end of the film I had only half of the attention in advertising B / C, it went so far apart as to what it could be and what should be. <br /> <br /> If you are not confused about this film, then you might like it, because I read the book and saw the movie, and I'm ridiculously confused from the movie alone. It was very terrible. The book that I extracted from the book is quite effective, but if you are going to do this work, then we should start by defining why the book is unnecessary, instead of creating our perfect character, we are Alice in the Workland. <br /> <br /> Is there no Fluffery book that can produce at least half the decent TV movie or oxygen?
