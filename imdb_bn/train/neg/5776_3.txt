Bad acting, bad sound accent, inconsistent cinematography, horror script ... <br /> <br /> I was waiting for this movie at the recent festival festival and it was very discouraged. It contains the quote / unquote name talent, but they are not provided. Of course, this is based on dishonest and unintended stories. <br /> <br /> Do not get bored
