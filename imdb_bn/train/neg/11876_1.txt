I think it's almost all necessary to say this. I feel compelled to explain my actions though. I basically have not seen such a surgical production, and I mean in all sense of the word. Although physical camera work, MIC operations and other technical aspects of this movie are awkward to wake up, unfortunately it is not the only area. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some classic independent films that have been preserved by their scripts, great characterization and plot are, inevitably, a terrible scripts, horror performance and the worst, terrible annoying characters. <br /> <br /> This is a crime that 101 other Indie films have died for silent death due to the distribution of haiku tunnels for every independent movie. I do not know who the Koranblut brothers knew in Soni, but this amateur family can never be produced as my only explanation. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I hope this review will save some people who might be interested to see the title of this movie. I saw many movies in my time, and when I was very sorry for the movie, but it was too much. To identify an important aspect of my experience in the film, I will never forget the 'tunnel'. There are so few points involved <br /> <br />
