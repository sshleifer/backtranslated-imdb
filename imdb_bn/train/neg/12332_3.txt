The film looks super on paper. A romantic trick which dragged into a runner thriller of a terrible lover generational cross breeding gold, especially with this excellent romantic cast. <br /> <br /> I fear Laurence Kasdan easily gives her two big lots of ropes and even though they go properly and hold themselves. The Adam Brooks script may be blamed, but you would expect better from a fish welfare winner Kevin Kline. Instead of closing off each other, two ping-pong and unlikely growing romance are ever between them and are not reconciled satisfactorily due to dashing around France. <br /> <br /> Genie Reno co-stars copious with cop-with one heart and I guess she was a star with a star. Remember he was going to make that Pink Panther remake (s!) So maybe he was right with her ... 3/10
