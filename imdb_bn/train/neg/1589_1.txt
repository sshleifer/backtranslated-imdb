It is unbelievable that a script can clich√© and completely unreasonable to make any screen even smaller one. The dialogue in this movie seems like a high culture classic in Catwoman. Billy Jane, playing bad ass Harmonica, Elvis's incognito, gunman, martial arts master who gambled the life of a former football player, gambled by NBC's Crackstick Show "Next Action Star" winner. Its performance is cold as ice and not in a cool way. "Film" is held in Vegas, and in the people's poker game, the author feels that it is a perfect setting for a film that is trying to survive 24 hours against a universal, rich gambler, who aims to make it through $ 2.4 million a day. And so Hunt ensues. A victim seeking unexpected explosions, construction-playing settings, lazy cinematography, and one-fishing device that contains "bits" or "gambling" words. Women's winners are also tossed into the mix, but for some reason I have no idea. Oh but do not worry "NASA" sufferers damaged as well as their memorable Cayos. If you like predictability or robbery, the wonderful ending will stop your socks. Joel Silver should reconsider its decision to sell more. I hope he can give me two hours of my life.
