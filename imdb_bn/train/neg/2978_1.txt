I am a big fan of horror flicks, and zombie films are a special favorite of mine. That said, Zombi 3 is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Saying so I really enjoyed it, it's the worst bad movie I've seen in a long time. This story was consistent with Dan O'Bannon's "Living Dead of Return Dead", but that image was deliberately funny, but the opposite was. There are some of the most ridiculous acting I've ever seen, especially from the character of the main scientist. His scenes with the general were just curious. Also, the impact is subpar and in many cases vicious, and the view of death is often stupid stupid. This, of course, makes it all the more fun. Possible Spirir - The worst scenario where the guy opens the fridge door and shows the thistle jamby's head, which opens his eyes and in no way frames it out of the refrigerator (explicitly pulling it with the help of a string), boys neck, kill him. Zombie head now has the ability to float the air? It defies every law of human physics, and it is one of the most foolish things ever filmed. That's just one of the many idiocy moments of idiotic mess. I can not believe it's earned so high rating here If you are a fan of bad movies, please kindly and rent this sucker.
