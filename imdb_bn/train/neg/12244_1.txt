This picture is awful. CGI is CGI of the very cheap gray blog. Crocodile looks like a massive gray smudge. The worst is that it is allowed to walk it for any effort or to see it like living. It is mostly the SGI of the photo shop which is set in view and you want to see the arm that you see around the whole screen on the CGI Smugzi. This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects I've ever seen, and I saw very bad cyai-fi-channel movies. <br /> <br /> In addition to the terrible lack of special effects, Cast is usually made of low-cost actors working as a waiter / waitress in local dinners while waiting for their short break. Perhaps the most ridiculous scenario in this movie when bad boys are subjected to sexual harassment, Kate and the monster crocodile villains come out directly from the water on the second floor of the headquarters and drag the bad guys through the balcony. Instead of crashes directly through kettles and building (and kate crushing), the crochet floats in the same corner of the water. Physics can apply any laws of this movie or special effects. There is least respect in crocodile.
