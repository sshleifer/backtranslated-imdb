Nice bad movie offers nothing new General creaks and moans try to make up for a muddled, but slim story. The acting is strictly unfortunate. Why Liam Neeson signed this for someone's guess. Oven Wilson has turned into one of the worst performances in the history of the most recent horror-film history. Catherine Zeta Jones is not very fun watching, though Lily Tire has done an average job. Special effects were fairly memorable and the house itself was exciting and hauntingly fantastic. But they can not makeup for poor performance and storyline which seems to have been gathered at the last moment. Do not disturb.
