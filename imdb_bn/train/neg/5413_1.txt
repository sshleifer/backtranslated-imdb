Indi Kumar again came back again with comedy Pierre Mohan based on the Hollywood film Save No Evil, Here no No Evil. <br /> <br /> This image gives you the status of Hum Hi Kamal K (1994) Reminds. <br /> <br /> <br /> This picture is a strange exercise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And some scenes are not like funny sorrow. Lastly, this half story does not go on, even comedy becomes boring. The twist is well managed and the second half becomes an action film where blind man and deaf heroines can be retrieved and all our OTT watch shows and battle scenes <br /> <br /> Indoor Kumar's direction is bad, music is okay, one song Standing I love you my Angel <br /> <br /> <br /> In the comic scene, its time is very bad and it is okay in a serious scene. For some reason, he's doing a comedy and has ruined his career. Fardeen Khan is better, but very tough. Among the others, Isha and Amrita Hirovis bombs are bored here. Snehal Dabbi all right
