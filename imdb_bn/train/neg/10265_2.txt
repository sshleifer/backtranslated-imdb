Cursty Eli, a bit slimer, but looking at just a bit, like a McGuivir's face in this world, blooded hairstyles and everything. In the context of the film, the old woman (50 !!!) who can not produce her screenplay due to age discrimination, so she can send her small nephew as a writer. Not a basic idea and not a very good movie with shy acting, underlying dialogue and a ridiculous plot. There is another plot related to the writer with the crash or praise for the character of the cursor and why it is a mystery involved. The actors who portrayed Karti's brother expressed so much frustration and anger, they were tortured to see their scene. What is there to say about this film. Avoid it.
