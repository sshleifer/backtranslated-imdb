I liked the "Legend of Anchorman; Ron Burgundy" and hoped this would be as fun, but frustrated, it was not. Some bits are nice though. I thought, the car filled with other members was delighted at the news conference for his love report for sports guy, Champ Kide, Ron Bergi. Everyone is ignoring him and he only kicks up loudly loudly and eventually kisses Bergdie, which does not accept. But the whole story is not jail. But this is a great effort, but to recover the unused bits from the first movie, which will include a lot of modest plots - the local terrorists will be called "alarm clock". Saturday Night Live's Maya Rudolph is one of the members and there are some funny lines, but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie. The addition of this disc is quite good, in which the most notable part of the film is the unmistakable comments with the best two Impressive Comedy animated rehearsals and Will Ferrell and "Fake Producer". In any way, shape or form. She went into the adjoining recording studio door and turned out to be a producer who "just a guy" turns out. This is also some fantastic fun stuff and goes for about 10 or 15 minutes
