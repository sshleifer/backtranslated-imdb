I was fascinated by how bad this movie was. Was the audience supposed to learn something, or reflected something here? What was with the pumpkin? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motor shot? What is there to have some garbage bags on the roof across the hotel road? Why are people in the statement dishonored with the failure of the interview (it is so obvious that he edited the informative parts of his interview to achieve narcotics). The best part of the film was an interview with a film professor, who says how bad it will be before the movie ends. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised. I believe that God is struggling to be intellectual or trying to influence the intellectual community.
