This is the single bad movie I have ever seen. I repeat again: this is the only greatest film I ever saw. <br /> <br /> It was a bad movie all the ear marks: continuity errors, bad writing, bad acting, bad production value, bad music I thought there was a couple point in horror movie. Firstly it seems to be awesome to be awesome. This movie gets and includes in this category. The second point is that when a character dies, or something bad happens to them, we are supposed to take care. This movie also gets an F on this topic as well. <br /> <br /> The first story, fearing the lady was afraid of fear of a woman, was scared that it would be her. The next story, an OCD guy has to be careful and to speak to him with a dead friend. Oh, and then there's a bad roommate's terrific, nail-cut story. Come, can you choose a little more interesting and less homogeneous than having a home alone, having ankle-disabled and roommate? All of these stories are out where hallucinations, virtual reality is introduced by a doctor, which uses it manually. Wow, fool. <br /> <br /> I explain something, I'm glad to see bad scary movies and how bad they are. I could not do that with this one. It was pain to sit and watch the pain. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances. You will regret it.
