I believe that war films will try to express terrorism of war, avoid idealism, and respect some basic military policies. Zvezda is not the first ever. Javizada was a Russian war film, I was hoping for patriotism, feelings, beautiful poetic images, a brilliant score, slavic mustache and cruel Germanism. What I needed was the absurd, irrationally stupid battle scene of neutral love and the misuse of syrupy soundtrack in a movie which is only temporary to avoid all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazimam, Holocaust), but the last word about the "abdication of Poland" for our feeling of history. A missed opportunity as a film but definitely not as a promotion.
