This picture is actually the interpretation of Bill Mehr's religion. There are several fun moments and some interesting points, but do not even expect the discussion of this religion even handed over. I consider it the worst kind of documentary - it is edited to give you the opinion of the director rather than the decision you made and your own decision. <br /> <br /> Edit - It has been spent, pop culture clips, and interlaced to make the media more powerful. There is an opportunity to conclude only one sentence before the editor has finished the interview. The only people who give a fair chance to talk about their minds, who say what the Mahara Bihara wants them to say. Someone deviates from the Gospel according to Maher, but they are edited. <br /> <br /> Interview - They represent absolute utmost extremist religion. From the TV evangelical to the final Jewish stereotype, from a track stop chapel (severely a track stop chapel). He chose the worst money-drawer, heavy extremists, and those who did not have the budget to say no. And when he can get a good person to interview, he edits hell from them. <br /> <br /> Stereoiping - All religions are portrayed as stereotype. Especially hard-hit Muslims are. During the Muslim Segment, he gives everyone the opportunity to interact before interacting with himself or smashing with suicide bombs. Gunmen have been portrayed as extremists by performing all the Muslims, and none of the interviewees are fairly educated. <br /> <br /> Last - The message is very heavy, and it is a fun idea, it is not presented with countless people who are religious extremists who justify. When Bill Maure got leaked in front of him, he explained them. It literally gives message that religion is stupid and dangerous, and it will destroy the world. He said that every stereotype associated with religion is stupid. <br /> <br /> There are some good points about the flaws in the film, and humorous, though very wrong, is actually fun. But know, this is a unilateral viewpoint, the attitude of religions Bill Mahier's view She is not invented anything. He is what you think he is. <br /> <br /> 4/10 - heavy hands with some good moments, but highly irresponsible documentary style.
