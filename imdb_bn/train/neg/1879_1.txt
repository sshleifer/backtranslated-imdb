It is hard to believe that Henry is a sigle of flowers. Confident that both the same director and actor were involved in the movie. Henry flower is refreshing, malicious, ridiculous, the pitch is slow, annoying and does not go anywhere. Where is the intelligence gone? I'm bored. <br /> <br /> Henry was 10 years old by seeing flowers and many of his conversations and scenes are still clear in my memory. Painful to see the fae grim. There is no blame on these actors, those who are good (Parker Posy) or Gorgeous (Jeff Goldblum) - the blame is not entirely plots, dialogs and even some of the movies (no excuse for low budget). A huge disappointment. Sorry, I could not pay attention to the plot, I was very annoyed, so frustrated ... if you enjoy it, you can not enjoy the Henry flower so much ... there are two movies with each other There is nothing to do ... there is no continuity in the personality of the character ... it is a hoax to hide hackers of flower worshipers. This is <br /> <br /> <br /> Now - what kind of imprisonment is with Henry the Taliban?!?
