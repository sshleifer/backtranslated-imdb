*** Spoilers *** *** <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like this movie everyone. <br /> <br /> I made it unusually annoying and rather simply made, regardless of the importance and depth of the proposed theme: that eventually we have to die, how should we contact our life? A "light" way, like Thomas; Terza is a "heavy" way; Or if you can not find a question like Sabin find the way? How important is fidelity in a relationship? How can we distort professional life for our loved ones? How much should be involved in our political life and the social issues of our country? Unfortunately, I did not read the Kundar novel, but after releasing the film, I would definitely do: If I want to know if the movie adaptation (which is my guess) is gone, or if it was shameless from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with most positive comments, which are a masterpiece in the movie. I just do not see the reasons why. What I saw is a lot of errors, and followed a sample of them. <br /> <br /> 1) Three main characters are thrown at you and it is very difficult to understand what drives them while preparing their preferences. <br /> <br /> 2) "Secondary" characters are just for filling the gap but they do not add anything to the story and you are surprised if you really need it. <br /> <br /> 3) I like how Thomas was disguised. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he relies on others and he is mentally involved with anyone, then I do not consider this explanation to be trustworthy. <br /> <br /> 4) It is very likely that an artist like Sabina could not afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, three main characters are very successful in their respective profession, which makes me feel weird. A) How can tragedy become so beautiful photographer? B) How well do they work well in the absence of such economic stimulus which usually motivates the public to succeed? <br /> <br /> 5) The fake English pronunciation of actors is ridiculous. And I'm not even a mother tongue. Moreover, the letter Sabina received during the United States, was written in Chake, which I found very inconsistent. <br /> <br /> 6) Many comments have commented that the song has been well-translated: I think most of the film was shot dead, so it is not hard to give East European feelings to the film, and the intrinsic beauty of Prague does not look good either. . <br /> <br /> 7) I ended up sort of trivial. Treasza and Thomas, finally happy in the rural areas, far away from the temptations of the "metropolis", living with their fellow citizens away from social struggles, have been separated from their professional life, died in a car accident. But they realized that they were really happy. So what? Did they unhappy, the movie's message was different? I do not think so. I consider it a cheap comedy sort of audience please. <br /> <br /> 8) The movie has incredibly light that illustrates the path of guiding the only thing. You see them around three hours, but in the end you have left nothing with nothing. You do not feel their sympathy, you are not related to them, you have seen a sequence of events and scenes on your sockets which are very few to see. <br /> <br /> 9) I "stop music in the restaurant" scene (which comments some are admired). Why has Sabina received such a strong response? Why does Franz agree with him? I really do not see the point. The only thing you are learning is that Sabina has very bad temperament and strong personality. That's it. <br /> <br /> After all these negative comments, I think the two scenes that I liked so much (for this reason I gave it to both of them). <br /> <br /> "Naked Woman Photoshoot", where jealousy, jealousy, and uncertainty of Sabina and Terez are beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> By the Russians, Prague. Treasury pictures are used to identify the people in progress that are going on, to identify people participating in the riots. I found it quite original and disappointed of Treja's frustration and was portrayed nicely on crime. Finally, the film is deliberately designed "designed" in such a way that the "Thomas type" continues to like it and it's hated "Tereza More". If this is the case (although I doubt it strongly) but my comment should be widely revised.
