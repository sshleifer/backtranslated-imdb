** Possible Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> This straight-to-video mess combines a gun-cast heroine, grade-z effect, nose, a mummy and endless lesbian footage, and it's still annoying; The 45-minute running time of the video is only forever SEEMS. The only good part is one of the blooper outtakes, where bad guys apply 400 pounds of marijuana to the chair, and a villain's foot crumbles around a chair tail. Take this snooze back to the video store and watch golf on television, bowling or tennis.
