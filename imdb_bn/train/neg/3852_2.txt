This is one of the most annoying movies I've ever seen ?? I really do not know why ?? Just talk about the story of your people about getting married, and instead of acting to someone else. The story has been told a thousand times. There is nothing new or innovative about this. <br /> <br /> I do not know what was wrong with this picture. Most of the time, when such actors / actresses create a movie that produces a million times together, it is really entertaining. Normally another that really has a little tricky thing among them. For some reason, this one is not just keeping your attention. You can choose some interesting parts or shiny ideas but for some reason they are funny, or somehow clever? How do I want to explain it new, but I do not ?? Just do not waste your time on this one ??
