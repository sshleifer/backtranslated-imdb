I think many comments here will be fake. The film is certainly not bad at least for the average. "Dark Remains" is basically a ghost movie that hunts you with your own ghosts and bad emotions. The movie has already been discontinued with two stories that are not web-webbad separately. A couple lost her child which is found to be slashed in her bed. They went to a country house to escape their past and assumed that the house was afraid, kind of. From here the dark residues really start very slowly with some scary moments (the first Ghost appearance is beautiful and the flashlight sequence works very well). All right, then ... the girl shows the ghost of the girl, in the accident or suicide, the other ghosts die, people try to hide the past houses, women become depressed, strange neighbors appear. Most of them were there, but its own passion has its own passion, so you wait for the turning. There are no twists, you have confused me with a story of a ghostly home history, a strange neighbor, a completely timeless vague prison and the death of a dead girl together with a photo-concept, which reminds me a lot of "shutters". The last is ridiculous because when you start and finish a movie, this slow and piano music with its beautiful hair can consist of a few of the ghosts, which certainly look like a zombie flick, of course, to go slow pacing and back to the piano music. <br /> <br /> To make it short ... If the script does not go anywhere and try to reach anywhere, then the dark residue can be a wonderful ghost story. Many stories combine the senses and conflicts in a fundamental atmosphere of a movie. And beside ... please do not use the abandoned prison again. Its so tired and in this case it even makes no sense. "Hey, here's the blurry prison, shoot it out there". I suppose many elements of the dark residues are thrown into the mixture like this.
