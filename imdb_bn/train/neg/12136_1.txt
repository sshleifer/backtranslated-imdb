I saw this movie on TV. This afternoon and I can not see how anyone can sit with this piece of trash. It's not all fun and it takes your IQ. Few seconds down I know this movie for kids, but this does not mean that writers should take it for acceptance of their intelligence. I believe that the writers were sitting around a large wooden table and imagined that the word "pop" was like a big laugh. B) A four-foot-tall baby ten-pound long basketball net may be lost. C) Children should always fight against armed abductors with guns because the abductors will fall into something and d) Three months after the training, the so-called "Nigasas" will be hit with the sword. One of the best things I can say about this movie is that it is the "gang" in the world's weakest suburbs, which can not be scared of anyone. Maybe the guys at MST3K might use this movie for a good smile. Do not bother with this lame-ass excuse for a movie.
