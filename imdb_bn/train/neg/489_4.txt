Good acting, nice of the ladies, and men's handsome, so if you are looking good-looking soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. Main character motivation, especially eponymous lead, is often a mystery. He could truthfully say - True is not true historical truth - the reality presented in the film - and time was saved in prison for the rape of his boyfriend. Did he save his father, who had gone to weep half, just as he did a severely scandalous case? Did he defend himself, with the suddenness of his fame, when he already felt the art of his industry? During the trial, this convincing woman got blurred before our eyes. On the contrary, her lover, who begins as a narcissistic coroner, becomes an unselfish hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clear: He sacrificed himself for love. Naturally, since no good work should be punished, he is told that he never sees him.
