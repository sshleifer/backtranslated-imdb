With a Bo Derek movie, the audience will get exactly what they expect. A cloth slim plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek have no clothes. 'Scratch Can not Do It' Just that. The first fifteen minutes of the general TV drama, while Scott [Anthony Quinn] is alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in various roles, but even a famous actor sometimes will sometimes have to work for money. Reverse Bo Derek, playing a strikingly handsome young girl with or without clothes always. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see queen, rent Arab Lawrence or La Stra. If you want to watch naked women or bad acting, any porno movie rentals.
