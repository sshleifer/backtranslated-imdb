Awful, terrifying! Absolutely awful! No plot, no point, no end. It looks like the director launched the camera and then the whole crew went to lunch. Every day I'm trying to give this video but no one will accept it. I give it 2 instead of 1 because I like Bengoie. Roger, I would say thumbs on this one. <br /> <br />
