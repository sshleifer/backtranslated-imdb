I woke up suddenly, aware that I entered into plastic couch in Dhaka, and realized it was a warm Saturday afternoon. Why i was sleeping Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandmother muscle relaxants? Could it be adult hellfire? <br /> <br /> I did break a few seats during the channel surveying, and the stunning lack of humor and merit spoiled my life with the speed that I became black. <br /> <br /> shaking head, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging bad. But I would give these moronic and annoying twins credits to sell this concept. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive on me and when he woke up, some horrific periods were already enabled and he hoped that all the visitors would be asleep, because no one would be terrible now and he would be able to pay $ 425,000 a yearly salary. <br /> <br /> you have been warned.
