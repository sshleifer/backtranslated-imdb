There is nothing against the speeding storm of my fast, but this Stephen King-generated nonsense is very fresh-scaled, very bright and modern. This plot about a new teenage boy in a small town, "Sleepwalker" - arranges a cross between a vampire and weaverfly - and gives blood to female virgins, requests for more mysterious, confusing treatment. . This thriller is an irrational color look and feel, rarely with any atmosphere. The kids are predictably beautiful and energetic, but Alice Kridge is as big plus the mother of the mother; The crew from "Ghost Stories" did not come out of the filer-head mold, and it is a huge loss that he is no longer used to. Its performance is vague and intense, and "Sleepwalkers" indicates that there is a very good film with a different focus and strict direction. It is too much and commercially operated, a disgraceful tone that swings wildly from the thriller to the comedy till the drama. Stephen King has popped up in a camio, like real life director John Landies and Tomb Hooper. * **** to 1/2
