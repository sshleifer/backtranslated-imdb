May be described as terrible only. It's bad to start with and then gets worse. When you start, you must see it because it is impossible to believe that it can be worse - but it is not afraid. Another poorly written script for the donkey's director for a talented family of past movie stars. It is difficult to determine whether the script is worse than acting or whether it is worse than directing. For the hero - he belts everyone with a scene where he has made difficult life difficult by opening a garment door and beat him with the window. And in another scene he was thrown through a window and upset 20ft onto concrete - not even dazzling - then immediately gets trapped and stuck in baddies. This is a really funny movie. Lucky to rent it only cost me $ 1.
