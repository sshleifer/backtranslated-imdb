I'm watching a lot of cartoons or animated movies because I have a baby girl who likes watching TV. I wanted to start watching this movie if I want to see my little ... and not. At the beginning, I thought it was a beautiful movie like Bambi, but it was gay to do anyway, but it was gay to make lucky ones intimate. The information says that they are making fun of him because he was not good at sports, but that was not the case. It seems like a movie made for kids to learn just to be gay. It was very sad, as far as lucky parents and all. I do not know if you're gay, you like it but I do not think I'm going to see my little one again.
