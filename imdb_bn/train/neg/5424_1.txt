Mirror Mirror (1990) Lumber Cinema outside of a plane. Why I watch movies when I was young? Who knows? Maybe I was one after another to punish myself by watching a terrible movie. I do not know, I think I need a hobby in my two year time. A teenage outcast (Rainbow Crop) seek comfort in an old mirror. He soon learned about the awesome power of this animated mirror and used it for strikes against those who have wronged him. In this movie like this, power donor has a nasty side effect. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A few years ago. I do not know why. They should keep at the shelf and collect dust. People love enemies of this movie for some reason. If you know why I want to know. Still, I hate this movie and sometimes I have no reason to look at it. <br /> <br /> Not everyone is recommended.
