A teenager who does it all seems to be suicide It asks many questions to his family and his best friend (Keanu Reeves) and blames himself. <br /> <br /> Good idea, badly managed. In the beginning it was made before 1988 - mostly on TV movies and after school specials. As well as some oaths and dialogues (hence PG-13 rating) have added nothing new. The results were anticipated and the Reeve's efforts at acting were really painful. She is good now, but not in 1988. His character was dressed like a slab and always looked so dirty, it was difficult to build sympathy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I saw every scene coming and every "wonder" wire was there. I did not really wait to wait for this item. <br /> <br /> I had a vague smile in the theater in 1988 and hate it (this is a left bomb attack). It still looks lousy almost 20 years later. The value of the handling is done but it has been better (with good acting) in countless other films. The "ordinary people" come to mind. You can skip this one.
