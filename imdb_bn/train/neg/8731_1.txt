Minimum score possible one star? It's a shame. Really, I'm going to the IMDB lobby for a "zero star" option. To give this picture even a single star is delivered a lot more ways. Who is the target of a risky microphone in the hopper's head at the station? And acting, or would I say its lack? Apparently talent was not a factor when Casting Director came to the city. My younger sister's primary school talent show provides a wide range of emotion and depth. And those fake accents were like nails on a chalk board. The only thing that can make this movie even worse ... Oh, wait, no, no, it's already as bad as it can be found.
