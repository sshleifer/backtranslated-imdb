Dear God! I waited "to start" this movie ... then I was waiting for myself to get rid of myself ... and when it was not there, I sat there, dumbfounded I said: 1) Perhaps it could be bad, and 2) I just had to waste a few hours on mere foolhardy. I believed that Drew probably could not make this movie a bad thing ... and boy, I've lost my faith ever since! Do not bother with this one! Drew tried, but the film was badly written, played poorly, and was just thinking poorly! I can not believe a script that got this bad money ever! It actually has a million potentials to do with the idea, (the word "concept" is too big for this movie!) And it has not gone anywhere! It's just kindness! Where another critic found the idea that it was not the worst, annoyed me! Because if I believe, if it gets worse then I would have torn my wrist before finishing it!
