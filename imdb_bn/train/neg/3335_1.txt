This Canon Movie Tale is the worst, and a positive proof that a five-minute fable did not make a full-length film. Sideless cesar as a futile emperor is so stupid, it is very difficult to see. As an intelligent tailor, Robert Morse does not have an ounce of charm. Her helpless nephew (Jason Carter) does not have "songs" awesome and plotters are just slow down. The aspect is virtually incomplete, and helpful characters are very little added. Lisaet Anthony is beautiful as the daughter of Emperor, but her voice is definitely dubbed for some reason, the fate of minor players fate. And the film crawls at the speed of a snails. Hans Christian Anderson must be turning somersaults to his graves when this appeared. It can be said genuinely, at least in the story of this movie, it is no wonder that it has gone straight into video confusion.
