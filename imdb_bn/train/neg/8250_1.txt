I ordered the film from Korea because I was extra in it and was interested in seeing how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Seeing this, I can say that I am ashamed to be part of it. I'm feeling embarrassed not only for myself, but for everyone else who was a comedian for this comedy. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It's hard to imagine how it might be a romantic and non-comedic romantic comedy until you see the film. <br /> <br /> This is not just a bad story, but a badly created movie. In one scene, you can actually see the runner or assistant director SA as you see it. I will post the details of the 'gauf' section. <br /> <br /> Upward, did it fill me with emotions (frustration, anger, shame ??)
