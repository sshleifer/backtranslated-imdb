I was very excited when it was a premiere in 2005. The premiere was very simple and interesting: each episode would be an hour-long movie directed by a famous, notable horror director. Then, when I finally saw them it was an isolated bit. Some good origins from the first season of the episode, but all it was a mixed bag. I blamed the learning curve, and that season 2 would be perfectly fine. <br /> <br /> Boy, I was for a shock. At least one of the seasons here and there were some good stories there. Season 2 (except the "Great Black Cat" starring Jeffrey Kombus) was my complete and total loss. The "Sound of Likes" episode may be the worst thing seen on TV in the past 10 years and most other episodes are not very good. I really hope that season 3 turns it around next year, but I do not breathe in it.
