This kind of movie which wants to be good but sucks. First, what is Punk trying to do with school? I do not think kids understand the situation very serious. The Deck guy told the girl that when she wants to go back to her, she is under her duty, but after that she guns the wheel chair father and wants that she is alone to repair the phone line. Where's the responsibility? I understand that poor actors must give them food but why not give them money that makes such stupid films or donates charity. Oh yes and how anyone target them Stupid punk shoots like a crazy somewhere in the cafeteria. They all want to see the professional but they all suck. Another thing I do not believe is that there is no emergency in school, the kids are trying many doors but they are all closed. What will happen if fire and fire safety guard dies? It is not illegal to get out of the state of emergency. There are a lot to say however it will be too long. I spent some time in my life watching a shit.
