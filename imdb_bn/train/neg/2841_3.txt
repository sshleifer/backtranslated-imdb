Sakura Killers (1+ out of 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 perhaps this movie might look great ... if you have never seen a * good * ninja movie. Chess' 80's music ... Chess conversations ... acting in sugar ... and crossing-the-chessy martial arts sequence. The coolest scene is at the beginning ... an adult chuck cones playing golf on the beach ... many black-colored ninja tries to kiss her and looks like she is looking forward to seeing her ball ... suddenly she reached her golf bag. And ... No, I will not waste it for you ... If you are unfortunate to watch this movie then thank you. The story is astonishing about some of the stolen video tapes or anything. A bunch of egg-bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the Ni√±a process because "only one Nizza can fight a ninja" or something like that. Curiously, these boys do not face any good fight after their training than before ... Oh well, the film is running quite intensely. War scenes may not be extraordinary .. but they are abundant ... and the effects of additional words are good for some chocolate.
