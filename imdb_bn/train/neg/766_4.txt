Whenever the Kalumbo story is separated from the known plot (the colorful killer crime takes place, the Colombo murderer, the colombo becomes the insect of this process), the authors, in any case, do not match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes. This phase deviates into extreme, and the result is a major flop. <br /> <br /> Do you believe: Columbo did not face villain until the end? <br /> <br /> <br /> In two-thirds it was tempted to stop. <br /> <br /> Oh, we offer surrender surrender !!!
