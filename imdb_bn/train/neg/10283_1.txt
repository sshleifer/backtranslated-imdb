I hate the word 'old man', but honestly I have not seen many movies produced in the 1960s ... Generally, movies seem to be worse and worse (although I've enjoyed Scott Baio's car "The Bread, My Sweet ", except the DD Resurrection sex scene which has not added any value to this movie). This film considers Mom, the former Girl's girl of Las Vegas, unable to live on her own, although she was apparently within 50 (although she has been hinted in 40 seconds). I do not buy it. I am 57 years old and all the women I know in the 50's and 40's, more than just living on my own (i'm graduating from high school at the age of 13 years, legally released and gave up on my own life) . <br /> <br /> <br /> The girl's role in her job is not credible ... she gets a promotion that she does not deserve (a great chance) and also drops that ball, but when another female worker takes action, the plate and Ready to distribute, the author shoots him down as a 'opportunist', while he will only do what any career-oriented person has to do - take advantage of creating an open opportunity created by self-worth - his Hakarmira discipline, a girl who is apparently his promises (in this case to his boss) do not understand the idea of ​​honor. <br /> <br /> The girl allows her to stay with her mother, on a temporary basis, but then treat her mother like a pariah (woman who gave her life and raised her 'adult'). Apparently such a 'writer' does not understand that it is not a 'normal thing' to do like parenting children, and then it will be regarded as AS child by their children. Hollywood is trying to stop our throat, even though we were stupid to humble their public by their creative sacrifices, it seems more than the 'Balani'. <br /> <br /> This tragic movie with a stupid end. If the young man's restaurant was not a two-dimensional 'TV character', he lived with the head, who was not older than him and was quite interesting. But in the end, she 'fell' for the girl, an ostrich, rather reluctant girl, whose young man was very small, but in general, soft. (This 'opportunist' young girl who worked with this girl was physically more attractive.) <br /> <br /> No credible reason was presented to the viewer why the girl in the restaurant (who was apparently selfish, self-centered * tch who treated his mother with incredible disrespect) - a woman who was hungry, sweet-scented, ridiculous, and had a Joe de De Viv, Eti could not even understand. Of course the mother had her own flaws ... she had reacted to her husband's death by drunking herself after a year or two years after pushing her or her husband into a girl. <br /> <br /> <br /> You do not really like the balloon until the characters are not developed or improved, it's a belly movie and your precious time is lost. (Where's mustard?)
