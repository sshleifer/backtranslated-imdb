This movie was probably stupid as a fake genre (which was supposed to be). Case on point: <br /> <br /> 1. Rubbing her for nets, Roberts secretly read swimming lessons at YWCA. After her "death", the YWCA works for her husband to work with her husband. How do they get their working number? <br /> <br /> 2. She drops her wedding ring to the toilet before she leaves the city. The day or even weeks later her husband found him in the house. Does that mean the toilet never flushed? <br /> <br /> 3 He has not given any explanation of how to pay for his mother's care in the retired house (since he has behind his wealthy husbands). <br /> <br /> 4. At the end of this tired movie, Roberts suspects that her husband is at home. To see if they have been stacked nicely to see if they run into the kitchen instead of running for their life.
