The premier species comes from the B-movie legend Roger order and those who understand these needs understand that this is a low budget B movie and it knows it. <br /> <br /> A group of terrorists kill a lorry and a whole army, they believe in catching uranium, but not ... it has two decoies of the taste of mankind ... then a crack team, whom Delta Force It can be said that he is called <br /> <br /> Well, this is not Jurassic Park, and yes Dino is never seen clearly because it's probably a dresser who is with Barney with dinosaurs Uba not disagree - just a little less severe, but the guys in this Jurassic Park, about 1% of the budget and thus could make it. <br /> <br /> Can it be 100 down? Do not ... I think almost half of the voters who give it 1 - they are going astray in the streets, it is very close to 4 ... it is actually much better than the whole host of other non-100 other movies below. Production value similar to a sci-fi channel production. (Again the movies get a lot of time from the critics at IMDB) <br /> <br /> Actor is expected in B movie, but no actor takes it seriously, neither is the script. <br /> <br /> In all it is a enjoyable B movie - not for film snobs. <br /> <br /> ** ***** Outside
