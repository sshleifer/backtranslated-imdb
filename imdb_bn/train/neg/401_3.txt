In the unexpected 3rd law of this pardon for this movie I have said myself later. First off, the computer effect is bleeding absolutely! Those wizs of computers' really deserve a patter behind. Although the rest of the movie, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, It's not worth keeping a secret!). Many smiles come in the movie strange, when they try to explain that the visions of the invisible people do not work in the pattern. Please, give more credit than viewers !!! <br /> <br /> Some sex aspects of the film were interesting. What would you do if you were invisible? No one could catch you! These topics have been more intelligently handled in the classic The Invisible Man since 1933. Especially one scene of violence is incredibly flawed, and later it is not mentioned later. If more attention was given, Kevin Bacon's mad scientist might have gained more knowledge. <br /> <br /> The film will be a lot more successful as obscene, because the premises can be really unique and interesting. But this piece of work ... go see something else. Or not, and live with the results! <br /> <br /> 3/10
