I think this film is an appropriate tribute to the first Superman film, because it is constantly and painful as the root is long. <br /> <br /> There are completely energized intergalactic visuals after an open scene, credits are worth respecting the original superhuman movie even for their future spontaneous credits looking for disrespectful. <br /> <br /> then there are some more vague things. Mother Kate sees some ugly rocks in the farm and a good part of my life slowly walks to some ruins. Then the superman and burst on it. <br /> <br /> Later we will die with Lex Luther, seeing the scary close ups of an old lady. We do not see Luther's face until the end of the scene, an elementary example of the movie's drive was left without a hackneyed stone. Lex Luther is a man who does not like Superman because he is not a man. Also, he probably does not like people because sometimes this film Lex Luther reveals some plots about the plan to kill most people in the world. Old work (I forgot to mention, she went on a five year tour where nothing happened). Then he finds Lewis Lane an illegal child and Cyclops is dating. It makes him so excited that he has lost control of his awesome power so that he eventually breaks a photo frame. <br /> <br /> At this moment we see Miss Lane is a kind of shuttle type of space attached to the jet. This is an important event because of television. Then we learn to have people in a control room observing this event. There are also people on television watching and cockpit pilots. The film reminds us that these people are involved in cutting them in for this summer. <br /> <br /> Continue to start the events inevitably towards disaster, I pardoned myself for getting soda. I went back to the wrong theater wrongly and saw the movie that showed the slides in the fullness of Al Gore. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I wandered into the watchman Companion, which I saw twice in a row. Then it was time to hover around. <br /> <br /> I returned to the first theater, found my seat, and saw that the original Loes Lane Space Shuttle disaster was almost on us. Yet, it seems to be forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a boy and sent it to college. While taking part in my son's medical school graduation, I thought that I would probably like to check in Superman Returns, so I forgave myself and soon I did not need to hurry to get back to the theater. It takes about half an hour before there is something wrong with the space shuttle lane. When they were, Superman saved everyone, which was quite cool. <br /> <br />. And then there is a mistress where the Superman became really obscure and drowned Luis Lane and her family with her X-ray vision and super hearing. Then he tries to cheat cyclops, who feels like a good man. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, before the end of Lex Luther movie, possible General Villene was involved in the race competition. . I forgot to bring my scorecard with me to the house (they give you one door), but I think they have scored more than a hundred percent. I hope he won a million dollars. <br /> <br /> At this time, things start to gear up for a big messy end. I think the projector has broken, because there is some loop here due to the film. I think the harmful things that come out of the water, Superman is getting sick, Superman is recovering, he is back on scary things, he is sick again, and does not wait, he is fine again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The bad guy moved: a little distraught in his girlfriend <br /> <br /> Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left. <br /> <br /> After ninety years, nursing home where I live felt a little chilli. I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and I went to recover it. When I did, I was surprised that Superman Returns is not over yet. I tried to ask some of the audience which I missed, but most of them were still in the school with a gray beard. <br /> <br /> I sat on my old seat and saw Luis Lane for a while around his room. Then Superman showed up and started quoting quotes at the beginning of the film, and since I already saw that part, I thought it was OK to leave it. <br /> <br /> So this is my review of Superman Returns. <br /> <Oh, also, if you like dog jokes about dogs or dogs, then you love this movie by taking a dog. There are two jokes like this.
