This movie is a good example of how to break a book in 109 minutes. Without the name of the character, the film is very consistent in the book. Strong Latino characters are full of a book and they are represented by most parts, non-Latinos. There is no character development in the film and there is no reason to love or hate our characters. And are unable to remove a whole generation. Isabel Alende wrote a powerful book and what the book will read!
