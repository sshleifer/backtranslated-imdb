I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative inputs. I know they are going for reality, but I do not just want to be authentic. The reality is boring. If I want to see everyday life, I will save you, live. Tell me a funny story and we'll talk. I can deal with low production value, I am a sucker for low manufacturing standards, but at least some good ideas work. The direction only leads to grab the camcoder and walk a little bit, but obviously I want to dig it because it makes the staff more realistic. The drama that Hitako was called was primarily in life with dust bits. I can not conclude not only this long drama, the drama. Rosetta walking in some places, Rasetta is working in a bakery, the rozett is eating a vapel, the rooftop is taking a bag away, the rooftop is back home, the rooftop is walking some places ... it is not just entertainment. There really is not a deep meaning. I am so annoyed that I have tried to find some reflections in this film life, but it is only a little reality, the highest quality of business. I think I'm supposed to love this, but come, there's nothing there.
