NWA's latest "Big 3" stations returning to the local "Back 3" stations during the wrestling craze on Saturday morning / afternoon under the promotion of Jim Crockett Jr. and Jim Crockett. When Todd Turner handled the failed version of the NWA's Crockett, he turned it into World Championship Wrestling and dropped all the NWA references together. NWHA World Wide and NWA Pro Pro Wrestling were re-labeled with the WCW logo and went to the street in Disney / MGM studio in Orlando, Florida, and eventually nothing became possible for WCW's nitro, Thunder, and Saturday Night. There was officially the last WCW program at the airport on weekends to buy WCWW from Wide McMahon and WWF worldwide. Today the entire NWA World World Wide / WCW Worldwide Video Tape Archive is fully located inside the Connecticut located in Stamford, the WHH Headquarters, with the entire NWA / WCW Video Tape Library.
