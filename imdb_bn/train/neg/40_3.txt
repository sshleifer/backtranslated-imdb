A model named Laura is working in South America when she was abducted from her hotel room and taken to the woods. They demanded a huge ransom for its release. Peter is rented for the safety of his home and if his money and the daughter are brought back, there is a bonus for him. Peter was taken to the jungle with Jack the Jack of the Hacktipter. The abductors tried to return fake money for Laura but the plan became terrible mistake and they had to pay bail in the helicopter. Helicopters are shot and they will also have to take bail (not going well). There is also a devil of jungle roaming. In fact it is a naked black guy with strange eyes and a breath problem. He began to kill some of the abductors and Laura was caught by some primitive men. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> I said, I can say that this is not really his best effort. Films are very slow when everything happens. The whole thing can be easily edited in a 25 minute TV show. Walking through the jungle, there are plenty of shots that can be taken straight straight up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Davey Hunter is burning badly (actually I think it's burning at all times), Dobbed, acting weakly and slowly due to some reason Slowly did not bother me. I think its main reason was that it was mostly bad scene. For example, Laura was walking on the street, apparently shooting a real street because crowd of people stopped sticking straight into the camera just like her shooting. Another interesting scene is that a gang has been killed, which is hanging on a tree, because one of his friends is standing directly under his, which seems like a minute. Then all the people on the head of the tree do not have any reason to fall under it and hurt the man. To believe it is to see. Then of course there is the actual devil. It's just some nude black guy, despite her huge eyes, she has a very vague vision. <br /> <br /> This video was part of the nasty frightening and was banned in the UK's 80s video. Now I have no idea why. There is very little noise and it is rarely a threatening movie. When reducing nudity, I would say that it is a PG that can go far away. The only thing I can remember is that it has never been seen and was added to the original list due to the word of mouth. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really good enough to see if you are not a massive Jes Franco fan. There is plenty of nudity to stay away from sleeping and some scenes are bad so you can laugh at them, but in other words, I will pay only for South American tickets and get lost in a jungle. It will probably be more fun. <br /> <br /> 3/10
