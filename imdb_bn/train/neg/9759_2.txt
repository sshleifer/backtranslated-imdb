It is very rare that I need to write a review on this site, but it is very useful for how badly the film was produced and how favorable it was to its product. <br /> <br /> I have felt a distinct effort to portray the Palestinian family as stupid and incredible as part of the filmmakers. We talk about the sadness that we are experiencing because of torture, but the film is shot down so that we think that the politically oppressed population is the Jewish-Israeli population. We do not see any evidence of Parishad's parallel position. We only hear from other Palestinians in the prison. I understand constraints, but the political nature of the restrictions has been designed to prevent peace. <br /> <br /> I came out of this picture that the victim's victim was selfish and completely stopped. Its fence beside him, so to speak. He was reluctant to see the bomber's parents' injury, and his anger and closing words became spiral outside the final meeting. It is, in my reality, the root cause of the Israeli psychological problem; By ignoring ignorance for understanding and independence, the Jewish people disregard the rejected requests for recognition of land acquisition process. <br /> <br /> I got both of these due to this selfish weakness of the soil, which is usually commendable in a document, but the lack of neutrality seems to be light, it seems all exploitative. Also poor editing, the lack of background in the original example, and finally the lack of proper representation for Palestine. Finally, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge that this is partly due to the political situation, but it is bound to note the errors, regardless of the heart and the content of the sad subject.
