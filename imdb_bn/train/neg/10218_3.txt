** In Spoilers ** <br /> <br /> I have heard from various sources that this film was controversial and was particularly horrific in the end. I was not expecting to go with almost twenty minutes to drag completely. A common cowboy / Indian Western suddenly started as a very dirty romantic 'comedy' about Hans (Peter Straus titled Soulier Blue) and Krista (Candie's Burgen), who was attacked by Cheyenne's horse. Most of the film focuses on these two people, so the romantic comedy bit. Donald Pleasance is then active and abducted both for no real apparent reason. They then escaped and both Cheyenne turned on the horse base in the wake of base attack (individually). While marrying Christa, one of the chiefs of the chain, she escaped from the rider and joined them. So common. Then comes the end. After an hour of great acting, after getting involved with a single click, they will not get together with the story, then the movie will be transformed into the leading exploitation and among other things a murder and shooting behind the head is being shot. At this time in the film, similarities can be made to match the odd bunch, but the wild clans hold the same voice and do not resort to extreme non-violence violence. In some ways, Soldier Blue Frank reminds me of Perry in the last summer, which is completely changed for a shock finish. I did not hate Solider Blue and did not particularly find the annoying end, but it was very dust with an unnecessary violent end. If you want to watch a movie with genuinely annoying murders, then come to Aleem Climov and see.
