This movie does not give anything to anyone. It does not succeed at any level. Acting is horrible, dust is dribble in the long wind. They were apparently trying to frustrate with the length of the last sex scene, but there was not a parody about what the film's goal was. Completely garbage, I can not believe what was this ridiculous movie. <br /> <br /> And I'm sure Rogerio Dawson has finished this film, though he carried the film Breaking India Hit, NY-17 on his mobile phone. The problem is that no adult will be trapped with this film because the film is not like an unintentional episode of OC or as a teenager's target. Poorly
