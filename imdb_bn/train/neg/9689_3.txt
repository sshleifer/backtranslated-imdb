In this case, it's like 'The Wizard of Oz', Paris is black and white, and in Revi√®ne's color. But it is in connection with the use of permission for love, destructiveness and moral degradation, though in fact it comes in contact with designer gowns, Riverware shots, a lot of expensive cars and music-dance, which Vincent proposes to Minellei in one day. Watchable, but disappointing title in the opposite direction, is an extraordinary example of dark plot element and glitzy style. (This model was 'The Talent Mr. Replay'? Does anyone among Gene Saberg and Matt Damon understand any relationship?)
