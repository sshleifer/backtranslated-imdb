Following my "My Beautiful Laundrette" there was high expectation, "bind it like Beham" and (less than) "East Eastern". The history of the homes taken by the British Civil War has been very good in the big screen as well as several excellent TV and radio series (Mercury My Mars, etc.). This one falls flat. After a good start, it quickly went down the hill. <br /> <br /> Finally, it was a terrific general BBC effort, strong regional pronunciation, unclear acting characters, a "that day" soundtrack and a lot of "problems" br>> I've cringed in many times during this movie. The text is predictable. Each potential cliche is pulled out and broadcasted. In fact, it was difficult to think about any cross-cultural / cross-generational devices that could not be used. The letters were thin and cliched: the bright non-conformist minister; Good money but eventually racist elderly women; Over weight, overwearing aunt; The deceiver Indian guardian; Working class neighbor; 'Wise' deep grandmother; Motorbike riding chill. The script was weak, every conflict gave the racist racist white characters the opportunity to threaten the audience with racist dialogue. And set in the 70's (except for an excuse for the soundtrack of 70) a mystery. Perhaps it makes this incredible letter somewhat believable for the people born after 1979. I do not know. <br /> <br /> Good acting can be taken in honorable ambiguity even with the exception of these things. Instead, the usual "BBC comedy" suspect Ham was out to wheel it out. There was much better comic performance (and indeed serious acting) than "bake it like Beckham", it is a formally unknown cast. <br /> <br /> Essence, a lazy clichehed script, prediction story. Miss it <br /> <br />
