The producers of this film have offered funeral expenses to watch the film and die for fear. They really should have given doubtful psychotherapy for those who enjoyed this stinker. A young couple goes to a house, where a woman looks like a woman from a couple. Very annoying, and very expected. Lastly I did not know anyone in this movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
