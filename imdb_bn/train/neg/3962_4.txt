Renoir works amazing debut, looking forward to seeing Nana after the virtual look of fate. I read that Nana was generally considered to be her best silent film, so I had high hopes. Sadly, this felt like a huge step back. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this picture is Catherine Hessling. Her performance is also on top, for a silent film. His performance is no more than what is expected in a teenage age, not at the end of 20 years. He usually has the same face, which reminds me to someone with pain constipation (sorry to say). It was very difficult to believe that any male would fall for this femme fatale. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The story reminds me of the box of Pandora's Pandora's box. It is interesting to compare two as these films have only 3 years. Pandora box simply scores at each level of dad's failure. <br /> <br /> This image is only for Reno's Completion or very serious silent film.
