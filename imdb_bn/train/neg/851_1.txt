When I finished the book, I saw that movie, I knew what would happen. I was expecting the movie because of the rating. The only reason I did this is that the film was 2 out of 10 out of 10, it was OK to try it out in a movie. I have some main points for choosing this movie. <br /> <br /> ********** SPILILERS ********** <br /> <br /> 1. Casting Jack Nicholson has just fits in Jack Terrence's character. Also, I would never choose Shelley Duval for Wendy. I impressed Wendy many differently. I saw why they chose Jack Nicholson, though the green, pointing eyebrows, but he really does not want to see 'evil'. He is supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. Also, they make one of the worst movie couples. Danny was right, though he needed more life. He is the way to droney <br /> <br /> 2. Screenplay. They cut many things in the book and added things. Some of the books I was waiting for in the film were deleted, changed or misrepresented. The few things I wanted to see in the book (Hedge Animals, Rock Malta, Leaflets) were not in the movie and it was 22 hours! I was extremely annoyed. <br /> <br /> 3 The end The ending completely changed, Halon died, Jack died, the wandi never hit ... the views did not blow up. The last book was so cool, and the film was so intense, I was uncomfortable. Halar√°n has never had to die, but Jack kills him with ax. If they want to kill him, at least Jack uses a Rock Malt. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The camera was cool, the blood emanating from the lift (not in the book) was cool, but maybe I was very annoyed that the movie does not go with the book, to be scared. Before you see this movie, reccomend reading books. I appreciate Stanley Kubrick for doing more to sign any agreement with Stanley King. I could never have done that, I used to have all the right I could scream throughout the day. I can not wait to see the 6-hour version, at least it has hedge animals. <br /> <br /> Ratings: 2/10
