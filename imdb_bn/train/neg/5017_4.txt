Just finished this movie ... I saw it on the video shelf and I had to hire it as a Nick Stahl fan. In all honesty, it probably should stay on the shelves. The idea was an interesting and there were several fairly smart twists and turns in there, but somehow they almost came before. And in my opinion the movie went a little too far ... If you get hurt by watching it, you will see what you mean! <br /> <br /> A positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering he was working with). Eddie was quite good but he always played the same character ... Paul Finch is more than "American Pie" for my favorite <br /> <br /> Finally, the worst part of this movie will be Jone's senseless performance in January. ..I think Hollywood is really a beautiful face.
