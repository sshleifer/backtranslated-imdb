I want to say, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and finding some new life in it, which will distinguish it from the most dull and highly designed Mexican films. I have no idea why I believe Lingo, Pudor E Lagrimas, desire for confidence and confidence in our existential industry. It was probably because the soundtrack (which I heard before watching the film) seems different from the other, perhaps it had the courage to be included in a new look (besides Demian Bichi who was always fond of Mexican film directors) and, in conjunction with modern social behavior in its script, Maybe in the trailer that the photography looks brighter than the theater And it was realistic. The film turned into a big crowd pleaser, and turned into a big letdown. In fact, actually Serno is fully transformed with "war of sexual intercourse" "all men are the same" and "why all these women ..."; Bad words, bad words, nonsense. It does not have anything new, nor even that, it uses so much common ground and cliché that it finally mocks itself without any valuable feedback on the condition of the female / male. Like clean clothes about clichés, the usual trams on the viewer are filled up, which I talk about before (always working, always) and screaming (a good acting movie about this). And by screaming I mean that in a literal sense. The first even more compelling characters, Monica Deoni and Damien Bechir, were even more compassionate. I do not fully agree with the discipline, that they should not have been treated to act as a morinet for his lessons ... He confirmed that we had received his message and completely completely destroyed their roles, which could be the only solid ground story standing. However, after all, it is a very entertaining film at the time and you will probably have a good time to see it (if you take it manipulated by it).
