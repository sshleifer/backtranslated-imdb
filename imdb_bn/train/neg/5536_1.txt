Zombies have no redeeming characteristics of rebellion. I am tired of the people that it is not bad, and the impact must have packed another punch in 1936. I suspect that this is not true: IQ does not seem to have accelerated in the last decade. In 1936 the average audience was probably disturbed by this garbage as today's average audience. Why? Just try to watch the first scenes, and count the breaks in the event, the terrible choice to spend intimately, the slapdash editing that seems to include an additional two seconds to pad the running time on each shot. Pay attention to the completely unnecessary dialogue: "I will go to some tea / go out / I'm going to read my books now." "You?" "yes I'm." The sort of exchange that occurs several times. Usually I like to be a huge fan of bad movies, but lazy actors duplicate their bitter and tiring lines, and all the desires of the laughing movie gradually go away. This type of ozone, pot-warmer time-consuming energetic space, is much worse than a fantasy mind-storm like Plan nine of outer space or Santa Claus Martins. Those who claim to be "good" than the more interesting movies, they are behind the entertainment. You do not remember this movie that your jaw is surprisingly open: your eyes are slowly stopped in disorder. Which is a lot worse
