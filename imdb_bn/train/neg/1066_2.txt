I saw "Paris JTIme" because a friend really wanted to see it, so I went with him. However, I was indifferent to the film but leaving the theater I was sitting through this sad production and I wasted 2 hours of my life. Without leaving the "story" almost completely forgotten that most of them were awful. Will Gena Rovers and Ben Gazard have to work with Paris? Most of the American actors' uninterrupted paradigm, this French film gave an extraordinary non-French feeling. Clichés about Paris were endless. Yes, most of them were playing with the clichés about Paris, but spent a lot of time to make fun of French clinics, they directly and sadly preached them once more. Yes, Paris is the city of love. We get it. <br /> <br /> The worst part was: One managed by Wes Craven (Oscar Wild); One with Nick Nolt; One mime one (worst?); One of the hair products; Juliet Binoch (William Dofo as a cowboy in the middle of Paris?); One of the vampires (when I think of Paris I think of Eliass Wood). One with Natalie Portman, which actually seemed like commercial to Mentos, and it was stupid (the blind man knew that when Portman called him he was playing only a part). And it went on. It felt endless. <br /> <br /> I do not like Coen Bros. It really plays with those Parisian clichés but I do not find it funny. Just boring. Gass van Sant was one interesting but it was very little (and the fifth was clear) that it was very few registered. <br /> <br /> There were only two "successful" sections and they were about immigrant women for a wealthy woman to leave her child in a kindergarten babysit only a baby. Excellent mockery there. And those who are stabbed in a segment about Africans. This is the best division of the whole film, but there is no relation with this section with Paris. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They wanted to celebrate its limited perception of the French, but the segment was closed. <br /> <br /> The whole project seemed compulsory and uncertain. Often the French government sponsors this film for promotion of tourism. After all, interesting stuff from around 10 to 15 minutes, "Paris J T'Am" was a terrible cinematic experience.
