This early Piya Jadora vehicle follows a well-known Harold Robins source: The ambitious main character decreases in some randomly chosen but followed the path to the fading world, in which case the film industry. However, despite being formulated to be completely anticipated, this movie would have been incredible at the same time. Zadora (her inexperienced call as an actress to be characteristic) does not convinces as a screenplay. A film about filmmaking can keep some insight into its own art and creative process. But the script does not give him any virtues that make the writer the character of attractive films: respect, skill with words, love-hate relationship with his creative skills. As its character empty as a donut hole. And this display disqualification here is just a taste. Cinematography is so unclear that sometimes it's hard to see what's going on. And the scenes can never be hanging together, so everything seems to be the heir to a random moment in bad Hollywood parties. To avoid.
