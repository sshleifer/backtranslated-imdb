Yet another British romantic comedy, which experiences hunger hunger for visitors all over the world. An uncredited parody of this poorly-tried sequence - all the classic cluttered scenes come from laughingly broad misunderstandings that announce their love after leaving the train. Characters store one-dimensional characters for love-huyt, who manage a bit more harmony in the film. Due to the progress of the film, the threat of spiral out of control in the Department of Thagiri! The suspension of our good nature of faith finally comes crashing at the end of the annoying end. If you are looking for Bridgetgate Jones, you can not find the Notting Hill experience here.
