All right ... it seems so far, only Bermin fans commented on this film - time for counterpoint. Be careful, this article is * long *. <br /> <br /> Those who do not know (mostly non-Belshianans) are: The film's director Tom Barman, the DU's Frontman, the more known one, the late 90s rock band in Belgium. Basically, they create very adventurous and innovative albums and quickly gain fame at the national level. Then, started hurting egos and the band originally fell apart, with leftness and left to rest the rest of the few others to create the album under the DEUS-monicker. In such cases it always happened, post-breakdown was much tamer and less interesting than the origin of the DEUS. They tried to achieve an international success with their album "The Ideal Crash" in 1999, which introduced a very thin form of their previous song writing. They do not quite do it. However, the Eagles are still quite big: it is often big enough to consider an artist enough to try Baramon in movies <br /> <br /> <br /> This is often a big mistake, and it The film is not an exception. And the passage definitely went for * Art *, another big mistake. One thing, he is a musician, not a movie director. For others, Dude has made its best fun and excited music, but it's never near what I would consider * art *. It shows <br /> <br /> So what is this movie? Basically, it tells the story of a bunch of completely selfish people to do the unwanted things completely unintentionally on Friday's unintended Friday, because they tend to be more interested in reluctant behavior. Characters shallow, the plot is completely stupid and there are no other redeeming attributes for the film to make for these flaws. The mood? The whole movie makes me smile (little) almost 3 times, and is actually run to run a single 5-second smile (not quite loud). Emotional? The film just does not seem to show any kind of emotions or feelings. Mystery? Well, the idea of ​​"wind-man", inspired by the name of the film, makes it a banana as a banana pepper pizza - not too much, and a thousand times before (remembering Jonny Destiny) - Tarantino One of the worst appearances is (* * last minute speaker *). And well, its * artistic *, so do not expect any kind of real action for all of the past. In other words, without a few smiles, it bothers me outside of my shorts. <br /> <br /> So what is left? Well, the soundtrack is pretty good, though it's the same problem that was recently shown by another OST: First, it does not seem to be much more like a movie than a commercial for the CD. Secondly, it is an impression that in the absence of the lack of mental resources in the film behind the barren weakness and the quality of the music material, which is not working only. In the end, it thinks the song is more than the figure of the image. And sadly, Bermas has its own contribution to Soundtrack, which gets the maximum attention, even though I'm concerned, it's the weakest part of the whole soundtrack. After all, it just shows that there are more about music than Burman movies. Camera work is okay, though there is something that does not shout at you cheerfully. <br /> <br /> My only thing about this movie was the eyesight of eyes. Since I originated from Antwerp, it was fun to play the "guess-space-position" game. I rarely consider it as a quality. Finally, losing another chance for the Flemish film. I recently observed this issue, the best Belgian films coming in the country's best. This is mostly because at least, there is something to say and manage something that is both sharp and emotional (Brother Darden comes to mind). Probably the Flemish Art-house filmmakers should also try it.
