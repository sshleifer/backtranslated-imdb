It could be one of the best movies. The basic foundation is good - living the lives of immortal cats, etc. - A variety of varieties on vampire concepts. <br /> <br /> The thing that separates each other is the complete chaos of the main characters. Even the socialists know that if you want to survive, you should keep a low profile - take a look at how long it took to catch Unibimbar, and it was because the family members found it. Contrary to the <br /> <br />, the child behaves (and, in small quantities, the mother) as they are untouchable. The child kills without any evidence or hiding or leaving a living witness. How incredible these people are able to live and explore for a month, the day or the day of single century. It's really embarrassing - if it is written properly, there may be a lot more, that is, the main characters will get the level of general knowledge for so long. <br /> <br /> does not look even worse. I finished the bit where every cat entered the city - every time I ate the food in the porch and saw that our cats suddenly wandered from wherever they were, I think that scene.
