I'm a big fan of true crime continuity, but I can not sit through this piece piece. Often Dahmar was called Yautica below the porn-flick soundtrack. There was no search for how Durham was able to survive, and no trace of his victims was searched. But nothing "look at how this guy is engaged." And I will give a lot of filmmakers - the greatest thing to humiliate their dahmaar screen.
