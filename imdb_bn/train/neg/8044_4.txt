Well, I saw this movie two years ago and now I have come out of the dust to see it again and of course, I really want to say, I really think this film is good. This movie was caught in a serious throat, I knew what I did last summer. 3, FINAL STATTi was like a screen 4, and this movie is not bad. I thought it was flawed and would certainly be ridiculous to release this on the theater but still for midnight's popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. It has some scares, and some really hot women I could have added. Please see Joey Lawrence's new drunken look, though she obviously did not win the role of a big Hollywood ... I feel bad for this man, he was in the middle of the 90's and was a flower-like career, some Disney films and the permanent Learner brothers' show Joey Lawrence was a little player in the sitcom scene, but then chose to rotate 360 ​​degrees, her career is just south Runs such low budget movies. <br /> <br /> This film puts you in the guard, it reminds you of the crew, there are really hidden information that anyone knows, just be frustrated to find the secret. It was a killer who gave you up, I did not think he was still a murderer but was a huge isolation combined with the secret of his purpose. Now, was a secret that was given out? This movie can be one of the best rating movies. But I'm not a fanatic for the college theme and I also went to the spring vacation in a luxurious beach beach in the college, so it seems to me the image of this movie. <br /> <br /> So-so slasher flick. Good for a midnight movie.
