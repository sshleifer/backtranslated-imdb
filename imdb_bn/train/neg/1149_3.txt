FBI Story (1959) Warner Bros. The 149-minute famous criminal investigation agency is glorified! Richard L. from a book from Don Whitehead Green and John Twist came up with some rudimentary scripts and it was managed only with a talent in Marvin Lea. But by Joseph Birock it is an excellent color cinematography and studio musical magician Mc Steiner's helpful scores! <br /> <br /> This film is reminiscent of the history of the bureau since its beginning in the twentieth century, and its all-aging stinking agent Chip Hardsty (James Stewart) that he related to his investigative experience - Flashback - a growing young agent In class. But it is all too long wind and episodic! And as it progressed, it started to look like a movie mini-series instead of a movie production because young hardesties operated the American Criminal Offenses for sorting such criminal offender "Baby Face", Nelson, Mother Barker, Dealing etc. Overwhelming organizations such as Ku Klux Klan, Nazi spy ring and Red Menace And here it should be said that the FBI story probably missed a forgotten disaster just for the presence and appeal of his presence. Moreover, this is another problem with the movie - Stuart has gone almost completely carrying out its own movie! Apart from Sheela Miles - his unhappy wife, but his devoted wife has played a role - he is surrounded by a cast of minor players! Everywhere you expect yourself half as much as Robert Ryan, Jack Palenas, or even Raymond Bauer, who welcomes a gangster or police chief or whatever. But sometimes something that goes fantastic as it happens! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The image looks good inside the bureau's activities! With the help of Stuart's description, we work for thousands of men and women organizations, which include hundreds of agents in the field. And our headquarters are also treated at the head office, which is in the huge record department and we are going through the daily work of chemists and fingerprint experts. Steiner's extraordinary score! The headline is a strong, passionate and scheduled March when there is an interesting love theme for photo gentler moments. But the Cuban Klux Klan series is quite skilled for the fatal and unpleasant march theme. And still better, the Latin American music, the composer South American scenes, especially the sensational Fandango, wrote like the archives for the arrival of non-ferocious fighter soldiers. The FBI Story was one of five scorers in 1952 by music writers, including Samuel Bronston's naval epic "John Paul Jones", the charming Rome-cum "Cash McClund", Delmar Dav√®s's basic western "The Hanging Tree" and Deves' "A". Summer Place "through which the Young Love theme is achieved - which became a major hit for Steiner, which is known as" Theme from the Summer Theme ". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Thanks to Beer's rich color painting, Steiner's excellent music and certainly hostage stewart can be seen! <br /> <br /> From the story of the FBI, the classic but unlikely line .......... ... Black Nick Adams (who is his mother He flew down the plane with 43 people.) He is going to handcuff, he is returning to the arresting officer and Blurt: "If I have any mail, you can send it to canyon city next month or jail for him - then you can send it." Great!
