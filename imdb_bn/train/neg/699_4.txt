Perhaps one of the oldest slasher movies, badly played and badly written. <br /> <br /> Five students are behind the holidays during the holidays during the holidays, but someone designed them and started killing them. One by one, the main suspect's strange groundspiece, John Heimit, played by Woody Roll, or could it be one of five characters. <br /> <br /> No one except Duffun Zongia will be bad too early and be the main heroine, and the rest is well quite good although Laura Lapinski's main heroine has her charm sometimes and you feel sorry for her at the end. <br /> <br /> They can not kill why they have really banned, most of the dead saw a fake in most cases, their hands were cut in half in one hand, which actually looks fake, but others feel so bad that a girl Drives a car in his car, a girl gets tall and alive alive. <br /> <br /> Overall a great slasher coupe did not have much good ld
