I have seen that the previous critic (who is still present at the school) has given a very good review and I can only assume that the reviewer did not see the BBC adaptation of this classic novel BBC 1989's BBC adaptation better. My main problem with this (1999) edition was Anthony Wayen's shield as Tom Long. Anthony Way is a talented boy Treble who earned fame after the TV mini series "The Koire" was shown. I can only guess that he played Tom Long on the role of his extraordinary performance in "The Quaire". Unfortunately, the small boy who appeared in "The Quiet" was long and riot young during "Thomas Midnight's Garden" and failed to be satisfied as Son of Anthony School. It is an extended part of the imagination to imagine that Tom (as played by Anthony) will make friendship with many remote hats. In 1989, the BBC version of Tom and Haiti was very close and their friendship development was so much credible. Even special effects for the 1999 film failed to be convincing and there was no significant improvement in the effects of the 1989 TV. Casting and acting of this version is worse than the previous adaptation and the real classic lack of all the movies. As a final observation, I would say that the VHS version of 1989 has received more than £ 20.00 pounds, and a new DVD of this version can be bought for £ 5.00, I say more?
