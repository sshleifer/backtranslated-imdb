Sam Mraovich should not be allowed to touch a camera again. If he should arrest him at the spot ... for at least minor damage. Anyone who provides a dime to pay his garbage should be compensated by claiming it. This was his first "silly" viewing of his "work" ... and it would end me. Ed Wood looks very good to me now. <br /> <br /> When I return this scrap to the video store, then I personally would say that the shelf will be closed. An active supporter of gay movie, I'm annoyed and angry that this war criminal, too inseparable male child has been allowed to distribute and package such items, cover a catishly beautiful boy (Jamie Brett Gabell, who, thanks, is not there, at IMDB Other acting credits) and an interesting summary in the background used as stomach, and then it's a "go Chatters "market as rent. Trust me, there is no place for any rock; It's not just a movie in any sense of the word. This kind of objectionable, irresponsible, junky gay movie can only be harmful to promoting and supporting (hell, in general, gay rights!) Who is tempted to rent it due to the cover, you will be disappointed. Gabeel is not impressive to cover movies like cover, and she has been shown once or twice without a shirt - that's it. Instead, Homo Morovic expresses our own hateful, sad-looking duck-child nudity. <br /> <br /> This "thing" is a reverse vanity project for "united" Morovich. He and his friend Michael Habos (who, I realize, keeps the same lazy garbage) both are terrible in this. Morovich deliberately posing as a complete non-genius (in all cases), he is frustrated to take any "damaged" attention for himself. He is to be guilty.
