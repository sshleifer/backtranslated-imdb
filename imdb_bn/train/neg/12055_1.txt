Do not spend your money or your time in this cryptic piece of film. When every third term is rendered in a cruel language and there is no real plot and cast of the old actors, as well as those who still provide the same date of performance from the past and did not develop in their career, many things can be said. I am looking forward to a better than award winning actor Bensio del Toro. Others that Pertertricricans may have the vision Maldaores will be distorted by overwhelming trash such as. A wrong word can be used to emphasize a given point at a given moment in a movie, and it can be funny or sad depending on its context (see the film Elsa and Fred, for example) but it should not be limited to the plot. The movie was a bit embarrassing and it was not funny or even cute about this movie.
