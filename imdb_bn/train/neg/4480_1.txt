I'm not saying that I did not see this movie with high expectations at first. I was recommended by a friend with a moderate taste in the film, and "MTV" was stuck in front of the cover so I did not expect much. What I was hoping for was a tie-breaker, very dramatic but at least effective. <br /> <br /> I was wrong <br /> <br /> First of all, I started to see that I did not read the book or saw any other version of the movie. <br /> <br /> The acting was my main song It is an unprecedented by God. The original girl is quite moderate, but Merle Strip, compared to the rest of the cast. The main "hero", heath, is just plain awful. She can sing beautiful sounding clich√©d songs, but that's about it. His acting breaks the 'sad' moment so that I am so laughable that I am laughing. Isabella girl was also a gentleman, and the brother was just a flat character who was played by an actor who could not show any emotion. And when he tried, it unfortunately failed. Blue Patrick Harris was the only good actor, playing Edward, although it was clear that the side was bad because he was not even alive for what he saw. Oh, and Dad was not half bad in my memory, but I was in the movie for a very short time. <br /> <br /> The story was not very good. More breakups than you can imagine. The predictable story (ultimately, which I just realized). Characters that are not deep enough for them ... are not only completely interesting or engaging, which we have never seen before, which have been great and there is nothing to see here. <br /> <br /> The last thing seems to be a tearjerker. There is nothing to sort it out. Finishing is not built at all, it almost feels like a postthought. In fact, I had to ask my friends why it really happened when they told me, "Waiting for me, when did they say?" Never a good sign. Perhaps the worst was my editing, though I realized that fade-ins-fade-out was over because it was originally made for TV, but it is not really an excuse. <br /> <br /> Overall the movie is just garbage. I'm a sensitive guy, I cried during the two episodes of Simpsons. I do not even close during this cone, Really, this movie is not worth your time. If you really want to look elsewhere.
