(Spoilers galore) This is a terrible film. Firstly it has that guy from the middle. I think he has been a career out playing Super Datting Parents. For the first time, she tried to scare her son fearing terrible fear ... but after 10 minutes she did it again in cloess! And so it goes, this film comes true real time. At one point, I started imaging a few days later, until I was reminded that the story line was only on the next day ... early in the afternoon! I'm not really sure who these couple supposed to be in real life. First of all they are presented as a sort of Manhattan Couple Couple in Yuppie and a kid. But they drive an old blue Volvo. Those types of driving off Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they are not running Volvo yet. <br /> <br /> Okay, then there's Winido. A "mysterious Indian man" gives the child a little magic Wendigo figurine and tells him his powerful magic. Come on ... we are still doing ancient Indian mysteries. Just to run the house, they pan across every Indian statue in New York City to their tourist traps. American Indians have not seen this film for decades! Oh, and about Wendigo. She does not really cause horror. He does not kill the children's father, which is the most horrific thing in the film ... he only dies with a furious and high-powered rifle with a common hick. Wendigo only came late in the late film, who killed the boy ... Oh, but wait, it seemed that Wendegago was crazy about Dad, maybe he killed the deer ... so Wandido was happy that father died ... but .. <br /> <br /> And so it is ... insulting, annoying and unconscious. There is no reason to see this image.
