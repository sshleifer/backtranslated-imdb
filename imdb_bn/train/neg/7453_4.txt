Wonderful actors <br /> <br /> Lausi script and not very good direction. My main problem is that I simply did not care about these people. Do not kill the killer. The settings were pretty crooked. Dennis Quaid's character was such a weak writing, I did not care after the end. She got her baby back. Big deal! I wanted to return my money.
