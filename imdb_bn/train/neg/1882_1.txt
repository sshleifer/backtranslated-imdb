What a junk piece of garbage !!! How good is all about this BlueBlue? Yes, this is "arty"; And yes, it's "foreign", but .... that's not enough. The plot is annoying and confusing, like a reality show, but not so silently. <br /> <br /> People are spontaneously selfish; But there is not enough depth to feel sympathy for them as characters. If they are based on real people, I feel very sorry for them. <br /> <br /> Violence (and quite a bit violent) seems quite strange and disgusting. It's the view of the producer Quenton Tarantino. I do not think so much about him, <br /> <br /> Oh yeah: If I have a neighbor like me, then I leave!
