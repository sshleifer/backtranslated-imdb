With a title like this, it is beyond my comprehension and how does the film appeal to me. There are supposedly a few moments and a little hole slowly, but the way the movie was shot and the whole story hit me as a stupid and lazy attempt in "shock" techniques ... a woman raping an incompatible plot hanging on the streets And killing the victim! Brother and his hated brother becomes imprisoned until the brother breaks down and arranges to meet his girlfriend outside the woods. She ended up screwing a screw where she screwed her and she then shows a collection of boys kidnapped on her basement. He was raped in a very addictive prisoner with his old boyfriend, who is a "occupation" neighbor and his sexual functioning boss. He explained to him that he would kill all of them. He kills him and then he concentrates on the man (or pig) whom he tortures and kills, focusing on him ... Most of the violence and humiliation eaten and destroyed genetia - which is all boring away and basically From the light. The best view is the graphic braum handle masturbation followed by some painful male rape ... Of course, "I spit on your dead body!" Spat on your grave "was a spit on your grave" - ​​as an unauthorized series - on Based on the headline, and the main character gives a reference - her mother was recommended by Keamily Keaton. I personally consider that a barbarous condemnation assertion! This movie is a boring, amateur mess which tries for shocks but weakly fails ...
