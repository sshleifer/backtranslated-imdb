All right, give me a new word currency here: polyphobia: Fear of Plural Relationships This is one of the longest films that started with the title of the audience about any other tuition, just starting a dime and it is so necessary and it is going to continue all the campaigns about the only moral thing to find a psychological solution. Just one person out of a thousand feels happy to love more than one person and this director is not one of them. Blah. Mark my words: From now on for decades, polyphobia is going to be a big mistake like Homophobia, but who was too close to guess? Just the first time: the producer of this movie. And so much better. Why create such a funny conservative and old type of movie? Considering the seriousness of the seriousness openly, it completely ignores that we live in an age where Mankummi is becoming increasingly stubborn, which turns around and moves into polygamy. Open your eyes, people, please! <br /> <br /> It's frustrating, Run of the Match Chuck Falk. (But, I want to say, Heather Graham is a living thing.) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
