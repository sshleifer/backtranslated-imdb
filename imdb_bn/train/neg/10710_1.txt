A star like a temporal who came to Doffe Lundgren New York, when an antagonist opposed to Christ is found, is certainly not killed just a few miles behind the monster dolph and as soon as he is transferred from the body. Body. (Like falling without mysteries) Of course Lundgren is out of its element and the movie is completely unwatchable. I admit to being a fan of Dolf Lundgren, like Stewwell Siegel and Gene Cloud Van Damme, whenever I live on TV, I try to watch his movies. I caught Minion and boy I was ever frustrated. This movie is completely terrible. Action sequences are so staged and badly edited that you can create just a coherent sense of war between the world of war. The worst thing is that unlike a tough guy pastor (!) In London, The worst movie that I had seen from Dolph Lundgren was that this movie became worse (which was good) and the last days (which was bad but better than that). It literally has nothing to suggest it. This is terrible and it is the lowest point of Lundgren's career. And I saw cover-up, The Last Warrior and the Universe of the Master. <br /> <br /> between 1/2 * 4 - (terrible)
