I saw this intellect about nothing about this, without the brief description I read here. After watching this, I wanted to say that the director has shown the promise, but it looks like that amateur, then I saw that he saw other things to see whether he was his first or second film, but he did the House at the Haunted Hill and was afraid . He missed this mark in both films and it was the same at the same time. <br /> <br /> The story was terrible, did anyone love the girl because she is beautiful but does she have a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some scenes that I finally enjoyed but it was pretty scary but totally.
