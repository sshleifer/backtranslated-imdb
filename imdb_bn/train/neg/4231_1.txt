I was forced to see this movie all the way, because I found it in a door box and bought it for myself, but I came many times to stop it and only paid for money. If you are a fan of thunder and sorrow, this movie is fine. If the makers of this movie know that there is one thing, it is a deadly effect for creative uses of fake blood and body parts. If it does not thrill you away, stay away. <br /> <br /> This film is shot in a home video camera with grand school props and horror actors. It's dubbing from the German, but for its permission, the sound is awful. This movie is related to budget budget, especially without special effects. If they used to spend more money on actors and a real script than donors, then the film could be a little more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The story is about three men who live on an island. Tin-masked terrorists by an army. They are captured, and the rest of the movie about their escape attempt. I say this story in a very little sense, because it is actually a series of torture scenes and a series of fierce scenes of war that are gathered by frenetic obscene dialogue. <br /> <br /> What can not be read about this movie is stupid. Consider to warn yourself.
