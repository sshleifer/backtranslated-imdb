What a shame! I was out of this unknown James Garner Gems and hoped it would have been a stinker! The production quality was fine, but the plot was uninterrupted, and I can honestly say that I am only a few hours old and a lot more figs. The film was not really worth the price and if such things are coming out, it will give a bad name to the Hallmark. No matter who you are about to know about it, it's about nothing, and in this case, it's not a good thing. One of the stupid creatures in the world who is watching our old painful woman, who can be married to a real lover, who is probably the only person who can survive. He pushed him with a mess after another, after the other he got in an embarrassing situation and made himself proud full time. Then the movie ends. What a relief that was! It does not take long to see, so do yourself a favor and avoid it, if you were happy you would have known how bad it really is.
