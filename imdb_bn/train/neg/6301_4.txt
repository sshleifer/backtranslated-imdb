Despite the stellar work of supporting actors and an intelligent script of Alan Platter, the film comes from a fatal error - the lack of central character / actor attraction. One of the characters describes Richard E. Grant's character as "a shiny little Turkish" and, unfortunately, it's totally hiss. There is nothing about his or her performance to be credible because his girlfriend and high-class publisher / friend will spend so much time and emotional effort on him. He is arrogant, arrogant, selfish, self-centered and thoroughly annoying. An actor who loves you while you love him - like Ivan McGregor, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> All the satirical satire of class system has been lost, thanks to this irritating And thoroughly unlike performance. What I wanted to do was hold it down and said to hold myself.
