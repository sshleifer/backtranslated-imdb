This movie is quite entertaining due to an excellent performance that is beautiful in Virginia Madison and Lindsay. However, the film is so predictable that we have seen it all before. I did not read the Mothers Gift book, but I hope for Brittany and Lynn Spiers because it's completely different than this movie. Until you consider ending a movie, which is essentially a music video, a real concept, the whole movie is remembered for the theft.
