What a waste of time is a waste. The film starts as a clone of the show series, but with more bad acting. Melissa Juan Heart is absolutely awesome The finale is ridiculous and there are no twists in the story, not the plot plot and just a plain bad end. I've liked some characters and I'm finally hoping to get together everything. It just does not happen. It ended up with no end in a total "actress" good performance. I could not believe I spent watching this time. Some people do it as "fun" as it does not. Attached to a man in a mask that kidnapped and forced them to find out. The connection is a stretch and he should be shot first on the main actress.
