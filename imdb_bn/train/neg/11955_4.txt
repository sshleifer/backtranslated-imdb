"Visitor Question" is a failed attempt in the black comedy, which is the world's most painful family, from mortality to physical abuse, from bachelor to nocrophilia to a lactating mother who nurses her husband and adult daughter. The film is very illusory, it has received some critical acclaim and has established a small culture. However, with the production of home video quality and a slapdash, "Visitor Query" just kept up as a curiosity. Genetels disappear and sanitary equipment is clearly visible, make-up is awful and everything else is best amateur. Time wasted (C)
