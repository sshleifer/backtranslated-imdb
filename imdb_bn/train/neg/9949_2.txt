This movie can be so good with a script rewriting. I do not expect a lot of potential in the film, but you would think that homeless and urban dweller Jack Mason would ask why a group of experienced hunters wants to hire him as a hunter guide. And after reaching the hunting ground, the poor ice is playing his part as he is actually going to manage this man by the jungle he had never seen before. <br /> <br /> How did James Meson return to James Mason's theater? <br /> <br /> I think this image is based on Richard Connel's short story "The Most Dangerous Game". A few years before I read the story, I showed this movie in a class of 9th grade students. I reedited the film, cut all the pointless scenes and all superstition. This is 43 minutes long end.
