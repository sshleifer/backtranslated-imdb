I had seen it on the weekend afternoon because there was nothing else, it was my feet strap and probably less painful. I am requesting someone to see the issue of how horrible the movie might look, it was certainly deliberate. I would like to have such a child, out of date, badly executed because it was out of faith, in a vain attempt to humorous efforts. Does this film look like spikes on Goodfellas, I think I'm exaggerated? Well let's give it airtime and remember it again. Awesome, totally awesome If this is not public, then the director and anyone else who is responsible for it should be removed and should be shot immediately after being forced to watch the film again.
