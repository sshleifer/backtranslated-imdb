I did not particularly influence this movie, which lacks music and it lasted only for 40 minutes. Thank God, because I was sleeping. I used the timing photography for excellent shadows and shadows, people, water and clouds. Unfortunately, it's all. <br /> <br /> My preference for the preceding, excellent Koyaanisqatsi created 87 minutes in 1983 and the evidence that a sequel can be better than the original, Powaqqatsi created in 1988, running 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Try both of them.
