I notice that this movie thinks that most people speak the truth, the moon landing (1969-19 72) or before birth was not born before their birth. I think it's easy to ask about historical events, if you do not live through it. <br /> <br /> I was a young man in Apollo, but I was old enough to understand how old I was. Follow the landing of the whole earth moon. Our family gathered around TV to see the launch. Newspaper titles are going on every day, from launch to transaction, from the moon pillar to the moon lift, all the way to spread in different languages, in the latest light of the day. At school, some classes have been canceled so that we can see major events on TV. At Apollo 13, the people of the world took their joint breath and the uncertain fate of men entered the house. You can not go anywhere without asking you last. The world was really a community. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < We have left books in our history, and anyone who can claim that the history is involved in false and false evidence and trying to prove "proven" evidence otherwise the tendency of the evidence will be completely ignored - the proof can not be mentioned - through this wonderful shirk and fantastic days Dwells in souls and memories who live in it.
