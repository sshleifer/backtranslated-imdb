It is not common to see foreign films of the United States flat on their faces, but flip side here !!! This is a terrible rebuilding of the American film "Wide Awake" by the British! <br /> <br /> "Wide Awake" is strange but entertaining and fun! On the other hand "Liam" is just weird. I'll give "Liam" credit for one thing, and it's clear that I have made the right choice to change my religion!
