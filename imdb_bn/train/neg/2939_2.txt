Others have said, "No, Luciano" is a more appropriate headline or reaction to the title of this movie. For entertainment, great opera singer should sing ... She is not a terrible actor. <br/> <br /> The first 25 minutes were fine - a beautiful family movie, as it was - but after that it's nothing but a boring soap opera. <br /> <br /> <br /> As a true creator, Pavarotti, "GeoGian Finney", his voice loses several times and the doctor comes to rescue "Pamela Taylor" (Catherine Harold). The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor gradually falls for the singer, both conflicts all the time and over and over and it goes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It spoils that thing as Harold and after seeing him here I am not surprised he never becomes a star. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I became bored and did not think much about the second half.
