I sometimes find that it was one of the worst movies I'm sorry to say. Although visually attractive (such as the use of color was absolutely stunning), it was quite annoying and annoying (see father / boy abuse). <br /> <br /> What's more, the music is completely absent, and if you think those wonderful soundtracks by Michael Nyman (who writes the soundtrack for most of Greenway's photo) then you can imagine that it does make any difference. <br /> <br />
