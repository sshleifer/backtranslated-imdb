Carlo Verdone has once been able to combine superb comedy with smart and fine social analysis and criticism. <br /> <br /> Then something happened, and he became another neutral director of "Holiar-thu". <br /> <br /> Il Mio Miglior Nemico is a line of "minimum class = type and warm, when high class = snoring and terrible." But the love can ultimately be shortened or shortened. <br /> <br /> A trite clich√® for such a smart director. <br /> <br /> There really is not much to talk about the movie. Each character walks on the walk: The self-made man forgets its roots, but again it will become "good", the barbarous wife, the rebel-rich daughter who falls for the poor and the poor ... ... rarely mean <br /> <br /> <br /> Very frustrating in every aspect.
