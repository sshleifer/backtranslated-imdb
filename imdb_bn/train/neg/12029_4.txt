Generally, I found that if you can not hear about any movie before watching it in DVD, then perhaps there is a good reason for it. I was not aware of this movie until the second day of Blockbuster and it saw a shelf. Since all the good movies have already been rented (which I wanted to see, whatever I do), I think I would give it a shot. <br /> <br /> This is not much different than other movies. If you live in singles such as single ward or rm, then you will probably enjoy it. <br /> <br /> However, if you are not a Mormon then perhaps this film will not appeal to you. There is no way to avoid having too much religious (mortal) messages, and sometimes it comes as sad and delicious. Finally, if you do not fall into the Mormon population, you're probably closing down to see something else. Certainly, there were some funny moments in the film, but I do not think it was enough to retrieve the movie fairly.
