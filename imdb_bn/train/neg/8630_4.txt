I know that in this episode there is something different from what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some attributes; For example, after giving a very negative opinion of the genes seeing the Sun's flashbacks of "Astronomy Sun", we can see the side of things and get a new, more balanced burden of life. <br /> <br /> But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it frustrated my enjoyment throughout the episode. Earlier, where the jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it was found that the sun's father was a person who was becoming shadow, becoming rich through illegal means. I thought he was a public, even; The public works in Korea, just like every country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that the sun's father was actually the boss of the Korean automotive company (or top executive), and the jinn was physically attacked by a government official (who was originally supposed to be killed). <br /> <br /> I can be especially sensitive in this matter because I work in the automotive industry, but I would say that it is clearly offensive and racist that even such things are going on in Korea; Hyundai or Kya (which should be the model of this fantastic car company, those huge, serious companies, which are actually the only ones existing in reality) work with such mafia-like methods, instead of the West like a normal automotive company It is incredible to me that the authors would be sorry to write something like this story, and there is no turbulent tension on it in Korea. It seems like exotic "Buy American!" The campaign is portrayed as criminal criminal, incredible, third-party organization of criminal companies.
