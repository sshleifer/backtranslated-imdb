Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It carries a slightly similarity to the ETA Hoffman's original story which is based on it. <br /> <br /> In the ballet, the story ends in the second half when Clara (or Marie in this version) goes to the Kingdom sweet to see a series of character dances. <br /> <br /> There are infinite variations of status productions, which explain the story (always not successfully) in numerous ways to compensate for the weak Balearic Ballet. <br /> <br /> The Balachine version does not actually have any idea of ​​the drama or the story (despite Tikovsky's wonderful first-actor music in which there are so many plays and mysteries). The result is a completely forgotten first half Christmas party, which rarely happened and where the dance (little it does have) is not particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we do not have much better version of the sweet state if it is near). Although there are some choreographer highlights, most of the dance forms are soft and vague. It must definitely be a wine drink. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film version of his graduation was reinstated in The Nutracker's only view.
