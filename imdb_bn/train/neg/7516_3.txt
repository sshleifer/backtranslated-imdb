Yes I hired it, so shoot me! <br /> <br /> Setting up a painful story without any real wages, but at least it shoots well. Director John Kays took a simple idea about the easy hazard inside the fake hallowed house. In most cases it should be a slam dank, but this little stinker is very quick delays. Cinematography is more than average and the actress is always moderate, but the story and the writing are horrific horror only. Slowly the scenes are rarely dragged and fears are very low and very few of the film's actual measurements are very few. An inferior mood is set at the beginning but before its horrible clarity its flashes diminish and I myself became concerned about death and made another sandwich ... cover art is interesting and I think it is a neutral low budget drake, but if you Enjoy a good story and event, but reach something else.
