Wow ... where to start ... it's been loaded for just $ 2.99. The three rupees I will never see ... and for what? I would tell you an hour and fifteen minutes of annoying, annoying, annoying chat and the angle of the college which appeared to be more suitable for Lifetime movies than the horror flick being advertised in the box. (Those who are marketing Droids may all be designed to burn in hell for eternity). Follow it with a little bit of cheap Gore (not even good man's heart ...) and a plot that does not come from anywhere and does not come in any sense. Horrible, terrible, terrible ... <br /> <br /> There are no freedom fighters? Well, Joe Bob Briggs was involved in the scale, six breasts, but my long lost three bucks that are rarely valuable. Without those, this could say on Scia Fi, two or three morning ... <br /> <br /> <br />
