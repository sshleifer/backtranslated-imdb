My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiment found in the film. Actually, they are quite consistent with me. When I came in a movie, it is stupid and gets that kind of story, purpose or dialogue that is a void of void. Maybe some people will say to blue that the song changers fail to inspire anyone outside the decreasing audience, it is not the same that creating characters inspired to speak due to the events produced by the author or the director is not the same thing. Despite the symbolic heritage of Neil Young, a silly story remains. The most child scene where the devil shows the way to the bar, slips a tonic to the obscure protagonist, then finds his way to the form of his dance form, which tells heroin about the song of the Young, which is not known where the adopted place Since these two dreams are a project where they search for West Coast ????? Will find out the blue, music with stick and leave to make the film from Steven Stills.
