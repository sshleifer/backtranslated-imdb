I really love something about this little girl, especially "living with happiness". This movie has some great startups - unusual possibilities and feasibility of treating a weird movie, but the incompatibility dialogue fails to succeed with the dialogue, patchy performance and very television coverage. <br /> <br /> It's a lovely television and a very common movie. The ideas have emerged as such that they almost feel like television commercial-like Pat. But the feeling is good, so we can not complain too much. <br /> <br /> I really want to see this director full-length animation and want to try and work with a producer who does not claim so annoying.
