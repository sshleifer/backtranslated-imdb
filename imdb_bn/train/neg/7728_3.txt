.... this is not good with mini age. I saw it and it was originally flown away like its seagull, and others when it was broadcasting. In early 2002, I borrowed both novels WOW and W and R and were even more impressed. I then decided that I would like to see again and invest $ 200 plus in DVD sets. I saw two minutes again in a painful detail and realized that I worked behind - I bought novels and borrowed the DVD. <br /> <br /> Do not believe it is uncomfortable wrong? Read the novel and see for yourself. Do not think of this date? This is not a screen for any person that it has originally been broadcasted and has seen the response you received (warning - people who see these responses appear to be awful). <br /> <br /> This mini for the Quarterly Division - Dan Curtis chose Ali McGrath and Robert Mitchem himself. Dad !! Production quality, music scoring, dialogue - a great story turned into 70 years of soap opera, which was a highly ambitious producer / director who was on top of his head. This was the last minute to date. <br /> <br /> These two minutes were great among the main broadcasters and those of us who saw them, tugs us on a small string that reminds us of our young days. IMO - This mini bus is far from its reputation and is not terribly frustrated.
