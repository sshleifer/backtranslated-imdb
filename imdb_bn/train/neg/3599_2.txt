Um .. I'm surprised that someone actually gave high marks on this photo. Let's face it ... Tori is not a great actress .. And this film is its "level". The film's plot was weak ... I have come up with the idea that Dark is somewhat distorted by peeping tom If there is anything good about this movie, then I would say that Tommy Chong's daughter is only for her daughter ... and then the swap-opera-ish leadership of men is a bit of a good look. Rsaniya makes., But stopped the dramatic power. * Why IMMb need at least 10 lines? You may say that more simply: "This movie sucks"?
