This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I love the Japanese movie, and I think another director of the same director, Electric Dragon 80,000 V, is an excellent composition. I really wanted to like this movie - an awesome actress and story coming out was very interesting. But I could not find some entertainment about it. <br /> <br /> The movie takes forever to not happen. And the effects that the director used - such as constant contraction and slow slowdown - this plot gradually slowed down with increasing annoyance and the actors were uninterrupted. It was completely unnecessary due to irrational attachments due to the great disturbance - such as an hour-long Buddhist statue spent in Asaona, tearing and declaring that he did not worship. This plot adds nothing. A fellow Japanese film buff and I had to check continuously during both times. We could not believe that this picture was terrible. And the last was horrible. I thought the director would reward at least for the management to sit in such a position, but sadly I was wrong.
