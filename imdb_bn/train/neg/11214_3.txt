I saw this film in the local screen almost a year ago. First of all, I'll say that it looks great. Cassella is incredibly talented and an excellent cinematographer. I just feel like the movie was good. I would not call this a horrible movie. Putting it in a few shot of eroded Scratch does not make it a horror movie. There is no mystery, there is no mystery, you know who has done the whole time. <br /> <br /> This is a drama. You know what's going on in the whole two movies. Actually, I guess, but nothing special. <br /> <br /> and tagline, "Vengeance can be fatal" .... Really? ... how many horror / thrillers can they check that the movies have exactly the same tagline? <br /> <br /> It hurts me to say something, but I know many people who work in this film, and I do not know they want people to smoke. Their ass, so I give my honest opinion.
