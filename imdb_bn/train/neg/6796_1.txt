Linda Lowles was a victim of a sad female assassin Chuck Trainer. I do not understand that sexual intercourse with dogs (which can be tortured by animals, as well) and be entertaining or funny. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who coerced into making this movie. I know some people will criticize this comment, but I firmly feel that such films burn hatred towards women and more rude feelings. Women in this society continue to portray women as sex objects. We call ourselves "civilized" but it seems that we have a long way before we can set the surface of civilization.
