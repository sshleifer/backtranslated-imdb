Despite the positive reviews and screenings of the international festival, this film is not for everyone. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to other movies, which is about the age of the immigrant family, a teenage girl who must overcome a lot of general personal, and struggle against her family's ethnic heritage pressure. He chooses any kind of sport and loves him for any reason with the help of a local boy, he awakens his problems and conquers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Semira Turan, "actress", who plays the role of a teenage girl, may do many things, but one thing she can not do is to do it. His appearance on the screen is immune and strange, dramatic, in which he tries to show some emotions, horrible, his body and face language is driven by amateur actress, director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they can not save this clich√© with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Along with a few relatively good moments, this film does not have any new or interesting offers. <br /> <br /> Even the Kung Fu war is not a reason to see it, it is very annoying. Slow motion was really unnecessary, dance was fundamental and there was lack of inspiration, and most of the Kung Fu scenes train or stand in the Kung Fu position, not actually fighting. A small and skinny girl is beaten by big and muscular boys, and it is not mentioned how ridiculous it is when their feet knock them off. <br /> <br /> The only reason this movie can be seen is because it is European. It's easy to publish this movie - Denmark's first martial art film, but do not fool it, it's not. It's just a story about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which is not really trustworthy. <br /> <br /> Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and stories.
