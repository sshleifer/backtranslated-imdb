Although it leaks a great good joke, but the humor often enjoys looking at the face or the thick language and is very dry with the members in the panel, who are very much on the hunt waiting for the crowd. <br /> <br /> I do not think other comments have made it the best RTE, it's really dry and ridiculous. Sarcasm is the lowest form of intelligence, some really funny intelligent gags that you will actually laugh to laugh at. It seems, the comedians are not well known but judge the quality of gigabytes but believe the familiar names. He was medieval with some fairly good humor, but it can often be quite medieval. Jasper carrot or Dave Alliance is not as good as the element. I find Benny Mountain funnier.
