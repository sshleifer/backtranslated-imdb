The genuineness of this movie is that people are genuinely disappointed - I am hoping that Leonard will look a little better $$, because a few years ago, his life savings had shifted from the manager and now more than 70. But this picture is just terrible. At the outset, Leonard himself said that he is not feeling overwhelmed with his past, and for the next one and a half years, Leonard's music is emphasized on the worst feeling of the song. It's so bloody, which ends with the rich close-ups of the singers. Cohen's interview was completed in the Ley-fi Video Closeups and I wanted to see the whole body or mid-shot! I could not think less about the comments of the performers, especially those who made the arrogance and bayak more prominent. An actor in this movie also did a good song like Leonard's own music, and if you think this way and you have any doubts then pay attention to them. This could be an acceptable PBS special, probably for a time. But I will be hesitant to get this a DVD. The film finally shows Leonard's half-performance "Tower of Towers", it accepts a verse by boss. Even occasionally good performance (Anthony, the first number of Rufus, the traitor of Martha) is lost in the context of this torque blob. Forget it, and if you want to respect him, then buy Leonard's most recent album.
