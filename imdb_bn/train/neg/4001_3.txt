I started looking into the interest of not seeing so much about the 1990 cracker series. Certainly the combination of hostage McGower and Robi Coleton could not be wrong. How wrong I was! <br /> <br /> The backbone supported by frequent, repetitive and violent flashbacks was very empowering. The production tries to be super-modern, but irritating the flashing box and even the children's font. Robbie Coletten sleeps two hours, fuzzy and unlikely "insight", and the police are portrayed as a dimensional explosive figure. As a result, the excitement was never created and the final scene from the next (no details for the fear of spoilers) as I've seen for a long time a piece of TV drama was as ridiculous as bad. <br /> <br /> No, I do not want to see them anymore, but going back to the 1990 series DVDs they will see that they do not match their fame.
