How do you spell out the fat Italian that can stop the martial arts move without the need of some heart medicines? In this film we saw Steven Sighal at his lowest level - his carrier has deteriorated strongly on such striking behavior that frustrates his career. It seems like his daily training is to order his daily restaurant Frookie Alfredo. <br /> <br /> She is fat, slow and old, rarely see martial arts action heroes in this movie, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gets the wind This obscurity, though unfortunate and ridiculous, gives some scope to do some top battle scenes that cause explosions through comic book walls. <br /> <br /> Did I completely suck this movie and Steven Sigal is a complete joke? Yes I did
