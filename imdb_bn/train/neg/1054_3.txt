Grameen family drama - perhaps a "monstrous people", is a monk who suspects a young man, who himself has removed himself after seriously injuring his elder brother in the shooting accident. Despite the low quality content (despite being given glam treatment by director Christopher Kain, without being reluctant), this tragic story has some dynamics of the invention value. Unfortunately, the reluctance of adult characters to charge the isolated agricultural atmosphere and the situation gives the film a great experience. Cast image with Robert Duval, Glenn Close, and Wilford Breamley, a small reunion of "natural". Too bad this project does not get the essential talent eke out an essential, memorable picture behind the camera. * **** to 1/2
