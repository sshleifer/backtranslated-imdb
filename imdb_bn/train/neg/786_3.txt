I got this picture released, and last week it was 3 or 4 times. I'm sorry, I want to be a voice-breaking voice about Mr Brangh's performance. <br /> <br /> It's a really great, unusual movie, not to say ambitious for 4 hours - shoots beautifully and is designed. Derek Jacobberry, Julie Christie, Kate Winslet, Richard Byyars, and many more work well. Then there is Kenneth Brangha. If there is a vanity project for the actor, it is, and Mr. Branagh Hamlet's "ham" does not have anything to do. From Stunt Casting (which gives us the worst performance by Jack Lemon worst), to understand the "naturalness", in the bits of the confusing business, in his own performance, which makes the towel from throwing all the other scinters, all famous soliloquy of literature His performance ensures that when he can reach enough level at a sufficient level, he was not a great actor. Visible budget can be charged for food supply, Mr. Brunge eats so much. Its performance is not a perfect example of why people do not see Shakespeare - "full of words and anger, nothing signals." And if there is any flaw in his order, he firmly holds his camera in his upward performance. <br /> <br /> It is not saying that people put any theory on the theory, after all they say, a playwright. The genius of his plays is his sovereign and timeless truth that rests. Although there are no "right" ways to play his plays, there are certainly good acting, good acting and bad acting. Shakespeare himself instructed the players in the "Hamlet" syllabus. It made me wonder how Mr. Brengha did "bribe" but could not hear it. There was an example of spending a lot of time working on how he would say something, and he was not exactly figuring out what he was saying. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> He is wise to stay behind the camera And who knows the acting industry to practice it. His command has always been better than his performance. I still give him a lot of credit for reviving interest in Shakespeare's filming. She is a great template set for other productions. And, it will be interesting to see him onstage, from around 20 rows. But, I hope he will give more instructions and work less. <br /> <br /> Is it valuable? Of course. There are a lot of fun to get in the film. However, it may seem a long, long film, and finally, less than they can enjoy to survive.
