I acknowledge that from the viewpoint of my review in 2006, almost 30 years after the film was created and it could be a great horror / thriller movie during its conception. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of Halloween night in 1968, 6-year-old Michael is under the cruel assassination of his 18-year-old sister. Michael is committed to an emotional organization and escapes after 15 years and again returns to his home town for his murder. At this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and initial path which is highly anticipated. Despite the similarity of music to the music of every scene with Michael (the murderer), the beginning of each scene can easily be predictable, thus alerting the viewer on the possible events following the audience. For horror / thriller enthusiasts, there is a severe lack of blood / gore compared to modern day movies, although I am not equal in the amount shown on this day and age. A happy medium was not found. <br /> <br /> In half-hour movies, one scene is not unexpected. For a horror / thriller film, it is fairly typical of the era of the era and thus there is no punch for modern day enthusiasts. <br /> <br /> A positive camera shot for the film and a dark light which creates a horror. Atmosphere. The second positive is the character of Michael Doctor, who provides the source of probability of story leadership. However, it is clear that Jamie Lee Curtis's star is her acting career at the infancy stage and thus is not a real horror central victim. <br /> <br /> This picture is hard for me to lose it, but in reality it is less than the other horror / thriller film, in the mid-80's, in the 90's, it's a real horror / thriller film. <br /> <br /> I recommend you find classic from 80 seconds. Cheers!
