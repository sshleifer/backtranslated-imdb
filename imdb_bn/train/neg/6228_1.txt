This movie is incomplete bad. It starts with several random explosions and then falls into a T-Rex shock doll that talks to the viewers (!). It goes through sock puppets and animations throughout the year, probably the filmmakers can not afford live actors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It bought for the purpose, but, as it turns out, our interference was not unnecessary. <br /> <br /> I was thinking that Ed Wood's "Plan 9 Output Space" was the most impressive film of existence, but it was released in Japan / Lego cars / sock dolls. Expelled him If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation. It's very rare and very valuable, a lot of smiles.
