Bill Maure is not an attack on religious organized organized religion. This is an attack on Christianity and Islam. Apart from mocking a bunch of rabbis as well as inventing fighter machines to get the Sabbath rules, he does not really attack the Jewish invasion, and when Rabbi becomes really angry when challenging the state of Israel's state. Following his speculation in Belle's logical conclusion, he will realize that the creation of Israel in the Palestinian territories is based on the so-called 'holy book' of the very organized religion. The lack of complete or complete lack of this photo or the focus of this focus is the evidence. <br /> <br /> I believe that people believe in atheists or even intelligent people. Anyone can go to a religious person and laugh them and call them stupid for their faith but what will you give them back? Somewhere he will not really say why they think they are fools. What makes him "reasonable" person in the room? In this way he shows how he is not really and the process is looking at the stupid like that person till the end. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good film / documentary about the real evil of religion and how religion can actually be harmful to human civilization, see Richard Dawkins's 'All Temple Routes'? This is a brilliantly researched documentary, it clearly describes how to achieve and how to expect. <br /> <br /> Bill Mehr's religious issue is not funny, there is no interesting question and it does not give any insight on any controversial matter. It seems that the dispersion and deceit of an old man involved with his Catholic enthusiasm I almost feel sorry for him.
