I have no idea how to really comment on this movie. The special effect was unthinkable, the acting was terrible and if it was a plot, it was behind the box. I do not think that for a long time I can think of this movie as bad, and I'm a big fan of homosexual sex and boobies !! ;) This film can not be saved from just a terrible excuse to stand in front of the camera (or in this case) in front of the camera. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of beautiful overall "zombie" effects. Clearly, in this movie, Jumbo is such a common place that is moving here to the couple here and there, unexpectedly speaking at the gas station (an internal windshield repair along with an internal bathroom), the junkie-movie genre 'ultimately even a factor. Even, hijacking a girl's clothes by a dozen junkies is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> To the vampires: Apparently all the zoom male and all the vampire ladies, which are fine by me. I'm not sure how the vampire goes out in the light of the day, or why a soldier, Vampire standing in the middle of the street, still holds his gun with his heart, just waiting for the Queen to flick it all the way through the vampires Any ideas of the old nunnery end segment, and when asked by another hot lesbian vampire of a hot lesbian vampire "Do you think we are the right thing?" Kill two visible heroes in the movie, that puts it at the top. <br /> <br /> Acting and special effects were always at a low time. You can almost watch the fake blood was pumped during the closure of the zombie while running from the general. The general said, where did they see this Kenny Rogers the same way? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just my $ 0.02.
