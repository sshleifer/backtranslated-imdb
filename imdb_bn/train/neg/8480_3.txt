I can not say one of the best movies it has ever seen. But then again, I can not say that it's the worst I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Okay, so basically the girl is skating, it is good, it wants to go to a costly school, it is not able to afford and take a hockey scholarship. She must hide her skating secret from her friends. <br /> <br /> Personally, I did not like acting actress Katelin. He could not cry for saving his life, just crying, a child who pretended to cry for his own way. <br /> <br /> Katelin was just an annoying person. He tried to do all the nice and helpful works of the people. Two squares are also calling his name and he is saying something about his Korean grapher and he says he has grabbed me 'line' cringing me. <br /> <br /> We all know where he goes and Spencer Classically they do not like each other and they are assembled at the end. <br /> <br /> Overall, I think it's a movie that you like skating but if you do not think the main skater is very annoying. It's basically good to kill time.
