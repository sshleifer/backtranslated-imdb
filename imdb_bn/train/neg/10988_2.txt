If I did not read the book, I would say it was a good movie. But I read the book. Who ever wrote a story to write a screen. There are so many changes, it was not really worth the title. Changing the characters, changing the plot, changing the time line ... <br /> <br /> Who was the first Henry and the investigator? They were not in the story. Henry was a bit of Mitch's personality, but Mitch was not a policeman. No, you made the resin, helped her body "drown" and used Jeanema as Blackmail against the regenerator. The real so-called blackmail was that Rezaan felt that Geneia was sleeping with his son and wanted to stay away from him. His son was also blackmailed because he hid something from his mother. Even the story of his son is not really mentioned. I do not believe his boyfriend, Rose's secretary. <br /> <br /> Tony and West were not together at the beginning. While in college, she was actually Geneva. The black painted apartment was their idea, Tony just went to visit. Here in Geneva and Tony Milan, quickly became friends. Tony hides his love for the West. Then Geneia went to the west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony together. Finally married, at some time in the West, Tony let go again for a short time. Just be heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. For Tony, Generaria Blackmail wrote a test paper for Tony Tenth. Now, as a professor in college, he does not want to take it out. If I play Tony I will tell the character astonishingly. <br /> <br /> The character's character was a pink, it is not really important. Augusta did not cheat him with the cancer of Genya in living condition. Billy was a boyfriend in the role when he was not there. Augusta's father, he was a draft docer in the Vietnam War. Eventually the characters actually care for Generenia for several months. There is one thing to take care of both geneae and delivery at the bottom of Cheny's nose. Then turned the Geneya government into a bill, and got away with it in the boat. Not with Augusta, Chauras was pregnant with her. Cheris was a divided person, because his real name was. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gehena did not die from pieces after cutting .... She fell or was hit by a balcony (we never knew) and a spring landing. Her blood was almost pure grade heroin and probably she did not know anything and it was closed as a odd. He died during this time due to cancer. <br /> <br /> It did not show any childhood memories or anything that would save the character to the reader. The book was pushing her bare bones down. Then created someone else's vision. Why can not you write your own story along with the lines of making the movie. It was quite different, and I could be sure that more has been done so.
