Extremely unnecessary movies that are acting in disagreement that I do not take care of anyone who will pay the best (or the purpose of the movie, to portray the smooth talk of people in New York City)? There is no romance here, no comedy. The acting is very flat and a very expected plot. What was the most annoying of this constant with quotation from classic movies is the most disturbing Humans, as you quote, the more your own movies will not be less important? Try to be real! No excuse at all in a small budget, first time director neither. Painful, foggy, racking. No wonder it only cost me one penny ...
