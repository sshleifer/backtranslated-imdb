This is an action of the Western. James Starr is beautifully portrayed in a great splendor which leads to an all-star cast. The scenery and costume is great. There are tasks and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy cowboy who persecuted the old Nathpostim's government. <br /> <br /> The main disappointment has always been a hero of Hollywood. Even when the film was made, the senior was the stereotypical hero, and there are really few preserves in Stewart's picture. He is kind to his two partners, and it gives him an extra level of credibility and preference. <br /> <br /> He is so strange to everyone else, it's hard to really take care of him, or accept him. He is like one dimensional spaghetti Western character (very bad cut). <br /> <br /> Still, lowercase letters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brevin, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan, and others are seeing this value.
