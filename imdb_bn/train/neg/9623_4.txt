Ben Stiller does not act as much as a response. And he is very good at it. He is very dependent on the comedy running around him. There's something about Mary, the stylish hairstyle only works by trying to keep the straight face of the steeler. While facing the other two suitors of Maryam, she was unaware of the house, but the scene is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stiller comic genius is surrounded by an array. Hank Azaria and Philipp Simmur Hoffman get the best lines, of which very few. Not saying that Hoffman relies heavily on physical humor - you know we are having trouble when we go to fart jokes to raise laughter. A basketball scene that attacked Huffman was completely finalized (though it has caused an accident as a comedic actor by the reaction of Stylar). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little response. The characters of Hoffman and Stealer may have played each other much more. Aniston again reprises the role of her Rachael, but the steel is no juice. It's a "more with a crusher on the Joey Rachel". <br /> <br /> Polly is a number-by-numbers rom and it fails - it lacks the heart. You do not have the root for the characters. By doing a little more work we could have done a deeper story, but in the end the failure of the film came down to poor writing. It is worth watching if it pops up on a slow night TV, but you will find it to relieve cash money.
