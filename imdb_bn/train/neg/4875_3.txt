My grandmother took me and my sister to see this movie when I was out in theaters in 1998 and so we happily bought tickets, popcorns and soda, and went to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience did not appreciate it very well, I remember some people that they did not like it, I did not like it, I thought it was rather stupid and not worthless. Eddie Murphy was such violent, but the whole film was bad except for that, I rarely smiled in this part, I also thought that the other people in the theater laugh almost scarcely And what I really thought was bad was talking about animals, because talking creatures exist in cartoons, live action movies, they are completely fool! I said, he is not worthy of showing this image except Eddie Morphy's violent rope, it's rather stupid. <br /> <br /> I have seen many movies by Eddie Murphy and I thought he was funny, I just said the only interesting part of this movie, I did not even see the "Great" movie, The Adventure of Pluto Nation, Eddie Morphy. This movie is not a movie that I really see you see, because without Eddie Murphy, you're probably not going to like it, especially because of animals talking about it! <br /> <br /> I'll give 3 stars out of 10 possible ratings for this movie.
