Imagine turning the American national anthem into a national cartoon. Throw in some beautiful creatures, some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates, and you'd find yourself finding yourself with a proper replica around this film. <br /> <br /> Remember to remember this when I was small; I rent my mother almost five times from the video shop. The story is not very bad, it is true that any Marxist observer must make some accusations. <br /> <br /> If you do not like America, you will not like this movie.
