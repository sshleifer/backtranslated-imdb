This movie always leaves an impression on me. I saw this as a framesman in high school and was alone at that night. I think there is a huge fan of an actor "Brady Bowch" by paying tribute to Robert Reid. I thought Chuck Connor's role was terrible and bad. However, this movie has so much impact on me that I am now a volunteer by trying to study Bible studies and church services in women's state prisons and at one time changing the life of women. What fascinates me is that so little people actually saw this movie. None of my friends have seen it, and my family thinks it is weird when I discuss this movie because they have not seen it.
