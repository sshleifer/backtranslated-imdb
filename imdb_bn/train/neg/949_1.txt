I do not understand the appeal of this show The actress is poor (Debra Joe Roop is a significant exception), most of the episode plagues are frustrating and irrelevant, poor talk, joke is irrational, and even busy trying for half-episode. Moreover, this show and the 'mid-70' link is very neutral outside the dress style and the scenery and background used for show-bits do not seem to be more than the modern sitcoms with the same old, weird sitcoms. Twenty years ago, wearing a showcase to showcase a show, which is hoping it will get some nostalgic visitors or something like this. Both "Happy Day" and "The Wonder Years" use the same technique more effectively and actually watch the contrast between this terrible, unfortunate excuse for the show.
