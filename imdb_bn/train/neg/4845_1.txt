This award-winning film does not have any artistic value. Well, it does not deserve an audience. Ironically, one of the awards is for cinematography but to say the truth, camera movement is uncomfortable for at least speaking. Each frame, you think you've got "full picture", some like him are "spending your sight on the edge". The story is sad. Well, I'll be honest, I can not bear to see the whole movie. Most of the suction was part when I was taking part in soldiers' barracks and invited one of the soldiers to drink alcohol. This and many other similar scenes reminded me of Steven Siegel so much. <br /> <br /> Take my advice, stay away from shit.
