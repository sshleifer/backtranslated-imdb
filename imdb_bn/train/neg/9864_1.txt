As a gamma, I can not say I love this picture. True, I hate it right down. I have tried to see it as open as soon as possible, but when it gets down, my social group seems insulting. <br /> <br /> I have many reasons. <br /> <br /> 1 The character seems to be unnatural. I've met players from different parts of life. I do not know that anyone works like any characters in character. Like this, film producers have taken the worst side of the worst effort and have kept them all 5 people. Most gamblers are rather social people, some rather active lives. <br /> <br /> 2. The style does not work. The music style is disproportionate to the movie. A real documentary of gamers will actually work well. Although it looks good (I.E. clearly put together), it's not very good. <br /> <br /> 3 The dialogue seems compelling, unusual. It seems to be lacking in any real world context. Gamers swear, I must admit that, but we do not have Tourette's syndrome. <br /> <br /> 4. There is lack of humor. Self-humorous humor is the mainstream of my community and the few groups that I have encountered are, it is a short boycott, and more like toilet humor. Similarly, a large part of the gamer's humor is not comedy, it is related to joke and ridicule. Most gamers jumped aloud loudly. <br /> <br /> 5. My biggest problem is this: accuracy. I do not mean the rules, but rather the dynamics. Unintentionally, this movie is comparable to even less budget film The Gammers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which illustrate players to play real games for real players. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to make players versus intelligent vs. Gamers, where you can say something: "Huh, I know such a guy ... yes, definitely like Gary."
