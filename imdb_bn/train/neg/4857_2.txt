I really liked ZB1. Really, I did. I have no problem with low budget movies, and I've enjoyed movies with Zb3 worse production standards (if you can imagine such thing, see 'Ads vs. Zombies,' if you are interested). Actually, I like the low budget zombie movie because I suspect that Hollywood directors can not understand that there is no junkie. <br /> <br /> But ZB3 was so bad. It was annoying. I do not want to be bothered to be honored in my criticism. I like my 90 minutes ago, etc. It took only 80 minutes, because I entered the Fast forward to 1.4x with the parseway. <br /> <br /> Well, there are some criticisms here. <br /> <br /> 1 Panning was terrific. Everyone talks in monologues. Even when there was a single line, still the FEEL made a mono-like line, because of the work and execution of the camera and inserting F-bomb into each sentence. Initially, I was excited about 90 minutes running time of 70 minutes on ZB1, but ZB3 actually had fewer incidents. It's all about <br /> <br /> 2. Gore got the effect stupider. Just greed rub around the human tummies. <br /> <br /> 3 Despite the epic show, there was not really a plot. And expressing really epic! I can not see it, if you're going to see it. (Do not see it.) But then, it's almost fairly bunch of character and bickering for ~ 80 minutes. Or less, if you choose so.
