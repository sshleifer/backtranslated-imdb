I can not help but those who appreciate the shot as hearty and tears, laugh. For one, it is completely unrealistic that these people will have a perfect life after their new home. <br /> <br /> How can these new mega houses be maintained? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must be increased after this incident. Plus, noise will disturb me. <br /> <br /> Secondly, what can be a reality television show? It's practically the same repetitive junk week after week. We are familiar with a distressed family, they rebuild the house, then surprise the family and everyone breaks down the clennix boxes. <br /> <br /> It can not be mentioned how annoying the part of the renewal is. The only interesting part of the event is to see what the house looks like, but that segment is also destroyed by hypocrisy and constant confusion. <br /> <br /> "Extreme Change: Home Edition" to be impressive by listening to a show, but it is flat. Leave this one out. If you prefer reality television, "Survivor" is much superior and moving.
