Feeding the public is one of your recent Medieval Zimbabwe films after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestions? Keep your hard-working dollar and just keep going for this old theaterx one for this group. Guess what about plots? Taking over zombies. At this time, for the originality (?) This movie is held in Rhode Island and I'm not sure I've ever seen a Jimmy Flick in Rhode Island. A TV station controlled by the government, usually holds "normal" broadcasts, so that no resident feels that there is a problem in the world, that is, who will never see or go outside. I would say that some of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most compelling part of this movie. Actually there are some parts of this story, but I do not bother it because after a while you will not care or fall asleep. At any rate, there is a lot of terrible acting to throw in front of all the trades "stuff before it" in front of all its cameras. Believe me, you can find more with your time than seeing it. 10 out of 3
