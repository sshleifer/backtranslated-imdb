If the writer / director is reading this (and I imagine that you are away from work now) then you must say - I saw some bad films in my time but it differs from being on the worst premises. I have ever heard <br /> <br /> Spinners - nothing is happening! <br /> <br /> The total time wasted. I laugh out loud at the end. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> > Garbage holes.
