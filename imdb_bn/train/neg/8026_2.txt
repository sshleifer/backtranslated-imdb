It makes a surprise how this show is still in the air. A couple stayed together, got married, and had a child, but everyone else was broken. What is this trend continuing? At the beginning of the show can be entertaining. You see all the girls swooning over one man, that almost all their immediate choices. It's just like real life! Girls start taking prejudice, worries each other and shows their true shelves (or we think). But the man can decide that he can choose who he thinks he can marry and live happily. <br /> <br /> What exactly is true love? How can you do for someone when you are forced to pick them up? This show is incredible. You were dating dating online, but would people go to TV to find love? This is not realistic. How can a girl go out with others when she can stay together? If no answer is given to this question, and if the show ends in the end, you will not have a happy ending in the future. We all know, everything is written.
