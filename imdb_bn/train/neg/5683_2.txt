From the beginning of the movie on Friday 13th September I felt like a movie of another Jason. And this ... debate that the movie is interesting. But the time goes through a silent film about silent, supernatural, silent serial killers. I mean, he will go to bed on the bed without any words, do not see anyone. He is supposed to be blind after execution, but he is walking and used like a man. I'm bored over it. It's the same thing for me. <br /> <br /> In other words - unreal. Many wrong and confusing information <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "
