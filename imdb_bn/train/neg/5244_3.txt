You are in a bad day, or bad week. You are looking for a movie that can make you laugh and forget your troubles. I do not think role models are for you in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie centers around Danny (Paul Rud) and Wheeler (San William Scott). Closes drugs, and more juice. But Danny has the worst week ever, and his company crashes in the car, with the wheeler in the seat beside him. Soon, her ex-girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Bank) is a lawyer, she is directed to spend time in jail by spending time working in the Volunteer Community in place of a big brother named Stary Wings, under the leadership of Gayle (Jean Lyncht). Wheeler Roney (Bob Thompson) has been appointed 10-year-old and has a dirty face like Chris Rock. Danny Jackie (McLoween, Christopher Mintz-Plus) has been appointed, who likes to dress like a knight and wrestles in medieval times. But this would be good for Danny and Wheeler, or would they be better in jail? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to hit Bush around, this movie was very unpleasant in many ways. Like Ronnie's character, the young people are very surprised to hear the bad news coming from them. If he is a little older, then there is no more motherhood than that. Where I'm thinking of his father's head, when they sign this to him. The character of Elizabeth Bank is so inefficient, maybe I wanted to feel bad for her character, but I did not feel anything because she was portrayed as a nervous prediction woman that would act in such comedies. And Jane Lynch, who is the worst, She has ever delivered the most overacting performance. Playing a former drug narcotics, he is still the drug who works like that. To listen to all his boring dialogue, I forced me to throw my head against the wall. Sun William Scott is playing again like another Stefler character, he must try to isolate himself, and this film will not do this. And the more Scott works hard to be fun, which makes him fun. <br /> <br /> Now, Paul Rudd, on the other hand, I will be different from the film, because he runs a tough performance, although he does not get a lot of smiles, but he is the most interesting character from the rest. Because Rudd does not overact, and does not try so hard. His view and Mintage-Plus scene is visible. But the rest of the picture is so stupid, sometimes it comes up. But it became so expected and uncertain. This is a reminder that such tricks do not try to do something new, similarly, they do not take any chances. An example of role models is that.
