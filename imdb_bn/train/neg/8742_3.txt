After watching the film trailer in the film, I thought it was the main idea of ​​a thriller, it was set up in the computer company's competitive world. All star cast was another message that this picture would probably be better. But when I did not go to see it in the first week of the liberation war, it disappeared by the 24th of the week. Patiencefully I waited for its DVD release, then it roamed home to see an enjoyable evening. Expectations than the house were much better than the film. The direction for a start is horrific. There is no thinking in it and the director has made a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. I can not use him in the future. Secondly the main role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillip. Philip is generally a cold-hearted crucible and gun-like character, but he is considered to be a disappointing hero in which he tries to portray as walking and sleeping with his friends, but he does not look right. Female star, Rachel Leigh Cooke and Claire Florine do not see enough features, but when they are not close to their salaries with a performance. The only highlight of the film is the role of Team Robins that can be made for him and his fluttering mood and mysterious ways that the movie is dragged. The final point is that this movie only shows its feature in the View section that fills the movie that does not see the trial movie and the DVD deleted. Although some strange in this scene even more frustration because they do not meet the important gaps in the story.
