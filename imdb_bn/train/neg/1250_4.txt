I must admit that this "re-imagination" of the 1968 original film was a big disappointment. Especially when it is considered a Team Burton Film. He defenetly is one of the most original and I can say, the Cold Director has produced Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I personally do a great fan of his work, but some have probably gone wrong with his latest flick, The Planet's Apes. I really enjoyed the original film. When it first came, the man was expected to expect another cesi 70 science fiction film, but as soon as it became astonishing, the theory proved wrong. It was really a clear cut message. A clear anti-war message Fear of cold war, where it was adopted in the world, and the fear of use of nuclear weapons played a major role in the minds of filmmakers. These reasons have gone above all expectations and it has become an instant classic. However, new movies, "rebuilt" or whatever, do not leave us nothing. No message, no standard behind it. It's just another finance minister's summer blockbuster. <br /> <br /> Apparently Team Burton does not leave you. The dark and unclear settings were nice and the make-up was definitely awesome. <br /> <br /> Clearly, it is not enough to keep a person obsessed with movies. There will be an exciting plot or story. The plot in this movie is very stimulating and it is thought very badly. The script is very hairy and it's full of gaps. It looks like this image was written in a big hurry. Why the app was there, why and why this regime was actually a fool and the script-writer proved ignorance. <br /> <br /> This question has been raised, which has no reasonable answer. <br /> <br /> For example; Why did the apes come from all the people who spoke English, why were the other up species compared to the chimps on the planet (given that there were only chimps in space ships that were crash-landed on the planet)? How some chimps were able to make all kinds of monkeys in thousands of years. (I mean it took millions of years for the humans to develop from monkeys!) <br /> <br /> And finally there was a wonderful thing to be surprised. Perhaps it was originally dropped due to the end of the film, when they thought that the audience was expecting the same finish. The ending raises many questions, which I know, there are no intelligent respondents. Did Thied learn to learn the space ship, which was low-power, and had learned to fly with time and took hold of the world with single hand? And what did he do, reproduce it with all women? And to say that it will happen, I fiercely suspect that history will remain the same, Washington will be exactly as it is! (I will not make a huge ban instead of memory) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < Helen Bonham Carter's character was attractive and well-played, such as Team Roth Thaid. He was very good, some of the points in the movie are incomplete. Michael Clarke Duncan was also fine. I was not happy with Mark Walberg She is not an actor, and here is a very macho color less character drama. Very unbielevable and nothing compared to the character of Hestons in the original. And the main female character film was no reason or place. She was just casted for appearance. <br /> <br /> I think in the future when people think about Apps Planet, they will think about the core. The latest will soon be forgotten soon.
