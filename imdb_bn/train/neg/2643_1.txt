This, for the lack of a good sound, the movie is lousy. Where do I start ...... <br /> <br /> Movie photography - this year, perhaps I saw the worst. The camera seems to be returning the camera to the camera from the camera. Maybe they were just a camera. It gives you a volleyball sensation. <br /> <br /> There are a bunch of scenes that have been thrown in a continuity. When they did 'split screen', it was unreasonable. Everything was flat, it looked ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Color tones were closed. These people will have to learn to maintain camera balance. This 'movie' has been created badly, and is done badly. <br /> <br /> The plot - you got to have fun. If I was an SS agent, then I would file a lawsuit against the producers. Looked like Marx Brothers with radio and guns. Sutherland was in its '24' mode - I can see this free. Eva Longoria has been good with a little less, and showing a lot more <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never say why are trying to kill tenants. I just can not see the President of the United States that it's been running for a living like a building's utility tunnel. PLESSE <br /> <br /> Hollywood is dead. This movie proves this. I like the 'big screen'. I was a kid. Like many more 'movies' and I'll leave. The thing is Hollywood, creating chick flicks so much, how to make a real movie? If I'm the owner of the theater, then I'll start playing the old movie. The real actor, good story line - and good cineography <br /> <br /> This movie is a dog. Do not waste your time or money on it. I rate this 'movie' a zero! Douglas is not suitable for this role. I can look at her age, but her just carry this off a lot of wimp.
