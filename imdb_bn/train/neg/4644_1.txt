This picture is terrible. The story is trying to find out what happened to his sister. The film struggles with its identity, hiding it from the silent / thriller to the boyfriend, with elements of the horror thrown for good measurement. The film has a very confusing framework, for example using flashbacks without typing this story. The plot has developed poorly, and the characterization makes it difficult to distinguish between who and the part they play. Most of the films have some uncertainty, but the scene where the main playwright deliberately takes the virtual stranger to his house, then only to go up (where he says he will get a call), the gun he was brought with, it is very difficult to call the police Was there. Something very poor in cinematography: we were watching 42 TVs, so much more than that, how little a person can work in what is happening in the whole dark scenes, and more.
