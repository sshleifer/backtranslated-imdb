My love this movie is bad. I was totally confused by my local movie review because it is a certified garbage. Yes, yes, good boys wear white, bad boys wear black ... and good boys always win. Now go home and hug your kids, and think of how well you've felt in Hollywood. Blech! I can not believe this is the brain's dead movie made by Wace Craven. I guess he needs a little money to mortgage, so he made this goat. This is a kind of production that shows regular movies, they believe they can do better or better than an experienced manager. <br /> <br /> Yes, a bad guy wants a sweet girl to love her dad's a bad isle 'bad thing or he will hit her parents. But Mrs. Olly American girl is the door next door, we know that that day she will live and kill the bad guys ... the end. Girl Power Rox. <br /> <br /> Now, let's just find an idiot ... "A roller coaster ride," just leave something new or new. The "super-duper" reviews you see on this site are industry hacks that make money by closing this flick, or selling their soul to Satan. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> MacAdams is beautiful .... Yes, that's it. Not a good performance, an awesome one ... He's just cute. To save this film, she needs to show up on the skin. She is not difficult enough to lead a very good female staff. <br /> <br /> Silian Murphy was at least 28 days passed at least. But here he is not a smart villain saying a smart one. He kicked 5'5 'McAdam, because he was a cheerleader and a field hockey player ... and I'm sure he is all the owner of the tapes. So he should be able to kick the shit out of an international terrorist for rent. I will not trust him to steal a pack of gum from 7-11. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie was done before, it was done before it was done well. Do not re-hire any of the die-hard movies. You loved loved ones, loved international terrorists, letters are more favorite and trustworthy and bad people are more capable and attractive I can not easily understand how Hollywood can continue such shit, as they are unaware of suitable models that can be easily copied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> I said,
