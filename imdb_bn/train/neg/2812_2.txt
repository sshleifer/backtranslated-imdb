I recently saw this film in a film festival. It is a former alcoholic unemployed romance, which is just a big depression and a middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I made the story very easy and completed the clich√©s, took the film's 'social' theme and made it into romance comedy. The main actor did a good job, he certainly looked like a drunken man, but Anna said she is not as trustworthy as a working class woman, she sees, works and talks a lot like a 'high permanent' woman. I mean that Anna Bella played herself. He does it all his movies anyway. The whole Mais-N-view of the film was very poor. Photography ugly, do not use good to all panoramic ratio proportions. Dialogue is fully scripted and most of the time sounds dull. Comic situations are ideal to Gomez Perera, but in this case they are not all fun and are poorly solved. This picture is not valuable in my opinion. If you really like previous movies of Perra, you can enjoy it a little bit. However, I left the theater because I felt that I was wasting my time. The filmmaker was by the door. When I see a director walking outside of his film, I think, especially one that is made to please everyone.
