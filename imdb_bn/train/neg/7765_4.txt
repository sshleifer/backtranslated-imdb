Curious, almost all critics are very positive about this movie. It has been Chamberlain and Curtis since 1975 and has repeatedly performed very bad and apologized to the story in a harmonious way? <br /> <br /> Perhaps some people got this image due to reading this book? (I did not read the book, but I do not think it's a problem, filmmakers do not think the audience read this book). <br /> <br /> Or are I unconsciously bothered about English-speaking actors trying to behave as their French opponents?
