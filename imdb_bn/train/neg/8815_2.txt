Yes, I'm just going to tell you about this so you do not read if you want to wonder. I got this one with the title Christmas Evil. There was another Christmas horror in the movie named Silent Night, Bloody Knight. Silent Night, Bloody Night (Silent Night, Do not Get Confused with Deadly Night) had many potential and it was very good, it was not good at all. This makes Villen enough attractive (if you can call him) looking at neighboring kids and writing books about those who are naughty and beautiful, but after some time you are looking for some steps and the film is not distributed. You need to character development, but this goes overboard and you're not sure why the junk hack is still. Within one hour, he killed four people and a group of people wanders in terror, and those who kill them are not his goals, they just make fun of him. This killer is one of many failed attempts to knock the naughty. Then he tried to try and kill this other man, and he tried to break himself in the place of fire and break his house. She immediately stuck and just managed to get out. Then he entered through the basement and then tried to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom. He can not kill this person in such a way, so he holds a star from the tree and throws it in the throat. Did the head even have a tree in a bedroom first place? Oh yes, before the assassination of a killer a party closed off and there was some fun. Well, the people of the city follow him with a torch and with his brother, and without the tone he wants to play. What was that about? He talked about something that has never been explained. This is how you end up asking, since I have spoilers I would tell you. He closed his van road and earns, well just say it was the hair !!!!!!!!!!!
