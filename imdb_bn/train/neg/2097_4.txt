I was expecting a lot from the Blaster Galactica franchisee. The main series is very annoying prequel. After the first 30 minutes, I was waiting to finish it. Characters speak a lot about religion, computer, programming, punishments ... gangster, mafia type, who manage hits. However, there is no real series action to offset slow parts of Crimea. <br /> <br /> Give some helpful tips to you while watching movies: As a general rule, if too excessive is too exploitative title, then you know the movie will be an ugly. Caprica has lots of these. Directors / writers usually try to compensate for their poor ability by throwing some nude bodies. It never works and it's all involved (very young) actors and I feel sorry for them. Director / writer who should be banned from this business. <br /> <br /> If you want to be annoyed for about one and a half hours, rent the Mapica. If you really want to see nude bodies, there is nets (free) porn. Otherwise, move along, nothing to see here.
