Do you see a movie when you see a movie that tries to make a serious, worrisome piece of the piece broken and unfortunately fails? When you can not help but laugh at your screen teasing trash terrible terrible nature? The "House of the Dead" also struggles to achieve the level of this lower class. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, "The House of the Dead" moves you to revive this feeling as you awoke to find that the cat jumped nicely on your forehead when you were sleeping. From the beginning it is clear that female actors have been cast for the size of their clauses (which they use shamefully), and for men their "kick-ass" attitude is for men. I did not really take care of any letter for a moment in the film and actually found myself in my own death desire so that I could keep a good hour of this torture. Uwe Bowl should consider two-hour footage screenings from the actual game as a movie. At least then will we get good acting ?? However, when faced with the script of this picture, the actor can not be blamed for making a strong film, as a challenge. It is controversially the worst part of the film, and in fact there are lines like this: "These are zombies, pure and easy" and "no caps", we will not have to go there! It's bad! "<br /> <br /> We all know that Jabby films do not seem to be either enthusiastic or full of meaning; The best stars are two hours of action, blood and closet terrorism, trash, yes, but entertaining trash. It is not like a trash to get out of the bag, which runs across the room, and puts your shoes on milk cartons on the farm and decays black skin. According to MDB, "Dead of Hood" has received a bad reviews that no Danish movie was bought, if we could have only one right. <br /> <br /> Final score: 1/10.
