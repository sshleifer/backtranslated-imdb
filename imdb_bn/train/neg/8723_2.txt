Very bad film Very, very, very bad film. This is a rareness, but it is not defenitly underestimated below the victim. This Italian jaw rip-off often produces little sense and gives no idea about rest. "Drug" is not all believers, and many sub-plots go anywhere. If it is in the local video store, you might want to see if you are a fan of giant movies, but it is not disciplined.
