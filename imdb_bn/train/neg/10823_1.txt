I do not like to use the word "horror" to describe any of the film, for which time, effort, talent and money are spent a lot, but Jeffrelli's attempt to accept Cheltut Brent's novel 'Janere' is a waste of time Roughly <br /> <br /> This script is a lack of fascination and power, everything explains the uncertain posture to the audience, leaving imagination a little less. The main actors are unfortunate miscast, clearly rented for their star name, and the musical score is drippy and dull. Charlotte Gainsberg and William Hart have absolutely no chemistry with each other. She is more like a wet Noodle than Jon Fontaine, who should have a story of at least frustration, to correct some of her mental involvement. And William Hart played the entire film in a voice and the sound is flat and powerless. Of course, lamps and bogus scripts do not help any other performer try to live a vivacious life in this flicker. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Fairfax of Joan Plathhey is like making some Disney, who is popping up to best satisfy the scene. <br /> <br /> There is no mystery around Rochester's first wife's story. Eli McPherson will play the second role played like a Barbie doll, it's an empty cipher <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She has cast as Mrs Fairfax as well. Only Amanda Route as Jane's preferred school teacher expressed any real sympathy or credibility. <br /> <br /> I watched this version of 'Jane Jane' I watched Rabindranath made in 1997 for British television, starring General Sieron Hendes, Samtha Morgan and James Jones. There is no comparison. Young's essential, romantic and deeply moving version is an explosive Nova compared to Jeffrey's Wet Skew. [<br /> <br /> <br /> I'm interested in watching the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton, about which I've read something good on this web site. I am amazed by how many people have liked the book of Jaffrelli's Yorkshire picture book. <br /> <br /> I can say good about this picture that the room is beautiful and cinematography is completely colored, yet it is a complete bud.
