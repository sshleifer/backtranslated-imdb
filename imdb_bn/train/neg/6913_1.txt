Believe me or not, "The Woodchipper genocide" gave me full gonorrhea! All right, there is a sunny cloud from me, because a group of kids are walking around with Camcoder and in no way have contracted and distributed the Devil. Middle intelligence is beyond my understanding of how anyone can tolerate this pant-load of a film. The only reason I could have sat by the whole thing (not even with the attempt of suicide) was because of the first shutdown, I was excited with the annoyance, and secondly - I guess I wanted to hate this newly discovered hatred I feel ... About the movie about "Shot-on-Video" "Awesome / Comedy", about three siblings who spend their weekend in the care of their wicked old aunt Second Little baby apparently kicked the old lady with her rambo-replica predatory knife. Then they could snatch aunt with various tools (apparently there was no blood drop in her body!) And kept her father in a rented wood chip ... her guilty boy stopped looking for her mother. The kids are also eating that jackass ... I have never seen a cast of boring actors, which actually made me nauseate. Seriously, that a blonde chick's voice was constantly winningcing in pain. All the actors were neutrally violent - literally, only their impressive conversation shouted and shiny jokes, written by a chip, which is not just taking care! Now, I can generally appreciate the independent effort, but only those who can realize that other than their relatives are seeing it! It does not need to find a painful, painful, long long hair montage with a 3-minute shot on the car and a somewhat ridiculous, impressive music. Plus, why is there a bloody piano in this movie box? There was a piano in one scene and someone was killing it around! I'm through with reminiscing about this movie. Unless you like helpless cones, I suggest someone with half the brain to avoid this trash.
