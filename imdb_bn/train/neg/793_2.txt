I was not sure how to rate this movie, because it was so bad that it was really fun. I'm not a gaet fan, though he is intelligent, even though he is in a strange mask like listening to tastes like cats. Although I always think Hyde was talented, an interesting album of faith <br /> <br /> But here about the people. This movie is ridiculous. It's on top and illogical so it's almost like a parody of supernatural action films. <br /> <br /> There is no plot around here except the vampire with gangster friends. In this case, this picture reminds me about Spider-Man 3, how many ideas were there, so there was not enough time to concentrate on one of them. <br /> <br /> Action scenes were ridiculous. Quick editing, is almost difficult to understand, with so much ridiculous in dancing photography. Although the Hayed action scene looked very stylish, this is the only release of this movie. I am a sucker for good action movies, but the action is done horribly. Although the final shootout was just right and this is the highlight of this depressing movie otherwise. <br /> <br /> It's not a good thing, it keeps jumping into style. It wants to be a drama, or an action flash, or a horror, or a romance ... what <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why does this review make you crazy? Because the Gate and Hayed Your Love? Do not fool yourself, this movie is bad.
