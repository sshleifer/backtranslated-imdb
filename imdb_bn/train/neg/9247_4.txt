"The Bank" (1915, Chaplin) "The Bank" is one of the films of Charlie's 1915 assassination. Although compared to 1914, these groups of movies are even more spectacular, it's a little less than an average. The general double combo-locked vault and the ultimate fate of the end of the challenge is that Charlie is waking up from a dream, in which she is pushing the head woman's hair, holding only the back of the head of a mupp that she used as a cocoon pillow is both classic chaplin moment. They are both wicked start and end. The middle rival is filled with fellow janitor and a bank robbery for the girl's victory is filled with busting. MOP is perhaps the greatest physical phenomenon of this film and Charlie uses it for the characteristic characteristic, although it is not intended to be its character or not. Mop Charlie seems to be arrogant instead of doing what he wants to do but not by his own hands. Interesting thing but there are good.
