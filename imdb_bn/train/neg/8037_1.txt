All right, a slash movie. A very, very stupid slashher movie. <br /> <br /> We are going to go home things to your stereotypical teenagers. We've got an FBI agent who has watched Wendy Harry many times. "So what's the secret .... punks?" We have around 4 different little camera shots and no knowledge of that scene. "Hey Man, I'm fixing the spinners" ((That guy was my favorite part of the movie)) Suddenly there is a preacher on a sofa to watch the movie, he died. <br /> <br /> They follow the killer somewhere in the middle, with no police. Suddenly he was wearing a wedding dress, in a church. I swear that I've never seen this stupid slash movie.
