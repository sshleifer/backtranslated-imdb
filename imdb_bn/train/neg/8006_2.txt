How does this film work well and combines with fun and drama in a unique way in action and horror, which gives the audience more emotion than a common horror movie. Unfortunately, talking about stories, frustrating plot-holes, and contradictory scenes, this film mainly disappoints me and is the "greatest giant film of all time". <br /> <br /> Start with a good thing: comedy, acting and special effects. From Get-go, this movie starts off quickly and shines off. The first scene - the giant's source - the campus and the rapidly revered, classic 'environmental' disaster that has spawned many other monsters. পেন্সিং দ্রুত, যা অন্যান্য দৈত্য ফ্লিকার থেকে দীর্ঘ এবং প্রায়শই বিন্দুহীন নাটকীয় খোলার দৃশ্য থেকে একটি স্বাগত বিরতি ছিল এবং চলচ্চিত্রটিকে সরাসরি অ্যাকশন-এ অ্যাক্সেস করতে দেয়। Within 10 minutes, why you 'why', 'where,' and how 'animal' will be ready for action. This image is distributed. /> <br /> Another small and well-shot sequence <br after the characters are presented: lazy boy and his troubled younger daughter, brother, grandfather, and talented sister (aunt), and, of course, the giant. Characters are presented in the context of each other and their conflicts are instantly visible, the spectators will be able to feel for them when the giant suddenly gets to the river areas where they live and work. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> প্রাণীর প্রভাব অন্যের কাছে দ্বিতীয় নয় এবং যদিও এটি অদ্ভুত মনে হয় তবে এটি বিশ্বাসযোগ্য এবং কোনও মুহুর্তে আপনি এটির স্ট্রিং দেখতে পাচ্ছেন না। Even the giant movement was also known, such as giant barrels through the crowd, like the rising and excited Rattuillar on the linoleum, overflowing on the surface, crushing and eating them in its way. When the path of the giant intersects with family and tragedy, it is a painful moment and you can feel the need of retaliation, but start appealing to the movie appeals. <br /> <br /> After the start of dynamite, quickly focus on the movie and lose the continuity. Plot lines are introduced, then abandoned, the letters do not change their position for a clear reason, and the comedy is divided into a trick in a dramatic scene, when the barriers are displayed and randomly disappear in random conditions. <br /> <br /> For jokes, let me tell it: I want to admit that many humor is probably cultural. I'm not familiar with Korean humor, so the translations are probably lost. যাইহোক, কলেজের একজন এশিয়ান অধ্যয়নকারী এবং গত 5 বছর ধরে জাপানে বসবাসকারী এমন একজন ব্যক্তি হিসাবে (এখনও এখানে) আমি গড় সাদা লোকের তুলনায় এশিয়ান হাস্যরসের উপর আরো ভালভাবে উপলব্ধি করতে চাই। It is said that I understand many parts of the movie, it seems funny, but I did not have it. /> <br /> For example *********** ************* spinner <br: After the initial attack, the boy was lost, the funeral of the family; Everyone is mourning. A new character is introduced - a brother - and the tension increases, because it has become clear that the two brothers disagree with each other. Both of them started to apologize for their losses and compete against each other for hardship. It's original, fun in this competition: Two brothers hate each other, even they compete in a funeral - it shows an interesting nature of family love fork in the Asian comedy. This funniest snap-stick comedy family and funny fun is considered fun fun fun but, in the context of a lost little girl really was finding the place. *************************************************************************** Last spinner *** This movie has brought so many points that are not explained, or worse, are interpreted and ultimately defective to prove to be neutral and vain. Finding an obstacle can not be a good thing for a character, but you need to expect some comments on that nature. পরিবর্তে শ্রোতাগুলি 'ক্লিমেক্স'-এর মুহূর্তের দ্বারা বাজেয়াপ্ত হয় যখন সমস্যাগুলি' এখন নেই 'আর কোনও একটি ইঙ্গিত দেয় না যে এটি কখনই কোনও সমস্যা হতে পারে। So I ask you: Even why bring it to the first place? <br /> <br /> This was common through cinema because the problems were raised in the new problem and suddenly the world of this movie was filled with anti-competitive power, which was not resolved by one another. Of course, introduction of new and larger problems is a time-tested story telling tradition, but if the new pressure begins, then there is another compulsory shortening if you get the full explanation of at least the new pressure. This is not the movie. Instead, if you've got a lot of stories, then only 20% of the ways have been explained to everyone, and in the end, they never take part in completing the parts completely. <br /> <br /> Again, I would like to acknowledge that this can be very 'cultural'. Perhaps its Korean story- to say the tradition to keep the comedy inside a tragedy. Maybe everything is simple for the story, like a child who paints out of line on each page, but never ends. Perhaps it is okay to present a problem for the development of the plot, but then without any solution or catharsis, the problem should be removed randomly. Or perhaps it seems to be a movie fiction and disguise all of bad stories, which is a better reputation than this.
