This movie is the only release of the fairness of the original death scene. The other that this movie is a big dud. We have booming Kim, housewife housewife gradually through local mall for the first 30 minutes. The movie, which added nothing. Then the film has grown slightly, since it has 4 birds who took away two parking spaces in the busy Christmas Eve. After trying to help the local security guard, they started running away from him. This movie is bad from there, way bad. I know it's only a movie and you will go with the flow but she's got about 5 minutes. Headstust and nobody can hide or find her. Instead he runs a half-built subdivision beside a forest. Usually he can allow his followers to easily track him that he can do everything. But now he turns into one hard Mofu. You get points. Do not buy or rent this movie in any situation, why you like this. It's so absurd that you will be interrogating each scene. It's boring and embarrassing for consumers as well as Craig Chefter and the rest Cast.
