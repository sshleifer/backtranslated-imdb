I'm sure Operation Dames was favorite in drive-ins days. There is absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you preoccupied otherwise. And if you want to get the mood for other activities, you have some curvaceous castes on the screen to get you the mood. <br /> <br /> No, there is nothing left for Operation Dames which is going for it. . It was established in the Korean War, where a Platoon of GIS together with British Tommy goes a bit further and needs to return to the UN lines. Already very bad, but these guys came across a helpless bunch of US girls and their dancing books in the same situation. <br /> <br /> What is sad about this picture is that the generation of women has finally been adopted to take military and war situations. This bibbole woman from the US released the light year to release the mother. Actually the sergeant in charge of this man can not even put professional soldiers in his pants. <br /> <br /> But it's probably better to remind you what was driving. For No name of this name is good with me, none of them have any recognition for personal effort. <br /> <br /> Operations dames certainly flop a team.
