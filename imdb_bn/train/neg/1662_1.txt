I have never seen one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like the TV play movie looks like a reserve dog. It's trash, except for reasonable performance from Virginia Madsen (I hope you have paid well) to save it based on one and only Britney Spears and her mother's book. The story of a red throat country, Gil, which gets a scholarship in a prestigious music school, is small but a car for padding music of Mr. Spears's pants, and generally agrees that the computing must be the way. There is nothing good with all the bits as predicted on the next day. Never again
