This movie . . I do not know. Why would they take a mirror like PP Longstocking and throw the singular glossy Tamie Irin, I never know. Why not spend money on industrial aspects and some bad-worst special effects, then do not bother to edit it properly, I will never know. Why never set and costume is sometimes in time, and sometimes not strange, why they have commissioned so many bad songs, why the script does not make sense (even fools, not even the children's film level). . . . What did they think ?? It should be as nothing about this movie. Every single part is dubbed (and always weakened), the effect of each sound is slightly wrong, each edit is in the wrong place, each performance is bad in some ways. It manages to create a suitable atmosphere in spite of all problems, but it is the creation of Astrad Linden, which does not contain magic.
