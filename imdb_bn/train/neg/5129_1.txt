This movie's message is "more important than a personality". Ginny Garofulo is considered "ugly ducking", but the interesting thing is that she is not all ugly (she is actually more compelling than Uma Thurman, friend who looks like a model). <br /> <br /> Now, would this film work if "ugly duckling" was really vague? When will the hythode stop by this hypocrisy? <br /> <br /> In my opinion, despite the fact that it wants to release the message, this movie is simply ridiculous. <br /> <br />
