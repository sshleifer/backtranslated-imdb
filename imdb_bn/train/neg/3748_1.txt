... but it's not just working and I'm surprised to see how many people consider it good. On what basis? Here and there are some loose indications, but the whole element is self-motivated and incredible. Lynch movies are usually confusing because they create confusion ideas and still very playful when doing it. There are some visual concepts, some subpages, letters, ideas, etc., but it is neutral and yes, vain. Whereas to explore is either "small" is either too remote, or simply told before in a superior manner. It's just searching for Lynch DV, and nothing else should be treated like this. 1/10
