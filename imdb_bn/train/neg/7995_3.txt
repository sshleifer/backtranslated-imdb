I used to look at this movie when I was a kid, but I could not remember the title, then I was going through a scary movie and I found myself "It's titled?" This film is a low-volume disaster film / insect attack film, with a significant number of stars. This is also a bit annoying because it has television VBs where you can see the movie being commercial and faded for them. There is such sort of plot being attacked by ants. I think they were annoyed by the construction or going around some nearby, but that does not quote me. The most memorable antatek for me on the whole of Flickr is the first one to fall into the swimming pool after swimming in the swimming pool and certainly the scene of the Samaris attack. And what's standing in it is very stupid, where survivors use cardboard tubes to breathe. In the end, like most television movies, this film is very rare and not very scary, until you look at the pest.
