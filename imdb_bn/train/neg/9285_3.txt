I think it seems like I have chosen to choose the new Jet Li film for a little while, but holding hands with a painful hand in hand, I grabbed this title. Unfortunately, this movie has more gun battles (Ala Chu Yun Fat) but better than nowhere near), than Jat Lee and the company's sudden battle. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I would recommend Enforcer on this disagreement, even though this is Libyanand, so Chi Chi, even on this disagreement. <br /> <br /> Ratings for martial arts 4 Ratings for total movie scores
