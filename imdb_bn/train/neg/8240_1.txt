Do not waste your time on this! Unless you want to study it for all the wrong things, you should not make a good film. I'm usually the one to review a movie, but it's private. I wasted valuable time in which they could not return. I feel obliged to write this report to warn others that these nasty observers are not wasting their time. It was a student project, I would not say bad, but only for the first 15 minutes ... after that it gets annoying. Scream, bad audio, bad video (a good camera guy can be a lot better). And yes, what's with the effect of Blair-Witch? No budget I was expecting it to get better, but it's not. Now how is it 4 a worthy? 2 more matches but 1 time to waste my time! I told my peace.
