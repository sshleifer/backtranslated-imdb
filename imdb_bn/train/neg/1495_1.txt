At the age of 5 I saw Hirer's movie, which was started from Children's Play. Since then, I have seen a horror movie and bad, but the question is, I've never seen the dumfest movie! Actors can do all of the material they have. The plot was just stupid. Plus, it was just all poor. I can bleed so much, but it was ridiculous! In one scene, a character is thrown in the back and sinks with its intestines! Simple stupid! Another problem with this movie is its annoying and perhaps the slowest movie. It's just stupid to end. But then again, it goes with the rest! Finally, when the girl gets away from the cannabal / ancestor, she gets help from an old lady. The old lady made tea, but when she was about to talk to the girl, the girl attacked him! She turned into a cancer! Disabled Movies
