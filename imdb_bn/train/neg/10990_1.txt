I ended up watching this whole (very long) movie because I was fascinated by the uninterrupted stupidity and stupidity. It is difficult to believe that so famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gilgold, Basrio de Sica, etc.) participated voluntarily in this fate. But perhaps the man in 1968 * was so stupid? Plot seems to be written by some confused Latin American Marxist pastor with an agenda. There is a Director General conflict and the Russians are actually good people, the general secretary of the Communist Party, is a wonderful and spiritual person who suddenly sees light after 20 years and freeing the prisoner, it is compelled to ease his bad conscience. Priests from a Siberian Gulag. Then the priest eventually became a Pope. We have been allowed to see the secret Vatican Papal voting process, which you might imagine most of the mountainous religious figures. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Chinese Communists have earned half of their hungry common socialist economic miracle. Country of death In order to resolve this small hike in the path of communicating towards communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to properly distribute Western capitalist wealth to the poor workers of China). <br /> <br /> Our good old Comrade General Secretary became a little worried and said to the Pope. They meet with Chinese leader Comrade Peng, who looks and works for a boy who is 15 years old. In 1968, what would be the chilling people like China talk about? Comrade Peng claims that the Western capitalists must pay (which is quite logical after all, or is the capitalists always paid for the madness of the socialists)? And the Pope has to say something for the common cause of the cause of equality and social justice. br> <br /> So when Pope is defeated in Rome, he is Catholic to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christendom Make a pledge of the entire wealth of the church. And thus he protected the Earth from the nuclear holocaust. There are some sub-plots along with <br /> <br />, which provides little to free the incredibly bad movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> He is much more logical as Greek Zorba.
