This movie was terrible. The end was absolutely horrible. There was no plot in the movie. The only thing that was true about the movie was Robert Duval and James Earl Jones. Their performance was excellent! The only problem was that the film did not make any judgments of their performance. The half of the script will come near the capture of decent stories, it will be worth watching. Instead, the performance of Robert Duval and James Earl Jones is completely a horror story ... or wasted on his own deficit. I could not wait to watch a movie for the film to be produced .... good movie ... just there is no conversation between characters that is not finished for absolutely any reason. It was nothing more than ordinary conversations that came back in that period. There was nothing special about the characters. How Robert Duval illustrates an angry, generous, drunk, old man is only one thing. The ending of the entire movie does not happen as well. After the film's ending, I was surprised ... I was surprised to see that while I was watching the film, I was waiting for some interest to sit through the whole film. It never happened! The story of the characters started rolling suddenly, and the movie was over, and I realized that I saw a plot of 2 hours of my life and a movie without any meaning. It was not even a story. The whole movie is worth a day's worth. That's it. It was a day of some Southerners (and death) on one of the plants. Which story can be done in a day (except film training day)? The entire casting performance was extraordinary, but they were almost completely lost due to the disappointment of the movie ... if you can call it a movie.
