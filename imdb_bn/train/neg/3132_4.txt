I've seen such a fantastic rating on IMDB, but I did not see it because I'm a big fan of biblical content. The first thing that bothered me was that Indiana Jones Wangbe Movie, but it also seems that the comedian Van Dien did not see those Jones movies (but he should). I believe he did his best, but the script is simply stunk The music tries to be very Jones Style. Great work, but it seemed to work a lot for this movie, as the part of the video did not deserve that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but anyway the script is bringing down everything. "Jokes" old school, somewhere 20 years old; They brought only laughable smile to my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic. Kevin Vinhouc probably had a good idea of ​​the story (my opinion, but I like these stories), but things did not work at all. Maybe his head was fresh when he should have it on a paper. When I see (in the first minute) that this film is going to be 'one of the low budget movies', I hope I can hear at least 'good', but sometimes movies are frustrating.
