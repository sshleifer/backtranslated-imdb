This movie is sorry for investing in my 90 minute life, which I will never return. The compound is really fun - basically it shakes a zombie from a strange perspective. Unfortunately, they fail to provide a compulsory story within this framework. The life of the central character can be associated with the reality of almost helpless unity film, but it sets out all entertainment standards if they try a bit more to engage with the audience, but they do more to enhance social commentary.
