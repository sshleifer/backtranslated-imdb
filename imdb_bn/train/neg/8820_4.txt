As I go into such a movie, I had hoped something absolutely entertaining without a whorder to kill ..... I was less than that. <br /> <br /> On the eve of Christmas 1947 a child witness is a Santa sue when parents are doing it. Fear, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. The story begins 33 years later and Harry Stelling is your usual daily Joe ... .................................. ................................................. The boss makes him fun, he becomes insane, sends like a santa and kills non-Santa patrons and his boss. A helpless neighbor can catch him and just as he is going to torch him, he has removed his van from the moon ..... <br /> <br /> This is a slow, annoying film that was not a freedom fighter , When Harry was convicted by tourists of the church. There was hardly any gore and even the "sex" scenes were pulled down. <br /> <br /> Very annoying ...... 10 out of 4
