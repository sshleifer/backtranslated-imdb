This show is awful. No comedy, no good character in any plot. America is giving you blind show prizes. I hate this show along 30 rocks. They are very happy they are honestly canceling this show. Thanks CBS Put one and a half men, keep Christine, keep the rules of involvement how I will meet your mother which is not funny, but much more interesting than that. This show closes a rip of friends. So exactly with the same director. But this show has gone and it does not bring it back. Sometimes sometimes The only reason I could not give it 1 rating because it kept me awake instead of sleeping. These are the types of movies or TV shows that I provide. I was still the only reason to wake up because of audience laughter and I was waiting for the next show. I'm really sorry to show this show but my opinion is stupid. Stupid I do not see why everyone loves it. My opinion again But I find kinda stupid big lip theory. My bad smart Classes Bye Now I have a smile and it is not from watching your show.
