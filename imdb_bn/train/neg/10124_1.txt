This serial has no mystery! When an episode ends, the act is so embarrassing, the effects are so poor and the script is so awful that Batman and Robin will save the last thing in your mind. No, in fact, the last thing in your mind is watching the next episode! This program is so annoying that I can not see how I created it, let alone the DVD! Clearly, the effects are not compatible with contemporary Batman films, even the script is awful. Some evil professors and an inconsolable babbling mess about something like a ray gun or something like that, I'm pretty sure to follow, because very horrible. See the 60th edition, or see the versions of the 90s, or even the batman starts, just a few in this version!
