drss1942 really took the right word to my face. I like Seagal's early films and still feel like him who is faithful to him. I saw this movie (well, I was sleeping in 90%, so I did not see the last one). When I got up and saw that I was in the DVD menu, I was grateful that I did not present myself on any film and did not have the courage to find out what had happened at the end. There was something strange about Segal and others' voices. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Mac where the voice was doped, but in the same language (Austrian English, okay?) However, if I have 10 organs then they will now point to Segal's injustice.
