I've just created one episode ("Crook End"). The dialog was suppressed and cringe right down right. The acting was tragic. Ion Bailey, despite his best efforts to be dramatic, remains largely unkempt. Her eyebrows indicate at a recent botox treatment. Claire Forlani can only play a virgin in an uninterrupted movie. Characters were cartoons, most shuffle of each conspiracy, furious plot playing their stereotypical cog. Sugar can exceed the special effects TV miniseries budget. But the effort to create suspense and surprises through the confusion of films added to the unintended. I feel that the finishing was considered surprising and surprising, but it was a long time and there was little to do with the rest of the story. If I have to compare the overall quality of my other content, then I will keep this episode of NBC's Hercules equivalent of "Nightmares and DreamSpace".
