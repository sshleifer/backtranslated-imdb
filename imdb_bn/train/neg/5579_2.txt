60's is an occasional entertainment movie, this entertainment mostly laughs in movies. It is very uneven, and has many boring elements. Take the switch between black and white for example, and color. If done properly, it can be fairly effective, but due to poorly done it becomes a boring form and is already separated from the bad experience; In most of the movie it was a strange feeling. The acting was not bad enough for TV Flick, but again it was embarrassing at another time. Most of the incidents were not consistent and becoming confusing. How did this family end in the big event in the 1960's? The last was very sad for my taste; Because it was Hollywood, everything had to end. I suggest you to waste your time in the 60's and do something else with your time. I'm glad I saw this in class, and not my own time. I think I can safely say that the best part of the film was Bob Dillon's music. Those who just thought of rambling me over the storm I hope you accept my advice, and stay away from this.
