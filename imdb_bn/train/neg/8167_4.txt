Forest is not just your daily standard slash / backwood cannibal rental, it is also an interesting mix of supernatural elements. The story is about two couples growing in the forest of camping trip. A cave dwellings, cannibalistic woodsmen and his dead wife's scurvy and two children soon will soon have their terror There is something you do not see every slasher. Director Dawn Jones received an "A" for the effort, although the film simply flatten on every level, acting is simply the average, except Javat Kelly, who plays the deceased wife of Woodsman (Michael Brady Uk Gary Kent). <Br> <br /> A couple open with some beautiful shots hiking through a valley and a forest. They are very late stalking to anyone that is too late. They are usually passed in the slasher fare both. Our murderer uses a trustworthy knife knife throughout the whole film, during its flatback when he uses a handle, pitchfork and harmful sari blade to send his cheating wife to the boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The forest has good stories but the movie does not work along just because I found it quite annoying with simply acting crappy. 4/10
