This film was a big disappointment in portraying aspects, intellectuals, plot and its content. It is a slow moving movie set which is like an episode of Wonder Years, although there is a lack of depth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> According to the makers of this movie, 'Beauty' can be enjoyed only in Bob-Styles Kittsky Landscape painting. Good art can be achieved according to this film by using color theory and many feelings of basic (e.g., elementary school level). Film abusive in some parts, e.g. At one point, it is said (rather, celebrated with a dance on the table) that mentally challenged people are not able to express their emotions or express them through painting, using their work as worthless 'bulshit' (quote). <br /> <br /> I do not understand that this movie can get such a high rating, then many people have not rated it so far, and they chose only for very high or very low grade.
