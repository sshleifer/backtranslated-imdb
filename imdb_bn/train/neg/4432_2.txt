Tat Daniel is about a terrible old hag, who desperately hurts his lover and sensed family. There may be some data about the colonial past in France, but most of them are doing Daniel things (as deliberately abandoning a small child in a park), which will soon take a tow from a person with a broken finger. Sorry, that does not happen here. It looks good and acting is fine and there is really no mistake with the concept, but it is only SMUG. God, love yourself this movie. Sad it is not nearly as tricky or as fun as it seems. The only inspiration for the show - sorry, the movie - coming from Daniel to Nestor and Nassari, and the only surprise is that he comes to see the increasingly unlikely ways. That's right: Just like a sitcom, this is the added bonus of 'Bonus' and 110 minutes running time for Mahima confusion.
