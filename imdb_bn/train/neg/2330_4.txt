I like how I started with some special effects for a 50-year-old film. There were some pretty impressive scenery. However, the film bogs down very quickly with several stupid conversations as men try to flirt with all of Anne Francis "Altaira Morbius.") <br /> <br /> After the long absence of '90s to see it, it was fun to see Frankis again, this actress has played since the end of most television shows ... and still acting. It was interesting to see a young woman Leslie Nielsen ("John John J Adams"), which I would not recognize, this is not for this voice. <br /> <br /> I saw half before the annoyance and the movie was almost awesome and I went to sleep There was strong will. I appreciate doing this VHS tape again in their stereo. But it was a weak attempt. This is a supernatural film "Elite", so "heavy" and "anxious-provocative". That's a fad It only appeared as "intelligent" because the remaining 50 'Si-Fi movies were so stupid! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps another look - this time at 2.35: 1 WideScreen transfer, I have to change this review.
