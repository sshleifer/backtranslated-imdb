I love Gishar's memory so I read the book twice; It's one of the best books I've read last year. I was waiting for the movie and was scared that reading the book would avoid the pleasure of seeing the movie. I was not expecting that the movie was bad. The best part of the book was dropped from the film and the letters were weak with Hatsamomo (Lee Gong). If I do not read the book, this movie will be a little confusing and predictable. Outline the plot of the film "Nita Saeedi told how she crossed her fishing ..." Did anyone see how Saipi had become Nita Saiful? Forget the movie and read the book.
