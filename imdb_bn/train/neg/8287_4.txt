A television version of this story is very much, the film has started like an episode of 'Shanna ...', which means a little meaningful dialogue or character. It gets a little more capital after a while, but all the characters are still cartoons. <br /> <br /> Salma foreign beauty Richard Harris blows up a scourge in Frollo, Salma, an evil and sexual abuse. Other characters including Quasimodo are quite forgotten. <br /> <br /> This is also an unreleased version of the story, the suppressor of the Fro≈Ço enlightened ideals, such as Abbott in the Rose name and the champion of Casimoado independence. The shadowy aspect of the Kas character is ignored, even though he poured fluid on people. He is really an outsider and he is separated and enjoy playing with bells over the average person. Perhaps this movie is scheduled for children, but I suspect that Froollo feels himself bloody to correct his own monkey to be trapped. A mostly uninteresting and forgotten, but not terrible, and sometimes entertaining, story-changing.
