Cow dung is an absolute steam pile. It is to me Manmohan that this picture has even been created. Hip-hop and old westerns just do not seem to mix. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The film makes a ridiculous stock of their entire career. The chick from prejudice should never forgive and he is stripped to any remaining status. After reading the first ten page dialogue, she was asking that her friend is playing this ill joke. After some research, I actually found a list of some other actors passed in this movie: Jada Panket-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardashian, Zenna James, Oprah and finally Marge Simpson. <br /> <br /> Simply tell, I'd rather look at an empty TV than watching this movie.
