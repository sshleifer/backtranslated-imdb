Do you like beautiful girls Yes i What is good to say about beautiful girls / women? Nothing, so why would I give only 2 stars out of 5 of this movie, although Chiyaki Kuriyama and Aya Utto got "talent"? <br /> <br /> If I want to see a really nice person, I want to see MTV or something like that. This is a movie, yet the so-called Action movie. So by definition does it really need a plot? I do not agree 100%, but let's say yes. So what is it needed? Part 1 to 20 minutes of footage (I might be a bit exaggerated, but it felt more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be "no". But again you never know, those who have seen the parts may not know what they can eat for breakfast, so let's remind them ... can they even remind them twice? Just do not forget they forget ... at least the credit roll, finally !!!! <br /> <br /> So about the story, the development of the character, the real passion, about "acting" (and not, I do not think that walking in scotts and / or is not responsible for fighting!) ... that's what Leave? Yes action scene. The action scenes are not bad and because of that I gave 2 stars movie instead of 1! I was giving a chance to this movie, but it's time wasted ... You have good work / look, believe me ...
