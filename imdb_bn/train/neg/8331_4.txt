What a sad mess is "Shiner." I wanted to choose the intention of this on-the-top-of-the-film film, and indeed, there are several moments with strong resonance. Sadly, those moments are few and far away. While trying some of Salons, I appreciate any benefit promoted by a painful bone, a budget cinematography is destroyed with genuine torture, which benefits the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < Especially "straight" couple Linda and young Guy. Nearly everything in this story is the two most vulnerable written letters of the proposal. The acting is so crazy and no actor seems to be able to prevent the smiling or cracking because they gradually drop their lines with lack of expertise. Sticky editing almost gives the impression that these roles were completely ineffective and the films were oddly omitted to avoid the movie throwing a strange homosexual movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> These two most rich characters and Nicholas T. King (Bob) and David Zelinas (Team) offer most rewards with truly captivating performances. The team is a boxer with some serious problems. The pride of significantly less self-esteem is almost impersonated by cartoons that he is dressing like armor. The team appeared with, seemingly ruthless but ultimately vague Bob, classic cat and mouse fashion boxer stalks. When tables are turned and hunters fall, this results in the only real mental catharsis of the film. An image that is artificially rigidly decorated (it is a complimentary) must be repeated in a character (or broken, as it is proven here), and the final clash between Bob and the team gives Jillins and King some realistic chokes. <br /> Playing by Scott Stapp and Derece Neal, Tony and Danny seem to focus on the film, And despite some rare moments of their own (with a real boring scene of sexuality / violence), but they can not escape from a cartoon-like decoration and it is difficult to find a note symphony for them and it is difficult to find something other than Finally this same raw material (and should be used) could be used to tell this story in good fashion. Well, there is nothing to recommend it so far, the performance of Messers King and Jellins really offers something special and a scene and which can be finally seen.
