First off, tell me to start with a quote when my friend said while watching this movie: "The whole film had to be brave." You know, 'Dude, I can not make you the best movie ever' ". With this movie, they made a good effort to achieve this title. The effect, of course, the poor. The plot / conversation is like a collage of bits stolen from any other movie. I'm acting, the actor is supposed to be college. Yet some parts of it (especially at the beginning) it seems to be in high school or middle school. I do not understand it. The scarecrow going around killing people is not enjoyable at least bits. (Spirira: To the end, when they hold down Leicester's name and he reappears, both black people and scarecrow are laughing, perhaps they were in their last scene and impressive dialogue.)
