Clich√©-ridden story of an upcoming divorce - or what? 6-year-old baby with eyes. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub plot and, all the bad, absolutely no payoff, are mentally or dramatically. <br /> <br /> Does anyone else teach creative writing? The real sign of a weak storybook - when you can not create a satisfactory transmission - just complete the story. I was forced to ask, "Do you think this is the story to tell the first story!" <br /> <br /> Good, but destroyed, debut by child actor Anthony de Marco - The rest of the cast was the most forgotten. And they wonder why nobody is watching the indie film! This is the ninety minutes of my life I will not get back.
