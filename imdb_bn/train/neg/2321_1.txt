I can not believe that this show still has 9 ratings out of 10. I can see that those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but after which will it continue to be at its peak? I was a huge fan of 1st fun. I was hooked - all mysteries, mysteries, unexplained facts. You did not know what's going to happen next. By season 2, I was still watching faithfully, but some basic topics were still getting a little disappointing that has been explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it seems like more questions. I love the mystery, but each of you has to throw a bone now and then keep them looking. <br /> <br /> Now, I can not even remember the closure of me, but sometime in season 2, I It was enough. I'm not a big fan of appointment - and you can not miss a part explicitly to stay in what's going on. So, I had no other effort. <br /> <br /> It is embarrassing that they were not a little more intelligent and loyal fans. I agree with some posters that ABC has become greedy and thinks about how long it will take to extend this shot. Do they not think that they will eventually lose more fans than profits?
