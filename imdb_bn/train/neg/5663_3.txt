"Star Trek" films on Jyotichi movies were like movies "Star Trek" - in addition to this, each original was more entertaining and attractive than the big, shiny redesign and was made better, more important than the surface of the substance . If I had never seen them, I would have thought this beautiful but empty; As I was, I thought her style was inappropriate and her content was insufficient. The idea of ​​reviving a large, slicker production letter has been good, but there was no other point than expected to earn money; It is simply a show that fails to capture the character's atmosphere in the world and completely fails before the character completely fails (also, the actor was not his best). I wanted to see Achi in the last phase of life, a story that would see him fascinating and draw some conclusions with his experience; This just rehashes bits and pieces from other sexes, seasoned with sex and sfx violence. Not all the same experiences.
