If this guy can make a movie, I'm sure the hell can do one. <br /> <br /> In fact, if you rent me for the movie then I promised to do the following: <br /> 1) I will add more naked women. There was nobody in this movie I think the horror films of Chess B-Class are only leased due to their traditional exploitation of female body. I do not want to give down my viewers. <br /> <br /> 2) I will refrain from creating too much scenes where the hero can wake up, it's only a dream. I think HorrorVision was about 4 of these scenes. And, considering the film was just an hour long, the dream-to-movie-tall ratio was quite high. And, if I decide to order the dream, then I'll be sure that the person will wake up without clothes. I mean, who is sleeping in a leather pants? <br /> <br /> I will not snatch a movie like Star Wars or Matrix because I know that my budget is small and I do not want to open my masks, adding ridiculous references about them about me is a big budget Hollywood movie. . <br /> <br /> 4) And finally, I will not mix modern technology with the latest technology. I mean, a pilot pilot can only be so scary ... before they blow up the screen or do anything before they become an evil roli-poly monster. <br /> <br /> So, if you are looking at the quality of your next horrible production, rely on me: wanna-b-movie director extraordinaire
