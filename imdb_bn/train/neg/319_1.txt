A friend of mine purchased this image for Â£ 1, and even then it was fairly valuable. Despite the big names like Adam Sandler, Billy Bob Thornton and the incredibly talented Bart Yeong, this movie is fun like cheeses and is often fun like hammering through your irehole. This is used in tired, underserved of barreled comedic tactics - Sandler broke the fourth wall as an interaction with the audience and the relatively stupid montage of the fourth wall. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She wants to make it as a successful comedian to succeed with women. The ship's comedian - disrespectfully known as 'Diki', when the opposite sex seems to be lost in the ocean - due to its tremendous success, Sandler's character Shaker gets his big break. Dickie is not dead, he rather locked in the bathroom, probably the sea is sick. <br /> <br /> She probably flipped the worst film all the time from her face.
