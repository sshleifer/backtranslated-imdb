I read some great reviews here on IMDB and thought that I would give this film an appearance. Frustrated Placing men on the side is good, and some interesting photography but fail to fully believe this movie firmly. It seems that for some meaningful effort to fill the fullness of selfishness but falls short and it is a vague mess in all the pictures. <br /> <br /> This is one of the films categorized as a movie. Silent which can be defined as follows: <br /> <br /> "The silence of a movie is characterized by frustration, lethality, danger, and temperament of the fearful character." Here are the stories: 3 Losses stumble together with their joint problems, including mental illness, alcohol, laziness, lending, and together they kidnap a child and deviate each other. <br /> <br /> There could be a better movie if the character of the kidnapper was less restrictive than the failure of the story. I think the female leadership has come out of its depth and came across as an amateur actress. <br /> <br /> At some good moments, I felt that I had wasted my time. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
