This movie was billed as a comedy and a mystery. It both failed badly. Here's the only mystery why anyone would have such a poorly made movie. The comedy only smiled when I saw how much the readers got here. Can be two movies with the same name? The movie I saw was a pretty blue eyes and a plot that was not there. <br /> <br />
