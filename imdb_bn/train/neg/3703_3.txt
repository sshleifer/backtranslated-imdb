I did not expect much from this picture, but boy and boy, I do not expect this picture to be bad. Chris Rock does not show a good job here, you can not feel the feeling of his character, I think if the film was a bit good then it would be dramatic or not a romantic scene, and a lot less in the movie. / Good humor was involved. Like filmmakers, it's creating a bad hangover. They do not show a single smile in "creating" This is a very bad film! I gave a few smiles, because I gave it, but I never smiled!
