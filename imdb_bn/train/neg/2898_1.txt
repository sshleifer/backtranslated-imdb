Wowwwwww, almost an hour ago I finally finished watching this horrible movie !!! I wanted to close it in the first 10 minutes but I think I want to give it a chance because it has got better. Or at least there are some breakdown qualities, as I have rarely thought it would make you a type movie, or really cute, or very well painted or made in mind ... Needless to say that it was not and I was not even One hour and one half of my life wasted Why I am not going to be terrible because it is a waste of my time that can explain that this could be "harmful" ... IMDB, be calm on the spoiled things and be sure to pay more attention so that people can write good reviews of movie and comment rates Is not paid for or is not involved in any kind of film. I will see this horrible movie defeat, hit the bad rating and I was very frustrated to see a high rating ... All the ratings of the 7-10 stars should definitely be something totally different ... I'm still a big IMDB fan, But seriously, re-evaluate this rating process because the film should be rated 3 times higher than Mayabie.
