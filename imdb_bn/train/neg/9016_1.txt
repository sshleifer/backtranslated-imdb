The first movie of the Dragon Fighter, I've ever seen the original movie (though I think it's called Sipi?). But I saw one or two later, and I can tell you that they were stupid, but it really scraps under the barrel. The CGI has been poorly performed, the script is ridiculous, and what happens in the end is unexpected and goes out of place (if you've seen Dragon Fighter, you probably know what I mean; I do not want my review to be a spoiler). Plus, this was a musical melody that was used in almost every single hazardous sequence. That was really stupid; They just played over over. And it's definitely not the original; I know that I've heard somewhere before (just where I can not remember). It's one to avoid
