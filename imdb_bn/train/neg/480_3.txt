2 stars for Kay Francis - he's wonderful! Warner Bros had thrown his way and this horrible Tripe was not deserved! <br /> <br /> Based on this movie the two-thinner hardness is extremely ridiculous and incredible. Kay is a small town wife and mother eager to do something big: She wants to be an actress. When a big shot actor comes to the city and invites Kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, who tells his husband that he's going to the movies In exchange for her husband's husband, Habib has a bug in the ear that Kay Kay is not truthful, and he comes out of his quest. He has found his actor / actor in the hotel (they are just talking!) And he slogans the guy who falls on the railway, encounters first in a pond and dies. Here are two incredible premises which are based on the rest of the movie: <br /> 1) The judge told Jurike that if it was determined that people were dying * in the head of his head, they must find the guilty guilty of first degree. (ভায়াআআআআআআআআআআআআআআহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহহहহहহहै। যাতে তাকে জীবনের জন্য কারাগারে পাঠানো যেতে পারে। যাই হোক।) <br /> <br /> 2) দোষী সাব্যস্ত হওয়ার পর এবং তার শাস্তি দেওয়ার পরে স্বামীটির আইনজীবী, কে বলেছে যে এটি তার সমস্ত দোষ। Her argument is that if she does not go to the actress's room, her husband will not have to follow her and will tear the man and kill him. She told him that she was guilty, not her husband, and he pleaded and agreed. What The Hell?!?!?! The rest of the film is trying to earn fame and money for the release of the Resurrection and the mistake that made him mistake because of killing the actor father in the first place is correct. <br /> <br /> I can not go with this review. The movie was just very painful. Four years ago, during the pre-code days, you could never catch anyone who trembled! True to Francis of fashion, although he did all he could to believe us that this woman was a credible character. I give her many credits for trying to breathe some life and credibility in this grateful role. This character preoccodes the role and real-life Spitfire kills cryresses from Francis. <br /> <br /> Be clear this way! There are many better Francis vehicles! (From personal experience, I can highly recommend Mary Stevens, MD, and Jhel Rabardi; Dr. Monica and One Way Passage are also good, I'm sure there is another great flick, but I only mention them, saw and recommend.)
