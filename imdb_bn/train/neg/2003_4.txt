For all his visual pleasure, how well the Renaissance was done in live work. Animation is great in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, many like this story story and style. With real actors, perhaps the movie world would not feel so lifeless. There is a lot of praise here, but in the end I have seen that what I can do is commendable. I have not enjoyed so much movies and it has made something clear which I have not seen before: Visual elements can be a positive definition of a film, but without a good story and strong character it can not be all. As far as I can not say that this film does not come, it sometimes gets hazardous. I love the dark sci-fi thriller Blad Runner and Dark City Two Pictures I Was Wonderful But Blade Rana had his tragic villains and Dark City was under the pressure of his sensational story. Renaissance shade and light, but nothing else. I hope I could have liked this movie more, but the weak stories and empty characters were standing in that way. Renaissance was a historical and artistic explosion of color and life. So, how ironic that I saw one of the most painful and ruthless films of this year, his title came from Renaissance.
