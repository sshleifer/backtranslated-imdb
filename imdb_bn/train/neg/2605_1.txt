Although I've recently put it in my list of 10 Bad Movies, I think it is not worse than Burt Rainhold in "Maddening" or "Look Who Talking" Seikel. Still, it is quite annoying, even playing with a horror-movie response to Sexy Drew Barrymore Holly Golie, moved from New York City to Los Angeles, but finds out that she has been seen as a killer. In the '70s, the highly acclaimed actress poor Sally Kellman has fallen in a very supportive role, and Barrymore's leading personality George Neubner is the worst kind of actress, always bothered to laugh after every line. The image is sweet, but bloody shower scenes of Drew are attractive and sexy identities (though just outside the "Scooby Doo" episode). But for the last ... be real! Who was that mess clean? * ****
