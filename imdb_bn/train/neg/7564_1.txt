Wiker man I'm so angry that I can not write the right comments about this movie. <br /> <br /> This plot was ridiculous, it was tied together, and absolutely wool. Nicholas Cage ... shame on you! Since I suppose that you had it, that it would be at least decent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " <br /> <br /> At the end you left mouth agape, befuddled mind and offended good taste. I have not heard a theater on the opening day with so much hatred to many people. People were complaining about the theater near the small group of malls at four floors around the floor. It's bad. <br /> <br /> I've heard it compared to: Gletter, Paris and Gogli American Wayrellf. My boyfriend was so crazy that he did not even talk to her. <br /> <br /> <br /> Gray!
