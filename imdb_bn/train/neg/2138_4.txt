War, Inc. - In the future the corporation adopts the war and uses the brand house (John Cusack) a lone killer to do their wet work against the competing CEOs. A dark comedy similarly satirizing military and corporations. It was often difficult to think exactly what was going on. I kept waiting for things knowing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> As such, the war is less or less. Again we see Cusack as a killer * Protector * He will embrace his conscience as he wanted to kill. To be fair, John Cusack shows credible credibility of half a dozen boys with relative ease. Short fights look good. The film is not left. It is often bizarre on quizky curious. War Inc. is not enough to be a parody, and anyone who has a film message is too bright to think about it, which I think could be a neutral way for corporations, such as fighting parties and planning how to plan without any consideration. Affecting average citizens. Interesting, but not satirical, because it is not funny and there is no heart in the film. We are amazed by how the war affects the character of a character in Kasak instead of millions being killed by the war. <br /> <br /> Its character is meant to replace the hot sauce's shot shot and the character of the tiniest personal flat but quirks character properties. Mercy Tomomi is being lost as a romantic sidekick journalist. Truly many of chemistry in them do not. Hillary Duff tries to pronounce Russian and does not fool herself. Joan Cusack just screams out and whines and wigs out. Blech Bar√ßa Kingsley might have returned to Oscars, if he does not play better yet. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is not a terrible movie, but ultimately you have to ask "war, what's it good for?" Absolutely nothing. C
