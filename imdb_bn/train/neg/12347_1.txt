This is the easiest worst Redlean Scott film. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this picture is a black sign in his career. Both Demi Moore and Viggo Martensen, misconceptions about an inconsistent film about the girl going to the army. Stupid And any scenes are not believed in any way. It's not really difficult to make such a film. The crew could all have some idea only. The authors did not have much inspiration; There is no knowledge of many stupid dialogs; And some brainless actions. I strongly recommend staying away from this garbage. I hope many such talented people involved in this project are not worthy of their attention and in the future they will work on more respectable and more intelligent movies than this vague mess.
