Steven Segal's movies go below this barrel. His best was just quadruple for bored teens. These tips are scales, then fall off. All of the letters are in the cardboard. The story is in double-lam. I could not loot it by telling you the end. If you've already seen, you already know how Steven Seagal films will end. Goes here He is a super-duper government agent who is very happy, so he can decide that instead of killing him, he will have to be in the brain until he remembers Skate. He escaped, of course, arrested and is located by his old general, who handed him a man to one militant, handed over to a barbaric air force pilot, transferred to a terrorist gang in Afghanistan, who was astonished. Surprised, Segals trained. All heroes die heroically except Segal's character and his naughty girlfriend, and Steve-Baby saves the whole world with a bad hook, or knocks down. Anyway. Some surplus air force and navy made with flying film. And many bombs. Instead get some Popeye cartoons.
