I rent this one on DVD without any previous knowledge. I was suspicious by watching Michael Madison never seen the movie that I had never heard of, but it was a FreeBerry, so why not check it out. <br /> <br /> I think Mr blonde will like it too <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This film is not wild that the amateur actor mentioned. Many non-native-English-speakers play parts of Native-English-Speaker, read lines from a script that should be deleted and should not be in the movie. It's incredible how all the lines of movie sound are incredible. The music sounds awful and perfectly from the place, and the whole thing looks and sounds like a poor school game. <br /> <br /> I recommend you see it so that you would appreciate other, well, movies. For this reason, I instead gave it 3 with 3.
