When the United States Constitution and Principles were established, it was degraded by the administration in order to draw attention from the internal problems of its administration, where the Geneva Convention, Human Rights and Foreign Sovereignty were abolished in an inadmissible manner, more exciting than the terrorists they are dealing with. The law is valid Here may be. However, if you want to see a movie about it, try Edgevic's faulty SIEGE, because NADA is one of the most 'kids' political thrillers ever created. Like Robert Allman's Preet-A-Porter, a director has also taken a subject that he feels completely unconscious and has printed his ignorance on almost every frame. <br /> <br /> His terrorists are an incredible group of his barbarism - auditioning for the Fabio Mad magazine's 'Spy vs. Spy' strip, testamentary dresses, Michael Duchess also behaves like malicious kidneys from Hello, sent sociology professor from Hell, Marianga Melato A cardboard middle-class revolutionary wannabe - Those who behave as they want to get caught every unconvincing plot turn. The corrupt authorities rent a little better, but are still drawn to incredible broad strokes. <br /> <br /> It is possible to create a smart film about the people of mobile phones (CF elections), but it is a stupid film about the ignorant people. Created by people who think by intellectuals who speak by humans. Indeed, Jim Verney, Johnny Noxville, and Shannon Tiayed were one to reinstate Testi, Duqueso and Melatoco, which in turn would increase the intellectual content of the film, it would not be reduced. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Only if their character and events take them seriously, they move away from them, but its staging is so vain (the war scenes are kidnapped by the abductors, the abductor's shooting Disabling more than hijacking) and its inability to play with at least some estimated measure of recognized human behavior is so embarrassing that it is actually biz Texture (Specifications must be made for the doucheaucie: Chab rol is very good at the killer bit, he's a performance badly badly here <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> After this the film, which will be a great shame. Lift, and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material - a star in the decade - and that being very generous.
