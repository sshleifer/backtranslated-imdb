Cheap and mind-blisteringly dull stories and acting. Do not make a good line, even a line not bad enough to be even better, and no memorable delivery. Even the blopper relation with the DVD is even shown how the actors were neutral and had fun in them. Confidential and secrecy were inhumane inhuman, and the opposition failed to be vague or credible. The 'homoerotic' overtones were in vainly dissatisfied and dissatisfied, and their boys were flaccid while young men pressing their boys were limited. I am not gay enough to respect it, but a little step can awaken me and my girlfriend at least.
