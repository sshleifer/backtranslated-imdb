I'm a huge Michael Madsen fan, so I'm not saying, I bought this movie even for rent or something ... This movie was so awesome, I did not even bring back to the shop, I do not want anyone else to do this human poisoning , I just do not think the money, throwing it on the trash, it was worth the price that was able to throw the price. Acting was not bad, it was not good or anything. The story was terrible, and last I was something to ignore. He is a broken man, alcoholic. Her life was a bunch of junk. I had a terrible device to show his horse, peanut, secretion of his childhood, a dog has been much better. I hate religion, so the end of this suspicion bothers me. Jesus cures all ... I hate that I know such people who are huge Christians and Catholics, and will show that God does not cure anything or anything. It was a horror movie, if you see it, pass it or even better, then buy it or hire it and drop it in the trash and leave the coffee ground in the morning.
