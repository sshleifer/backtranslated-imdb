There is nothing worse than an Asian movie rental and American movie experience. <br /> <br /> This is only my opinion, but a good thriller is preferred, based on the establishment of intelligent characters. As far as possible, say Yes Yes hero is a distinguished married couple. Beautifully done. Unfortunately, they stupid beyond the belief. Let's count the way to mishandle terrorists by a stalker. <br /> <br /> 1. After giving a threat to kill you, tell him that you are in a hotel. <br /> <br /> 2. Get out of hell from the day-long guard on Thursday and in front of dozens of witnesses, thus let him charge the attack. <br /> <br /> 3 Police was disturbed by the police about disturbing the shopkeeper and making it easy to guess (not for obvious reasons). <br /> <br /> 4. When trying to flee, your lady left your eyes to ensure that Stallar kidnaps her as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> 5. After getting your help from someone after hijacking your wife, do not forget to send them as soon as possible so that you can face him one-on-one. Any point, right? Now, I do not expect these people to be disabled for doing some wrongdoing under this pressure situation, but yes yes the letters are so dense and so incredible mistakes that it is effectively impossible because the visitors take care of their safety They are victims of their own. It kills the entire film's enjoyment. <br /> <br /> If you were surprised, then the written authors did not stop with the letter gradually. Since they themselves have definitely lowered for this narrow writing, so they decided to make the situation so illogical unreasonable that all the ideas of the reality have come out of the window. <br /> <br /> 1. The shopkeeper kills a policeman inside a police station ?? Not ten feet away when the heroine is sleeping. <br /> <br /> 2. Brokers are involved in all kinds of suspicious activities on Thursday and around a hundred people, but no one other than married couple observes his strange behavior. <br /> <br /> 3 The shopkeeper lives in painful violence that killed any person. <br /> <br /> 4. "Mysterious" scenes were not imagined. Indeed, some scenes were a direct rip-off from American films. <br /> <br /> The only positive is the decapitation at the end, which was a cruel scene since the murder of his wife It is very bad that filmmakers have followed it with an uneasy stupid ending from the left field. <br /> <br /> To be honest, yes, Koreans will have to be ashamed of themselves after making yes. Even better, they will only move to California and those who have created similar films with similar quality and intelligence will have to take their jobs.
