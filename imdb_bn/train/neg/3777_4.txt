Wonderful backdating flats, suuleless computer images, animated a horrific prediction story in this movie. Of course nothing surprises you, you can say when Brian Adams comes in the voice. <br /> <br /> The original character, Spirit of the Horse, is a boring voice when he describes what's going on. Description is not necessary, although everything is happening, it is really clear. You can even tell what the horse is saying, even though they all do. Which would be good, but all the horses make the same words - a warning, sadness, laughing, etc. There is no difference between the voices of the horse. <br /> <br /> <br /> Like this picture though. It is enough soppy to sit down and watch for a family, and someone is afraid of someone is very dangerous. If you do not have to do anything else and want to see a movie with your kids, it is not a bad choice. <br /> <br /> But otherwise it is not recommended.
