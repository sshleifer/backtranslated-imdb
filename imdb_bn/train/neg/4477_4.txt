The classic novel lacks an empty and lazy carpet. I want people to stop hating classics when they do not explicitly have any idea about the original purpose or key point. This version is no different. I used to think that the version of Ralph Fiennes is even worse, even though casting it as a Kathy to Juliet Brewe is going to be the worst casting decision ... Anyway, we go back to this version. It aims to make a contemporary setting and a story related to a musical style. It's both high efficiency but it's nit to succeed. Throwaway was probably a rainy day ... The direction was average and the edit was abysmal. Worse than the old Quincy. Deepak Verma has made a great turn as the Handley and indeed a brilliant talent in Britain. The hit part is played with great charm and faith and I think casting is the most powerful point of this project. Although more talented directors took advantage of his benefits. It is clear that he was the director for the fare and it did not inspire the project with the passion that the availability.
