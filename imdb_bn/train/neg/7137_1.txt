This movie car is awesome. Acting in this movie is awful. The plot and driving scene does not have much knowledge and is not equally bad. If you are really annoyed by movies, someone changes and suddenly goes away laughingly, hurts yourself and saves money. Good movie for racing fans? Well, there is a part where they make a mistake to mention a NASCAR driver as a bike driver. You can not tell the difference, see it, you have an explosion. It really comes down, this movie has really really nice cars, they are terribly driven and completely unrealistic. Acting extremely bad plot is mainly awesome. If you want to see hot girls but instead turn on mtv or vh1. I'm disappointed that such beautiful cars will be represented in such a bad movie. If the car class meets the movie, then they will be racing with bicycles on the streets.
