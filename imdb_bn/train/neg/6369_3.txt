Because of the article of Panorama Magazine, I was the only reason to rent it. The article looks interesting in this film. Well, that's not it. This was a very annoying, amateur-written and directed movie. All the actors in this movie are horrific, except Fai Duneau, who is always happy to see. But for a long time Gina Phillips and Ravens and Durio Marzier faced her ridicule. Marguerite has such a thick thick Argentine accent, you can only understand every couple of her words. Nicholas Poles, who also showed great interest in Gina Phillips Bottom line: This movie is not scary. Only a good scene and it's the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I could have given this one star, but I gave three because I loved Fei Duneway. But even he was not that great at this.
