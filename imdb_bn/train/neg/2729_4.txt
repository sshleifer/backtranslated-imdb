Acting Ruth Roman's real-life public gesture for coming from a Korean war on a wind base near San Francisco Jeep and coming out of the Korean War, this All-Star Warner Bros. has given salute to patriotism and lyrics. Many celebrities display attendees and love hatred romances develop among a stranger starlet and a painful green and skinny Air Force corporal (Ron Hagleti, who thinks he should be supplying newspapers from his bike). It seems that Karol is fooling the actress that he will go to war when he is flying from the helicopter, flying from Hololulu and Hololulu (you think he would be happy that he was away from the damages, but instead he works) In the decade, like most girls in the film) Doris Day is for the first thirty minutes or so, and its distinct smile and lucky songs are the most joyful. The Romans are also seeing interesting, attractive looks here, while James Cagney enjoys the fun of his screen and Gordon McCray sings on his handsome baritone. Following Dan's lead, Jane Wymen sang beside the hospital bed, causing one to wonder, "Did they get out of the set?" For undemanding viewers, another interesting place to flash and time. Nonetheless, less rental production and adequate technical aspects, "Stirlift" strictly provides second-aiders. * **** to 1/2
