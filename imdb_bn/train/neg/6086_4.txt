For some reason, at the end of the 70s and early 80's, local CBS approved stations in New York had placed this film in late-night slots for several years on Friday or Saturday night, usually 2 o'm or some time. This is a suitable movie for the slot at that time which is really hard to follow and quite weird (see other reviews for specific story information). However, just before that it was caught on TV several times before (and even after it hit, but before programming many night), I would have kept this little curiosity. After watching it for many years I decided to see if I could find the DVD. Well, this is only available (if every search which I have guided) in the budget label "Brentwood Video" as part of a 4-pack (4 films on 2 double-sided discs) as part of "Alien Worlds" if anyone is interested. Often it is available for around $ 10 - but if you shop around then less is available. Other 3 movies in this set are easily available in other collections of public domain films, so they do not need to comment anymore. But I could not find "eyes" anywhere else. Although in some way the "recovery" version is not in any way, but this print is exactly 92 minutes, so once the 90-minute IMMb's running time is not right. It's also not unusual for the 92-minute running time, even from any other language to dubbed the English, and printed a few of the running times. Sometimes it seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to save money, without being disturbed by drowning some scenes if it is not considered important for the story. Will a long version make any confusing? Who really knows - unless you saw it in its original language ... By way of way, my efforts to see the time of this day do not work and I stopped it. It has something to watch in the middle of the night that fixes this movie ... or is it from my previous experience, who knows ??
