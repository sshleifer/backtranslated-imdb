I would not say this a * bad * movie. Unfortunately for me, I feel that you know more about fences, when it gets worse, it becomes completely unreal. I'm walking at the age of 14, and the film is very poorly portrayed. F. Murray Abraham is good (and seems to have some fence backgrounds), but other actors - especially students - seems lost.
