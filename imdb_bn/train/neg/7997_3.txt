Even for nature versus people's cycle, a tedious film model, which was so prominent in the 1970s, even the ants are weak enough to become even more effective. It is sooooo preposterous. Clearly, these roots have been bulldoged near a body, consuming poisonous waste for decades and have now become poisonous bites - these hundreds of deadly bites are deadly. Some superstition actors often fall in the black color, but it is very painful. Many scenes seem ridiculous: A boy is trying to fall into a dumpster while attacking, while traveling around the bed, Susan Samarra is crying out of fear, Robert Foxworth and Linda George are breathing through pieces of wallpaper, Barney KC is getting a gam leg and the list goes on and on. The dangers ranged from a drain to the ants to crawl from a black line of green wall ant. Cast is not bad for the film, but none of these actors can believe in the material. The poor Mirna fusion has to sit in a wheelchair through this awful. I hope he has found a good use for money, because this is the only reason that a woman of his offspring would have this folly. Although it is a bad movie, but it can be seen - once for me and some of them have bad traits - the beginning of the studded actor makes us embarrassed, creating televisions and taking revenge for the terrible creatures of nature. People at this time must be pushing his hand to a stack of an ants to hit the man. Really awesome
