This picture is not funny. It's not entertaining. It does not contain the originality or intelligence single second, and it does not allow you to take the least interest in letters or situations. As any of the recent memory it has been added about as a movie as a movie. It seems that a group of 14 or 15 year-old high school kids who were actually related to a relationship, which did not coincide with any actual girl, was sitting, and wrote a movie based on their misconceptions about what an adult would be like. . . This movie is annoying, unreasonably man-friendly, and sometimes objectionable and hateful. In most cases it puts you in a moment or two that lets you laugh. Also, it seems as twice as the running time of 85 minutes.
