Generally I like horror movies, but unfortunately it's a pound of hands to my friends from Darjeahan bin. We were sitting to see it, we were ready to be afraid and spreading food everywhere we were very happy. The idea is not bad, but I do not know why they are lucky to decide the tenth number in the series. The worst thing about the movie is the actor. The camera work was poor, but if I were to be generous, special effects were not really bad, but the story failed to connect to a level as a whole, because the actors were badly acting as a small throat of the alarm. They were wood outside the measurement, especially a folk young actor, who was 15 years old to take seriously as any government agent. She actually looked more like a public school boy. There was a really appealing sex scene where he found that he did bubbing for apples, as the bishop lady roamed around him and later his nail-shaped underpants were violent, but then it was not supposed to be a comedy. I sometimes talk about this movie away from the nipples of the breast, wracking my brain to find some positive, but there simply is not there. Let's hope for ten lucky numbers and they will not do another work, I'm not sure that my ribs can accept it.
