It must be an embarrassment for every member of the African-American cast entirely. Insulting to the black American community, abusive stereotype specially featured. Without mentioning chicken, watermelon, and dies, I will not strengthen the humiliation listed here. <br /> <br /> A good song for Ethyl Waters (and a few bad things), and the excellent singer and Sammy Davies, 8-year-old dance talent, brought something under the IMDB scale 1.
