Problems with such films are literally creating dozens of them. Thankfully, only a theatrical release is offered for boxing, others are directing videos or TVs like this video. <br /> <br /> The main problem of this movie is its originality. This is a film that is a difficult but disturbed person's "die hard" formula is in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, it is a character operated by Caspar Van Diane, who works for a security company that thoroughly examines security procedures for companies and individuals. In this case he is sending a cruise ship, which is certainly hijacked. You can watch this movie as a mix of "Die Hard" and "Air Force One" and do not even try to conceal the film that these two films are probably the biggest source of 'inspiration'. So really, you can not regard this movie as original. It uses all the clich√©s in the book and this film is really a surprise or something that does not seem to be remotely similar to something original. <br /> <br /> You can expect from such a movie, it's a very weak script. Or rather said, it's some very lazy writing features. As I said earlier, the film does not show anything but the real story only involves some of the elements that are probably far away, and are really simple ridicule. I mean, a huge cruise ship is being hijacked with only 8 people, in which Helve carries only a few small guns and claims only 10 million dollars in ransom for a ship of $ 10 million. Pretty ridicules How do they even want to split that money even after? Every person gets only one million or something? That is very profitable for such a big and risky enterprise. And then the passengers have a hostage case. In some way, they managed to manage all the passengers on large passenger hostages and they managed to keep their pistol in a room with only one person, which they could not hold. You do not see as many as 30 prisoners, although at that time they were all who were there. Also when Van Deen searches for the character of his son, and on the contrary, a cruise they wander through the huge cruise ships, but they always fall into each other. Some examples of lazy writing in the film <br /> <br /> But of course this is an activity, so the story will be secondary. But again, this movie is not a good step. The look of the actors seems to be that they have never put a weapon before and the movie is filled with some disappointment. It really becomes ridiculous to point out. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is not the best actor, although I must say that the comedy van Deeven is not really bad 'action heroes' and actors, as much as the section and the B-movie circuit related. She is also suffering from the same problem as Tom Cruise; How old is he, he does not believe enough to play a teenager's father. Van Dien once started as a committed new young actor but acting acting does not really help a lot in his career. He probably deserves some good, although he never gave the right opportunity to show it. All other actors also work fairly well, but their characters are so formulated that they will never be attractive. <br /> <br /> Oh well, this is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is also the most original or memorable one. <br /> <br /> 4/10
