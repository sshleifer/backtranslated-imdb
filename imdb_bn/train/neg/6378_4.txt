This movie was occasionally funny, sometimes the hell was even funny. <br /> <br /> The original message I received from this movie was that women are responsible for all the troubles of men. Every time a woman is portrayed in the picture, she is slutty or lambasting some poor people for any lazy reason, being idle. I do not think the message involved is good for women or gay men. <br /> <br /> However, it is a comedy and a part of the industry, so it's just a little bit of perspective. Even if I do not agree with it, they are entitled to it. <br /> <br /> A ridiculous movie, but some other comments are just plain fools. The best film ever my legs
