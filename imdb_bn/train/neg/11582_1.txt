I'm glad most of the people here do not think most of the movie. It has some big names to throw, but that's it. There is nothing to recommend, you can make several beautiful women in thousands of films. <br /> <br /> The story is unlikely, self-centered, chain-smoking, "hip" characters do not involve nothing, and it seems to all of the national film critics .... and most people can not stand. <br /> <br /> Oklahoma accents are so fake that they are ridiculous, South Racist Stereotypes directly from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is frustrating.
