Thin stories are the concerns of their struggles on the honor of brother and family in two small towns. David Morse is responsible, straightforward police and 'good' brother; Viggo Martensen, 'Bad' boy, a former soldier and former criminal As an actor (especially in his early days), Shan Pane seems to have modulated his performance under the method. The writer and director for the first time discovered the drama for this army, he works in his own script and characters through the same procedural process, reducing casing to passes (apparently we can catch every nuance and infection). This method can be impressive if you have to take care of three-dimensional letters, photogorphic mortgages and Martensen are not really believing siblings. Worse, we expect Charles Birston and Sandy Dennis, who are less likely to come up with something interesting than the sensitive build builders. The bulk of the film is included in the Turquoise sequence, a hawk story and confusing editing (which is always slot to indicate artistic excesses). Pen's tools with the camera closed the gifted eyes, but they are mostly irritable. * **** to 1/2
