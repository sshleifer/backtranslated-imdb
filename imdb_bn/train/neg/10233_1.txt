When thinking about the captivi, many words come to mind. Among them are: weird, unfamiliar, reluctant, unsexy, unfathomable, and unwanted. <br /> <br /> I hated those movies from the mid-nineties, which was originally the ripoff of the screams but to start with this new hobby, those films look like classic. They are still looking at the same demographics that other movies have been so successful, but now they have added a new dimension contraction that makes girls from twelve to fourteen years old, they think they are hardcore and hip-like. <br/> <br /> This movie is boring! What happened to Larry Cohen? Since 1993 there is no connection with his name! Yet, I was surprised that he had something to do with this bad thing! When was the interest of the movie to become one of the psychopaths, was anyone surprised? Does anyone see him when they saw him? Never before ever in his own life, never seen another movie!
