This is the first Jason Scott Lee film I've seen quite a lot. I say a lot, because I also saw Soldier, where he played villain ... but Jason Scott Lee was not considered to be from what I heard. This is, however, either. And if there is any indication of the quality of such a movie, then I will not see anyone else. Lee is basically passable as a martial art artist ... As leadership, he is awful. He engaged in war with random characters for a few minutes each minute, perhaps the script writer could extend the film for a film at least necessary time and not figure it out. Villain indicated personality only with the character, and the fact that he is visually insane, then he rarely feels like a villain. Most of the film has largely followed villain over time ... or perhaps it is a different way. I'm not sure ... and I will not see it again to make sure. The effect is not entirely horrible ... but it's close. The title comes from the popular idea of ​​using time-machines to go and kill Hitler. Somehow, the film screws alongside that interesting idea. The plot is very complicated for itself. Panning is poor. I can not remember a positive thing to say about this picture ... I really can not. It's just too much formula and pointless. If I was only a time-machine, then I could go back and never stop making this film ... No, do not mind. I hope some harmful minds are as open as possible. Listen to negative critics. Avoid this turkey. I recommend this to Li fans, and someone else. If you are looking for a quality film ... well, it is not. It's true. 1/10
