What a horrible movie! For some reasons, scientific laboratories and outposts always have a sleeping, dirty, average-stimulating, in-house atrocity worker. These people, who probably work together in complex scientific projects, can not agree on survival of a CGI dragon. Spoilers: An extraordinary scientist whose main performance is "leering" and "shocking stare" cloned a dragon. Although the lab was working on this type of thing, other scientists were frustrated because apparently they were behind their exams and their pants were captured. The rest of the story is Things, or Ten Little Indians, where stuff is hunted and killed when they create ways to escape and / or defeat the "dragon". The CGI dragon animal is dark gray, which seems to be the most popular color for CGI special effects. It looks much better than cartoon and dark gray tone dragon makes it difficult to see any interesting details of the body. It looks like a gray blob. Acting is less than terrible. These scientists work like children who can not agree and it makes it easy to kill the dragon in various attempts, to hide them, etc. Dean Kine is less well known than a cast of unknown actors. This movie He thinks its supporter throw level sink. This movie is really, really rogue. Acting is bad. The story is stupid CGI is very cheap and amateur. There is nothing good about this movie, it is not a good time-killer to do surveillance while doing work or other things.
