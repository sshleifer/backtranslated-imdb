I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not dead, so why did I hire this movie? Well I live in the cottage and thought that the places I know in a movie would look beautiful. I really knew that I was not going to get inner jokes, so sitting in the halotite did not surprise me with deer. I was surprised that the Ant-A-Mormon work was done in this movie. <br /> <br /> I know this is a Mormon film, which was supplied to members of the LDS Church, but I was objectionable because of their belief that general stereootype. Every non-Mormon, which was not much, was drunk, smoked and had an amazing selfish attitude, why? It really made me stop filming this movie, they made Mormons so clever, but the rest of the camel states I guess they do not follow the LDS Church's scriptures. <br /> <br /> I understand the plots are moving around all LDS members, but you think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which is not even close to the truth. And I said, in the movie, the non-Mormon was portrayed as a drunken zeros! <br /> <br /> I guess I do not believe it because I am not including their beliefs and I do not think that I will never want to.
