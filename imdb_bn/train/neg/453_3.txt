Okay, the first one is good: Character performance and painting. Although I'm not a fan fan, he gives a nice performance and his piece was well written. Cinematography is well done and has taken the sense of romance. <br /> <br /> Rest: The performance of Nilolas Cage is a thin platinum, and a complete tragedy and weak attempt to portray the Italian-American family in New York. First, every time the cage opened its mouth, I opened it. I do not know what type of pronunciation is using. I do not do it honestly, it is certain that I have heard of any New York or Italian Act. It was quite real. And it was not because I had some stikler for accuracy, his voice just cloyed in my ears. And I like the other performances Nicholas Cage. Second, and it is completely stagnant, but there are many Italian relations, friends and contacts in New York City, and in truth I get more smiles than this laugh, and the film received much more appreciation by realizing the Italian ethnic family. And that would be an annoying night at home. Let's do a down.
