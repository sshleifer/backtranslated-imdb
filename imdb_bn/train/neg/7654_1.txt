I think when it comes to this movie, remember to read all the terrible, awesome reviews. I wanted to see how terrible it was, but it was outside the theater within three weeks. Gogli is the only other movie to handle. <br /> <br /> When the movie came out of the DVD, I bought it how awful it was. I was very scared that this image was not available. After seeing it, we can understand. <br /> <br /> First off, tell me that this image is not without some cool shots. At the beginning there is a nice shot which exposes a bullet inside the gun, which I thought. And this movie is great to see the way to die of monsters. But you get old after the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> I start with the worst thing in this movie: they read Reid. If bad acting is a sin, then Hell is so incredibly awful in his film as soon as they circled Reid, it is impossible. And in all the roles, he plays a curator. Now if he is playing a fool, empty head toys, then perhaps I might be able to forgive him for how his character behaves. Apparently, Uwe did not understand the ball, although he thought that if he closed his shirt in the movie, people could see it. He did not realize that the film became more ridiculous because of the misguided media in the middle of the film. And during a dry humping scene a Mexican song or something? I could not say. <br /> <br /> that brings me to my next charge: The Uwe Bowle will show any poor instruction skills in a movie. I mean, I'm the House of the Dead (and I'll only do this for a few films), but HOTD will score at least one bit less than this screw-up piece of junk. The film begins with a very long description, which creates instant confusion (and reads by a terrible narrator) and from there, really, really stupid in the mobile phone. Slater and Reid are looking around a building where this is a point and the screen is black. When it comes back, Slaughter and Reid are shooting everywhere and suddenly an entire army has joined them. is not it? <br /> <br /> No one has bothered to test the mistakes of this movie. At one stage, a team breaks through the glass, but the glass breaks before it touches. They can change the color of the reed earrings in the middle of a scene, and after slipping away from Slater's body, you can begin to move on. <br /> <br /> For the story ... I was really lost. An old tribe releases the darkness and somebody is about to "open the way" or pop out some and all the evil monsters. It is an excuse for many gun scenes (this technology is so advanced that no character here ever needs to be reloaded in this film), which is easily disturbed. <br /> <br /> I hope to laugh laughing with how incredibly stupid this movie is. I did not smile, but I still think it's stupid. Very, very, very stupid.
