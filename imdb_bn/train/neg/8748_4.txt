It was interesting to see how accurate the writing gyakus correctly was, but it is still very naive in the corporate world. If they can win such extraordinary things from the judiciary, then bigger couples will be caught more. Every bit as real and funny, yet sinners in the real corporate world. I seriously doubt that any corporation will actually kill someone; Even mod these days more indirectly. In the real world, they kill people of nicotine, pollution, additives, poisons, etc. This film should definitely be made by Garage, I think and the studios do not know the difference. They just wanted something in the news of the Microsoft Antitrust case as capital.
