Nothing positive say. Admit dirty, huffing and puffing with a "message". The new Russian (post-Soviet) films can be very good (Kaku seems to mind), but many are cardboard glass and asbestos padded (a good example of noncoo dosage). It's a "dozen" kind of empty. If acting is not for the preservation of horrific unexpected aspects and inefficient editing, it will never be terrible that sometimes it is so awful that it distracts from actress persecution. Every shot that is frustrating to give a special prize to the cameraman (can anyone please understand that Blair Witch has his 15 seconds unreasonable reputation?) And draws attention to pre-teens based on counter strikes and masturbation. Men try to break lead and often try to be seductive, male antihero needs a fiction instructor (although genetics is not bad: rather the publisher's eyes.) One (medium) finger for this irreplaceable level of non-industry. Anyone who reviews this positively "auteurs" a (remote) cousin.
