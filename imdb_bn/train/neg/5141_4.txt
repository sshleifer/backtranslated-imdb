1914 is an extraordinary year for Charlie Chaplin. In the first year of the film, he appeared in more than 30 films! Although most of these movies were not particularly good, they gave him a chance to develop his screen personality gradually. However, by this film, the character of the "Little Tramp" was still evolving. Certainly Charlie saw the part, but his character was still the reason for lack of sweet and neutrality that he developed later. Instead, Chaplin often did not hurt, kicks, or used other bad things for any reason. <br /> <br /> For this very little movie, cast is interesting to keep an eye on. Although they are not known today, with Chaplin Mabel Normand, Chester Conclin and Mc Swain - starring with keystones, all the popular stars The problem with this movie is that it has some nice scenes, but this plot is very vague and improperly developed. Received Chester and Mabel Race Track (a very common theme for Keystone Productions - it must be located near a race track). Charlie and Mac showed and kissed. Charlie was caught around Chester and stole his daughter and held the police. To the end, due to some apparent reason, police takes Chester and Mac - leaves Charlie with Malle (who seems strange, does not stop by Charlie's behavior). <br /> <br /> If you are not a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, it's a very forgotten movie that is important only in the evolution of Chaplin. It is not particularly fun to see today what he and other actors actually did on the stage until it was unusual for the film.
