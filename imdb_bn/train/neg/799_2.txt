In some ways, the idea behind the story was a striking combination of different standard movie types in an interesting combination. However, no point in this movie was so clear that it does not deserve linking off shots. I think I had a headache to kill people with a deadly clear explanation on the head. <br /> <br /> The authors seem to be easily quoted as alternatives to the display lines of clips from other movies. Actual character The actor does not help the subject. No chemistry I think they can create some kind of attraction for the only reason that they are an essential element of such stories. However, the author does not work very hard to develop chemistry. Sure, they are both interesting, but it seems an open question whether they are attractive to each other. <br /> <br /> The character of self-confidence Turner is shown in Sabatote for a quick and improved reason. The character of Sabatra is considered as an excellent doctor who can not play by rules only. Think of Jeff Goldblum's character in "Independence Day" Generally, some kind of character is supposed to display talent or brightness. Subto's character is not there. He is only Cassandra's with Magic Eight Ball Crazy and all predictive skills. She seems right by random chance. <br /> <br /> The death scene is ridiculous. Every actor was really trying harder than to show torture on them. Signs looked like bad soil, like the video of the 80's, Peter Gabriel, I think.
