I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie. Guessed, it takes Shakespeare and a certain mentality to be interested in it or not. But this film has overcome any barrier to long soliloquy, and not many, it can prevent many from taking care of Shakespeare based stories. <br /> <br /> The complete level of the biggest road blockade character of this product Often, during the interaction of the character, it is very difficult to separate the lines of the case. Imagine, I believe this film is dubbed in English. Of course, they could have voice actors, which could add some more drama to this classic, literary lines. <br /> <br /> This film will be difficult to lose more than 1, although it may seem likely to be an age and a very low budget based on ancestors. Still, it's absolutely painful and annoying. If you insist on Hamlet, then do yourself a favor and read the book again. 1/10
