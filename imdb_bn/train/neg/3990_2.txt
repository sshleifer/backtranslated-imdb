Jungle fever is very styled, stereotyped, and essentially comes across as evil. Wesley Snipps was wrong for leadership and there was no chemistry between him and the Anabella cyobor. Although this movie has a lot of talent, it's mostly lost because the parts are a bit more than decorative Camio. Also, instead of just showing racism for ugly and stupid things, Spike Lee likes to surround it with the flag in the most preferred and provocative way. I mostly made it through the film but I could not finish it completely, and it rarely happened to me.
