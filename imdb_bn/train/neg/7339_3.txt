Maya is a woman without any interest. He just dreamed away from his life and wondered, why he does not feel full. This can be an interesting topic. It will be a good story, a beautiful setting and good dialogue. It does not have any of this. This movie is completely annoying. There is only length and no climax. Only Climax Shahrukh Khan. But I was a huge fan of them, but I could not bear this movie. Even she can not quit this movie. The movie is not bad as "King Uncle" and if you are an art house fan or you prefer it slowly, you might like it. It's not funny, it's not interesting, it's not caught. My recommendation: do not see it.
