Other critics feel that this movie has died in the last 1 hour. But before that it caters to predictability and a stunningly breathy performance by Cap Capso, who definitely did not find her character and destroyed every scene of her. The conservatory is fine like a fish, but most of the scenes are truly impressive instead of the truth. With a sense of immorality. And the end is just bizarre. The filmmakers obviously knew that when they had assembled this mess, they needed sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner so that they would compensate for adding an overloud "dramatic" score. With a crescendo of emotion each little jump, where it is ridiculous If you want an example of the main league bad movie, see it one, otherwise skip it.
