Probably not, but it's terrible. Even the superb cast can save it. Okay, I accept it's quite a fun start but they seem to fly downhill as soon as they jumped up the girls in the General House. Bill Murray became a freaky, ridiculous man, who was screaming in the streets of Arshall, who was not funny at the street, as he tried very hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV? Coming ...) and after attacking other countries, becoming a national hero, and how many soldiers to kill God, for laughter A good aspect is that this image shows the inadequacy and inadequacy of the US military and, unjustifiably, shows how insignificant and inhuman they are. I was really bothered that such promotional campaign could really be released.
