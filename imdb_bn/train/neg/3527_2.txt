It seems like this wonderful scene, the prisoners found magic books, and it is wrong! Clustrophobic Terrorist etc., etc. <br /> <br /> But the story of the great idea does not seem to be. Instead of chronic / physical jaundice, this open-fire and otte depends on the effect of body hysteria - which is not afraid if you are over 12 years old. <br /> <br /> The ending argument is ridiculous, with characters being killed for nothing other than bodycount. The good thing is the waste - which is the best thing about this movie. Perhaps a low budget, which does not loot it, the film really does not go anywhere, and I think I'm going to say it - it's a Hollywood remix. You only interested in this version. Certainly, in the same league, other French films such as the minor rivers in the last few years were at least guardianical / recreational, as well as sincerely not being monitored at the end. And I can guess the betting before you watched the movie before. Really really frustrated - the recommendation is impossible.
