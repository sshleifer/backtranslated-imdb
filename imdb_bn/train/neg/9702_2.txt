I am not rated this movie properly. I took my copy and wrote the PG rating black and wrote it. I would not recommend this to anyone under the age of 17 or 18, whatever the R range is, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Why? It has a view in the jungle with a few chaotic Indian women. I do not know about you, but it is not something small children have to visit. True, it may be African (?) Indians' traditional "dress style", but ... I think partial nudity will give a movie a rating. <br /> <br /> I did not see the movie recently, but I guess otherwise, it was OK.
