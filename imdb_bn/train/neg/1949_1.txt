It shows an animation done in 30 seconds and shows characters more like characters instead of characters. Since the series in 1962, I was a fan of Scua Du. I do not think most of the movies of Scooby-Doo animated films (I'm talking about a TV series, not a full-length movie.) But some of them were quite cool, and I saw the Scrappy doo, but most of the people would be annoying, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation, and heard the letters, (and I used that term timeless) to speak, I cringed. Also, Mystery Incorporated, was a team, and without the whole crew to commemorate each other, it seems like someone would like to open a box of chocolates that somebody has already played well, and no one wants the rest. What the new Scooby Doo was better than this. If you are going to get a Scooby Doo TV series, include the series so long to tolerate the elements. The entire cast of characters, and quality animations. They will put back under this stone where it came.
