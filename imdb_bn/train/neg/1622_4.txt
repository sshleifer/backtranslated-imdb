This is the reason I remember, it was shown after weeks of Nigel Connel's bright QUATERMASS serial broadcast. The trailers emphasized that the main character was an isolated hand, which I hoped would be like Victor Carrun on the road to London's experience. <br /> <br /> There is no fate as the racing game is trying to go downstream in the investigation of corrupt horse racing, just by changing the role of a protagonist with physical disability, only a changed thriller thriller. I think that if you are a fan of Dick Francis you can enjoy it, but when Seinei was over and professionals were still created by the end of the 70s, then there is a little about the lack of racing games. A trailer carries another car on a motorway, if it was a trailer for Soviine, but you saw Jack Reagan hit a car outside the car and outside the fencing, which the professionals would take a car and blown the terrorists inside. I think what sums up wrong with this series
