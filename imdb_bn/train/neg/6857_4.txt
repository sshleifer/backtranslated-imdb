This "chic comedy" seems very forced. In reality, actors have tried very hard to abandon an indispensable script. And, as a result, it does not really go anywhere. One woman finds the idea that she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce is not all that funny. And then, when Cooper closes with the baby because it does not want to take it for granted, it looks very scary and making it hard to actually make it into a comedy. It's really embarrassing, the actors were more capable than the script and I bored myself completely by mess. Considering the creation of a very good comedy of Cooper, I suggest you see them instead.
