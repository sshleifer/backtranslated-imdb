Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! I can not stand still in Ben Stier. How these people are still allowed to do movies are beyond me. I do not understand that if I play in the movie then how will I act and I'll be the owner of the company ... I have to set myself on fire. God! This film was simply a plain, evaporative, ants streak plate, if it is possible then it needs to be steam. Another thing I have to say is stupid 10 lines of text in a comment guide. What is wrong with saying something about a movie? Sometimes I need to understand why I need a short novel when writing a short comment needed.
