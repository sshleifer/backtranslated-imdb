How to make five movies in Rick Slow is hard to believe than cold synthesis. This film is absolutely criminal. Before I could see this movie, I thought Manaus: The fate was a bad part of the frog that I have ever seen, but at least the mind goes very slowly, you can fall asleep, so your eyes are recovered from the pain of your pain. The greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man who has "locked" the Haboblins creates this final scene. I was a complete waste of my life while watching this movie.
