Here is an indoor film I really wanted to like but could not finish it. The lack of scripts (boldly prevalent in major titles) really shows the image and kills. Trying to find the story is a Nonsense mess worth noting. I was bored in 10 minutes quickly, then I used to be in the last 40 minutes of the residue - waiting for the best hope - before the chapter was closed (merciful) ... it was not even extra effort. Ozark Chavez clearly works hard to crack, EVIL raises his best sequence from Dead 2 and MATRIX. As a result, there is very little in the ozark sieve, which has not been better than ever. This film was a lot of fun as 10-20 minutes short, but as a feature, it seems only pedaled and compulsory. Of course, there is no meaning in the shorts, so I fully understand that for financial reasons, I expanded in 75+ minutes. Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise, and I wish him luck.
