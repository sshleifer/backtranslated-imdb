This 30-minute documentary, Bunuel, was one of the poorest regions in Spain, in my opinion, one of the weakest movies in Spain in the early 1930's. First, let's make the world more wealthy than the 70 years (and when I say it, I fully acknowledge that the wealth can bring its own problems like personal problems, though in all the resources it is far better than extreme poverty). And if poverty reduces in Spain, then Benuel was not well with the kind of socialism he supported, but Western European style with capitalism. But one of the most frustrating things about the film is: In one scene, the narrator asked that the value of children's Pi was taught in the school. Mathematical education of poor people, awful! Bunuwel ShortSites is one of his most appealing views here, it does not realize that this is the latest knowledge and access to technology that will help the poor to overcome their situation. What is he suggesting? What are children taught in school right? Bu√±uel does not understand that it lacks modern technology that makes them poorer than other people?
