The last of the twists can be really cool in a movie. When it's particularly interesting, the front of our eyes is fine, but we do not pay attention. The ending of such a package is the person who thinks of the man. Then we got twists like this film. Twists that, whether you pay attention or not, there is no need you are going to happen. When they reveal such a random wrap, instead of shock, this is a slightly violent reaction. This movie has started as it plays a fascinating role on Harrah, but after about 20 minutes it is nothing but annoying dialogue and foolhardy. <br /> <br /> Three young ladies are going to the concert, so they lost lost traveling through the forest, and hit a tree trunk. They are home to some old weird lady, who hate men, and they are greeted by her housewife Marine (Laurel Munson). These girls stay in this house for a few days instead of going to this house or going home, and Suspense walks through a stupid slash. <br /> <br /> This movie has been caught in much of its conversations, and it is always just a few characters. Our three main daughters, strange spinster and old lady, and no important conversation crosses these five. To make things worse, they have no interest to say anything. It's actually quite maddening to sit through their conversations. We wanted to know what was going on, and instead they would only talk and talk (nothing). <br /> <br /> Plenty of plot holes here. When the house reaches their car crash they live, apparently three miles away ... wow, three miles! Two hours or less walking will kill them. Why do not they go with the workers to drive this town? Does he have a seater? How do these questions leave the girls and just do not question the voluntary, rarely check up on each other? Why are these so stupid twists? Maybe the answers are in annoying scripts. <br /> <br /> A slash film with five letters is really a bad idea. It's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the end is definitely there, but undoubtedly stupid. <br /> <br /> My rating: * **** of 1/2. 79 minutes For nudity and violence.
