I still have to read a negative professional review of this movie. I guess I must miss something. The beginning is curious, three main characters are delayed by night, otherwise they meet with empty bars and give each other a spell with the invented stories. That's the good part. After the three go their separate ways, the film split into three threads. Borodum sets. Of course, threads with Flaminix Babushk, which creates dolls from cakes, first opened the curiosity of the eyes. Unfortunately, the director beat this death, even throwing a wild plat line that does not come especially. Bottom Line: Two-hour plot-thin stagnation. If you enjoy insomnia, it will look at the bed and you will sleep a good night.
