Itan Fox, in general, poses a risk to the offending party of Israeli politics, in the past, created a number of interesting films such as "Walk on Water" and simply amazing "Yoshi and Jagar". So, "bubble", he took extreme extremist and extremist steps. <br /> <br /> This film was far from offering a permanent festival, I left the screening people silent and left. I also went quietly left, rude rumors, and racist rumors (and terrorism) that are involved in the rage in such ridiculous unilateral films, translate as surrender in the form of a blast of fair anger; Which indicates that the Arabs have done so much injustice by the evil Israelites that they react to the continuous stream of unilateral Israeli aggression against them and they can not be held accountable for their actions. <br /> <br /> This film was not worthy of the price of the ticket for the ticket (in fact, I wanted my money back), and originally was an Israeli designation of Palestine's film "Paradise Now". If you want to be an anti-Israel, see this movie in all ways, because it really supports such a belief system. The Israeli director made this image and worse, such a gifted Israeli director, a cry of shame. Indeed, the Israeli think of themselves as anti-Israel campaign, the beggars believe, when the paranoid may be considered as a state, it can be astonished. <br /> <br /> What an embarrassing, horrible little film!
