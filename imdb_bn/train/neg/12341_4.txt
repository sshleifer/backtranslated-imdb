Horror spoofs are not only a thing of the 21st century. Before the series 'Darwin movie', Weite was a few examples, mostly in the 80's. But like most of the franchises, this hit or missed movie. Something like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' has topped up, but 'Saturday 14th' and it can not smile on its continuous smile. But one of these movies is particularly big crime and it is 'Transfilieria 6-5000', a big waste for many reasons. <br /> <br /> Professional: This is a great cast which makes it the best. Dopey humor is some fun. Hold a corny, but the theme song. Some good transylvanian location <br /> <br /> Cons: Threadbayer Plot. Mostly tiring pacing. Most of the humor does not cut it. Monsters are offered little work and little screen time. Was I supposed to be a spoof in this giant movie? The end of the lam is that the audience will be angry. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: Is It A Comedy? So why are so much fun and so little bit? Comedies are supposed to roll on our floor, do not roll our eyes and yawn, overching for it. I can not believe Anchor Bay is a tired junk release. I admit it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but if you are a fan of actors, then this is not a time or money value. Instead see 'Transylvania Twist'. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/5
