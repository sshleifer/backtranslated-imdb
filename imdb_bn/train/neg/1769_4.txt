First seen 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Mick Garris): Stephen King's movie, like Campie Vampire, is so weird and stupid elements that you start to laugh about extreme curiosity. The following can be a ritual for the King fans of this movie. It is a mother and son who searches for sleeping horses (like a shape migration, eat meat, life needs, humanoid extinct descent), to save the lives of the virgins from town to town, to keep themselves alive. They are hidden lovers and cats coming out of their homes, without the wail of the day and night, as the beautiful normal high-class people. Cats are their deadly, so they try to keep the public in their yard and keep the trap set down. When we attacked them, they saw some of their neck breaks (which was the first of my movie's ongoing experience) - I hope that no real cat will be damaged in film making. The boys after the sweet girl, when she gets "sleeping" until she gets buried and she wants her body. There are so many cams unique in this movie that it was better than the miracle of colonial living, but instead of the director you try to frighten him within a few minutes, unless you want to get it. Gore brought out Eventually that will happen and the film stays at the end of its general Stephen King Downbeat. The film is interesting because the comedians are more than normal, but their curiosity is very present and a movie of what you have, which their fans probably should have in their collection and should be with them, but this is not really a perfect movie experience.
