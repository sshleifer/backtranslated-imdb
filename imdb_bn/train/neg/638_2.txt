The good world is probably the most annoying movie of my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting borderline is unlimited. Although I love Paul Munie, I can now say that I have seen a movie which does not judge his true power. The only saving I found with this film is the price of production it produces. Hundreds of additional uses throughout the film create a very credible and attractive environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create illusions of millions of earthquakes were easily sold and revolutionary. I can say something other than the production price which is good or entertaining about this movie.
