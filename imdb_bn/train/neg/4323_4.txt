European holidays (the European Vacation of Uk National National Lampon) are the weakest of the holiday films (the best of first and third movies). Returning to Chavey Chase and Beverly D'Angelo Clark and Alan Griswald (with new actors in the role of Ras and Audrey Griswald), they were given poor scripts with very bad dialogue at this time. Enjoying this pissing problem, Jokes are not very funny. Instead of serving the central plot of more than 3 holiday films, the reason for actually damaging this movie is, as "jokes", they are stuck in a bundled script alone). Oh well, they all could not win them. 10 out of 4
