I usually try to create reasonably reasonable criticism of movies, but I can not believe that it went on the script's stage. The conversation is frustrating, the acting is very tragic, the pronunciation is just awful, and the direction and the pacing well scraps. <br /> <br /> I think I did not see a movie for the last time. Joseph Fiennes, as he is pretty, might start his career as soon as possible to kill her career. <br /> <br /> Doctor Moriora Island is not worse than this garbage.
