Given the title and the ornate box industry, I was just about ready for something. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The best way to spend fog and evening is to have the decision. Where is this set up used before? The difference here is gender uber-reverse nature. Not all products were allowed to be shown (as long as the green shots in Japan have been shown to be illegal, it has been shown) as much effort as possible to show the viewer of the film as unorthodox sexuality. <br /> <br> Among all the strange phenomena, a muddy monster (whose original source I can not understand) and killed a man and started rape of women ... and then killed them too. Some of the sights are somewhat more, especially if a woman exits her intestine through her cell or spit in front of another woman ... but otherwise the price of the fair value of the cow. <br /> <br /> Finally the film is drawn by its own design; It is too much sex to be a straight horror picture and it is very terrible to act as a sex flick. Medium can work, but there will be a balance. <br /> <br /> 4/10
