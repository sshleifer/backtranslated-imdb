If I want to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I will have to give it a low score of 3/10. <br /> <br /> But it was entertaining, and there's a lot to say about this movie. <br /> <br /> The psychiatrist James Bishop has been appointed to his resident St. Andrew's Hospital and he is encouraged and interested in "changing the world". <br /> <br /> From the beginning you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and can not recognize this recess. <br /> <br /> The story is fairly well-made, you know what is true about what some of the patients are saying about and when James is wondering about how to discover this. Also, when the break comes, James is attacked by evil and you feel a little suspicious until the "war" is over. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Another mental horror element, and you can get the picture. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < <<br /> <br /> The image sets unexpected scenes, it is also quite well done. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> How to kill this movie: * Stupid special effects - A modern version of "Plan 9 from modern space" - Bad type (evil demon genius rascal) * Some bad acting (or possibly filming) Rarely takes anything) - The main character sometimes works badly, and sometimes good. * The term is sometimes very cheap. <br /> <br /> I'm thinking of creating a movie with "My Home Video Camera" throughout the film.
