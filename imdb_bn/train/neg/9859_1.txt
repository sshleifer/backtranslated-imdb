This movie is just lame. Total waste of time and money. Curiosity is predictable, the letters do not have much clich√© and the way they talk about RPG gamers is also not fun. The problem is that authors do not know how an RPG game works and, most importantly, how to curious about this game. Of course there are a bunch of victims who have frankling reverse and play RPGs like total damages. But for me it is not the most fun way to joke about this game. The story does not make any sense at all. Who care about how long a game has played? The biggest problem in this movie is that writers and actors do not want to know about an RPG even curious about it. I felt ashamed by watching this lunatic movie.
