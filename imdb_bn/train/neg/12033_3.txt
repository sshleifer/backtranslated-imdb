Movies about small towns like Mormons and Baptists. The new family continues, the overwritten dialogue, the medium-acting, the green zelo salad with rooted carrots, and everyone knows the 'joke of Manomone'. Anyone outside of Mormon culture will find it difficult to beat this movie. Anyone inside Mormon culture will be a little surprised with a chocolate here and there. It will be better if you watch other movies in Hesse (Napoleon Dynamite, etc.). Acting medium Jared Hesse's "Sants and Sadders" and "Napoleonic Dynamite" has many other handfuls of quality films. I would recommend both movies on this groaner.
