... and how they raised you straight from your mind! Crater Lake Monster is one of the 70 classic BAD movies produced by 70 notes of "Awful" lungs with no notes, no shameful script, harmful direction and light comedy. This film introduces a paleontologist, who draws a water dinosaur under the crater lake ... a meteorite falls from the sky, and the soils of water-borne dinosaurs are terrorized and Kutter Lake starts eating the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The whole thing is that Steve is taken care of by our local Sheriff. Most movies - when we do not see blood pools, we see that we have imagined that the animal dining - two people named Arini and Mitch are spent after the ironic antics who hire the boat. They try so hard to be funny that we want to get the line, see a business mark, Mitch Arnie says, "You made a misspelling, it's been made in Ban'At." The smile was rather unexpected here. We get drunk together with them and see the imagination of a tree trunk to be dinosaurs. Looking at Laurel and Hardy! Dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way. And in very short time, the lake is beautiful.
