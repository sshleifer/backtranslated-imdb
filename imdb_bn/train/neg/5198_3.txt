This is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but when I look bad I can not really remember. I would have inquired about this in an air crash. What it really was was a soap opera, and that's a bad one. They overplayed the extreme 'rivalry' cards. Looks like a scream in the first hour or something like this, that has been thrown out in some improbable scenes. <br /> <br /> * Probable spoiler * <br /> <br /> The 40-minute-minute 'monument' scene (with the necessary black umbrellas and rain) was fantastic lunatic crash, and I thought it would not end . <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
