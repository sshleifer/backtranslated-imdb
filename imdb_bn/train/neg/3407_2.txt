Okay, forget that all technical inconsistencies or physical abnormalities in the space shuttle are wrongly being introduced with the heart of an impressive robot. Forget the harmful special effects and weak-built one-dimensional characters. Just looking for the context of the story. The reason for the picture being present in the first place, and you will see how badly the film was involved. <br /> <br /> I looked at this humiliation of this 9-year-old intellectualization and just smile at it. The story is horrific. The act is ridiculous and it is impossible to try to hear the message. And what's worse, the cable movie channel is shown to it! Every two or three days every day! Why does anyone think in their right mind that people want to see this painful piece of celluloid more than once, is it very rare to see it? <br /> <br /> My recommendation is not to disturb the energy to see it. It's not worth its value.
