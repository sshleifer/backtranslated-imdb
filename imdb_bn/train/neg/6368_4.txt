At least once I rent a video in the IMDB review, rent it out. The Limiei Steven Soderberg, who wrote the real horror nightwatch with Ian McGigger, and operated a trash like an out-of-the-road with anti-talent Jennifer Lopez. Terrence Stamp is a fine actor and it is embarrassing that he added himself to such a bad movie. It is often a misleading edit that seems like a last-minute decision to get frequent or tale, filming and general general knowledge. This film makes everything wrong. What did they think?
