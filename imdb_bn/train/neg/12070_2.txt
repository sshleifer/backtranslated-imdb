I bought one of the 50 movie pack collections "Legacy of Haar" and if you believe I'm still looking for them to find a good horror movie. Sometimes you find a campus that is enjoyable like The Devils Messenger or The Devil Batt, or one of Alfred Hitchcock's movies (although not a few horns, but only because of the hatchecks being directed by some awesome and suspicious), but at other times they think that they keep movies like Island Monster and Because they can not be easily forgotten, and in that case it is Each. <br /> <br /> So we started to open the idea of ​​Westing's game. The rich but cruel and humiliating father managed by the carabinie (a permanent feature of it) dies and leaves his heir to his children and slaves whom he hates. Carradine always gives a good enough performance as well, but he left us to sit through medium / terrible performance, there is a voice recording and flashback sequence left mainly. The rest of the cast thrown or overacts or overacts. This 70's gave an independent film lighting and the effect was quite limited. It is difficult to create many excitement that is not visible to viewers in some scenes. Some actors like Egre and Elgo give at least one attempt and I'm basically shy to leave the kind of left-left chuckling for sheer stupidity but still some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a curve, otherwise the superb obvious K-make-it-film-quality Not enough to improve. You are not meant to like characters as selfish and cruel or psychologically, but it takes a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. The death scene is quite bad and the mystery is not really there. This proves that you will probably enjoy 20 movie packs, "Chilling", which has movies like House on Mounted Hill, Jack Nicholson's Little Shop of Harrison and Night of the Living Dead. This is best avoided.
