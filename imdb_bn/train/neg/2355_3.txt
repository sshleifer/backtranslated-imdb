I've often tried to include songs in a movie. I believed that the quality of the movie will be automatically upgraded if only those extremely annoying songs remain unchanged. However, after seeing the horrific black (no song) and this movie, the songs (lots of songs), everything changed rapidly. Although black was an extreme weak, some played strong and delivered a secret story with good aspects. The songs were almost coherently mixed with accessory and film. During the night streets, the source of mysterious water is not sprayed with water for any obvious reason. <br /> <br /> I'm a brave and brave manager. There was no shine in anything and almost every view was completely believable. <br /> <br /> I recommend these movies with a little understanding of the lives of the Hindi-speaking people in Mumbai. The previous reason is that the English subtitles were the same and there are many errors, which, at times, completely reverse the meaning of the actual statement. After you live your life, you will definitely appreciate the accuracy of the image. <br /> <br /> I must rank it as deserving of international recognition. Scenes with gazing drivers have a nice touch and it worked together as a source of genuine humor and another view of the entire Mishish. The film falls short in some places, though the characters sometimes say the most vague things that can be reduced from the overall picture of the film. <br /> <br /> I also thought that the sad scenes were not very good work. It was interesting to watch rather than wake up feeling of frustration and the whole scene became a little stupid. Although these minor topics, entirely, are really a rare treatment for watching the film. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an ironic, neutral point of view and a refreshing! Actors, not heroes - this is the original. A remarkable setting of trustworthy people - daily life A behind-the-scenes look at the amount of depravity and an rare ray for Indian movies. <br /> <br /> 8/10.
