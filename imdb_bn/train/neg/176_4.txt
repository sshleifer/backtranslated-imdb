<br /> <br /> I saw it on the Saifai Channel. It came right after the first one. For some reason this movie kept me interested. I do not know why, stop asking. <br /> <br /> --- Speaker --- OK ... how this man was involved with the creation of this movie was very impressive. In the first film, there was "cause" to kill people, but at this moment, half of the assassination / attempted murder was fundamentally due to any reason. Stanley killed the director due to creative differences, because of creative differences he picked up co-authors, but what was the attempt to kill Cast? No cast, no movie He wanted "real face when they died"? If it is supposed to be a high budget movie, use special effects, MAN Of course like the first, the captive girl goes away, and Stanley ends, and becomes tearsome. Woooooow (restriction). This movie is potentially HAD. And the most tragic thing ... really sad part ... I'd like to see "a cabin by Lake 3". Just because I like Jude Nelson, and he's the only good part about this signal.
