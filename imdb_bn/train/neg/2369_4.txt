Freddie Kruger's 6th Quarter Journey, which he finally was able to kill almost every youth at Sprundwood; Now she wants to expand her horizon and (** speller **) needs family members to do this. Failure as a horror movie because it is not easily scary. You work as well as a dark, macaroon black comedy to tell the truth. Freddie Kruger is now stripped of all his ability to cool the viewers. (Too many ads, this is definitely guaranteed.) Actors are not attractive (always save Robert Eldond, and always save a slammy Yaphet Kotto) and there are only a lot of visual effects. The end is okay, but I hope no one can provide many sparks that can expect. <br /> <br /> By adding a new twist to the story of the murderer of a known dreamer, it gives the opportunity to make more non-makeup in England before scenes <br /> <br /> The comments are evaluated: Then there is a joint appearance of Joan Rozan and Tom Arnard, which is an idyllic entertainment, an appropriate look of the old shock-rock Alice Cooper, and a Johnny Depp's funny low pop icon. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Repeat key views of previous entries in closing credits. <br /> <br /> 4/10
