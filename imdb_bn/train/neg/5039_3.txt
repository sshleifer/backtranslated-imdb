Rex Reid once seems to be shot in a movie ("Julia and Julia" to be specific) that it is shot with great juice. I was reminded as I snored through that purple butterfly. <br /> <br /> This story was boring and there was no help that the faces of the actor were literally out of focus for a large part of the scene or just after the extended period, only the focus was on time. <br /> <br /> Everyone also looked the same, so it was difficult to differentiate between letters. I call it "Dead Cubs Society" syndrome. <br /> <br /> There was no one to care for anyone, nor could anyone be interested in dramatically, and the film did not have a very interesting time and set historical history. <br /> <br /> Total frustration.
