Repeat: According to legends, Velakiri Brunhilda denied Odin and was locked in a rock around the eternal fire. Only a pure warrior can go through the fire, free from the demands of Brunhilla and Odin, and you can stay with yourself for yourself. Now, war is going on in Norses, and the king needs a alliance with the barristers. Berserkers fight for Odyssey's valkyries, war, blood and flesh, and therefore demanded Outstairs, but the superior in the war. The leader of the Berserker Raja, Boar is a shocked son, and the value of the alliance is his brother, future King, Bérék. But after the King won the war, he refused to give up his only son, break the oath to the bury, and betray him and kill him. Orein is protected only by burke's call. But the fight between these brothers is just starting, and their final battle is going to start almost a thousand years ... <br /> <br />: I hope that it will be a movie some viking grounds, much less about Vikings Movie has been made. It started very well, with lengthy detail and arms, beautiful and perfect graduation and a good fight. <br /> <br /> The basis of the bases of the blessings is thin and looks very weak to me. Oddin is more vengeful, awkward and absent, I remind him of school, and the vulcaries have become some vampire-monsters. I'm not an expert, but it seems completely wrong. <br /> <br /> But the serious mistake caused by this movie is to move from the original period to the current period. If the two brothers fought in the right time, this movie would have been better with some decent wars. Now the setting, suddenly varies from current Stockholm. Nevertheless, Oddin is present and sending Boar and his Barker for Brunhilda and Berk, who shows Burke a picture of artificial armored and scrawny armor in the industry. Beautiful hills and wood have been exchanged for cement. And when single focus was given to attention, instead of a huge war at the beginning, I quickly saw that the fights and the skills of the actors are slow and weird. <br /> <br /> The end result is thin story, sometimes hard to follow and the other is only silly, and only that it can save, actions are drawn from the slow, dull and erect swordfight. It is very rare to draw from Aesir legends or Vikings traditions. So both story and action fails, and the movie is just plain bad. Finally, as a Sweden, this movie is a little confusing. Perfectly portrayed in South Africa, it still seems to be some familiar Swedish signs, plates and an authentic police car. However, the effort is poor and only goes so far, it's really set to Sweden. No name is Swedish (probably not exempt as an exception), no known graduate is not Swedish, they (not supposedly) Swedish, but can speak Norwegian (slightly)? And uniforms, both police and medical, are not clearly Swedish. If they can not try to do it properly - and why is the confusion set in Sweden really boring? <br /> <br /> 4/10
