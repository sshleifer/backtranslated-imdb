Well when I used to see it at a home projector as a little butterfly my beloved as a child would have to accept this one. Now there is nothing to suggest that "awesome" actors have nothing to do except for the implicit camp values ​​by replicating people's coupons. Special effects are pretty stupid, mostly on the forehead of the cables and crocodile "ghost" pictures. <br /> <br /> But the sets have something to say. The big palace where it takes place is quite vague, especially it is mostly indefinite (probably due to budget reasons)? <br /> <br /> This clearly encourages laughter more than screaming. Do not try to get giggles when the wife goes to the Green House (who shares her screams) and encounters with her husband's former ghost
