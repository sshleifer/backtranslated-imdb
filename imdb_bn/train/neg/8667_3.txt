It's a nice, deep cast but for an exciting you get better name than the actor and talk. The first third of this movie was nothing but the words, and there was more to say. Most of these were just a bunch of women crying out to each other. <br /> <br /> Here are the top five women actresses, so that they truly check out "Chick Flick" and others. It could possibly play on the Lifetime network. <br /> <br /> there was a quick killer scene and there was further discussion. Through half, they were lost to me. <br /> <br /> The Sally Field is about 15 years old here.
