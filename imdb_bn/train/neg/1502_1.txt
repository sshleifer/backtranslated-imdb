A movie of Django's Ballad is a confusing mess! This spaghetti is a concept of Western Scenic Collection (and more!), Which is tied together by "Zeno", telling about different kinds of law and order. Hunt Powers (John Cameron) Django role does not come in nothing. You only have to create each Django movie and leave it one unless it can be a good enough excuse to see!
