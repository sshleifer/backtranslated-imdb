If you look at Corey's information on IMDB, there is clearly a movie called "Reload" (as of June 08), playing a character named Sebastian Cole. <br /> <br /> Firstly, such pornographic films never earn a series of income ... and secondly, did Sebastian not be killed after "loading"? <br /> <br /> I saw this early in the morning. Insomnia was fighting, and so was when I was drifting inside and out. I'm sure I've missed some plot points, but overall, it looked really weak. Large performance was (for me) one of the strongest parts of the film. I am surprised to comment on the beautiful girls, since I thought that Brooke's acting actress was beautiful, but not exceptional.
