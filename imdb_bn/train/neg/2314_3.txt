Plot Synopsis: When his wife, a news reporter is kidnapped and replaced with an Android double, secret agent Agent Erich Phillips watches him down and plans by the arms dealer to create an army of unreasonable arods to kill world leaders. <Br> <br /> Richard Pepin's low-budget scientist / action hybrid "cyber tracker" I did not expect much when I saw this series. This film was not something special, "The Terminator" and "Robocop" did not mention a lump sum rip off. This signal is already the same, with an out-of-order action sequence opening the movie. A large amount of explosions, heavy gunfights and huge body parts, as well as some martial arts film stars, Don "The Dragon" came from Wilson. The whole film seems to be at least consonant with the intriguing scenes. Acting Front, Wilson is a bad actor. He really needs a personality replacement.
