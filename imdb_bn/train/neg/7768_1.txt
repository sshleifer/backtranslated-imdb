This is the owner of nearly three abandoned God who gathered a group of people to play a deadly game and the winner gets one million dollars. First of all, acting terrible, and the movie makes absolutely no sense. It's not least bit scary, it's so stupid that it lets me laugh, so it has gained 1 star. This film is not violent, but it is quite lazy and most women pay attention to the nipples. , And some of the characters are very annoying and whiny Also, the monsters of this movie are so impressive and not fake and scary that it wants to throw you something on the screen. Last but not least is not terrible at all. If you're really curious to see this junky, I do not want to give it. Avoid All Costs !!!!! <br /> <br /> is not rated for nudity, profanity, and hedges (but should be r).
