I hate this movie so much that I think it clearly. It's not even fun. A movie which relies on illogical sexual fantasies and racism humor is not worth the money to make it. In the first half hour, Rob Schneider drink a carton of Ranikidas milk. I could remember that "he deserves to make such a bad film." Do not waste your time or money on this.
