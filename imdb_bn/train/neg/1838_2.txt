"Jealousy" is bad for many reasons. Yes, there are characters unlike. That's not the problem. It's unlike they and we do not care about them all. "The War of the Roses" contains unlike characters, but due to appropriate roles, we have at least been interested in their own fate, where the "jealous" presentation is thin, the letters are not reliable and the plot just makes things worse. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Ben Stilller is easily boring in his role and I am most often a fan of his work. Stella campaigned to publish this video directly and now I can see why. The film proposes that he is "best friend" with Jack Black, but in the first five minutes we were given footage which hated Stiler. I thought it would be a solo correlation (a La "The Cable Guy") but it never happens, instead of calling Stella as her "best friend" and I feel confused because she seems to behave like a black, Poo. " The film's plot is ridiculous but it does not matter, because it is considered to be an exaggerated morality story. Unfortunately the message is lost in the world. Walken gives a good performance but black off-key and annoying (and I usually find him very funny). No, this is not a horror movie, but I still can not believe Barry Levinson ("Rain Man," "Sleepers") is responsible for - it's not one of the worst movies of all time, but it can certainly be perfectly good. . I hope there was a gh-roy-raise - so we could make this movie disappear forever ....
