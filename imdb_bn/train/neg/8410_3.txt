This movie is all flash and no soul. The actors keep many emotions in numbers, but these numbers are often not associated with the film and stand alone felt like video. And no effort was made to make the word of the word appear in front of you, everyone sounds like coming from the studio, basically enjoying all life from the song. Stage performance is all lazy and unrealistic, especially Hodgson, who is basically the same angry, "strong" (he's dirty and selfish) black woman, which we've seen before. There was absolutely no depth in her character, and no other woman did it. Although I think the film wants us to believe that Hudson's character faces hardships due to her weight, but it really denies her own problem, which leads her into trouble and makes the film completely meaningless. Hudson's Academy Award was a joke, no support. When he sang, he expressed his emotions (although it was often wrong, but it was the fault of writer / manager), but when he was just acting, he did nothing to musclose an underrated character. The character of Eddie Morphy is the only one, and he did a good job, but still Oscar is not worthy. Danny Glover, who took a relatively unexpected character and made some real sense from it, only the actor who brought a roll on it. There is nothing here to tear down your teeth, play or heart or even laugh. The installation of musical numbers was so bad that sometimes the film seems to be fun, instead of making musicals fun; When Hudson is debating with other girls, the number is so long that it can be passed for a family Guy Schitt. There is no idea about the movie, and I have been humiliated for the last few minutes. This is a big, annoying waste, and the worst movie I've seen in 2016, and with the beginning of last year nothing really was wonderful.
