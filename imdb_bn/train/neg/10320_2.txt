I really hope that it will be a fun show, all promotions and cute preview clips given. And talk about the promotion, even heard an interview with the show's creator on BBC World Today - a show spread across the world. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this show is not even close to distribution. All the jokes are clear - for the first time you feel like a funny word that you hear them - but then they seem to be lam - and they are not given any new treatment or twists. All of the letters are one dimensional. Acting - well - middle (I'm having nice). This classic CBC recipe - which always fails. <br /> <br /> If you are a Muslim, I think that you have to be stupid to believe in a white character, and if you are white almost all of the white characters are often portrayed as confiscated, unconscious, or both. Making fun of white people is not a problem - the best of these are mainly comedy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So how did any of these show producers find?
