Photos of the Republic "The Wavefuff" Ere Wakrett style comes late. While coming back to Paris after a long trip abroad, the writer is the author, during which he feared the jungle, during which he blackouted. He is a good seller in parallel to a notorious trial that is coming for great praise as his novel. The French government wants to know what he has access to secret documents, the possibility of an officer being killed by "catman". His drunk suspicion in the end of the dead really falls on the author. The complex issues are the return of the Blackout so that the author does not know if he is a killer. <br /> <br /> Well, the thriller is very much delightful to enjoy it completely. All the middle and the next sections have a lot of musical numbers and much more dead time during the conversation. Acting is fine and the set is quite good but there is a reason that I know that most people remember only the leading killer, he is the most interesting thing in this movie. Despite its short running time (just an hour), I think that this movie was rarely seen on TV, that after 20 minutes you would start losing patience with it. As well as the talk, I just wanted to do something to someone. When the end was over, it was too late .. <br /> <br /> <br /> Take a pass.
