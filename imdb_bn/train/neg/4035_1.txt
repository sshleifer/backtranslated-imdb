I hate to be one of the rain (even a small one like this) rain, but from the first scene, you might say this film is going to be the absolute shite. It's really a shame, I'm quite like Martin Freeman and Danny Dyer. I will meet together together, but they did not have a single scene for my disappointment! I think I have to repeat it - two main actors (who stood beside the advertisement poster and the DVD cover) did not have a scene together !!!! They did not talk to each other and did not appear on screen at the same time. Just sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertising <br /> <br /> The dialogue was painful, every single character in the film was unreal, and like the people. The scenes were far away, the plot was whip, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried very hard to be funny (and a poor man from the team played the team), some were not liked, and some of the worst, so some letters were annoying that it almost Moved to switch, because I could not bear to see it, or would not like to hear them again. <br /> <br /> This low budget sticker was an epic failure. Even Danny Dyero could not throw some humor and elegance in it, but blessed, he tried. What time is the waste <br /> <br /> This movie can make me like ten towers, outside of me. Ten stars Seriously? Come on .... I will not even give ten big stars, because the ten stars mean that a movie was perfect. This picture is completely opposite, almost the opposite, which means it was almost entirely terrible. See it if you like, but if you have seen lots of movies and many have seen great movies, your review will probably be similar to me. <br /> <br /> 1/10
