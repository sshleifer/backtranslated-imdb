Is this a stupid movie? You bet !! I can not find this movie at any moment scary or scary. Stupid moment? Lots of Stupid characters? You bet Bad effects? All the places! Rick Baker has gone and big and good things can be done, it's not one of them. Oh good man's got to start somewhere. Dr. Ted Nelson is cheesy. The most whiny doctor he has ever seen. He has found a molten man running in Venue County in some places, his wife is pregnant (probably 55 years old and weighing 90 pounds) and is not very happy at any place. Plus he's got very very helpful general on his barrier to find out the astronaut Steve. And the local sheriff asked to know, no matter what, Mr. Nelson could not tell him anything. There are some random characters thrown for better measurements who face molten people. Finally the film ends and scrapes the trash can to make the giant compost. Ultimately it is your requirement for a wonderful MST episode.
