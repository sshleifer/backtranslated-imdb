Senator Joe McCarthy is still a legendary political giant king with a legendary story which is hard to find in the film. Boyle (as Joe) provides a compulsory but historically incorrect screenplay by the Wisconsin Senator, many of the trick McCarthy actually accept. During the army hearing in 1954, Mauridit was always better as military lawyer Joseph Welch, outsourcing McCarthy. <br /> <br /> In fact, McCarthy and Cohen were worried about the safety-related security situation in the army and the army's hearings in 1954 were filled with smoke-screen used by the army and they could face investigation from their security failure, which the committee is investigating, complaining that McCarthy and no one is trying to bias on behalf of their staff, David Shaw In, when on this service. <br /> <br /> This film was based on spontaneous programmatic vertebrates, which was plural, based on the many mythological stories taken for truth with many people, 'red-red' was mainly based on Phoenix and McCarthy, HUC etc., always away from the wrong targets, Not lying, the campaign of spreading the profession, which was suppressed on the constitutional rights of innocent libertarians, Those who were accused of security risk / decreasing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Wrong information is expanding, it is no surprise that people have swallowed it. Schulberg's serious left wing is a recent hurdle to the British newspaper "The Guardian", titled "McKarthy" named "names" by the author of Hollywood - "Hollywood" investigation as the head of McCarthy HVAC is "false" - true that McCarthy was even a member of HHIL No, and he did not have much interest in Hollywood politics - his investigation often came from the US government's arms It was limited. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " It is difficult to correct public misconceptions over the decades of this era but it is fully exploded by US government documents. <br /> <br /> One day, some bold Hollywood souls will create a movie that American Americans and men secretly helped Stalin killer, and in reality worked to blame the governors. In the Western world, Joe Mccarthy can give a correct account of his career - but I can not hold my breath. Until then, we find this legendary, drunken false media's popular imagination lies ... "Tile Counters Jo".
