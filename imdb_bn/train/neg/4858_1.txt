Why would anyone in the world make this piece of trash movie? The first two zombie bladbath movies were stupid, but it took the cake for the worst (probably all the time) in the triangle. Todd Sheet is still the director, but it is not a negative or positive screenplay, he is the author who is uninterrupted as the author. The article is very reliable f-word, which is used anywhere between 200 to 300 times. Acting is equivalent to the last two bloodthirsty movies, so naturally, what I saw is quite bad. Special effects are better than the last 2, but they still look godly. This plot has become very complicated for itself, and some government exams have gone wrong and zooms are being produced. Also featured in the chorogenic way that mutant zombies and school kids travel during that time, frozen, leading one of the most stupid end I've ever seen. After the movie it passed, which is strange because this whole film is an outtake. Just look for it's fun, because if you go into it with a serious mind you can probably kill yourself. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / **** 95 minutes
