How are these pieces of garbage are made to film beyond me? Only actor Judge Reynold, known to me, is an acting actress whose presence is just right to produce it. <br /> <br /> I do not think it deserves a nomination. The Rotten Tomato Award, this film really does not have to be a cinematographic movie. Carriage with the police along the freeway in the car, and no one can stop the car, all right. <br /> <br /> The script is written behind the cigarette carton. Most of the TVs are horrific but the word is redefined. Check out bridges performance of bridge operators, pure Oscar material.
