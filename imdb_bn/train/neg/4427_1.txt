The final score ... carries it - it's a reality show. It does not have any love for the audience, it pauses to lazy TV viewers, does not keep anything in it and gets nothing. <br /> <br /> "Joe Millionaire", their most appealing phony reality show, a television disaster epic proportion. It's not for Fox, but for America's public, Waterhead, the rock at the bottom, who really can see, talk and talk about this shit the next day. You people will be ashamed of themselves. Since Fox promotes this junk, it will not make any money until it gets noticed by people (and the boy was, the final got the super-ball number!). It does not disturb you that there are so many quality shows, guided, played and usually their efforts are being canceled and you cancel this endless, cool game show while taking away the show? <br /> <br /> I was Fox's Stander Supporter. It's like us who likes and finds good TV like us, helped to build Fox again on married days ... with children and Simpsons. Convenient enough, now in those shows it will not be ready for 6 weeks with current management. Gayle Berman is often referred to as "the reign of terrorism". The network has fought on script TVs and, oddly, fans of it. The very first people who helped them at the beginning. Now, we do not have to fight for our good program, but we have to fight our own networks. It boggles the mind Nothing makes Fox, no sense, done in the last 3 years. "Titas", "Phuturama" and "John Do" (NBC can renew "Bumunton" but if hits are hits, but can not any other shot of Fox make it a great shot to give a decent show?). And they can do all this: Junk's success like J Millionaire. They can now say "we do not need TV fans, our reality shows are there". They apparently have no idea that the big crowd is clinging to this junk and the next fad comes along with the second one to release them. In this way, to cut off their base, eventually the ABC will set up a network that has been set up. <br /> <br /> The show itself is a joke. Here we now have a classic fox gymnastic, which gives us a slightly different and radioactive commitment, but then does not give anything different from "Bachelor" or bigger 3. Fox has gone mainstream. The final and "twist" (quote / quotation) show that there is no sense in them. Now we know that all of these shows, they do not show any difference, all are the same tombs, the fairy tales will end. We have seen a bunch of lingering ambassadors that the networks have found millions of head shots suitable for their demographic parade like their population Bimbos, claiming they liked Ivan Meriot ... because it was a competition and it was what you did Is supposed to be. Marriott is like himself a weirdly embroidered thief-magazine, who struggled to combine the simplest sentences. But how do women (all kinds of ugly guides - an important minus such a guilty pleasure show) do not read "loudly" with charming lines like "Joe", for example, "Look, you are not stupid". <Br> <br /> I used to think that seeing this reality / dating / game show that was simply lazy to change the channel, but after "Joe Millionaire" I think they are really mentally in need. Come to the people, be a little too proud of yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
