I'm really sorry to miss every single second while watching this movie, really. Sadly, once I start watching it, it's hard to switch the movie. Especially, when using it for a classic or a classic call. I think that a movie lover has seen at least one of these movies, so I saw it. Do not blame me, I like Humphrey Boutert and his wife Lorraine Bekal, both like a couple and actors, but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion. No really good plot, a romantic love story that does not spark a spy. Well, this is even a strong mix of both styles. The only thing to create tension was that it was uncertain whether 'bogi' and backlash would remain together or part from one another. I think "there is a lot and there is not much", and in the 1940s, Bogart was very good film.
