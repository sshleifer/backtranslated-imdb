Last night I grabbed this movie on FX, and I sat there and watched it, it happened to me that perhaps it might be the worst movie. Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad words, complete incredible fight sequences, stupid characters. All this made me to be the most ridiculous bad movie she ever saw. It was very bad, I was fascinated by the lack of that half-worthless observation I had ... and they made a signal!
