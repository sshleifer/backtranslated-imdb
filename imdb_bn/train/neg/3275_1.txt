Do not watch this movie if you like Classic, such as Tom Wetp, John Scandar, Kathryn Batch, Sound Book, James Best, Denver Pile, Sony Schwire and Ben Jones! This movie will blame you very badly! Above all, this movie begins with the light of the moon and the moon at the sight of Jesse for Jesse. Bo and Louie never do that in the original series! This movie features unknown characters that never happened in the series. In the series, Aunt Jesse was honest, and to abide by the law. In this movie, he is a criminal who is moon and smoke with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this extension is added to the Hejard Reunion Duchess! And Hollywood's Hazard Duchess, I have a question: How can Jassee face before Hajjad's hunger before he dies? How did he die when he died before the liberation war in 1997? Movie and Roskow Run Hajjard? ITEMSEMS Magical that these characters have returned to life, when they died for 11 and 8 years? If Hollywood really wants to make a good film, in 1997 and 2000, they wanted to bring back James Bast, John Scendor, Tom Wapat, Ben Jones, and Kathryn Bach and made family-friendly films with original real characters. What it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see a good Duke movie then buy the original series or go to Walmart.com and buy 2 DVD sets, which include Hugsdro's Dukes in Reunion and Hollywood movies! They are both original cast stars, and family friendly! Do not waste your time in a movie worthless CD!
