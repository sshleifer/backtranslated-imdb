Fortunately I do not see this movie. Also, I could not publish any spoilers because I voluntarily walked out of the movie forty minutes later. It was that bad. I once laughed, when yahoo! The billboard fell on the guy, and came to the theme song. However, since I thought it was fun, but then I realized that it still had the stability of any other product. <br /> <br /> I like the cartoon. I used to see it almost religiously. (Although I missed the last episode, I heard that they showed Dr. Claude and it was nothing more than Clo, someone commented on the show's page) Cartoon had more than Pannie and Breanne's film. I hate the whole thing setup, Robocop is memorable. Then the screws with the whole feeling of Broderick Inspector Gadget Cartoon is almost not as painful as it is. Another fact is that in his gadgets I actually saw that the oil is shiny except glossy. He used an exciting tone which screwed up with the "Wowsers" tone. I was so disappointed that they killed such a cartoon. Everyone else felt that way. Our 14-17 year olds love cartoons and we love it every minute. <br /> <br /> I gave the film an open mind, I knew they were drunk with the cartoon. I was surprised how the movie was spent. It depends on sight gags, and stupid dialogue for humor. Depending on Disney, pushing a children's movie relieves pain and physical humor. This film is worthless in the film placement, and it shows. According to the wise-cracking car cracking is not good at all. Gadgets look beautiful, but they were shiny almost shiny. The cartoon was a good look. The intelligent scene was shit. In 40-45 minutes I saw the movie, I could not hear a smile, and they laughed at the Doodle-Doo-Right preview. This movie should not be seen by people who want to entertain their family. I highly recommend "The Iron Giant", which was tragic, but very good. This movie is a mockery of the whole family drama .------------ 1
