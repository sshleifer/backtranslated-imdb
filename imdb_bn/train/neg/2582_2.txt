Just ending with American pie: Beta House and I would say, it was a junk pile of garbage. The first 3 American pace was sunny, the last 3 was a joke and the American was not supposed to be called. <br /> <br /> You have come out of the movie title, Beta House is about a Brotherhood, freshmen, girls and, the most original part of them, fall in love. Of course, the man who stays with his children, Stefler, who is trying to accomplish something other apparently impossible with his friends. It was unreal and super mesh. Its just really predictable and intact so weak. Both sides of the college see who gets the whole thing (like some) to add it: Terrible acting + dust script + wrong use of American pie franchise = waste time! This movie is intolerable. I can give it two out of ten, although mostly nudity and beautiful girls got, like 2 funny scenes :)
