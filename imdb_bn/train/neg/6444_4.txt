Most college students lose themselves on the academy's bubble, and cut off from communities they study and live in. Their conversations were held with the faculty of their fellow students and college. Steven Greenstone's documentary is a major example of a misleading college student, who, through limited contact with a small number of members, judges the entire community. <br /> <br /> The documentary focuses on a small group of people who were represented by the larger group of population represented. As usual, those who scream get the most media attention. Alongside the misrepresentation of the community that was established in the film, the documentary was well-formed. My only debate is that the feelings and objections portrayed in the film have been highlighted to the entire community, rather the entire community has been blamed instead of some of them. <br /> <br /> Naturally it is important to test debates like this and make people aware. Among the differences between the political opinions, but it is ridiculous to involve the whole community of people in some fundamentalist activities.
