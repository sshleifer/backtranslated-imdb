A very sticky and dull road movie, the desire to be hip and modern, the editing style and some weird camera has been shown in the corner, which only makes sleeping. <br /> <br /> The cast is broken, the text is stupid and hypocrisy. The only thing useful, the soundtrack of Lalo Shiffrin, is really cool and the first and interesting sequence, very original and interesting. <br /> <br /> If you can do that, bad feedback and opinions about this flicker are perfectly deserved; It's really pure garbage. Of course there is a character, it is shown in a movie which will not burn beer beer when it burns in the fire, but save it for the storm day where you have nothing to do.
