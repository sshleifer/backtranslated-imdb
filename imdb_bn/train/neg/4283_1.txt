Sorry, it's true. "Legiunea sträinä" Denialius's irreversible failure parameters reveal with full transparency. <br /> <br /> As already told, the author failed to comprehend the material elements and artistic intentions. Mental disorder is concerned with the mechanical technique of selection of news items and joins them without any validity; He only collects a boring pill of events, which is unable to follow at least a storyline. The level of the script is similar to "Kantar Romanai", which, like amateur games for the glorious achievement of the socialist reality - just goes in the opposite direction: The Communist line refers to narrow anxiety with only positive and sweet festivals, now Danieluk is simply undisputed negativism and hateful graduate. The idea material is zero, and "messages" at a "kindergarten" level, children and educators. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, he also forgot most basic professional principles. He will not be able to edit any dramatic situation, to do it right in the film scene, to properly frame and follow the simplest rules of the format of the film. Similar to the translation of the movie-story story-like parallel: "The sacred sheet man is not right in the document", and all these people are idle! What a huge distance from the fascinating artists of 1976-1984, who created unique works such as "Cruise", "Prova de Microphone", "Vantorere de Badpo" and even "Crossover" and "Glissando" ... Sees Transit Gloria Mundi ...
