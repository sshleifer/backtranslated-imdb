Yes, unfortunately I came across this DVD and it was incredibly awful. <br /> <br /> First, to suck the character. I mean, let's say if some of the orange hats are called 'Orange Sherbert', then these people are the best creative ideas for a character, but of course it must not be in the film making scene. Weak "costume", bad "interview", and basically no curse of this whole disc is no "wrestler" with any action. <br /> <br /> "Splendor Rampage Wrestling" does not have anything more than "wrestling" slowly and playfully raises together a trampoline. They are sure to hang around together all the time, a very early experience seems like a kids playtime than a "wrestling execution". <br /> <br /> Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty sluggish backyard wrestling clone. Instead of blood, weapons, glory and retreat, we are known as Trumpolin, Girlling kids, sharp audio, and some people are known as Orange Sherbur. <br /> <br /> Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD. It's boring
