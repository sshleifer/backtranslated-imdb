Someone may think that Robert Osborne has contracted to contract at TCM's library even at least interesting movies because it will explain how to publish the 'attributes' of this "charming" movie while looking after him on television. Seeing any old movie in IMDB, several satirical amateur critics received 'classic' status, I thought it was a rigorous requirement for a more honest review of the film. <br /> <br /> This is your father's 'shop around the corner' With 'you've got' for all my poets, it still fantasticly outshines as a rebuilding in almost every way. For those who actually saw, the flaws would be more obvious. <br /> <br /> I can remember from an inferior sweet poem (a tragic crystal effort in 'Humor'), the film gets off on the wrong foot and it does not really get back to the steps. This 'musical' only qualifies as one of the most obvious words of the word. The immediate forgotten musical numbers are dispersed and then Judy sings "Eye Care", when she undergoes surgery around the hostage. She sings songs in the store, Christmas Music is probably one of her best numbers. Miss Garland was wonderful in a number of musical genres, but here she is terribly ill. The role was largely met by June Allison and Judy is certainly unable to fulfill the old parts of the Margaret Sultan. Van Johnson also activates performance rather than rather a second rate Jimmy Stewart. Leads never receive chemistry of stewart / sulvan chemistry or even hedges / ryan chemistry. <br /> <br /> This is a film that knows some notes, but not music. Actually, it does not seem necessary to understand why it works and even the need to add another potential love interest for Van Johnson's character to complicate things in the Andesius. Replacing Remix for the Unreliable Use of Roots is a Hackney Plot Device which is an invaluable ventilation. It is almost embarrassing to see and it seems that this is probably taken by Dealerian and Flux Capacitor from an episode of Theory Company. This is really an excuse for a Keaton Feast. Even the big resolution scenario in romantic Leeds is mishandled. After watching both movies, you will understand why they call it 'Lubisch Touch' and 'Robert J. Leonard Touch ' <br /> <br /> Avoid it and re-add the original movie or an earlier movie from Judy Garland, unless you are an icon slaster, who has come down to the world once seen a big star.
