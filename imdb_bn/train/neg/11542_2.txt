An unpleasant woman and similarly unpleasant people were attacked violently and horrific by a team of two-dimensional Psycho Thugs at night on a forested road in England's Sherpasia. The men and women who attacked and attacked their attackers ... <br /> <br /> The boring piece of Voicesrestrial trash, no matter how to masquerading as the 'thought-provoking' drama, when the sub-winner is actually winning * p (You only know that Oliver Reid and Susan George have been made so easily in the 1970s). What is happening in Alice (Jillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Deer) is scary and devastating, but Dan Reid manages to nudge the audience in the last glow of his sexual abuse. During and after the attack, both Anderson and Anderson hung up their camera hungry, although the script abandoned nearly all the characters under the Tejgaon ocean of nearly two dimensional clinics. His script forces his characters to behave in such a way that the audience will be able to disassociate the viewers by pushing them into more deadly situations (both Sophie and Alice will be attacked after the Adams attack - objection to confessions) <br /> <br /> Contemporary central playwright Coming from acting - A terrible actor in the film, like a young man in the initial attack Disable shadows (he finished istendarsa, mark my words), but Anderson extraordinary. Even the unreasonable script forces its character to behave in a deprived and humorous way, yet it feels such a formidable, compelling and complex characterization as a spontaneous, arrogant henannist and needs revenge. <br /> <br /> then a vile and dull film, but almost never was recovered by a compelling central female performance.
