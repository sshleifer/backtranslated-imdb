I recently liked seeing this movie at the Dubai Film Festival because it was selected in the prestigious competition category of the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> <br /> Some critics have mentioned in the picture that the number of gunmen Not too much - but violent violence is boring. Imagine killing your enemy / opponent in front of your little boy or force someone to eat porridge spoon to prove loyalty to someone. Corollo's son opposite Coppola's "Godfather" has some indications that it seems to be revived here in the Chinese / Hong Kong film, but the quality of the two differs as chalk and cheese. <br /> <br /> The film is only recommended for violence zombies ... there is no great movie here. Best it can be thought to be better than the usual run-runs production for production quality.
