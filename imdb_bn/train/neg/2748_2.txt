This movie gets only the second star because I work in the city center and like to see it ruin. The effect was quite good - I heard it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. Being the most expensive and still absolutely awesome it is a huge amount of waste. I've rented it so I will not accuse me of what I gave, but it was a few hours that I would never get back. Plenty of plot holes Terrible acting across the board. I do not recommend time to watch this movie, life is too short. If your friends want to see this, run away. I could not put enough pressure on how this film was bad. <br /> <br /> Where did the second dragon come? Why does he show up soon? How did they have rocket launchers in dinosaurs 500 years ago?
