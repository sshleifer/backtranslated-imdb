The idea is beautiful. It is a good idea to take such a big picture in a movie. But .... a lot of stories, very short and really lack any sense. There are no connections in the scene. There were some 3-4 brilliant stories ... but these were among 18. The frame reminds me of "all the invisible children" - a movie that I like a lot. However, compared to this, "Paris J T'Ime" lacks the fantasy short story, which develops - starts and ends. And it lacks all those connections - children. I can not find enough topics to combine 18 small sketches in Paris. It is probably interesting to know Paris. Otherwise, I would not recommend it ...
