Savage Island (2003) is a thrill movie. It's more like a home video shot with very low light and awesome acting. Not only was the story and script rogue. I do not know why this movie was made. I saw lots of flicks in my time and the movies which I really hate are angry at me. This one is my blood's feet. The situation was best atane. If I make a movie like this but it will be a short one. The fact that the backdrop was not in the "IDIG" movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I'm watching a crazy movie crazy. But this movie is virtually unwatchable. I do not think the movie being shot on DVs. But if you're going to make the movie enjoyable, do not reproduce some tired tones in the horror of high horror movies. <br /> <br /> I do not have to recommend this disc waste. If you come to this mercantile store as well, then <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>
