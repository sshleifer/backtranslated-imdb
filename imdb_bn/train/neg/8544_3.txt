I was not quite sure where this thing is going. These people feel interested in what some mountains are happening. They investigate, narrowly escapes, leave them, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleeping watches, robbers who regularly wear ward robes etc. The guy likes the girl, but he leaves him unprotected repeatedly. She is taking off, she gets behind her, leaves her again. You get points. The whole thing often wanders around a little sacrifice, I guess, but I'm not sure whether the person is sinking, but I'm not sure. It's just dull and endless and not worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so bad that black seconds of black times are not unusual. This age or night filter is caused by overuse.
