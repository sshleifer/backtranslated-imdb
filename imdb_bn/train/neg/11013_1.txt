I'm not going into bad movies but nothing for this Despite the morons described above, it is not funny. I know comedy and underground movies but it is so annoying that the Director / Writer should never be allowed to access the local people from any direction! Movies and comedy love make this film trivial. I could not get on how unfunny and annoying this was done. If you like this movie then you are not here as a Pacific Ocean. Zero! You need to compare underground movies, see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or Early John Waters. The movie begins to defame humorous and I defy someone to show me the mockery. Comedy's rule is this ... if you are drunk you can say or do anything but it is not funny if you are not funny, you are not intense, you are simply modest and this movie is not funny. Zero!
