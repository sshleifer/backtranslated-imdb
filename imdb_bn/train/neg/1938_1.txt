Where to start? <br /> <br /> # 1 Amitabh's son, starring Akshay Khanna, 30. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Amitabh is in jail for 33+ years ... <br /> <br /> Telepathically send home to sperm? <br /> <br /> B) A beautiful Pakistani guards asked him to mail him for him? <br /> <br /> C) All of the above <br /> <br /> E) Producers are breaking a little bit more <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They approved the script <br /> <br /> <br /> Amrita Rao (Yummm!) wants to cry - she's Yum, Yum, yummy ... and obviously she wants him - Who does not, right ?! ... But, when his parents out of mockery, and then die (I think it seems impossible to see them as a 'mocking' as you see them coming to film in the brain dead and blind) He is against this disaster and his hat (metaphorically) Leaving behind him to save his father, does not remember his loss and says, "If God wants, we will meet again" ... basically meaning, "I will get my father. Sorry for your damages - CYA! Buh Bye! "- Callous to exceed the quality of Hollywood's life, even less ... <br /> <br /> This terrible waste time has many holes, known as movies, So that you can drive all the zip, truck camel and any extra thing through it. Pass - Really, complete and complete waste of time - oh! Here's a great dance sequence (yes, only one - in the order of dance - regardless of quality) Great stomach dance - but not worth it <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, 7.5 / 8!
