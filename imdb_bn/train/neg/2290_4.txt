Big Brother's ultimate goal, we realized what we should think before thinking about it. Is it any kind of miracle, or a terrible joke, the people who do not give their own geographical mental straight jacket, make themselves a shape shaped and green like a leopard? Movies, art, and unknown risks do not come in the way, but decided to eradicate life. <br /> <br /> "Noticias Betty Page" is a fake case history, it is suitable for feminist courses of a new college. His text is designed, right-wing and linear: "See how women have materialized, exploited, misused, then male-dominated society blurred on the trash hip." Looks like "pin-up queen of the 1950s" was there, millions of men were confronted. (All critics repeated the word "pin-up queen of the 1950s", such as a monkey singer.) Its history is known as American bombshell: South, raped by her father, raped etc. In this movie he is a na√Øf, he is an innocent sensation from innocent interest and innocent gain. Although he believes in Christ, he enjoys nude breaks before the camera lens - only the healthy female-post-door sex-slave imagines the American men supposedly. <br /> <br /> From Mary Harton's own mouth, Oxford-educated and pre-punker (do you smell my privilege and the logical scent of "Hipnas"?): "I think without feminism, I'm not ... I do not create a feminist film that I do not do anything ideological but I see that my films have made better. "<br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > This movie is about a person's life The motion goes through storytelling, the film before it starts, and highlights the purpose beautifully. Miss Page has a boyfriend, but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship. Actually, the film has no intimate or detailed relationship. <br /> <br /> No one can ignore his sunny simplicity. In New York, where Miss Page fit the mind of her mind and tries to fit the mind of the human mind, she sticks herself into ropes, and SML's black leather sticks tightly in boots and bottles, the film is black and white. But under Miami, where she moved away, she took off her clothes and painted a "redeemed" woman, the film turned into color. <br /> <br /> Haran no 'T' like hell made feminine films, "" not something ideological. " The ideology has become so internal, so guess, so the program, that it almost disappears. Big brothers will laugh.
