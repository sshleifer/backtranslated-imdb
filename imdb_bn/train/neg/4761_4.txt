Harold Pinter writes to Anthony Schaffer, a lover of a boyfriend to visit his boyfriend's husband and go to the sideway. The original film was played by Lawrence Olivier and Michael Kine. Caine has the role of Olivier in this version and he is associated with Jude Law. This image is directed by Kenneth Branf. <br /> <br /> Acting spectators. Both Caine and Law are their respective role gangbusters. I really liked clashing chemistry and personality. Its surprising and the script's direction is when there is enough reason to look around. <br /> <br /> Harold Peter's conversation is crisp and sharp and often very distraught and I understand why he was selected to rewrite the game (which has been updated) to use the surveillance camera and similar. The problem is that how scripts around the letters float around are terrible. Michale Caine gets the law through her weird modern house with no door and panel slides for really good reason. Conversations occur repeatedly in different places. I know Pinter did it in his plays, but in this case it is tired. Cain's wife is sleeping with the law why? We have done so much by the law, but it is not right that it does not work for the first time every time. This script can not remove the law by its manipulation. Initially, he agreed to start in the dark so there is no scope for us to fear. (Do not delay the discovery of the game which makes you wonder why he gets annoyed) Basically, we never doubt. Here we do and when it gives an edge, it seems to lie anyway, because it is so obvious that we are surprised that we can not see the law enforcement agencies. Say there are a few more examples but more to give. <br /> <br /> Looking back on the picture, I think it's a missed opportunity and a movie on the wrong path. Opportunity to have good fireworks among the squandered Caine and Laws scout. The wrong ideas that take away from the strange setting of a girl and a credible thriller, rather strange in a girl setting and plot. Instead, we get some smart dialogues and great performance in a movie that does not let them be real. <br /> <br /> Despite some great performance and malicious conversations, only 4 of the 10 reasons why the script just does not work
