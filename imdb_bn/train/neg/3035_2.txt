We've been served - a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> I will admit that since I'm white and "in the competitive world of art, I have no real experience", just be an authority on such a picture. On the other hand, when I see it, I know a bad motion picture. <br /> <br /> And boy, I saw it. <br /> <br /> This story tells about how important it is to follow his dream, depicted in a low budget-outlook and directed by Ian Iqbal Rashid, "(" Touch of Pink ")," Ha ha Ha Move "- even if those dreams Hip-Hop excites music, and even while talking, the average person could not understand that he was an international translator. <br /> I will try to give a brief overview of "Plot". First of all, there are two actors, such as LL Cool J, who work in an auto shop in Toronto (ethnic variety of Mecca), but there is still time to practice dancing for eight hours a day. <br /> <br /> Some boys of this "crew" There is a Token White Dude and "Malcolm X" in which there is a man like Denzel Washington. There are also two women in the film - one like Sherlock Williams and the old "Flip Wilson Show", like the other Geraldine. One of these women was kicked out of a private college because her parents spent all her tuition drug-addicted siblings. The other girl, member of the Salt N Paper, is no doubt that this is not good at all. <br /> <br /> There are other people who look like Eddie Murphy's rest, and another actor who is a fake of Hogi beer. These guys are rival step dancers. Obviously, this activity is very hard-core in the hood and they all are working for Detroit's big "step slow" jam. <br /> <br /> Since I did not understand the 90% dialogue (probably a subtitle was beneficial as a music video in Bergman movie or Snow), it is hard to believe that, Serena Williams girl (who does not smile at all), is out of much debate. , Becomes a freelance stepper (move from group to group), some step dances and hip-hop music are so boring. <br /> <br /> This is a wealthy story from a simple puzzle; Like "Rocky" with a really bad soundtrack, "Ruedi" with the annoying rap music in the background, "Cree Freedom" without smile. <br /> <br /> But why is a movie that can have a big impact on black viewers - drug narcotics, bad parents, and a title that sounds like the sound of the first grader, "How did he do it?" <br /> <br /> I was "moved" with this movie, as soon as possible to leave the theater.
