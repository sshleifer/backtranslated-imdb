Clearly, 1950's famous stripper Misty Ayers was created to showcase "acting" talent. Very bad she can not work <br /> <br /> To annoy the annoying little story about sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) and to force white slavery (prostitution). Then he met the desired Tommy Cole who immediately fell in love with him. Does she want to help her escape but she? You really do not care <br /> <br /> There is no real skin here - Ayers slows down their underwear (twice) gradually. The rest is simply a boring little story which played bad, fierce "comedy" (Never thought the prostitution was fun but I know what?) And the terrible post-dabbed conversation. I admitted that there was a turn at the end, I was not coming but it was not enough to sit through it. Also the acting's efforts are violent! A real bomb To avoid.
