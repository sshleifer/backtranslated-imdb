In 1993, "spectators" were a huge hit in France. So, the order was inevitable and unfortunately, this sequence ever created in the worst place. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that does not fulfill its promise. Indeed, it is supposed to tell a single story. Gene Reno must go to the twentieth century and in the Middle Ages, Christian Clovir must return, in order that the time can usually follow its path. The problem is that in the twentieth century World of Clovis fully felt completely relaxed and so it worked very hard to return to the Middle Ages ... instead, after moving the movie, the movie moved to another story. Plot As a result, the film sometimes becomes a mess, sometimes a mess. <br /> <br /> But the film suffers from the performance of almost all actors. Reno and Clavier fall into the trap that they can avoid in the first movie: they are going upstairs and becoming annoying. Then, the film producer Jean-Marie Poy played a key role in why Murray Robin was involved? He made a mistake because he feels helpless and is absolutely unhappy. Other actors are not good: Marie-Anna Chezel is helpless and Christian bujau, unbearable. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film has a few good moments with skilled gags, but it is often absurd and easy to read. Some sequences and dialogs are affected. It also seems to be a hole, because the elements of the first elements of the paw is the safest components of the return. So, a young girl takes Reno to a close relative of her family and asks her to take part in her marriage. <br /> <br /> Following a labor and frustrating. However, the interest of this movie is otherwise commercial? <br /> <br />
