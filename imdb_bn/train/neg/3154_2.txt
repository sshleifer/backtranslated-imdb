See, there is nothing spectacular about this movie, it's just boring. It ends with a common rom-less that you can see before coming to see the trailer. The main difference is that classic Rome-comers deal with their stories lacking intelligence and protests. There is no trend in this movie, but it is actually no idea about the movement, you feel that you can get up and go any moment. Fifteen years ago, there was a feeling of the film's first film production. I'd recommend re-watching a classic movie like Harry Met Sally instead when this shallow imitation instead. Oh, one other big problem ... no chemistry. If you look good on Michael as O'Leason's Von, then you'll be disappointed with him to show him here.
