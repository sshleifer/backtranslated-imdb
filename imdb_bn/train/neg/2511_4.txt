This good deliberate, but inferior comedy for Freddie Schepisi (Roxanne) this good intention, but Albert Einstein (Matthau) about to try to chill up with his low (Ryan) common man Tim Robbins and enjoy life in the life of 1950. Instruction To get Raven like Robin, Einstein tried to see Robin as a brilliant scientist. The idea is beautiful, but the film is flat with some situation and stupid conversations. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the terrible supporting actress do their best to keep this stupid comedy, but unable to retrieve the film. Her loser went so much talent that produces such a lazy movie. I will not recommend anyone until they are a huge fan of Meg Ryan.
