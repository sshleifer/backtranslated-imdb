For the last few minutes of the movie, I could have given the film a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the end is so horrific and "Hollywoodized" that it completely damages the first 80% of the movie. <br /> <br /> This plot revolves round the submarine and receives the order to burn their nuclear missiles. . Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for launch, its first officer, Denzel Washington, to confirm the first launch order. The problem is that both the captains should launch and the first officer must use their launch keys. Determined to introduce Hackman, Washington finally stood firm up until this result in armed rebellion on Sub. Finally, the missile was discovered and the missiles were not launched. Cool. However, here comes a part that is not really true. After returning to the country and before a review board, the Washington and Hackman (who used to spend half the film trying to kill each other) put his hand down and all friends! Huh?! My last trite to make time movie movie.
