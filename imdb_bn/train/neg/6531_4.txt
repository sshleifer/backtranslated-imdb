First off, I want to say that the comments of the user alone make me laugh at my eyes. Bad SF movies are a good comedy that makes a good comment. MSAT 3000 has shut it down. <br /> <br /> If you see a hungry red plant in the dream of a 10-year-old comic book reader fever since 1959, you will have a handle on your goat. All elements are: camouflage, occasionally logical, often scary infantile. "Gigolo" Captain (good call on the boy, boys!) Attention to the boy at the age of teenager, looking at the red "colorful" eye of the hair, it is a wonderful fact that it does not stop the alarms of fire. The funny Sunny planet of Mars is so aliens that everything turns red, yet there is a wicked monster face, and Blob Alien has an eye that turns around like a toy toy. Comic Relief, an overweight astronaut (!) Who thinks he did not finish the 8th grade of Brooklyn and set his psychology on the ray gun. And of course, the fact that aliens = hazardous evil. If this guy meets the ET, they make him two second flat mats! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I rated this movie low. Yet it is never annoying (when the scientist tries to explain everything - it only makes all the words more ridiculous), and you must accept the core of your little kids, it jumps you a few times. <br /> <br /> Well, do not accept it. I guess you did not have 10.
