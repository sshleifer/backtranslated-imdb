This is one of the worst movies of my life that I have ever seen. I can travel back to time and do the following: <br /> <br /> 1) Find out where the "movies" was shot in "war games - dead code" 2) See original war games with my current computer knowledge and a 1983 preteen eyes 3) In the 80's, Pentagon has learned the knowledge and perspectives on computer and remember. 4) Hoppar was able to restart the status of the deed code minutes on the first day of filming 5) Take a beer, drink a beer and get "empty" of my memory to Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, especially the original view of my "dead code" ) Have another beer and see Wars games 7) Be happy until the next bad repetition of the 80's movie. <br /> <br /> 8) Do I forget that Zara Zara has killed? I'm sure that I'm not sure whether to travel in the future. Maybe I need access to a wormhole.
