I just saw an episode of this program and I could not even get to the end of the program. Every minute I have seen this program my IQ has to be dropped about 10 points. It's basically a children's program but with the oath. Even the oath and humiliation he told to other people does not make me laugh. Anyway, the story was written by the monkey and those who actually wrote this script for filming this image must be kept at gunpoint and there is no other alternative than this disabled, frustrating, terrible acting program. Sarah Silvermann should actually use a little money made from this program and get some rapes played by some gods.
