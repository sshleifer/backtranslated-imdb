Shintro Katsu has gained a lot of fame while playing amazing character, Zatichi. There was a strange and unbelievable idea of ​​zodiacal films - a blind person is the greatest terrorist in Japan, and every film has the right to mistake and punishes the wrongdoers for proper punishment. He is a nice man's hack and movies are exciting and addictive (I actually saw every movie). Because of this, I saw this final installment of the Hanzo Roger series, as I guess it would be very similar ... and the boy was wrong! Hanojo films are highly sexual in nature and it promotes the rape of "those who deserve women". You see, Hanzo Meiji is a policeman and he regularly takes the women to custody and interrogates them by raping them with "sex of steel". How he made his members so powerful that you are going to believe is certainly something, but it is certainly not for conscience. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can suggest seeing someone in this violent and misogynistic film. However, from looking at another review, I can see that they are still very popular ... and it's pretty awesome. Despite some modest acting and amazing battle scenes, movies are like brain pollution - and I do not want to imagine how films can contribute to violence against women.
