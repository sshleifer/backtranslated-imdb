Steven Seagal seems to be sleeping sleeping through a horrific movie shot almost completely close to the disguise of the budget and the complete lack of resources. To pick up technical flaws - sunglasses F / A-18s and F-14s are taken from a carrier for an air strike and the miraculously fierce F-16s for the actual strikes - this film gives more credibility than its capabilities. Not saying that the most interesting thing about the movie is that the credit headline fades and then a power is erased, which is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Keeping your own creativity in your own credit, Michael Kicks in the same section as Marcel Mandu.
