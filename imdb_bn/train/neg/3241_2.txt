This movie was potential, but it really makes the badge of Lindsay Crayes. I've never seen him before in anything else and maybe there are some provocative fans who like him in something like him, but his performance in this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> Its Delivery Robotics. When he delivered his line, it was seen that he was trying to make sure he got the right line and only read his head list. So, there is very little inflection on her voice. I was given a major role in a movie that could not believe in anyone acting bad. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, <br/> <br /> However, I like where I am going to the story So I see it. The first part of the script has a good movie's makings. But the end was frustrating as well. Maybe his performance was good, I liked it.
