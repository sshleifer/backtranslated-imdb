Beverly Garland was born in the wrong time. She was an actress before her time, in which she acted as a film in Karamen, Liam received power and favor for Flickr. She is the wife of Sheriff in the town of Galaling. She closes, so she takes her job to pursue her killers. He is even better than he is doing. The movie is gray, stilted, and mostly boring. There are some (strangers) humor with the tire track, people suddenly appear in front of a house (I've heard the lies, but it's funny!), And the real stupid plot line of the newborn is falling in love with the mercenaries in the death of Sheriff. Even if she did not love her husband, then she had something like just a week or two after she died! And she finally ends up shooting the death man, however. There is no luck with men, this one. <br /> <br /> Another girl, fragrance owner, Salon owner. He is planning to buy a piece of land when he gets rich through the railway tracks. If his action plan is not long enough - he steals as much as he stole from the city. Hell, it ended up against a whole city and his rental gun. You tell me these people are not armed? See what happened in the original cities of the Old West when the bank robbers came to loot banks, then armed and dangerous cities were shot in firing by people. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of things to point out and ride around, interspersed with a few lame shoots. The end is intense as normal as Croamen Flick, although expressing gratitude for goodness, it lacks the lack of moral change during the last conquest of the world. Sherif turned his badge into Sam bash and ran towards sunset, even though the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun.
