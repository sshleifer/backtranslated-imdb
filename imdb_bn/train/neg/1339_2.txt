A sad, sad sight indeed Munster's revenge. Mandrake was finally brought back (Fred Gywnne received a huge pitch to return to the role of Herman MÃ¼nster). In this-for-TV movie, a pair of robes "terrorists" is described as a pair of "Grandmothers", which is a mummy's stash preparing for a robbery As the city. The police try to find out who is behind the crime, on their heels, to clear their names, two old television icons. As the waitress (a minor high point in the film) we can see their drag clothing, Dada has turned upside-down with telegrams (I assume flying flying flies with Harmon in Flying Transylvania) and the most annoying relative "The Phantom" is singing continuously and the glass Ads breaks the nose! What is most tragic is hard to understand: it is so gyane (especially) and al-luiss so obscure in each scene and indifferent to the material. Is it the robot's hockey costume that shows the school's electricity production costs? Maybe it's a ridiculous script. Sid Caesar's crazy, mostly weird antics. Or perhaps it's seeing something that brings me the joy and pleasant memories of the child treated as a beautiful K-Mart fashion outline. At any time, the results are undoubtedly frustrating and stupid for the Munter's criteria. For the rest of the part, Yevon de Carlo is fair enough in the neutral role (though his year and experience shows more clavage than usual for a woman). Who C. Martell has made perfect Adi Munster forever. Joe McDonald is an interesting Marilyn Bob Hastings looks and works like the previous and most foolishly. There is a real cheap feeling for the movie made for the movie.
