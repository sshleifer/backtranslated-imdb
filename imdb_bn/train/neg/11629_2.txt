** Spirir ** Chemosh: Completely unreal, lack of a plot, and basically only they were made to represent themselves. If Shabana Ajmi was in the shower, the movie was the most suspicious scene and then we saw the shower scene from her TV PSYCHO. This image can actually convince users that Nasiruddin Shah's character has enough memories where some shots were fired and how many were shot! <br /> <br /> *** *** *** <br /> <br /> Finally, the killer allowed Shabana Ajmer to spread the throat of her throat and to shoot the character of Naseebuddin Shah and shoot him! <br /> <br /> *** End of the Spokler *** <br /> <br /> The director and cast members begin to humiliate each other and Shabana Ajmi says, "Oh sh-t!" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Baaaaaaaaaaaaaad movie! <br /> <br /> Rating: ** ********** (2 of 10)
