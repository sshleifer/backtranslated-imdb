I was expecting to enjoy this photo of a agreeable skeptic and fixtures and thus. But after watching this, I honestly believe that I could make myself a better documentary. Among its arguments there are only four hidden sources (though I did not see Richard Dawkins anywhere, though I am not listed on the charities in IMDB), it has been humorously edited with amateur amateur influences and it does not even make even the least effort to appear neutral. The story has suddenly spread throughout the ages with anti-teen attitude, which may be opposed to preaching to the church (i.e.), and the film can actually change somebody's mind. Although there was some interesting discussion about the historiography of Jesus, when the film was present as a child, Christianity began to live extensively in school, then it caused a helpless slip, which is an institution that apparently pretends it mentally, because it ignores it Do it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br />! Suspiciously worried religious documentaries are lacking in the market, and helped to cancel the film. Instead, the director has chosen to contaminate our intelligence with this junk, which, ultimately, considers something like a medical exercise for him. It is so bad that his Christian godmother panicked him, but his protester did not need to be respected to him.
