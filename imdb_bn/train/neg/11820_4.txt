I saw the DVD (known as CORUPUPT in this format) and the cassing blogger was really hip-up how Harvey Katel's character Frank is so good that he played Bad Lieutenant "This wonderful and powerful police thriller". Cassing has not mentioned it was an old Italian movie. How old is theo? Well, when a character plays music, he does not keep the CD player, then he pulls out a large plastic pancake, puts it on a rolling hobby where a mechanical hand can touch the pancake and touch the music. Can you see my points about my old movie? The DVD case was made in a movie made 20 years ago, no needle given. It is a movie that is similar to many other Italian films like poor American production value. The role of Johnny Roton, rather than Keitel's acting, is rather intimidating, but painting is static with images and sound quality, which I saw in the fourth generation pirate copy (I do not know if it's a dodgy DVD down or it's a very bad film print) and worst all Ennio Morricone Score of It is impossible to believe CORRUPT's annoying offensive music composer, who has composed it for Clint Eastwood Westerns. It was never the best psycho thriller ever designed, but it kept my interest in it and always kept Keitel as good as a violent nutritionist policeman. Just a pess with the rest of the movie does not match its high quality
