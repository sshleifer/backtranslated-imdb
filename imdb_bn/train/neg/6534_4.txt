This sci-fi adventure is not the best and no mean bad. I agree with the statement that bad scientist is ridiculous. Seamless pink tinting and unusual special effects late, late, late show make this a favorite for viewers. The aerospace explorers on the planet fight off monsters and other weird creatures like the strange monster Amoeba. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this film, Les Trimen, Norah Hayden, Gerald Moore and Jack Crusen. Get comfortable and enjoy. Do not feel bad if you nod off for a moment. I agree with adding this to the classic classics list not missing.
