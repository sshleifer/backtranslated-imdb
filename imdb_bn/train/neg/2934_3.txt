Simony Peg starred as Sidney Young, a striatily clammy idiot britt who is working as a celebrity journalist in the US comedy. After getting a very lucky break, he started working in a highly respected Sharps Magazine, directed by Jeff Bridges, a trusted New York man. David loved David Pradea more than Shaun. An inappropriate love interest is provided by Kirsten Donst, who works well with Peg for despair, but they do not fade well with their emotions. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To get the ingredients in the magazine, he must forget his journalistic principles. Eventually he was eventually persuaded by the famous celebrity Sophie Mace (Transformers Megan Fox), especially young people and Glamor. Supporters of Dead, Hot Phase and Space will be surprised that Pig himself felt the same feeling of real life with this film and runs run runs in the best comic titles of the United States disestablished in the United States. <BR> <br /> This is all a forgotten comedy. Come back to Simon, we can forgive and forget.
