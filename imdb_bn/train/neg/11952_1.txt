After the death of long-time friend John Belushi, his first film, the Ackroyd, showed a lot of trick, which tried to create a snap for Belusi. <br /> <br /> Instead, "Doctor Detroit" makes us brainstormed the bookie's teacher, Icured, a strange, violent pumping ward off a competitor known only as a mother. It's bad enough, but there are classes to attend classes, host to school dinners, to protect four women in the evening and to attend a pump diner (or something like that). It is no wonder that Income Taxes are mostly obsolete. Why should the visitors be alone? <br /> <br /> In this picture, the future of the skype is met with wife Donna Dixon. At least some good came out of this sticky mess. <br /> <br /> Half of the stars. If you like Aykroyd, see "The Blues Brothers". If you want bad, see "Doctor Detroit".
