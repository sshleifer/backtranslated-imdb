Because of the 1988 authors Guild of America strikes, they had to kill this episode in 3 days. It has been described as "terrible, just terrible" by most shit, repeat cut + past clips with Season 2 and its author, Maurice Hurley. <br /> <br /> Why the producers could not wait to shoot something that does not know anything. I guess because of the strike that the product has gone out of money and can only publish a flashback episode, or Rodenberger was very sick when he was able to veto this half-Assessee. This episode marks the final form of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Catherine Pulaski) in Syria.
