The Japanese always kept their incredible ambition in fantasy movies. They are always ready to destroy the city by the huge plastic giant coming from outer space and from somewhere else. The problem is that they did not have the money to succeed in making convincing special effects. This movie, released in France, is not an exception under Les Env√≠es de De La Spece. His ambition shows to cosmic octopus trying to put three creatures above the glorious lobster on top of human hands. It is very painful and ridiculous, but very enjoyable. After all, we are not this creature and after all this movie, do we?
