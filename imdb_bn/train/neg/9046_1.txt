Now for the truth, this is a very weak story - Walt Disney movie's total garbage When Robinson was seen, films all over, I was amazed how poor it was. It went like "Wonderland Alice"! It seems that they were brief on the ideas, some crazy people were trying to tear together and could move away from them - and they did not. After that, I was sitting there till the end. My younger brother lost halfway and was confused by the story. After the characters are weak and Robinson appears, you do not look at the end, you just want to finish the movie. Forget it a film, and forget fast. You've got some extra time, do not waste it.
