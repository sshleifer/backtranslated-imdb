The films I saw were almost a downward (Huntsman Manson, problem with some other, and some others kept it below the rock). It is fast, the story is disturbed and the incidents have been played poorly. . Of course, we will have to put some of our books on the door of the book. The film was later filmed, the book is violent, and illogical. Oprah "Biggers" gives a brilliant look like a mother, but its probability is not nearly as close. Other famous actors seem to be the worst of them. An African American who has decided to take a job as a Chaufur is the plot. He is known to run the family daughter on a communist dinner. One thing leads to the other and the girl becomes drunk. Now the family he is working for is not against blacks, but they think. So when she comes home, she puts her on the bed, but she starts calculating. Blind mother (yes) listens to this, so big tries to silence her, but rather her smothers. Now he is really afraid to suffer a white girl, because he is afraid of any logical thinking - he will push him into a coal reactor. So investigators are carrying a missing person case and they did not have the foresight to test the furnace (ridiculous Asia.) Then he was arrested and is an infamous part from the last hour or courtroom. Frustrated for bad movies, this may work, but if you want to know seriously about the topics of the 40s and 50s or see good plays then there are many good options. Avoid it.
