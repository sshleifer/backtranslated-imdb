I rent this movie for a few smiles I have never seen SNL squat, but with the hits like Tommy Boy and Wayne World, it could not have been bad, did not it? Answer: It was. This movie was a medium to relax after a tough day of hard work. I just kept waiting for a plotline and a fun part, but there was no one. The highlight was Tiffany Amber Thieson, and it's about exactly.
