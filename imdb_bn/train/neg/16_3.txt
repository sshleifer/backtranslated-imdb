There are many great people in this movie. It's probably the best thing about it. Perhaps it's also valuable to watch. <br /> <br /> "Loaded" story of Titan Price (Jesse Metcalf), a young man who is going to make his mark on Earth. He is a good family's son with a good reputation, and he is on his way to law school. But like many settings, things are not perfect as they appear. The expectations of these families are much more than love. Without school, Tristan's father rarely lets him leave the house. This may be the result of some horrifying events in the past, which reduces the family, which is partially published through flashback but it is not built until the very end. Tristan's clustrophobic environment puts him in the very first possible opportunity when his friends take him to the strip club to graduate. The celebration soon followed some stripes on some beach house parties, and from there, the Tristan Sebastian Cole (Corey Large), who dragged him into a drag associated with the underworld. <br /> <br /> Typically the film is a poor script and a story that is not very compelling. There are also some constant camera tricks counted against this movie, which are generally boring and out-of-place, such as slow-speed, fast-motion, free-frames and echoes. Such influences are usually used by the directors to showcase a character's perspective while in drugs, but in this case they seemingly spread to random points in some of the style of style. <br /> <br /> <br /> Despite its cast of relative unknown, performance was good around, with the most prominent main opponents (Corey stars) with respect. I suspect we will be able to see at least a few people in future big and good projects. <br /> <br /> Of course, while referring to actors, I have to mention their appearance. Ratings based on the heat, this movie has a score of 11. This movie is looking incredible about women and you are almost upset about a boring movie. I'm sure the male characters are quite interesting, but you have to ask someone else for a comment. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can not recommend for this movie, to buy, rent, or even watch for free. It does not cost the effort it takes to sit through it unfortunately.
