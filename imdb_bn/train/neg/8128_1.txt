OK, my summary does not let you fool. This movie SUCKS hard. But the worst movie ever? This movie was terrible that humans would not have to rack to describe their brain. But it's not worse than Manses: Fate, HabboGlinns, the horrors of Spider Island, or the hand of small mobile phones. The movie sucks as a review, it's terrible. Do not see it with MST or you may develop health problems. But there are bad movies.
