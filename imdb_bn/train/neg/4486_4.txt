What was that about all that? I saw the matrix and amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. Have you ever been able to do this film by the Wachowski brothers? <br /> <br /> There is no plot, you can not argue with it. Basically all of these movies were loaded and do not make mistakes, I did not have any problem with the talkie films, but all the conversations of Matrix Reloaded were an unmatched veil. There will still be a continuation of the war which will go on a long way, then there will be more uninterrupted drawal, then another battle scene which will last for a long time and it will be created till the greatest anti-climax of all time. Little beard leakage for talking about a load of unfavorable steam for 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Also the Qin Reeves gave her the worst performance. I knew he was not a good actor but it was a joke. If you look at the sequences of his films, they are slowly getting worse. God knows what his performance will give to some! Keanu Reves: The only plaque of wood ever to become an actor. <br /> <br /> It appeared as a huge adaptation after the debut of the first film. If you have not already seen the first movie, then I suggest you look at it, but do not waste your time in pieces. <br /> <br />
