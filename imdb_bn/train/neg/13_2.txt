Weak plot, expected violence, only semi-interesting characters. The author likes (one of the stars?) Made his own screws imagined and added incredible imagination of drug and murder to "hot". From predictive rap and house soundtrack, family conflicts, it has been played badly, stereotyptic and finally horrific boring. Even the title has been done earlier - IMDB has released five films by the same name, released in 2007-08 !! Note: It has been seen in Showtime, which lists the summary of one of the other movies. About half an hour ago I did not understand that no one was a secret police. Even if another stereotype, it would be interesting if it happened.
