Dear favorite dear dear ... I! I had the power to see it ... but why? <br /> <br /> The first two films where fun and actually a bit better. But it is so bad that we had problems seeing the whole thing. There was some kind of Tremors for these kids. I can not believe that this movie has been made. Any kind of bad Western series has been taken from any kind (for kids) and they have justified what they have done. <br /> <br /> This movie for the audience? I can only think of 12-14 years old If you are over 14, you will have serious problems with this movie. It's not only slow, but it's completely annoying. Characters are compressed (not only a little) and so it is fun for some time .. But you do not want to swim tomatoes on screen is not long enough. You know everything that's going to happen, yes ... you've seen it a billion times before a hero series for children. I have all started to survive and the second letter of another vibration sheet. It's so bad .. So wrong .. So ... shit <br /> <br /> But ok, we've got a smile now. Not only the fake plots, but some scenes where replay or two ... or a scene, where two children's vibration blows between the people of the clear compress phoder. It's really a great scene which has overplayed over us and smiles wholeheartedly. It still makes me green when I think about it. But that sadly happened a second time ... and at that time "Badas" shoots a gunfighter and surprises his part ... and one comment, "They're some demo tricks like spring from the ground!" Where at this time we almost cry with laughter. But after that ... nothing can happen to something .. (?) .. so much fly away from it. <br /> <br /> So here are the top trouts and overacting. If someone tells you that it is a good movie ... she is either a "plant", vegetables or someone else is very bad. This movie is going to be so far fork. Looking forward to Tremors 3, it should be a hit at the box office ... this ... * Hansambaam * No..I will leave it.
