This was 75 minutes of waste in my life. The acting was oppressive and the plot was ridiculous. It travels around an evil lesbian woman who gets married to a rich married man and then blackmail them for money. One of the sufferers is the DA candidate, which creates problems with his wife. Another plastic surgeon, married, and evil gay these boys will happen to seduce the wife! Meanwhile, the evil lesbian girlfriend does not really like his sleeping sleep. It is a happy ending where everything is forgiven. Women get very nude, that is, in most cases the reality extends. Bad bad is bad.
