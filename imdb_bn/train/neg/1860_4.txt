The comedy of the same title of 1998, Michael Katon's Kidney, was criticized for his, um, special effects, but it is a positive mind-stupid comparison to the Scrum Mad George being cooked for this horrible comedy. The killer snowman was made from steroepom and his arms look like oversized oven mitts. Which they probably were. The film pervades many (more bad) films and Paul Parrot's parody, because the city's doctors specially play a minor but ridiculous role.
