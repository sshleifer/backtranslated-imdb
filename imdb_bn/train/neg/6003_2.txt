Sandown - featuring the most vulnerable, dorkiest Vampire ever seen, with one of the most inefficient, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane Vampire, which was each move and spoken word so ridiculous that I smile half times out and left my rolled eyes. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> that's really, it's Ever imagined calculation Dracula is thoughtfully recoiling from a war 'because he ran out of bullets? Even not me. Any other movie-Dracula uses their bones as a snack at breakfast, their followers with skin and teeth. <br /> <br /> The main plot of the movie is that a Vampire gang war was caught in a four-person human family caught up - Dracula versus some old Geezer. This may be some older B-Flick fun, but the very dramatic song written by someone who took this film very seriously and destroyed the rest of the film and ultimately did not end up with the soil bat and eventually acted. And ridiculous scrapple. <br /> <br /> Finally it's too stupid to be fun. Sure, it has some fun moments, but they are few, and far away.
