In the first few minutes of this Dutch thriller, we came to know that Krab is trying to steal a magazine from a news stand at the Krab, who is about to sleep on Sense underwear, to imagine his roommate, to steal a magazine from a news stand and after looking after a young man, the railway station . And he is the protagonist of all the heroes of this non-congressional movie (in less than one scene, besides the Crab) but he has no place. The basic plot is very simple but it is almost two hours before the conclusion to reach a pointless conclusion. Verhoeven is an excellent visual flash but wild delusional scene, symbol of emblem, and unexpected resonance from Gore scene when he runs out of the idea.
