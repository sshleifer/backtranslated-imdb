The film was recently released on DVD in the United States and finally I found this hard-to-win wax. It also came with original theater previews of other Italian horror classics such as "SpasMo" and "Boundary of the Darkness". Unfortunately, the previews on this movie were the best ones. <br /> <br /> "Zoom 3" is actually a maliciously associated with the infamous Lucio Floris "Zumbi" franchisee which started in 1979. Similarly, "Zoomby", "Joomba 3" has a threadbar plot and a very bad actor who barely carries this 'horrible' trash. The goth is almost non-existent (unless someone is afraid to run around with green rock on their face) and English dubbing is a groove below embarrassment. <br /> <br /> This time around, a group of minors engaged in conspiracy involving a plot of secret military operation, means a secret military operation. A stupid man and his stupid female side-stick) who are talking about the reproduction of death, selling some chemicals called "Death One." Until I need to check my ears, I do not think a reason for "Death One" research. It seems that only poor souls who make the mistake of selecting the star of this movie as 'stars' can feel angry. <br /> <br /> However, "I was sworn on a corpse, I swear like Iain Brenner), and after injection on his system, he sat upright and exploded his head! The sound effect is very pleasing - the body of the corpse, as the bubbles with green pepper, 'crumpling paper' The sound can be heard. "Death One" is carried out toxic and is 'high-jacked' by the thieves, where someone closes it, but after being cut off on an open fox, they themselves get infected. <br /> <br /> The man is a zombie, but he does not get cheap cheaply on time before he gets infected, infecting a lower porter and putting a mask on his mouth in a bathroom mirror (!). The military retains this air and immediately takes action before 'elimination' of all those who are unfortunate and 'turned upside down' in the 'polluted region'. They found the infected thief and burned his body, only the smoke shrimp infected a feather of flying birds on the stack (!). <br /> <br /> We cut off the role of a group of men who are going from the army to the holidays, listening to 'Govi Music', which is coming out of a little weird box when girls from a trailer loaded out of Windows And showing them in the chest. Can someone say "Zombie food"? We also have a sub-plot of a car to stop visiting a girl and her boyfriend for a group of birds beside the street ... the birds that were infected with 'junk' smoke! <br /> <br /> The bird attacks the boyfriend and the girl goes to a lonely gas station in search of water. This movie is one of the most incredibly joyful moments. He walks around this old messy, rusty and definitely abandoned building where he is saying aloud, "Hello, here's someone? Please, I need some water!" She faces a group of zombies, in which a wall (!) And a machete are swinging. Moves around the ground and roams around, he escapes, but not before blowing up the gas station with his lighter. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the bird attacks the trailer loads loudly and a girl gets spiked and infected and infected. They reach the same motley with the original infections, and this is where the second most hilarious moment of the film occurs. After hours (mostly a day), the same motorlet is now cooked in dust, it sows seeds across it, and it seems like it's been hurried for years. However, what better place to take shelter than this particular building? Not saying, the group starts to break down, because a number of people are stuck together with the incredible fools involved in the incredible folly of a gathering. <br /> <br /> The third most sunny moment, a man and a woman explore a desert village, among which the female comments, "This place is a dump!" Then he gets 'pushed' from a porch by a jambi (?) In the oppressed water where his legs are tied and becomes a zombie in seconds! Meanwhile, his friend returned to the peas and Horse was infected before, even then it is entering a zombie! Unfortunately, there are many inconsistencies in this movie that make the film very falsely for the words. For example, the duration of the 'jambikephide' related to infected people is very different. Sometimes it takes seconds, takes other time. Some run zombies, others drag their feet and walk really slow. Some people carry kung fu, others hide behind the people of the hats. Some of the dead even talk! Of course, the most fun moment is the infamous 'Zumby Head' of Freeze, which strikes itself in the mid-air and invades a fool by looking for food in search of food. The lady is enough, her girlfriend bursts her throat with her 'Headless Counter-Part' (LMAO!). <br /> <br /> The biggest disappointment for me is that there was a lack of story lines in people, actually killing them by zombies. We do not see them coming back as zombies, in fact only we can see 'Zambiafide' who have been jumping through birds and a girl who bites her legs. Even less than that, at least I was expecting a couple who died in the kitchen and / or the person who was killed in the bridge would return like a dead body. It is very surprising that these bodies only took 'a few bites' and then went to their next victim. <br /> <br /> The most ridiculous moment was certainly the jumbo embryo. A pregnant woman has been infected with a lie on a bed in a hospital. A woman who thinks too much 'medical knowledge' is attempting to rescue her baby (!) And her face is drawn by a zombie, before pushing her head into the head, her hand bursts and her hands burst. His mouth closed. Timeless! <br /> <br /> <br /> Naturally, this type of perfect trend is the perfect trend. Megalomomaniel military officer, ruthless vainly screaming women who are shouting for the murder, the obvious character who is going to die (i.e., watch out for a chicken behind!) I think this movie is actually a comedy. There was a lot of ridiculous scenes, such as Shade Hand Grenade (probably the scene where the entire budget was spent) and the weather scene where a man shouted, "I thirsty .... whale blood for you!" The dress is really bad - the same body is seen throughout the film again, Bruce Lee comes out in the same 'Asian-like' dress that is available in the film and comes out for the Blue 60 skirt. When she and her boyfriend were in the infected people. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < A radio DJ, described throughout the DVD, considers itself as a zombie and warns its audience of 'the beginning of the end', when two survivors leave for a helicopter. If you ask me, very rarely is the "invitation to death" element. <br /> <br /> Still, the film laughs a lot. Gore is less, and what gore is, it is very unconvincing, let alone unimaginative. The normal mixture of black blood, thick green powdered weeping lungs and green jam from 'zombie make-up'. "Zombie 3" makes for a good rental for a night party or beer and popcorn on a sleeping. Even more, the fearsome fans should stay away. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
