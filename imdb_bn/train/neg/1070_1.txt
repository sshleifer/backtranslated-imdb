I've seen some bad films (Austin Powers - The Spy Who Shagged Me, Batman Forever), but this movie is so awful, so I've got almost half the way and could not bear the rest. A miserable talent towards the story of a Kenneth Branagh, Emmath Davits and Robert Duval and John Grisham, what's wrong? Branagh is a big time lawyer who has fling one night with Davy. His father (Duval) was a psychiatrist who executed his cat, etc., so Brangha sent him to a document, and he ran away quickly. Unknowingly (how did I not understand) Robert Donny Jr., Daryl Hana, Fem Jansen and Tom Berena all met together in the story which runs slower than stability. I wanted to like it, and, as a huge grim fan, I read everything about this movie and I hope (stupidly) hope something interesting. It really is the world film that I have seen and I want to get my money back. * ***** out.
