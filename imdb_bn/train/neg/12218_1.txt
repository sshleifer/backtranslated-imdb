very bad. Very very bad. A colleague who wants to create, at least - or enter the food supply table on the set of movies, I have actually received a movie that is difficult for critics to criticize. However, this movie ... Oh dear <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And it tries to combine with more mainstream values. Wrong And to be fair, it's not saying - More to say - Red Zone Cuba ... but not much. So I will not try to criticize, just ask me to throw some observations. <br /> <br /> 1) If Gore is the point of the movie, will not you be able to see it? <Br / <br /> 2) If you hire three sound men, make sure at least one person will know how to run the machine. <br /> <br /> 3) In a horror movie, your lead maniac will be a scarf rather than a smurf doll. I know hard, but really ... <br /> 4) There are many talented video photographers in Buffalo / Rochester area, most of them can afford to rent really cheap. <br/> <br /> 5) Just because you have someone who knows how to use the effects later and other cooler programs do not mean that every second. <Br> <br/> <br /> 6) Girls get girls to take them to the top, but next time, we can get girls from whom we want to take them away. <br /> <br /> 7) The edit story will help tell a mood set. At least this type of movie editing should be sold in Gore Gags. Suddenly a character is present on the stomach, it is not screwed. <br /> <br /> Some good things. Not all acting was bad. Jack was pretty good and after starting the fight I loved acid. There were some handsome imagery, unfortunately it was thrown on the screen without rhythm or reason. "Acid Poport" is a name that deserves a good film. I liked the moxie of Frightworld too. Next time, now they have a movie under their belt, I hope I hope to achieve something better than Col. Francis. Upgrade at least Ed Wood.
