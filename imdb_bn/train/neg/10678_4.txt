This movie looked good - good throw, evergreen issues and an explosive opening. It went downhill from there. Why was it pictured by hand-held cameras? It shakes, judders, part captures the scenery and simply distracts the viewer. Indeed a poor choice. If this is not enough, the worst edit in memory estimates a drug addict - if you want to get any benefit from it then it is mandatory. And then it all commits the worst sin. After taking all kinds of leadership in unlikely and impossible situations on the fatigue point of viewers, they rolled out credits without disclosing the denial - finishing - how was the purpose of the hack in exchange for money? How can you succeed by creating a thriller without ending? Doh! This film was a great promise and ended a face plant in clay. What a waste of effort. Weak efforts by the author and the director.
