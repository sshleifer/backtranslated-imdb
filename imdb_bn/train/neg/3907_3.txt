I am glad that I rented this movie for one reason: its flaws make me want to read Almond's books and get the full story. Prose: The movie is beautiful, the time is well and consistently depicted (best of my knowledge) and Merrill and Glenn work well. Cons: This is the worst act I ever seen from Jeremy Irons - I wondered if her face had something wrong. (And I hate the terrible English to say "trantoots.") Winona Ryder is not believable except for the young and idealistic. Most other performance is okay, but there are so many things hanging together in character arrays and improving the relationships that I was frustrated and angry before it ended. <br /> <br /> Now I am very enthusiastic to do the work of Billy August. I might have to drop a few more bonuses to pay Smith's Sense of Snow.
