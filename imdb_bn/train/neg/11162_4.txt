Jack Black is an annoying character. This is an annoying indie movie for the age of 14. Do I have to write eight more lines? It's nice to look at Ana de la Reguay, just like Mexican nuns are ahead and Jack's Black's rude progress. This film is a PG version 13 of an indie film. I really have the courage to explore Mexican culture which I liked a movie. This movie searches deep into Mexican culture. I'm just pushing on her cultural rudeness: Jack Black just so rude. A white man like Jack Black was not my most precious chemistry in Mexican culture, as it was. The Mexican wrestling culture is not a white person, as I could find myself. I doubt Mexico is presented here in a culturally obscure than Jack Black. <br /> <br /> I think IMDB has changed my review. Has anyone else changed his reviews? Just a question.
