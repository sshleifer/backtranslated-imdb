It may be one of the most enjoyable movies when you do not take it seriously. It's a bit date and effect is lame, but it's so enjoyable. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. Oh, and crabs Japanese songs. It's surprisingly bad. And finally, the whole film has been telegraphed which is suddenly horrible. Predictable, but the final battle will be rolling on your seats. Do not even give this movie a chance, and you like it. Look Susan George watch and yes, he appears naked. Not putting much value with her daughter, but she is attacked by giant crabs. They are big cats size It's a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I have it a 7. Do I have monster crabs mentioned?
