This film is shameful in making movies. I can not believe it was funny - even listed as a comedy. The script was not just violent, but voting should be shot. Gayle and Grady are just a great actress, but still ... the rest 99 percent cast ... ouch. Most of us all ... Wow, it's even harder ... Wow. Here's the number one rule about the comedy "Do not try to curiosity". There are many talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy - none of which has been used in this movie. Canadian Nepotism and Casting Director are helping to make bad films in Canada. I technically understand a "US" film, but saw the director, actor, position etc. I just saw this in Bravo - they should be ashamed that they have purchased the rights to show this film. Again, there are many great films that do not get airtime and they show this shit.
