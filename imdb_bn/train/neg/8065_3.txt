Steve Turner can not make horror movies. First, the cast for this movie was very wrong. The hot brown-haired girl was the only decent part from Vanessa Slayer Bufi. There are no ghosts (usually the main element of a scary movie), no work, no acting, and no doubt (also a key element). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is sad that this is dry and plain so. Some parts were funny (continued teen horror / comedy films), and none of the spectators smiled. I thought the movie was rated and I did not pay attention and realized that it has changed to PG-13. However, if you like, watch this movie I still know what you did last summer. This is the only person who regarded this movie even remotely scary. And seriously, this is Steve Carpenter, making you stop making horror movies. This movie makes Texas Chess look like a genocide scandal.
