I did not read a single IMDb comment for this movie which mentions how the Jewish character of this movie can grow like a little gun like a baby, in its description how racist can look at the head of the skin and the black character of the movie shows hardness. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I agree that the university is not the basics of tolerance and they will be heading right if Singlton does not have so much character in his characters. <br /> <br /> On the surface he tried to portray the character of the album as a bad guy, provoking Rami to become a racist skin. But who is the ultimate bachelor of the movie? It seems as if Sigglton is sympathetic to her colleague's black student (I did not say sympathy!) Or only to take the path of racist skin. Many nations who have been raped by other nations do not wander in extreme superstition. <br /> <br /> Women who are raped immediately turn to lesbianism, which is illustrated more like worship than lifestyle. What was the point of honesty?
