A good idea, badly implemented. Although it can summarize 99% of the Saifai channel, it really applies here. A good back story is slowly published where I love movies, and I like action movies, and I like the main actor, so it can be great. However, despite some good acting, this film failed due to poor writing and management of the bill plates. <br /> <br /> Another review has made a good point of interest to know where you are going. This is not the movie. It has been unacceptably united that you do not know the word "platform" as the word "second draft". There is a completely unnecessary scenery and can be moved without any philosophy. This scene even starts and ends with their driving, so you can spend from one car scene to another and never miss a non-pointless scene in the middle. <br /> <br /> This film was also a strange habit, explaining some details while explaining to others, some points where you can guess the whole "plot" up front. It was also a habit of ending the war, perhaps only because they could not afford it. There are some ridiculously bad scenes where "plots" are released on a computer and the final war is easily associated with "toxic glue" (seriously * what * is it?). <br /> <br /> <br /> A fan of Shirley Appleby, check out this movie because she's okay. He managed to break his "Roswell" personality several times and created a good hard cock (but not always). John De Lansy has played in the same status that he has ever done since returning to the status: TNG, so this is nothing new. <br /> <br /> Finally, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.
