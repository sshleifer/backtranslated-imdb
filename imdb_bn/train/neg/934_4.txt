Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as normal. Ritter was not bad. Her name was pretty cool as usual. This could be a good movie. The worst was the plot was oppressive. It was completely predictable, trite and annoying. <br /> <br /> From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie is decorated like a child's paint by the shoot routine. Characters were cut pieces of cardboard cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and it played completely, which was a sad. <br /> <br /> Finally the script writer was not very bad. Especially with the "steady" lines of the child, which was totally unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Again, it is an act that prevents very few scores.
