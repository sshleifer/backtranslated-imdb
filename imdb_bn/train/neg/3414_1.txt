It's just horrible, really horrible trash. Yes, we've got nice nude women being dancing and having sex. But when could it work on a pornographic movie ?? Could even be a hit as a porn movie ?? It tries to mask itself as a "movie" with real passion and struggle. It's not It's an excuse to get some girl naked and have a fun time. I am sure that this woman (and men) of this special film could benefit fairly in the 1970s pornography business. . . But not the real film business. <br /> <br /> Actually, Hackney was so bad, I'm really terrible. The writing was even worse. Can not I put all the blame on this actor ?? There was nothing to work with them. Very detailed structure or plot of the film can be done well with potentially good writers and capable actors. A very wide framework or conspiracy is a psychological person who spends his time shooting as a sniper away from the people. These shootings were motivated not to honor their women enough to men. If there was more writing - good writing, a lot of good writing - and fewer unwanted sexual imagery could have something to do with us. <br /> <br /> This movie was supposed to be the first porn movie shot, made and marketed; It will earn more money. This is really a hardcore pornography, and it is the only non-porn movie which I saw that shows a male steep penis.
