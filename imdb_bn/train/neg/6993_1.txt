What a horror movie I can not believe I saw this 90 minutes ruining my life. Please tell me why Ving Rams and Mehkie Poffe are acting in this movie? Mehkki Pfifer E.R and Ving Rhames are probably not quite aware of what she is doing. I feel terrible for them. The music background that I say is not fit with the story in Allabal and it's amazing how you can find out exactly how life-savvy directors can create a nice and balanced film. I hope that in the future no director of a dire director can ever distort such a great classic movie. This image should not be made in the first place. Advice to everyone who saw it, please tell me that I'm okay because I probably could not be the only one who did not enjoy it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />! 10 out of 10
