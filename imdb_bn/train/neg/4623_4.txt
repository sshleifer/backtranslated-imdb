If you have not seen the Gong Show TV series, you will not like this movie too much, knowing the series is not a great movie. <br /> <br /> I give 5 out of 10 because some things make it fun that helps them with their obvious problems. <br /> <br /> 1) It was a fun snapshot made in the early 1970's and early 1980's. 2) You will find many fun comes that you have seen in the show. 3) Chalk (host) is interested in seeing when he is not working on his TV personality 4) You will see many diverse people that you are going to watch TV shows. <br /> <br /> I will not list all the bad things because they have a lot, but here are several prominent. <br /> <br /> 1) Gong Shaw Movie has most of the TV show clips that are tired of the length of the film. 2) Film story line is very weak outside clips segments and basically only a plot point is created. 3) Chuck is actually half decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing the common ways over the 1970's leveling. <br /> <br /> It does not have a good movie when you do not have a movie hour and a half once you want to see it all. See 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad. But even then it is not very good. ;)
