It's listed as a documentary, it's not, it's sort of illustrated like a documentary but I suspect that's just because they get away with filming with a shaky camera and dodgy. It has been released in DVD in the UK as "American Pie Style Comedy" which is not it. <br /> <br /> It's basically close to a group of Spring Break ages when they go to Mexico for cheap meals. And finally being abandoned to get virgin friends there. Throwing a few of the Dooars, with similar searches and trying to get some of your girls, there is a lively story of drunk teens. <br /> <br /> It has lot of nudity considering 18 ratings, and indeed zero sex scene, mainly I have assumed that there are lots of oaths. <br /> <br /> If you like crude jackass behavior without humor, it can be a matter of your brain cells. Then I'll probably avoid this left!
