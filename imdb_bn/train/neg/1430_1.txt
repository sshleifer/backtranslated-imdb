While walking through the channel on Saturday night, my friends and I were standing across the movie. First, Irish actor Pearce Brosnan as a native American? Seriously?! His pronunciation broke so much, though his character was apparently Scottish. Later, I found that this film was already created after James Bond / Agent 2007 played at least twice. With the inspiration of this movie inspirational Professor, stereotypes play up. The girl's face will be kept closed while playing Tony. And, who won this award? I can not believe it. Brosnan was an interesting man, but we gladly wanted to gauge our eyes after watching it for 10 seconds. We switched it from "kickping and screaming", and we wanted to go back. We saw the children's 1995 classic "cupboard in the cupboard" in the night before, talking about the echoes. The following line represents our escaping desire: "Take me out, the world slowly." From "Gray Owl": "If you do not like it, you will not see it."
