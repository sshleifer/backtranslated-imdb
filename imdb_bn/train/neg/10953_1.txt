This garbage excuse for television never hit the Australian television trash single most terrible piece. The home-grown comrades are frustrating, weird, ridiculously intelligent and on the basis that if they want to be with them then you will try to kill them. As far as I am concerned, Big Brother is the fall of Western society, it shows how our brain is becoming dead in our brain. Has happened on a television that does not target the lowest general majority of the audience as the audience? This can not be classified as entertainment. I think it is true that the channel ten can erase your soul. It happened with Roof McManus who once was a respected comedian and once again became obscure by being on Channel 10. The Simpsons exception which is highly intelligent.
