Nightmares are proven in the weekend that some people have become so depressed in 'movies' that they are ready to do almost anything. <br /> <br /> I'm not referring countless women who stark completely into this horrible piece of completely happy trash (after all, nude female form is a beautiful thing and nothing shameful). No ... I'm talking about them who are willing to cooperate with a badly made hand doll called George. Now that is embarrassing !!! <br /> <br /> A scientist created by organic scientist Edward Brock (Wellington Mayfert), a biological electronic, George (who shows an abstract felt cloth with green wool for hair) is an interface for an artificially intelligent computer system that is a revolutionary device (A silver ball about a golf ball size), when it is accepted, it would reverse the character's disorders. Maybe. <br /> <br /> Edward's personality changes have been successful in the laboratory, but careful scientist is reluctant to run tests on human subjects, afraid that there may still be side effects. Her bad assistant Julie (Debbie Luster), however, does not have such kind of softness and Guinea earns to use three beautiful young women as pigs. Inevitably, they all become a hate killer mutant. <br /> <br /> Basement special effects on the door, a cast of a completely pure fire and a plot that is almost impossible to follow (I took notes when I saw the movie, and even though I still do not fully believe that my summary is correct) , Nightmare Weekend is a complete and complete disaster which also extends a touch of several soft-core sex scenes and Gore Can not do This picture is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in horror films: Tony (Bruce Morton), a Wakman who designed an irate 80-minute music that allows Justin Timberlake to look at me.
