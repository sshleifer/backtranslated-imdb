Dahmara, a young confused man. Dahmara, a confusing movie. Please see the movie, I had a few beers, but I did not explain why this was so annoying on Flickr. <br /> <br />'s flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there is no real story with a beginning and a end, the only thing that made sense in the film was at the beginning and in the end of the film there were explanatory texts. Stuff, which will be movies, nude images, annoying images and time waste. <br /> <br /> We never see actual kill, everything is just a bunch of intimacy. Sometimes you just have a feeling that Dahmar's dream is the whole thing, but you know that he is not, because it is based on a true story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> But what happened? It's not easy to say. <br /> <br /> I do not encourage waste time in this movie. I <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not like it a little and suddenly I got cheated. <br /> <br /> * / *****
