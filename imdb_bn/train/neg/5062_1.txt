This movie is bizarre. To be good, it's "freakin weird". I could give you a plot summary, or some group intensity analysis, but I would consider it a waste of your time. It is necessary to know about this picture that this film is about two young sisters, a cruel relationship, a monologue, post mortem separation, and a really annoying inspiration. At the end of the film you think you are going to take a shower to wash your throat, but not in a good way like "Paul Fiction" or "Fight Club". Looks like you're a teen (or high school that I'm still a teenager) and you just did something: hope you did not do it, and hope B is the best Lord of heaven and earth not to find your parents. And everyone likes. My suggestion is that instead of looking at the contaminated and decorated cinematic fragrance, waste your time a little less horrible and see "Kajamam" (yes, I want to see "Qadam" rather than "Madadaras Madad", you want to read what you want ).
