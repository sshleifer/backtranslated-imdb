Film for a 'female film' but not gang. One of the worst movies created by a male director about women. Director Andy Mac not only knows women Pieces of bad taste, humorous style of American pie, weird stories, no ideas, underground stories, fragmentary characters. Virtual visualization of screen life Insulting and definitely not funny. I wonder how three good actresses are taking it to take part.
