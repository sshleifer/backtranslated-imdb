Information about National Lampon goes to movies, AK National Lampon's Movie Madness: <br /> <br /> 1. The film is also poor by the standard standards of Lampun. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one goes to see movies. So, after watching this, I was wondering why it goes to the 'National Lampon movie' on Earth, and why it was never thought, much less actually made. This will be called Austin Powers, called 'American American Guy to the Movies'. How lame He's not American, and he does not go to the movies. None of Lamphun's so-called "satire" characters are funny and do not see any film, which creates some problems. I hope this mystery will be something in the vein of Science Theater 3000, but it is not. <br /> <br /> This was the first picture of National Lampoon after House House, although you could not say it from the quality of the film. Badly developed, rough and amateur by any standard, is it a headache? The 89-minute movie does not seem to be long. <br /> <br /> I noticed a pattern. Really bad movie is usually named ?? And this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles - perhaps it could help people to fool and publicize it to remember how bad the panning was taken from home video critics in 1982/83. Hmmm, movie madness ?? I did not hear this movie before! Let's rent it! And then, perception: 'Hey, wait a minute, it just goes to National Lampon movies! <br /> <br /> It was printed by MGM / UAE, not for the theatrical release or DVD; It sometimes pops up on television several times every decade, which is just its only place that you manage to manage it. <br /> <br /> Is it divided into three stories ?? Self-growth video, butter and corporate brutality, and police cruelty / cop-body film (I guess) is a parody. The first segment divorces his wife to Peter Rigert (Anne Lions House) as a disappointed person and does something else. I'm not sure because it was so annoying that my mind began to shake. Until the sexual scene is popped up. <br /> <br /> Part II is about an exotic dancer who is raped by a stick (not asked) who decides to become a queen of Margarine, so that she can stop supplying dairy products. Seek! This is the only funny line in the movie: 'Only I can love my son!' If you do not feel very funny words, are you right ?? Is it not and just imagine ?? Part III is about a policeman who smashes the serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his nerve and shoot the man. It contains a fun scene but it is highly over-acted ?? Only Lloyd really displays any humor, his character is dry and sympathetic, yet weirdly over. The part that he hates his prey and the polite police, reveals everything, at least, a sneak or two. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Low value. The authors of each section explicitly believe that they are called so-called and shiny by so-called Stereotypes. The fault is that the movie has become a huge contradiction, instead of plots, and supports it; Crude humor instead of malicious dialogue; Inspired ones instead of superb acting. It is easy to see that an actor is not submerged with elements, explodes in their lines, often embarrassed, they rarely can contact the camera. <br /> <br /> The movie is not funny, as I said before. I once laughed, just one line, even then half of it. Two chocolates, a smile, and a very weak smile. Compared to the movie Madness, many other decent comedy looks like a regular sunny track. I like National Lampon's Leisure series (or, at least three installments) and their classic asylum house, but their golf punks (video bombings with this wonderful comic genius Tom Arnold, video bombs in direct video) Earlier, their newspaper provided a good example of why they went out of print. It really gets old, really fast. <br /> <br /> A new movie, known as Gold Digger, is found to be released with their approval stamps. Is it a movie condemnation even before the theater hits ?? Maybe they should start advertising their names across all places? <br /> <br /> Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It gets national lamuna stamp of approval. Later you will be taught not to do something terrible. <br /> <br /> Forget the death penalty. Just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and watch them watch this on every day and over for a month. <br /> <br /> It is so bad that I can not even begin to explain his witty vileness. I give up
