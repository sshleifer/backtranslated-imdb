I was lying on my bed, really bad cold or flu or whatever. I would have killed a bit while watching movies for some moments before buying my mother for a horror movie. I do not want to pick this movie! I felt more sick after seeing it and I wanted to throw. Afterwards (I certainly have been well) Dennis L. I did some research on the radar and I noticed that Dennis was not really anything in the movie. I hope no one will see this movie but if they can not eat or I first saw it. I think you'll get better time viewing Santa Santa Claus. At least that movie had good reviews on this site.
