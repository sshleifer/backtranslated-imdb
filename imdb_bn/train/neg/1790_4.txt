It was initially a "cute" movie, then very enjoyable and very great song. <br /> <br /> Talking to King James in English today is not very annoying, but always easy to explain. Are you young people trying to hear this picture? Forget it. <br /> <br /> Bing Crosby has some good lines here and is preferred as "Hank Martin". Rhonda Fleming ("Alisande La Carteloise") was in addition to her good looks and beautiful, long red hair. <br /> <br /> This is an excellent movie with a feeling-good finish, and I can not lose it. Maybe it's a good fit for a rental, for historical reasons or if you're a big crossover fan, it's not a whole lot more.
