When it was made I was impressive to come back with the cartoon. It's a smart smart drink. Although it admittedly had errors, it was rather enjoyable. <br /> <br /> Naturally I was interested in watching the film version. That was before I saw it. After that I never wanted to make it. Apart from being worried as well as <br /> <br /> (what was the role of Broader in the world?) It did not create grade only. <br /> <br> The effect is reasonable and probably the movie I like; Seeing a live-action version of the career! What was lost was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting. <br /> <br /> The original was a cruel cartoon with a very silent attitude. It was fun. The motion picture became crooked and took FAR myself very seriously. It was seriously a great plot or it became crazy to think of it as "cartoon in movies" but it can be enjoyable. <br /> <br /> It is not considered as part of it as part of it. "Gadget inheritance".
