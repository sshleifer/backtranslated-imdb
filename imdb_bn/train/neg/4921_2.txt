Exclusive producer Wes Craven and blame Wayne's donors for the disappointment of this big budget: "Dracula" with Bram St Oker (who probably will not want his name on this item) and slasher-styled jolts and gore, much else for our rest. Christopher Plummer looks winded as modern day Van Helsing - Van Helsing is just a descendant but real thing; He kept himself with the drip from Count Dracula's body, which came out of his coffin after being stolen from Van Helsing's Vault and after moving to New Orleans. What is New Orleans in the 21st Century! The film is well-produced but without the single core idea (except for multi-racial prejudice), both boring and lazy, and repeats itself after about an hour. * ****
