I was annoyed at around 10am, so I saw this movie. And I could not laugh. Everything was so ridiculous. The way the kids acted, they worked like more than 11 years of age, cracked me exactly. The children had a ring, which supposedly killed people after 3 or more years. It impresses me that he wanted to be a gangster. <br /> <br /> It is very difficult to take small children seriously, especially when it comes to eating insects. They do everything, such as a big deal, do not eat the bait (the main character), then the world will end. <br /> <br /> It is a good movie for younger kids (without the truth that a 5-year-old 'gender'), but for teenagers or adults who do not want to waste their time.
