I rented this awesome movie. I remember the worst I ever seen. I believe the 1st grade class could do a good job. I've never seen bad pictures and I saw something bad. I had to spend Rs 1.50 on renting anything and it was 1.49 rupees. Terrible acting, the characters are bad and the film is just a piece of trash. Slathouse House Scenes is so low budget that it creates an abstract look like an Oscar nomination. I can say, if you want to spoil a good evening and rented a little money this awesome flick. I would see murderer clowns from outer space when sitting in a bucket of razors again sitting through this flop
