How nice! From the early part of the 1980s, I remember very few horror films around high school. They generally pretend to be incredibly scattered plot and to be 27 year old actor students. I saw this picture, I felt some nostalgia growing in the 1980's. However, I see this picture was created in 1989? What is the ball Well, the nostalgia factor just ends up there, it's just bad. The city is preparing to stop high school and threatens to live in all high schools in all the students. Which is strange, that both of these students are wealthy and lots of students. In fact, the main character lives in a palace. You wonder how you can not find the meaning of keeping this school alive, they have not heard about property taxes. Oh, but here's the kicker. The school board says that if they can raise $ 2000,000, they will keep the school alive. So seniors go to do this. Hmmm, you raise $ 200,000 but instead of storing it for college, have you placed in high school to Saving, which is a senior? And why would they close an overpopulated school before the end of the year? And ... Oh forgot it, this picture is stupid and made in 1989!
