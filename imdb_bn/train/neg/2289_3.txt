Sadly, Marie decided to take her own problem with men in the fantasy account of Harron Betty Page. Generally as in all its work, each main male character is portrayed as weak, bumbling, or twisted. To add to his fiction, he projects his own opinions and problems that are not true. Betty did not leave Bij, because she felt that it was morally wrong or had religious problems (though she was born in her life after the effects of her third husband-a minister). He was at the age of 30, because his acting career had gone somewhere and he thought he had lost his face. The persecution and rape indications are unauthorized and beta has been denied in its own words, and the director's efforts should be abused by men to claim that any bowl was made. Harron failed to mention in the point that Betty designed her own wardrobe in almost all her folks (not handed her by "sick" fetishists). Harrison also failed to create a point that Bati Jaeger, who had shot many famous photographs of Betty, also did many "naughty" shoots with Betty and was not a morally upright professional photographer portrayed in the film. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace shows a lot like Gretchen Mol Betty. Otherwise, other films and documentaries are more accurate and honest in his life and in his life.
