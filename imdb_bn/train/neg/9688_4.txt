Greenway's films are cute, hungry and innovative as the poses. Nevertheless, its genre of genre and grammar originated in the era of the First World War, and reminded the audience of the movie: frame structure, use of mid-shot, static camera. It might be better to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it's not new. Perhaps another "inventor" like TS Elliott, draws even more from the past than being a real inventor or waiting. <br /> <br /> Still, Greenway's biggest failure is that he can not write. Without its dialogue and even the schematic structure mechanical and logical but other dramatic logician's lifestyle, Brecht. This weakness is most evident in his comedy, which is authentic and logical, so joke is dead before it is delivered. The result is Tedium: If it is not funny, it failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their actions if the audience does not respond. Perhaps the well-known director may learn something from Freud. Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenway has acted like a clone for years now. They talk about a long, sunny wind line. <br /> <br /> This image is boring, despite its design and discussion.
