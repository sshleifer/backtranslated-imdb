Spoilers will be this. The movie could have been better for a different script, director and CGI provider. Do not have more rights? The movie has started its own theme park ... Wrong ... on a lonely island zoo, where dinosaurs can see ... Wrong ... Subterths and it's called Juror ... Oops ... Primal Park I have no original idea for this type of movie, but it does not match you as soon as it encounters, R e p e a t e d l y. There is also a "galaxy of creatures on design" head. Cereththus, not Cereththus, Mr. According to the Primal Park (only the ancient cataclysmic cat), they are rather zunky but I am a "slogan" of the crowning success. Because, after settling a big cat, a hero keeps a little jerk because only one is left. Tell the stranger the man, Nah, we have created three, the third is a demon, who draws himself in front of him. Great, groovy. A group of college students are also on the island for a Schansancer Hunt, where they were tested for their enemies traveling or always (always thought that a short nickname is needed). Only one of those who live has done their job, so I came out of her. Oh yes, forced to compulsory "Evil capitalist must die" click on one, but two of them! All the ridiculous things of Mr Premal Park's death that you loose the teeth of the Sabratoid statue (courtesy of the slogie), shrink some sizes and impose the human with the throat. If I only acquired so much easier I liked "Sabretooth" better than this spin off
