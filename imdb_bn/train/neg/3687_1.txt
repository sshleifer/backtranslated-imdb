This is not just a bad movie; This is not just the four "best" Mexican filmmakers. And it's not just scripts scary. It's just that ... this movie sucks ... big time. These people are wasting money from scarier scripts. It is supposed to criticize Mexican society but we're annoyed with such films. Bad language is supposed to be funny? I do not get it. If such movies continue (and are written and produced) then the Mexican movie is facing big problems. <br /> <br /> Please, this type of movie is not well accepted in Mexico: we hate them and they do not reflect us.
