This is the most annoying film I ever seen. It creates a "dream request" like a Disney film. However, technically, it is good to reasonably well, acting, cinematography, music, direction etc. However, the conclusion of the gang rape scenario is the most terrible and violent thing I've ever seen and I really do not want it I saw. I'm afraid that it will hunt me for the rest of my life. Although I think that anyone would make this film very annoying, my wife and some of her friends were similarly hunted and I did not really think of the need for a clear reminder of the horrific experiences they had. I saw the film at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas, and no cast or crew was present. I liked them to get the chance to defend violence in their film, which I felt, excessive, unreal and unnecessary. The mood that was successfully running in a previous scene was notified successfully, but soon after facing extreme and explicit sexual violence. This photo should have a big alert label. That's why I will not recommend anyone to show it. You have been warned.
