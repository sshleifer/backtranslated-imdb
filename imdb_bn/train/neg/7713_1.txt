I knew this picture was so bad that it was funny, so I went to it with the hope. I found it to be very bad to be mortally boring. Whiny theme song is fun for about 10 seconds, until you realize that there is nothing clever about it except deliberately annoying quality about it. The thing gets to be splattered with tomato gets nearly 30 seconds old. There is nothing clever or interesting about the movie except premiere. It may have survived the 3-4 minute comedy sketch, but it is not a stretch of imagination.
