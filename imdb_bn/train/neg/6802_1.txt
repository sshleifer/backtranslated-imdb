It can not be described how bad this movie is. I can not just explain by writing. See it for yourself on how strongly the movie can really be really awesome. That's not what I recommend to you. Here are a lot of clich√©s, mistakes (and you can imagine all the negative things that are) here that only you will cry. There are many errors related to the aircraft to get started with technology first. I do not list them here, but just mention flat color. They were not even shown to show an airport in a fictional plane, rather instead they used a 747 color image of the original Boeing. very bad. The plot is stupid and long ago, a lot has been done, much better. There are so many funny moments here that I have lost count of really early. Also, I was always with the bad boy in the movie, because the good boys were so stupid. You have to choose this option without any doubt about "Executive Decision", even "turmoil" -Movie is good. Actually, any other film in the world is better than this.
