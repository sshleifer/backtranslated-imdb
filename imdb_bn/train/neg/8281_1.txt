It was a stupid movie with an unprecedented story and awesome acting !! Willie Nelson was tough as her braids. The film seemed like a very long advertisement for Jessica Simpson's bright red lipstick - especially her close-ups with her face. The premiere was not fun and I said - soooooooo predictable. The amount of money that was spent for the production of this movie is shameful waste. Any other expression in the old Marilyn Monroe film is not always promoting the Golden Ambition scene. It was also incredible - Jessica Simpson was able to promote the post of Hat's executive editor - it was ridiculous !!!
