I'm sorry to say it, but "Thunderbirds" do not even come with a loud pop, do not remember a thunder. At one stage, I seriously considered walking out of the movie, I was optimistic that the film could improve. I will be disappointed, it is not good, if it is possible then it gets worse. I went to see the film that it seems to be "surprising", I still feel frustrated. Here was an excellent opportunity to create a great franchise for their movies, they completely destroyed that opportunity. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley, to add the name to this film, Mr. and Jonathan Franks would like to say what I can say, they should be ashamed and not too far away from the truth should be ashamed. I have seen this picture while showing the pre-release, I was waiting to show the most interest to be able to grow up in the sixties with the original genre. I would have said that there would be something of an understatement that was frustrating. A finalist about the film was a TV show that had more wood than film stars.
