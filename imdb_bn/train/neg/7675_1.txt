Can it ever be said that there is a movie which is not a feature of liberation? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After threatening the director of 'The House of the Dead', the Uwe Bow now dropped less talented eyes in the adaptation of other video games. Do these guys get it? Nobody understands, here it is in the block capital for you: Do not make video games for better movies! Here's the acting, the best, sub-values. Set design and special effects are poor. In contrast to the video game (which had its horror moments), there is no atmosphere in the upcoming growing environment, danger or danger. Pensing and plumbing are used as well as paper toilet paper that is confused and printed in scripts. Chief criminal director Uwe Bol uses a monkey to gracefully and efficiently uses a paintbrush. The hackneyed zoom, swoops and pan viewers are spliced ​​into the whole dreary matter of the unknowable moments of unconscious and bored viewers. Why this guy should ever stand as one of the greatest secret of modern cinema, given that the first film was given around a movie set. To avoid all costs.
