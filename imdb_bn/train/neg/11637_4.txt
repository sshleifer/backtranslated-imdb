The Uwe Bowl did the impossible: Create a game adaptation that can play at least a few; He has made an incompatible and objectionable content game full of anti-social and offensive content. So, as an orientation, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Uwe Boll is still dealing with this, so do not expect movies to be any good. When it's the moment, "postal" welcomes him very quickly and there is pain from it. In the main part of <br /> <br />, the post is a mockery of America, such as the twelve year old child. Ball feels that objection is proportionally proportional to comical values: more objectionable, funny, and more exaggerated. It turns into a movie that is highly hit and determines the new dimension of dullness while missing. Yes, some gags work but it seems to be the fate of pure. High pointers include satirizing yourself, and getting hit by violent injuries by truck trucks and other vehicles. Low points include .... we have more <br /> <br /> After the initial surprise, the post just became a sister to see. Yes, there are ten minutes of good and good points, but all the other boring characters have bones and are following each other in a place that seems eternal with each other. It's probably worked as a small film, but it's not enough content for more than 90 minutes (though it seems twice as long). There are excellent ideas and excellent attempts, but they are uninhabited and unwelcome in view of an endless and vague step that is objectionable only for it. 4/10
