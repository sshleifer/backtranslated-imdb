Martyn Koslake's extraordinary charisma brings a certain credibility to the disappointing artist's character. He impressed his conflict with the strange idea of ​​reality, which created the sculptor Marcel a believer. The character is seen as a real person and it is not a normal B movie villain. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to write about the line of the story, and many scenes are dust. What is this strange chemistry as a cripple between Cosek and Rondo Haton? Koslake's conversation, the philosophical character is the low key of the hat, opposite to the psychosocial process. The character of the crypter is not much better than a basic giant level, but the hattan suggests the untimely possibilities and surprises me with its back story. <br /> <br /> This movie was in Shock Theater when I was a kid, so I have a certain nostalgic love for it. It's worth watching, however, those who enjoy fifty horror movies.
