For domestic viewers, I can see how they would appreciate this movie. For outsiders, without the interest of any interest, it did not gain much knowledge. The Germans were disabled and Russians were depicted as heroes. The supposed romantic angle was lazy and a confusion. How a young girl could 'love' Lieutenant only shiny her, she was stupid. At the end of the film, it can be mentioned that why was it not right to get married because of this ghost? I mentioned that the German was portrayed as statue and it was behind the Marsh. Hundreds of German soldiers armed with firearms Russians, pushed into the marsh. So the Russians were secret and the Germans stopped at the edge of the Marsh and heard there. I think they did not want to visit their boots, but I'm sure an officer ordered 20 to 30 people to search in the water. But that story will end. Also, the Germans entered the barn where Russians were hiding in loft and did not stop to set fire on the roof. At the worst time, some soldiers threw a grenade in the loft and could not move towards ants on a stairs. <br /> <br /> I saw some critics who said they were crying till the end. I wonder why? You knew this would destroy the small band and they had nothing to tugging that heart.
