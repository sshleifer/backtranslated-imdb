This is the greatest, greatest rolled holiday movie I've ever closed eyes, and it's saying something. I know that there are some strange ideas about the religion of Mexican people, which mix traditional beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their death is not a terrible half of them in the Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> So Santa is not some delightful, greasy red liqueur (see those pink cheeks once!). Rather, he works harder than Cathie Lee Gifford's sweat shops, with a bunch of kids, a skinny sociology podfofel living in heaven (or the sky, anybody). They were dressed up in their homeland by singing many beautiful traditional songs. I was surprised that I was surprised that African-American boy was singing 'Mammy' in the black. This Santa is a peeping Tom who sees and hear everything from their sky in the sky. This is that he can force the naughty or beautiful (those who are naughty, with emphasis on the I will bet). <br /> <br /> There is no Mrs. Claus, no elves (what does she need elves for when her child is in labor?) and Rayyan's mechanical wind toy! This floating scary cloud is falling on the clouds, perhaps by its silver lining. <br /> <br /> Santa's generosity ... Devil?! This is Santa, our Lord and Savior? Mysterious Anyhoo, Satan tries to screw Christmas, one of his minions, a mincing, sends ghost called Pitch devil. Let me get this straight-the pure evil forces are trying to destroy the whole commercial and greed-driven holiday? It seems to be ineffective, is not it? <br /> <br /> The pitch is completely ineffective. He tried to talk to some children worse, but there is not much luck. I slowly became slowly slowly and slowly slowly and steadily gradually, gradually, gradually slowly I slowly became gradually blindly gradually. What he wants is a doll for Christmas, but parents can not buy his account (they keep all their money in pocket that they have built their houses). So pitch tried to encourage a doll to steal. In reality, this is the only way a poor poor doll can ever get a doll, because he is holy and pray to God and the holy Santa does not really work. But the loop prevents the temptation and tells the pitch to take it behind it, and so you have been rewarded with a doll that you just know that it's the sister of Chuckie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> he was trapped in a tree (oh-huh) from there, he was rescued from the mallin! Marlin? You're kidding me! Since the legendary Druidic figures are displayed in the Christmas story, or have something to do with a Christian religion? And Allah does not deny the magician? Hundreds of years ago they killed Marilyn, and she did not tell him to be saved from one side of God (or I'm going against Satan, I think Santa must be). Is this movie a long huah? From the beginning to the end, and it will surprise you that if you drink or drink it is not speculative or anything. It was probably because this movie is like a long giant DT.
