With a story and screenplay written in high school, 'The Art of Seduction' fails to provide a romantic, sophisticated experience, which it tries to bill itself. The two main characters can be attractive - both men and women lead "swinging (or female lead, in case of lead)", but 'off-the-art' coins do not even try. The title, 'The Art of Seduction', removes some of the substances on the basis of thin, low stereotype, from a perfect test of personality of these two characters. <br /> <br /> 'The art of condemnation' is insulting - shame of its character, humiliation of men and women, and insult of the audience's expectations. It is our terrible beautiful man who we all know and follow their painful interactions when they hope to make us idol. G-Wayne is an unexpected, spoiled, manipulute bitch. She is beautiful because the spectator is beautiful and is expected to forgive her errors. M-jun, well, he's the exact same. Not good people. "Humor" in this film is basically congratulating each other in the respect of the art of falsehood and manipulation of G-Wyana and Min-June. No character develops and we never know why G-Wyon and Min-June are such. We are just expected to accept them like them, and do not ask questions - they are beautiful! And this is important. In the reviews of AZN Movies Scenes, the comedic references to celebrities of major actors can help you find the 'Seduction of Modernity of Art'. <br /> <br /> If you are still in high school, you like Grease, or you are a yellow fever, you may like this movie. <br /> <br /> Despite its "romance" tag, this is not a very good date movie.
