The best thing to do after the frustration of "Fried Dead" fifth movie is that it is the most wonderful thing. It starts from scratch. Of course, this "final" film in Saga is stupid but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even taking a bit breath. And the story of Freddy's (Lisa Zen) story is unique to returning to town to face her bad father. <br /> <br /> Overall, there is nothing other than cartoons to get kids to movie theaters. It has a bunch of good actors (Jane, Yapet Koto, and Lezley Dane) who are basically stupid and turn like a sheep ready for sheep. It's aside, it's a magic-strategy, and, ultimately, it's nothing but stupid, baby entertainment. <br /> <br /> <br />
