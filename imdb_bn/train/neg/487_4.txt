What do the director think? Everyone reading Artemisia's biography has been relieved of his bitterness to face trial of rape in Renaissance Bar and tortured to show that even Taseer was guilty. That reality shows the real freedom and liberation war - in his most horrible hours he stood his man. Why is the movie portraying Renaissance so beautifully and beautiful to be Romantic, are we afraid to see the wonderful aspect of life or have won the happy-happy mood of Hollywood? I will always preserve a direct freedom to create my own reality in the film, but I can not look at Artimisia's life story on her head. Very frustrating choice by the makers of this photo.
