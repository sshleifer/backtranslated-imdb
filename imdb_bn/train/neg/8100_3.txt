Vanity's forestfire is a movie within the flop sweat. I can not take a movie that has worked so hard to be so illusive, provocative and important, yet it has failed so much across the board. It's like a sunny smile that does not smile, but can not leave the stage. As much as the film tries to make it harder, so every effort will be made of a stiff neck. The frustration of the film display is so great that it expresses regret for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> The movie only achieves humorous status twice. Once, Geraldo Rivera's eyes look like hateful, arrogant and unbearable television tabloid journalists - which is funny, because she does not clearly understand that she is playing herself. The acting judge of Morgan Freeman is distributing the Holy Lecture about Morality ("Your Mother Is Learning!"). Moment of crippling is the insult to be stupid. <br /> <br /> One should acknowledge that it is a noble effort. It's bad, if bad acting, the band of actors, who try to figure out the cardboard out of thin cardboard cards. The film shows professionally and produces small cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves, especially if not particularly effective. But movies, which seemingly want to be a commentary on modern morality and ethics, will never rise above the level of cartoon. Satire style is needed. Fars power is needed. Even need sitcom time But the best Bonfires can be a great disappointment. In the end, you do not want to laugh, you just want to go away.
