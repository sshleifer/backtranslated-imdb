Timo Sapromomo has three children, their leader - Captain Crandle, Rap Girl and Skate Laad, with their own battlefield (buzz! Chico! Oppa!) And the outfit and moving They work for the governor, Kevin, and are appointed after the game and are willing to be heroes. They carry out family and school duties as well as normal living, but most workers remain away from school weddings. All of Villen's are unique and unique features, such as Mr. Vegg and his people who do not seem to plan their plans but work in any way. From an evil robot to a wicked barbarian, three will face them and stop their evil, and often strange, plan to gain power, take revenge, etc. <br /> <br /> Animation is very beautiful and smooth but the purpose of style appears to be simple. Background colors are overlapping and buildings seem to be in the future. The music is quite beautiful, and the show is not fairly bad, although the style is not my favorite. <br /> <br /> Plot is almost always offensive and ridiculous, but after all it is a cartoon and one that can not be held accountable for them. But there will not be the same position as Fimmore! Or Paper Ann.
