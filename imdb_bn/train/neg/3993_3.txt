The movie I hoped was not right, not good, but not bad. In my opinion, PG-13 films are not terrible enough, so I already knew that I would be bored throughout the whole movie. Obviously things are going on in the hotel room, but nothing we've seen before. I guess I did not like it because I thought that many twists and happenings are happening; It got old and repeated. I do not understand if all the things to travel in the house of Kasak are real or not. There is no explanation for any event that happened. The film ends only and when it finishes, you want to continue it because you are still waiting for someone to tell about what the whole film is about. I had special effects like what I did. There was nothing more than that. Maybe it was just me but I was down on this average.
