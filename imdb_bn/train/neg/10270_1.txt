"American Nightmare" is officially bound, in my opinion, "It's Pat!" <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is hosted by a guy with a beard. <br /> <br /> <br /> The moon, Monica, Joe, oh ... Oh wait, that means, Owen, Jesse, and the rest of the worst one-fishing gangs are taking everyone. By beard makes them the biggest fear. Unknown to them, an insane nurse / serial killer can hear ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In this scary include such stunners as "Voodoo" and gone down by old women with dentures. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This image was circulated in a word. Craig Nurse's lack of encouragement, the audience's "jump", the last hit, and - again - Voodoo <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you care for your loved ones - even a little bit - go to your local blockbuster, rent all copies of "American Nightmare" and hide them in the freezer.
