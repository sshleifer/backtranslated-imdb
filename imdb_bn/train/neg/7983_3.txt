Ultimately, overlong and there are more fillers filled with subplots than Swiss cheese! Directors and co-authors say that he wanted to mix general - drama and comedy in this case. Well, at least here, these two mixtures are like vinegar and oil. To boot, the comedy is not very funny and teenager. In addition, the film is not really realistic. Libertarians are charged with legal action against the French citizens against their will and against the obvious nature of drug trafficking in French hospitals. I saw this movie on TV on my big screen and I screamed to scream in the movie itself. Finally, finally I send the final lecture, one of the main characters highlighting the son of his ex-boyfriend. Until that time I had abandoned a great deal of intriguing plot, related to a deceased boyfriend, marriage of benefits and a brown ex-boyfriend. Occasionally this plot separates the family of two main characters and then returns to one of them - Ismail or primarily Nora. For the loss of the audience, the outlook is changing from Nora and Ismael, his former boyfriend is confined to his will in psychological hospital. Perhaps there are two potentially attractive movies, none of which are well developed. The theoretically not many sub-plots are wrapped up and it seems that spectators can believe that Nora will be happier in any way, although given his situation in real life, Hell is equal to the chance of ice. The actors are not enough to overcome their lack of performance, editing and focus on all their best and interesting, but poor writing.
