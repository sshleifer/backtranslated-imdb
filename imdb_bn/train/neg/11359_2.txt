3-D animation (highlight of the show) It worked well, but the other elements are flat. It seems as if the filmmakers think that "well, it will be 3d so we do not have to work hard to develop the plot or character." And it's a child's movie that is absolutely no excuse. The public is drawn into three dimensional letters (Shake, Nimo's father) as much as they are drawn in three dimensional graphics. Any of the main characters are shown in two dimensional scooters, who, in time, reflects the plots repeatedly, and they owe it to everything. <br /> <br /> and absolute kikor? Aladrin's appearance is very finished (after seeing a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical image for one hour) and the main character of the movie called "Pollutant" and it was impossible for the screen to release the situation by expressing it. <br /> <br /> ??? !!! ??? Do you just tell the kids that Easter Bunny and Santa Claus do not you?
