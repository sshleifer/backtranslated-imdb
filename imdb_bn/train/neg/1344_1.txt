A movie titled "Bagman" will automatically draw attention to a bad movie lover, but the DVD is far more different than what it might look like after the cover. Bagman is not a good movie. It appears in a movie section that looks (and probably was) featured in a home video camera. Acting horror I've heard and saw this kind of wood from Troll 2. There are lots of scenes with nudity and sex, but they definitely go very quickly. Characters are morons and are completely forgettable. The last (which I will not loot) can easily be expected after seeing the very first scene. Due to the nature of the Chess of the film, it is really dangerous to turn away from the terrible production costs (real-time Gore's terrible effort, driving scene where clearly stabilize etc). Recommended for only bad movie aficionados.
