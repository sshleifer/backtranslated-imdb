I'm not saying that this movie is terrible, because I look bad, but it's not half decent. <br /> <br /> The plot is very confusing. I could not really worry about what's going on and where things are going. When the movie was over, I left my skull. I saw the end of the credit that there is something after them that can clear something, but once the credit was over, it was there. I felt I was jerked from one weak plot point across the whole movie to the other, with little or no transmission between the two. <br /> <br /> Character development is very shallow. I could not even think when someone was angry or angry against someone. I could not say that half of the letters were drunk, throwing stones, were mentally challenged, or they were a bad actor to illustrate them. This film seems to have seemed to make the development of its character much easier, but it seems that many films have already been portrayed by StereoTips (as a credit, refraining from using a film about a singer in Rock band). Trying to clear the victim child, or the trial of heroin addiction It is easy to paint stereotypes, which explains why so many bad films use stereootic characters in excessive use. On the other hand, this image uses the left and right stereotypical characters, but then as much as possible they try to keep as unreliable as possible. <br /> <br /> Another problem with letters is that they are dismissed without any explanation. I think it's okay because I've spent so little time that these characters have not had the chance to know any of their contacts, so I've never missed them. <br /> <br /> and last but at least Sadi's songs were sung. It's boring His backing music support is not a winner, but it is usually sinking by the screech published from Sie's vocal ropes. I swear that there is a point in the movie where he sang a song for at least 10 minutes. I seriously thought that this Hello-Non-Than is going to stop it. <br /> <br /> Completely, this movie is confusing. Characters are developed, Georgia's acting wood and hard, Sadie's character is one of the worst, without any other story or explanation from any bad situation. The music was intolerable, and I can not think of any good reason to see this film until you have thirst for cinematic pain.
