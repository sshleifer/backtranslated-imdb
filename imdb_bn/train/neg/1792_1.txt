Allow me to start this review by saying: I love vampire movies. They can suck (Har har pun intended), and I still love them because vampires are superb in movies. Many thought Van Helsing was a whip strap, because the vampires were enjoyable to me. You can ask: "What to do with this movie?" The answer is that I want to tell you how horrible this movie is, even for me, a vampire movie like this can be a hungry (disappointing) movie. <br /> <br /> Movie star Van Helsing, a college college professor, who is not a believer. He is a terrible actor like everyone else in this film, and he wrote it to add wounds to the wound. I honestly do not want to blame him, and I'm sure everyone has made this movie fun, but it was really painful to see it. I'm not sure why I saw the whole thing; Perhaps it was a deadly attraction, such as seeing an upcoming train accident: It's awesome, but you can not manage yourself to look at yourself. Its main drawback is that it is boring in ****, and its plot is so ridiculous, even for a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> But, I'm frustrated. However, Van Helsing has sex with his mother. Of course, he did not know that he was at that time; He just thinks it is one of his students (which are still illegal and not all, but hateful and unclear). <br /> <br /> If I was Van Helsing, I would have pulled at least one of the autopsy when I found it. I have done so gross something done. It would have to be an entertaining thing if he made some comments on it, but not The point is not even brought by all the letters. It is not such a writer even thinking about it. I said at least one other character laugh at her and said, "Ha ha, you had sex with your mom," which would be funny funny (though blatantly unfamiliar). I'm probably going out of the room, so some more words to stop you from watching this movie: There is a purple ninja war with an old man. It will be fun, but filmmakers hope to take us seriously. It's not worth watching how bad the movie is. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, there is a long, long segment where he wanders around his knife and actually does some nice Nifty tricks. It would be annoying in any other movie, but here, sadly, it was highlighted.
