At first I was sure that this was a made TV movie that was not eligible for primetime. But after a few minutes of scary panic, I realized that at least stunts and c-movies were at least comic prizes. This movie got 1 if my wife and I were not so frustrated because we were surprised to see that the actor could face it directly. It was like a less fun spy version of Big Hit (even I've bought Big Hit DVDs so much laugh) even worse performances. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Allen, not Jim, after Hogging and High Five. A few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down.
