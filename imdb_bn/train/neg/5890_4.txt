This romantic comedy is not very bad. Here and there are some interesting facts, and there are some memorable characters in it. <br /> <br /> Acting, but amateur (except banker). While some scenes are great fun, others are simply embarrassing. In particular, I think the "romantic" part of the story is poor. <br /> <br /> I like to see if everyone likes football or romantic comedy. It's not really a bad movie, and the end feels very good. Just do not expect anything out of the ordinary. If you have an hour and a quarter of the murder is fair enough.
