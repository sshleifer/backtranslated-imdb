I hired this idea that it might be interesting, and it can be an interesting story that is called it in a selfish way. It is difficult to follow, weird editing, isolated stories, the letters are destroyed, and are always destroyed horribly. I could not penetrate into it and did not think about what happened to the characters - even Ian Holmes could not even save this image. Until you need a cure for insomnia, I'd like to exclude it. 3/10, and that's being generous.
