These days and the age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a tired frustration. The actors seemed rude and uninspired, as was the dialogue. Westerners are not the usual fare for Hollywood these days, but films such as "Silverwood" prove that proves that someone is still good. Considering that it is difficult to publish that anyone will leave any expense during the liberation war, making such a weak film is very rare. If you love and looking for a good western, keep looking!
