This film does not only have a poor plot, bad direction, and terrible acting, it opens up a whole new meaning to racism. <br /> <br /> "white" kids in the film are sluts, "White" boys are frustrated, and successful (yes again) "White" businessmen rebel toilet sheets. <br /> <br /> I'm fine that if I had made the same exact movie with the exact same story line and script, only I made it about the Caucasus. "He's a friend, finally saw that you've stopped dating the black girls." <br /> <br /> Someone does not seem to see this, but watch this movie again and how do you highlight the new image of "white boys"? Suddenly, his white people are the main reason for the gang aggression, and forced the bank to fast. Only Samoa girls have the heart, there is no thing as non-slutty white girl. <br /> <br /> It disturbs me that they can not make this movie without a boring profile of the Caucasian community of New Zealand. If you think I'm too ordinary, see this movie and see what you see "white boys". Samoa likes to choose our "white boys" in real life, because its meaning is not funny. If I say, black boy, I will open my teeth. <br /> <br /> Do not see this picture. Do not waste your money. Do not be racist.
