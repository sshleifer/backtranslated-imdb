Someone would think (as I did), with Steve Martin, Goldie Haun and John Clice, a film would be very decent. These stars (especially Martin and Cleese) have all produced some fun works of comedy all the time. <br /> <br /> Well, apparently I was fairly mistaken - this one alone has ever seen one of my worst movies. It can be so unfunny so deeply in my mind that a trick after another is so deeply unfunny. These gifted actors tormented me to run the most sad tail scripts for me, which came unfortunate to me. Based on the big names, I was hopeful for a long time through the film, but it failed to provide any entertainment. <br /> <br /> In general, I try both movies and life to avoid biased commentary and broad generalization. But with this picture, it's not hard to be frustrated. I can rely on one hand, perhaps even two or three fingers, the main Hollywood production that kept me bitter from this. This is easily one of the worst comedies. <br /> <br /> I tried to enjoy it --- I really did. But the out of the towns finally failed miserably. If you really want time entertainment, take only your money and watch it frequently during the closure of the toilet. Please do not just watch this movie.
