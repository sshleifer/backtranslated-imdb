Do not make me wrong - I love David Sucre as Pirot. I love the series and the movie but enough already already on the blue death. Everyone has done this! We know who died. We know why they die. We know who the murderer is. We know how it is done. So I say enough already! Mr. Suchet, one of the most unspoken Christie's novels, could use that brilliant talent. I would say that all acting actors were fantastic. The set was terrific and very realistic. I especially like David Saul, but he was surprised to see how terrible he was. I hope he does not see that way in 'real life'! I did not really think from other movies that the very end was the same. Somehow I do not think so. I think it was a rather brilliant touch Ms. Whether Christie wrote it the way. I would rather end up in prison!
