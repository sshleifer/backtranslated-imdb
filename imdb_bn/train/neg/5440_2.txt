I was a lot more fan of Lin Pitterson fan in 1988's blockbuster film "Far North" and although I liked him in another photo "Slov" (2004) where he played "Francis", but far and wide The role is far away <br /> <br /> Lynn, I'm sure you all know (or should), play an important role of "driver". Unfortunately, I am afraid of the extraordinary performance of other lines that it is not going to go too much for this movie. <br /> <br /> Wait a second thing - the amazing creativity of the edit to eliminate superstition for TV viewers. . Memorable lines such as: "You son of a child!", "You children!", "Shoot!", And "Well, you've forgotten you!" <br /> <br /> OK. Bye <br /> <br /> PS: Does anyone know where I can get another Lin Peterson poster?
