This picture, though apparently a comedy, is critically serious. The issue is imperialism (with a capital): How Britain believes foolish, insulted, that it is still a great power after World War II. At home, the empire is driven by tragic dalt, the well-established Tories who are so deserving of the descendants that they can not distinguish close relatives; Government offices have long forgotten archives (a excavation in Orwellian paranoia?), Unsteady glasses and pre-room accommodation, where boring annotations in lounge read popular novels. <br /> <br /> Britain's old Pope abroad; But pomp thread bag and silk out of the background, especially when it embodied in bumbling twits. Carlton-Brown was an unimportant picture of disappointment, of which there was no lacrimose rot, which beat the imperialist imperialist jewelry in the hand. <br /> <br /> This film also acknowledges the cold war, boldly that it is a dangerous Farce, whose participants deserved desperate and humiliation, fear and respect. Colonialism, colonialism, more marked by negligence than irrationality, destroys colonies, their advantages, power, and the most important, self-respect, weaken them in the techniques of dangerous cowboys. <br /> <br /> Of course it is seriousness, that it kills. It is not understood that weights can not be treated in the comedy - Morgan Crick's character, Dr. Stranglebove and The Life of Brian proved this to all. Indeed, someone may suggest that serious themes should be treated only by comedy - it allows for a clear sighting. <br /> <br /> The Carlton-Brown problem is more important than comics only. , So that it becomes weight and unfunny. In the above three films, most comedy character reacts from the extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. Here, the script is very poor to maintain rich comic characters and sometimes the greatest comedy genius of all time - Peter Sellars, Terry-Thomas, Raymond Huntley and John Le Mesurier - have been criminally lost. <br /> <br /> Thomas - Thomas, glorified many times, shows that he can not manage the lead parts, and he needs to play nervous, arrogant, tiedless, not toffs. The music is made to carry most comedy, but its massive satire draws attention to the lack of humor on the screen. (Most of the British comedy, which was fierce and low-quality, Bullying often tried to create points by mutes and compositions, through filming, Montage and composing), Hantley directs genuine smile and creates it <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Carlton-Brown, who believes that democracy and military- It seems to be opposition. I'm not sure that this was not the purpose, but if you are able to give priority on comic intelligence and film forms, then these errors are bound to happen.
