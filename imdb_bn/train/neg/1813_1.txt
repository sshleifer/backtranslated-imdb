If a person really wants to make real movies then the bad movie "Wizards of the Lost Kingdom" actually measures the true Temple, which can measure the depth of evil. Start with pseudo-chelcha starting with <br /> <br /> The main character ... Some poor schmuck in an elegant white "furry" costume seems to have been stitched together from pieces to cancel the carpet. Slowly, painfully, with more extraordinary effects that completely deny viewers suspension suspension. Add a garden gnome (just for it's hack). <br /> <br /> The second thought, this movie completely go away and find something else for one and a half hours.
