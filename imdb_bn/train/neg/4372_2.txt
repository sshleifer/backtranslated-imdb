I love Don Knotts, just tell me that front! He is an outstanding talent and best for what he does, a nervous, lovingly rendered victim is thrown into the position of the authorities. Roll Flaming, The Reelctant Astronaut, he's imagined in this role, but the film is quite nasty, really, though my brother and I are happy to see this and his other films. It's still viewable, but it's really a movie that is best enjoyed by children. I'll classify it as 100% family-friendly and something you can sit down and meet your kids with family kids. <br /> <br /> With all the notes movies, there is a great cast of the favorite character, and you can not laugh, but when it comes to notes one of its cone, open-cell phone stereo, it does not matter how old you are and zed. <br /> <br /> From an adult perspective, I think that this one is amazing about this picture. How did it take NASA in the 1960's - all new modern buildings, hope, optimism, future! And I was surprised when Leslie Nilsen was so pleased and studied. Ray's love interest is only the love of Reuters, but rather the hole, the extraordinary woman, who can not give it until the big shot is made - if you are like me, you expect that she will leave the holidays to the end. Be careful - you'll do the theme tune for several days after watching, it's interesting.
