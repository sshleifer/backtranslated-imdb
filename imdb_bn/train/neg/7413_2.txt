Not just looking, I could not say that I was fascinated. <br /> <br /> It's pretty good, such a movie is visible and the atmosphere gives a wonderful feeling. But in the end when the first lordly giant appeared. You can not recognize them from the band lord, but they are seriously damaged in the movie. With the twin jacket and peacocks, the monsters of the Day of Judgment are like 80. <br /> <br /> <br /> Like the story, it starts like the same horror movies, people trapped inside a hell hole. But there is no clear story about why and what is happening. The viewer is throwing some lines for possible reasons, but never met the line and end up something without a mess. <br /> <br /> With all the money spent on this movie, with a playful start and some good effects, I had to think that nobody would take good care of the product. I wonder how the Lord could prove to this movie that their clothes could be awesome (not without them). <br /> <br /> So the movie gets credits for visuals, I guess the money will go anywhere. But the rest are embarrassed to make a rock band for the creation of their on-stage giant Elias Square.
