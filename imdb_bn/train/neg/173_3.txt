A decent sequel, but do not pack the original punch. A murderer screenwriter (Jude Nelson) took a new identity to manage his own novel, Cabin By the Lake. Still ruthless killings, but the movie seems very tongue-cheeky. No humor is funny. The total project seems to be a quickie quality and sometimes Nelson is the way to the top. Recording a script before going to the screen ... it happened with this script.
