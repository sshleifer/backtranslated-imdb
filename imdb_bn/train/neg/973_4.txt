This is generally the melodramatic Bollywood movie that has become unusually popular with Western critics. The script is comical, the actress is up, and it's sparkling. The only reason to watch this soap opera is the screening of legendary singer and legendary Mina Kumar. Seeing the sick actress while filming and the film will be released at the age of 40, she will have her own death, the same train has the same attraction as breaking. Her former husband, Amro, wrote and directed, but lacks the ability to work well. Bollywood has produced many good films.
