<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you see it as a comedy, you will find that most of the humor is flat and just hair <br /> <br /> If it is romance then you will be surprised why a person is such a b ** f! <br /> <br /> <br /> If you see this as an action, you can not really drag the Hunini hero. <br /> <br /> You can see this movie which fails to deliver distant entertainment. As mentioned, the monsters were obvious dolls and this film had another attempt at a Gremlins type movie. This is however the style that has the worst looking monsters. Critters looked pretty good, so the Ghoulies, puppies from munchies even dogs looked better than this. The characters of this picture are fairly unlikely. The hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a traffic friend who has a brawl military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. At one point in the movie, the hero and the military fight with the ray ... this movie is simply stupid. They are terrific club skams (which is probably not a club, but more likely to be a diner) they like the scene and tell the hero waitress that there is none of them 21. Give me a break, I'm 25 years old and I see them younger than them.
