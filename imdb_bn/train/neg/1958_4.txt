Where to start. It seemed like something like the movie "Darkness fruit" rip-off. An old, stupid woman lives in wood, giving children gifts for their teeth. Sound familiar? Then change it. In "The Darkness Fruit", if you have seen him, the tooth fairy only kills you. This film does not matter what kind of fairy do you kill. Why do they need Holi, her hippy girlfriend or bust and their sister? I think the movie will be fine without them. It seems that the producers are sitting around and have decided that they will have to keep additional people in the movie, so toothpish will be killed. Although, a beautiful blonde girl looks beautiful to see that is not being painted as a bubble-head for a change. It's okay to rent, but I would not recommend buying it.
