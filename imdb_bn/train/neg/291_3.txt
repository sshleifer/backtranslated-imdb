The film version of Sandra Bernard's one-woman off-Broadway show is fomenting. Sandra spoofs work in lounges and superstars, but his ideas of hatred are only fitfully attractive, and fun fun. His fans will say that he is tragically honest, and it can be true. But he is not incomplete for this film in this style, incomplete with your face brutally. She does not want to be beautiful - and she certainly does not make friends - and that's always going to rub many people in the wrong way. But if you meet half of him, then his material is seriously lacking here. Filmmaker Nicholas Drug has acted as executive producer and although not directed by his directorial, the film has its pepper, distinct signature style. Written by John Boskovich writes Bernhard; Their peculiar touch was to show the audience totally annoying in the Sander's room - a feeling many real visitors would probably share. * **** to 1/2
