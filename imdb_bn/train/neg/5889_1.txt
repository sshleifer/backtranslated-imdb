After all, I firmly believe that Norwegian movies are continuously getting better. From the boring movies of 80s and 80s of the 70's, movies from this place actually started great humor. Imagine ... the real comedy has been created! Films really started to be entertaining and fun, which was long, dark, depressing and boring. <br /> <br /> In the mid-90s and 200s, many great films were produced by a new generation of filmmakers. After the movie, the film praised critics and played load loads. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Never But the matter is ... we think it's funny. Because we are using Norwegian movies to be funny. Especially with some really fun comedians with a cast like this. But they do not say anything funny! Where's the humor? Show me laugh! Wonderful clerk at Harald Yay? Is it fairly unrealistic football coach? Is it commented by Ern Scheie? The movie is not just funny! <br /> <br /> But it's not my main gem for United. That is the predictability of that. (And here I am afraid that Norwegian comedy has seen it in a number of movies.) Always when you are going to finish it right then you think. All the characters are exactly as they are presented at the beginning of the film, and everyone decides to end up. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, this is a movie Which made me realize that we probably need some new blood to make the film in Norway ... <br /> <br /> Ratings: 1/6
