... from this horror movie! There are many mistakes in this movie, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. It is extraordinary that some peaks and proves to be completely bad. Music! Notice that I have two composers listed. It must be why every single frame of the worst "D" movie style drill must have music. They never heard of "less than" the expression. It was so painful to hear, every time I was in the conversation, the sound was silent, that the dialogue was good. You will feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they do not see this kind of role in their carrier's evening. See it at your own risk.
