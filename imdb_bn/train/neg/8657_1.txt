Now I am not the lover of B movie itself but this part of the trash has humiliated me to the end. The first film showed the brother of Leigh McGuie as a boring little baby who is looking for his lost dog dogs. Now, what kind of a fool's mistake is that I ask you for a fraction of a three-headed dog for harmful crocodiles? And why did he give another thing to think about why he showed the denocrococcus behind the movie and actually in the water box? I believe if the memory spends 2.6 minutes in water and is only 6 feet long, it is a heart broken. But finding the quality of this movie is so bad that I almost smiled because I think bad acting has made me want to die. But the fact is that this thing is again made by another military test site to train super narcotics for military warfare or something like that from the E.V.I.L Corporation of the temple, something like the creator And do not forget the characters, we see that we are # 1 stopped, men and half of the decent chick (who do not know how to work), as I lead the women, I say outside! The only thing was bad, the acting was over, the heroes spent two hours and spent a few long-term plans to kill Denkroak, and it can be killed normally, with seconds to come up with about 15 seconds. All of these films were out of gay with its random opera music in all the backgrounds, and in fact it was the highest guest of all CGI monsters that were originally made for bullets and bombs (otherwise it would have been made for the military DUH!). When Leiji McGuire's brother moved to Shakele and Dinkroop could clear the word for his head. I believe that you will stop shooting yourself in the eyes to see the denocross. And as a director I believe that we will have to get more people to hang him by an ammunition, and until we die we will have to kick them all in the crash. Bus
