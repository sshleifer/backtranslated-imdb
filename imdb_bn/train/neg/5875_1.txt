In this film, Fred Williamson, (McDaringer) and Gary Busier (Leny) meet two former football players who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of women and men with some bad backgrounds. Mac Deringer works on telephone conversations by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer). Jennifer is being threatened by an inventor who wants to do something terrible and she asks for her help, along with many other women. Mac and Lenny spend more time in their hands and often Miami, Flow. Hang out in the golf course or sports bar where all kinds of things are going on in the cities. There are many fifties, killings and double money terms that bring this movie to a bigger zeros. Do not waste your time, this movie cost me only 50 cents and it was too much.
