Ivan Reitman is something of a savior. The most tired plot (Ghostbusters, Evolution) comes to life with his handsome skill. Even occasionally flop (six days, seven nights) shows signs of life and humor which makes it valuable. So I was disappointed that Reitman could not accept a fairly original plot (Man Dump Superhero, superhero super-power revenge) and it took some form of enjoyable. "Girlfriend" is an exercise in the dexterity. After the first 20 minutes, the tooth split into pieces. The film can not determine whether to be a romantic comedy or a superhero drama. As a result, both flip-flop is a film, which is not done very well. Uma Thurman is always prominent, and Luke Wilson also stops his role, even though his slammer antics quickly get tired. Even more interesting, in some scenes (like when Uma hits a headboard through a wall), you scream and screaming for a wicked, cruel Retman Manually. But after a few seconds, the magic is lost, the superheroine goes as fast as the movie is frustrating almost everywhere.
