Looking forward to seeing this picture and seeing this great actor perform. However, I was sadly disappointed with the whole plot of the script and the story. David Duchowy, (Dr. Eugène Sands), "Connie and Carla", 04, was a doctor in this story who would lose his license to practice medicine using a drug. Dr. Sands visited a night club and was able to use his medical experience to help an injured customer, and assisted by Angelina Jolie (Clare), "Taking Lives", 04, who was immediately attracted to Dr. David Sands. Timothy Hutton, (Raymond Blossom), "Kinsi", "04", Big Shot Gangster and a man with all kinds of money and connections. Timothy Hatton believes that he has played in most of the scenes and his mind completely disappears to prevent his gang members from being killed. Gary Dordan, (Yeats), "CSI-Vegas TV Series" plays a great supporting role and portrays the true COOL DUDE, the so-called bodyguard of Raymond Blossom. Angelina Jolie draws attention from all the men who look beautiful and sexy with her ruby ​​red lips. This image is not the greatest, but it gives entertainment.
