I had to give this image 1 because it was bad, but I do not think that I did not enjoy watching because I laugh and smile, even I had some questions. Half of the time I started to laugh, half the time I was saying, "What's going on in hell?" Or "why would anyone do this?" et cetera I mostly blurred the fires of the mountains, the style of the 80's naked scenes / war / dialogue / naked scenes, and the way they ride their horses, the sword of the warrior blows in the air. And there have been some vague models (who are not supposed to be the actual trees, they?) And I still do not realize that they find the cave, is he hell? A friend of mine told me about this movie and I thought I would try it, and I really liked the movie like Ed Wood, I had no real enjoyment that I saw the meaning of this movie. My own sunny way So if you really think it was an action movie, do not confuse it, I like it for other reasons. It's a lot worse than Evil Dead, so it really can make you feel that you are ruining your life by seeing it (which comes to me several times). I think most people have to have some drinks, some friends and have to laugh in this picture. Maybe it's a little hard, but I do not think so, rent it and you'll see it. Yo.
