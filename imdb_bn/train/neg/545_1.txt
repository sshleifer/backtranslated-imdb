This is simply the common Indian rubbish that turns into film, as Indians, we can proudly say that our biggest film industry, but this is also the worst. <br /> <br /> How realistic in other poor countries, the real challenges challenge their respective society and we only continue pumping junk. Keep an eye on Russia, Iran, China and Latin America, see great movies with them and we'll get shit like a kidnapping !! <br /> <br /> To get the real people, it is no surprise that international community is generally Indian cinema.
