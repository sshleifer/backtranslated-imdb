Yesterday I came here for a review before deciding to sit in front of a TV movie, and those I found it find it irrelevant. <br/> <br /> <br /> For the first time, there must be standing in front of this housewife's movie of the day. Performance rigor, in every sentence, housewife movies and bad soap operas are such an attempt at 'mad', and this is the basis of the expected and well-placed determination that men (especially soldiers) must be violent and violent. incompassionate The whole film is clear in some moments about the 'drama', when male characters threaten to develop second dimension. <br /> <br /> Be careful if this seems to be tolerable (or even enjoyable) to you. Linda Hamilton's German pronunciation is quite good, painful, misleading - like her face, for some reason. Other performance There is no doubt that the lasting source of embarrassment for their angry people, with the increasingly thin and obvious character of the day. There are a few surprises, but keep an eye on the continual supply of food and drink from the 'nontaxes' of the 'Hungry Pythonos' endless hungry soldiers! <br /> <br /> I'm not expecting action, but I've hoped to be beautiful or textural or mentally charged. What I found is that of a particularly bad Christmas 'feeling' story that will narrow an intelligent audience with its miserliness. <br /> <br /> Under these running conditions see: 1: There is nothing else. 2: You're a fond of 'Housewife Men and Win' predictions and TV fiction 3: When you turn Hollywood into feature film, you can appreciate the real story. 4: You're dirty enough to think that your emotions are easily excited by the available conversations.
