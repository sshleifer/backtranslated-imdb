I have always said that some plays of their nature can not be translated only into movies, and this is a prime example. <br /> <br /> As a game, it is a very funny adventurous mockery of Catholics. Charger, a chaos intelligence and a central character, which is so unrealistic, we must root our way for the killing of his parishion (one of which has made a grave mistake by acknowledging that he did not sin from his last confession) he is sending him directly to heaven) . <br /> <br /> Outside the reality of this theater and beyond what reality, the theater believes the world, it works. However, such a higher reality rarely works on the film, and it certainly is not here. <br /> <br /> Director Marshall Brickman did a great job, who did great work, but realizing this disagreement, the fashion comedy becomes tragedy and your emotions are empty feeling. Look <br /> <br /> instead of a production of stage play, you will not be disappointed.
