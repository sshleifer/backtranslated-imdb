Normally I gave this movie 6. This is a very important issue and it does relatively well - despite Katie Wright, it is a success in itself and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is actually directed to run such a character or Naturally, it has been provoked, but it did a great job by making it impossible for Lexie to take care of. He does not have any other dimension than how confused, helpless and stupid, and how well he shouts. I can understand how a young person blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose food disorder moves beyond control, it can be frightened, frightened and painful. However, Right's full performance is based on constant crying and sniveling, leaving the rest of the quarrel. I could not help but the problem of this special girl was not by the giant that Bulimia did, but she did not have a backbone. I'm very doubtful that movie movie is meant.
