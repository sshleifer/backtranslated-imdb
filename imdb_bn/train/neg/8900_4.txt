I like the first movie, but it is a textbook example which was a good example of a signal which was left on the drawing board. There was a general idea in the first film, if not superb but at least very interesting. This signal tries to create the first film based on the concept and character, and even though Christopher Walken is still good like Gabriel, but the whole idea suddenly becomes ridiculous. If you do not see any of these movies, get the first movie and forget them, they can remove all the joy from the original.
