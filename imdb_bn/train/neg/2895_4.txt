This movie has been released in the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miraculous fabric that is not frustrating. But the film failed to fail it. Instead of padding it for 45 minutes, it is noodling near a promotion before the big discovery. Since the audience does not benefit from seeing an intelligent child finding things, it is a strange favorite: the film prevents you from being attracted to any topic. Once the fabric was discovered, the film was established very quickly, and both artists wanted to discover the discovery of large and blue-collar colleagues, leaving the film with only two radioactive movements; Chemical innovation, and running from the oppressors. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why anyone would describe it as a comedy. Tone is not funny or ridiculous. This is a day of serious social criticism: capitalism that provides both supply and production. Which instead prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, this is probably true, but if someone does not deal with the real view, the film is simply a sincere argument. Here you will want a very broad definition of any joke. <br /> <br /> It's more like John Dawn of British Britain (see Nigel Doe?).
