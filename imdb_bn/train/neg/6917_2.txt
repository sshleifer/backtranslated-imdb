Again, the same familiar story about a man (writer here) that sells the soul to Satan to achieve his most desired ambition of life: success. Unfunny script (we will "go home and write well"), ridiculous line "strong" "Christmanish" message (love our sole desire of life, respect and love to find a good friendship) and understand a very long trial Agent Hopkins Saturn (which Jennifer Love Hewitt is no sexy or not evil) for all the bad things made for the unlikely character. Bad attempts from actors (Ballwood also did not play the role of Catrot in the role of director and "Sex and the City", with some strange lines in its limited role, the Icod). Try also a popular movie from Greece, which is known as "Alimono Stos Nace", a great transformation of this legend (An old man gives his soul to Satan to get back his young man)
