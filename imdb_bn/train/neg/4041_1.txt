Wearing a hair shirt. Positively, absolutely, no doubt one of the worst movies ever without a shadow. Pure torture Zero big out of ten. A long, tiring, hard-working, persuasive, self-conscious, dramatic, and after-the-headed arts scene. Intend to be dreamlike and impressionistic, the soul bared, instead, moz moz. <br /> <br /> Half-nude, parents and boys shout to each other like a lover. The "Homo-erotic" point, high and clear. OK, so what? <br /> <br /> The boy repeatedly said, "The life of the saints," "Father's love is crucified." A loving boy lets himself crucify. God and His Son, Parallel to Christ, Heavy handover, irrelevant and bomber like all other things here. <br /> <br /> Some reference points include the theme of the Russian Siberia: "Mother and Sona" (1997); "The Return" (Andrii Giggattsev, 2003); "Little Odessa" (James Gray, 1994); Turgenev, "Parents and boys"; And, of course, Dostoyevsky, "Brothers Karamajov". <br /> <br /> Credits in English indicate international distribution, that is, to understand this mess, you can not be used as an excuse for Russian. <br /> <br /> This is not the end of Sakaruv, near or compulsory as "Russian Ark" (2003). <br /> <br /> Equally powerful, as its "mother and son", some scenes are distorted from distorted mirrors, although not as interesting. The film is almost exclusively, starting from the beginning of the seed filter, it makes the scene dramatically flexible. A soft-focus blur is only adding to the brutal feeling. <br /> <br /> An annoying soundtrack drone is never closed like a tap loop. An old radio drama continuously in the background. The Russian romantic maliciously "swells endlessly as themes based on Chyakovsky." In the presence of "Sound Designer" (Sergei Moskov), it is obvious that those tiny words, radio static, noise, distortion, and all such "are designed" <br /> <br /> It's hard to believe that anyone (Sergei Popepov) actually wrote this thing. It seems arbitrary, like all traffic, as inspired by indifferent actors, coming out of some restlessness. <br /> <br /> The modern industry has finally succeeded in conveying the thing without disclosing it, so that what we see is the concept of the idea, empty like a shell, but not the shell, only the idea of ​​the shell. One may ask for a better definition of frustration?
