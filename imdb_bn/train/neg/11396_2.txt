The cheap erotic horror, Master of the Rolf Kneifsky, finally creates a movie that does not go directly to the Playboy channel. "Hamming" takes a lot of money from Elm Street before Evil Dead's nightmare, but it still manages to do so with enough humor to make it visible only. Characters are cardboard, conversation wood, the story is thin-thin and the actors can not get out of the groceries. All that together and you have a pulpy ball to watch for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm annoyed, I like to eat paper. Very good to see this movie. Chew it for 90 minutes and leave a strange taste and no nutritional value in your mouth.
