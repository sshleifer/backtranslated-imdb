I'm a big fan of Stooges's slapstick, but I find interesting in their history. I have recently tried to check out Stooge era stuff, but the chance to see Joe Shorts does not seem easy to come; Someone says that mental problem with Joe-Shorts is not really Joe's fault, and I suspect that this is the case. Joe as actor is far from the worst thing about this. The thing that bothers me most is mentioned in another comment: Other jokes against third parties violate comedy-team / stogues whole. Perhaps the zoop style is charged, those who are not really good - though there was no real closed-camera collision between him and others - and it was the way to work around it. <br /> <br /> And with this title and what are some of the other late stages shorts? Certainly there is lack of creativity; Is the cause of drying of the shorts market or the cause of anybody?
