Very rarely I saw talent such an gratuitous waste. Almost nothing to say about this frustrating lapse of a film is not constructive. Some interesting strands of film seem to promise to be a little more than initially red-haring. Comedy Actor - Robert Duval, Robert Doney, Jr. - plays a role in any role; Sometimes a gifted director creates a movie that is portrayed through a coffee-stained camera lens; A writer (John Grisham) who did not create anything of merit, he discovered a new depth of uninterrupted inconsistency. It has a cheaper, impressive feel about the film - but in briefly at the level of speech - it is the real part of the aesthetic. Generally, I came to write balanced, generally complimentary comments on IMDB. This serious disaster in a photo just wants me to produce an endless, bilious rant. I do not, but only because I do not want to grab my "mind" with this garbage.
