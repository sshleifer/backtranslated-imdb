I can not think of how this bad one can get a budget for a movie. It's like TV station, something frustrating for everything. They bury under a bunch of ice, the electricity gets burnt and closed, but there is a background light that is constant in the magical way. Where does this (mesh) come from the light? That's all that stupid bickering between characters, and characters. Instead of trying to find ways to survive, they seem to be more interested in each other's complaints. It tries to help the emergency and the people. But because it's such a bad indication and acting, you will not fix your Florence Nightingale with this flicker, sorry. I'm joining negative feedback, and I agree with one of the worst movies together.
