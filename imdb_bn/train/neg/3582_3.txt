No, it's not a horror movie ... it's actually a love story. <br /> <br /> <br /> The color is a silent film which comes in two boxers and the women that are among them. She loves boxer known as "one round" jack. He loves him until the champion comes along, that is. Although he got married in one round, he started strongly with the champions from one round and the champion's climatic final boxing fight. He came back to the corner of a round, only when things got to see him slowly, and he miraculously found inner strength to win the war and loved his wife. <br /> <br /> This photo was very early in the hit career, but the restriction of time does not have to make him a permanent film. Although there are special film techniques and some comedy relief, this movie does not hold any of its next work. Although it was extremely extreme for adulterous adulterers in a time-bound manner. It may have been drawn in 1927. While searching through these old movies, I think they can be reprinted on today's screen and will really be closed. Maybe I want to be one .... <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie if you are planning to watch all the hits. You can sleep in the middle
