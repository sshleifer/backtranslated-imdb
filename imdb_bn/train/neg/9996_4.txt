Although the production and the order of Jerry James are contained in a specific development, "Airport" is not much better than the "Airport 1975": the time when submitting a garbled, commercial waste (literally this) is a modest cast. Jack Lemon is a packed airport pilot who is a thief And was kidnapped by crashes in the sea (all the publicity claimed it was near the Bermuda Triangle When there is no reference to the film), when the rescue vessel comes out to raise the water outside the water, we can see all the cranes in the sea (rather blindly) and have difficulty smiling (imagination of aircraft, passenger and waterproof screws). Injection with the effect of a "Gilligan Island" episode with all the remedies - Most Flashbacks - Lowers One hour was seen as "the director's cut" with extra footage. The most exciting moment is the plane crash and some players feel a little funny: Lee Grant is a humiliating drunk, Brenda Vacador, a nonsense stewardess, Joseph Cotton and Olivia de Haviland flirting old boys . Despite this, personality conflicts and exciting military details, look at your patience eventually. ** **** to
