This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of rare films which are not fully understood. There are two routes on the horror films: You're not explaining what's actually happening (or those who kill the killer, like Texas Censo genocide) or characters giving a lot of back story and character so that everything is explained (Halloween probably could be an example) <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the crop fails in this area. I completely see no reason to give a small hole in the story behind Craig without capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. No character was fully realized, although the circular nature of Kate's character in the film is the most successful part of the story. Finally, this story is largely unsupported and does not give any performance, it is interesting enough to encourage life or to overcome the lack of background, and is attractive enough to make films. <br /> <br /> This movie is another example of a movie (as the most), it would not be so great even though that might be a lot better. The only thing that was used correctly in the film was setting: Characters, stories, aspects, and overall writing could benefit from a serious mouth lift. <br /> <br /> Creeps serve a purpose like mind, stupid horror movies with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it ...
