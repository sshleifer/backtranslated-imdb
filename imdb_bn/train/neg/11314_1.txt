This movie is probably the worst I've seen. Bad acting, bad scripts, everything bad It compares mainly to two other movies in the same genre, and interesting at almost the same time. Both Cyborg (Van Dam, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are both much better and more powerful in story and direction, and it's still Albert Pine who has ordered these two! <br /> <br /> The story is not original. The world has probably become a terrific place because of an environmental disaster or atomic war, and people live in medieval conditions. A special species of robots (cyborgs) live in the blood and there is a story ... the cyborgs have to get many people to meet "prophecy" and people need someone to stop them. A robot created by the creator of Cyborg (Chris Christopherson), together with a daughter, was appointed to save mankind. <br /> <br /> In this movie the director tried to see some Hong Kong stylish war scenes with the participants. Flying high and leaping away. <br /> <br /> I recommend this picture with the sole reason that most people will get a new "worst" movie. And for the continuous fans I recommend "cyborg" because I think it's a very humorous movie with a very high entertainment factor. And if you can not stand in the van dame see "sample". <br /> <br /> I rated this image 1/10.
