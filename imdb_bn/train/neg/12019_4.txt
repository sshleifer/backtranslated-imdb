For "Mr. Scripps" I read several good reviews on this board, but whoever has been unmanned by the Italian gangster film, like himself, the picture probably made a very small idea. Indeed, after the initial deployment of the 10 million Lira scams, the image was given a fairly regular vengeance with a small twist in the introduction of the character of Rick (Al Cleaver). With the addition of Vicenzo Napoli (Vitorio Capralli), my whole gang war plot was awakening for me, but most of the viewers commented that he gave the film a life with its often viable attempt at violence. I was somewhat unbelievable that Monjari's gangsters did not push Tony back on the road, even Tony did not even touch them. For the creation of all of them as a title character, Jack Palance instead of titles to work in the United States, rather than "Mr. Scarface", was awakened in an anticlimatic finale rather awkwardly. I've seen enough spaghetti Westerns that they do not work at all; I guess in this case, my first appearance of Spaghetti Gangster Flick is not quite like it.
