"I watched this movie last night and I do not think that I would think the same about the actors involved, because this movie will be behind my mind." <br /> <br /> The above statement can be thought of as a good or bad thing. I think every time I see Tom Cruise or Demi Moore in the movie, then I think "a very good man" which is a good thing. Now, every time I see Ron Perlman or Crusty Swanison, I'll think of "tincastown" which is a very bad thing. <br /> <br /> I thought it could be some intelligent or at least make me. With Chicken and Ari Gross and the previous Swanson and Perlman, I thought it would not be the least bad. The film can be made in Heili's budget budget, Indiana (where is it?), But they might use every dollar to make good movies. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is not funny or entertaining in any word. It just lasts for about 84 seconds and annoying. <br /> <br /> letter paper thin. You often do not care about letters, and since Lead is the author of Hollywood with two dreams, it is a dream you need to know about two struggling writers who wrote this article. Well, two real authors know all about the screen versions themselves, so they illustrate the audience. They do not even think about the development of character, instead of trying to type the story again "Giligan Island". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is unreasonable. Two live in a storage center, where one of them saves the bed and there are about 20 people living there. The rest of the story talks and stupid. Did you see "National Lampon's favorite deadly sin"? The second story with Joe Montagna is a television writer who can not find a good story to produce a TV movie, so she made one. Now the television writer is the screen writer, Morph Montagna, half-boring actors, and to withdraw the comedy and you have this movie. <br /> <br /> Actors try. Christie Swanson is in the movie for 10 minutes and is still the best actor in the film. She is still hot, but she will help if she would make the CAMEOS continuously instead of AR in a movie. For everyone else, I do not think it was a fault of the actors because they have BAD ingredients <br /> <br /> Watch the National Lampoon movie, but stay away from this movie.
