I can not be a great fan of the original "Creeps", but its tragic Siegelty is like a myth! And to think I'm hoping this one more choice. Five years after the predecessor, George Romero returned to the EC troupe of EC Comics and was in love for Steve King's three stories. However, the order has been transferred to Michael Gurney. The film mostly fails with Gurney's unfinished brush in that outlook. But most of the blame Romero will have to go horribly static and unwanted scripts (especially flowing through the first and final story in that dialogue). Morality messages (which come from an impressive bunch of mostly characters) simply accept black humor. Oh, it was painful and could also be said about the lively music score matched with the film. Together with three stories (Old Chief Woodenhead, The Rafting and HitHicher), a light, strange and effective wrap-up story in Nostalgia (80s) animation form. I liked this segment and had a shining light in the character of wisecracking creeps. <br /> <br /> # The first story "Old Chief Woodenhead" sees two old owners (George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamor) of a common shop in a dead local community of dead dead communities. Be looted and finally die for killing some vertebrates. In front of the shop there is an Indian head wooden statue that comes to live for revenge of their death. <br /> <br /> - Listen to George Kennedy Waffle ... and spend 10 minutes about how much he is committed to his 'great' community. What nice disguise time is. Well, just like Kennedy lectures, it is a continuously colorless and excessive item that never makes good for the good courtyard. The overbearing scripts are plain inane and the performance is therefore suitable. These two reasons really add to my headache. When Indians are alive and take revenge, then they are very quick (severe) death in proper fashion. The effect has been done pretty well, but that's about free streaming hair. How to knock that lock back on Hollywood? Esse! <br /> <br /> #The second story "The Roughts" is a group of doping smokers and Yahoo girls follow the title until a secluded lake. After swimming in the middle of the lake, they were trapped in the platform in search of the unexpected creature hiding in the water. <br /> <br /> - Now a lot better, a lot better. Your basic teenager starts running excuses, which becomes a mysteriously weird set up, which is full of tight and clustrophobic tension. And it's not even coped out on the flashing of nudity or satirical splatter. It is quite morbid and that humor goes for its ideas. Amazing satirical end It has a beautiful touch. Performance from Nobodies is acceptable without a huge sign. Gornick's direction is nasty and stick next to Gooey. However, on this occasion the score of dangerous music presses the right chords. Like a lake, such as water bodies (as mentioned by many) a black-and-white watermelon (yes you're just reading it!) Seems floating in the water. <br /> <br /> # ends with three "hits". A wealthy, but sexually transmitted woman is on her way to returning home after being with Gigolo, but she is late. If necessary, thinking of explaining Latinology, he closed the road and accidentally hit the hit. Instead of getting check or help, she hoped to return home to her husband. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> This one was so different in this one tone compared to the first two and instead of trying the funny bone lizard. Lois Chiles was right in the main role, but the strong optimism he had and little conversations with himself were desperately agitated and tired. The animated make-up effect is well displayed and drip with vision. When he hits the beat, it is violent, fatty, and his execution is executed. Since then we continually hear and revise our supposed dead hitchhiker ?? And the line repeats, "Thanks for the ride lady!" During this time he decided to run on it. There is a little courtesy to the dead darling. Finally, the second little story "The Roughts" and unexpectedly, fantastic effects inspire this very inferior suqql.
