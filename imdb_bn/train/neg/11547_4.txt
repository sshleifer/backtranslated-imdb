What type of t * t? Power Rangers vs Freddy? It was visible and as good as the first movie at the beginning, but from the part where the plays got super powers in their dreams, it started to be a child. This sh * t should be rated instead of PG or PG-13. I was hoping to see some very mature material but it was only for 1/3 of the film. For the rest of the kids. Plus it is very focused on Christianity. I know Freddy is a giant but there are many religions that have demons in many ways to fight demons. Why would it always be Christian? It is filled with total Orientalism and the superiority of white men / Westerners. 'Do not show this to the little kids who love electricity rangers.
