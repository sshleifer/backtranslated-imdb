I had mixed fillings about the "documentary" of the Puerto Rican dynasty. At first I am sorry that Mrs. Perez Sen compared Campo to Che Guevara. Just a point, Mr. John LezuZimo is not a descendant of Puerto Rican Her father came from Colombia. Anyone who did this research was not very right. I think our nation depends on the future education. This message should have been realized throughout the film, education is freedom and strength is our way. I think it should focus on the future of any of these production teams. In my opinion, this movie was directed towards anti-American sentiment.
