My life is about saving animals. I do volunteer work with a cat rescue agency. I can not even kill an animal to protect my life because I am a vegetarian. I could not even kill a spider, I kept it out. Where the child dies, when the birds throw stones, the scene takes part in the effort of being adopted by other children, makes me sick and has been afraid of me ever since. It only believes that people are kind and compassionate for their recognition. Last - Parents accept the listening ear - the animal does not free the screenplay of cruelty. Why does anyone want their child to see this picture?
