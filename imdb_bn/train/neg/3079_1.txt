My favorite quote from Croo was when the car was going out of the mountain, "The movie was so bad, somebody wants to get out of it!" <br /> <br /> This was the most fun movie. Have ever seen It was terrific there you fear, which makes it even funnier! If this mystery is not for science theater, I will not stay here today! :-P
