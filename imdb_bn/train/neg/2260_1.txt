Oh dear, Jerry could be King without Talkos, but the movies play completely different balls, and he has gone out of his league. The script for this film is so poor that it can be believed and it is sad to see strange known actors like Michael Dudicoff (80's Action - BVV King), Michael Jai White (seen yesterday Flip Flow). ?? Spons ') as well as games of service' William McNamer (who is involved in only half the fun of the whole movie!) Got bent for this job. If you are a fan of Zeri, then stay in the TV show because it is a total waste and one and a half hours. When I sat down at the moment, I could catch Rocky 5's last half-hour on TV, which was like a fine industrial way like a movie, it seems like saying enough !!! <br /> <br /> <br />
