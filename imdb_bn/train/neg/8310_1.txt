Another big conspiracy film to try to blame the US government and the Armed Forces (especially the army) for every disaster from the Great Flood. Anyone who has ever spent time during the US military can see how this film is in the canals. Uniforms, tools, sets, and methods are all wrong (And of course, all senior officers are either corrupt criminals or total stupid people.) There is no effort to unleash bright campaigns. Most of the theories presented are disrespected in the last few years. Using every clich√©, rumors, and urban legends from the Gulf - all are presented as Gospel. (The truth is, some do not know why some GW is sick and healthy as other horses.) PS is not new to it. The fight is not fun and I know with some extremely deadly illnesses from WWII, Korean and Vietnam. (And the government has the responsibility to take care of everyone.) Such sensitivist films will not solve the problem!
