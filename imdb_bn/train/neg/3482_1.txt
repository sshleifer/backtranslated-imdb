So, I know I gave 1 out of 10 votes, but there are really no more than half of it stars. I hate it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can not believe any star sign up to make this ridiculously unreasonable project. <br /> <br /> James G and Catherine Oahah were nice in their character and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate was very good, but the story was crushed and I encourage anyone who sees it in the video store so they can not get it up and back Can not read the cover, but to go away ... I do not want to know about what's in the movie, because post-romance about it is too stupid. <br /> <br /> Do not hire this! It's awesome! Awesome!
