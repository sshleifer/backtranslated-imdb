Believe me, I like horror movies. I like science fiction movies I like independent films. And, I like low budget, B movies. <br /> <br /> Sometimes, I even played bad, plodding scripts, wooden lines, unimaginable situations, and similar choices. However, I do not like Christmas on Tuesday. <br /> <br /> It does not work so much. For all previously listed reasons, and much more. The woman's genitalia images include nonsensical, blatant use. And there are many conversations in male genitalia, very Freudian. <br /> <br /> I'm sure it's completely unknown. As opposed to trying something really different things. I think that a film that takes years in the film can not focus only on the level of solidarity and the focus of modern audiences. <br /> <br /> I hope the whole movie will be a dream only of a dream. However, sadly, this was meant to happen, we saw the things on the screen. <br /> <br /> The only greatness that I can express is that the picture is ultimately outstanding. In the beginning, if it is used, it eventually allows the film to close in late 2001 ... <br /> <br /> Instead of doing bad, they do not try. I was not so important about this picture that I had to make it. What was this plot? Of course, it can not be. What was it the letter? I suspect it; I want to say, I could live without telling about the ad 15. Is this the dialog? Brightly, no. Music? Possibly, but more likely the prospective instructor needs to be stroked up to disobedient ego. <br /> <br /> There are many good efforts in the cutting-room floor.
