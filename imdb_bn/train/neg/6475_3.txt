Although I have not been able to review the film in almost two years yet, I think the opinion that has lessened my opinion. After the love of the original Little Mary, and the child could be covered with mermaid, I decided that I would spend time sitting and looking for seagulls. <br /> <br /> Disney, I've got a little message for you. If you're not the main director and actors easy ... you just want to shake your butt. <br /> <br /> In this series, our story begins with a little Arri and her daughter, Melody. My first big issue was that Eric and other crew singing. Yes, I understand that Disney is big on singing and dance numbers, but really, it has made Eric my favorite princess. He was calm, collected, and knew a real gentleman who was fun. And he said. No <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Whenever we slug on the Ushula screen, how could we forget our thorns, which are both world and Ariel Scared? Unfortunately, that Gene did not pass his seemingly vain sister, Morgana. There was nothing, never said about Morgan in the first movie; He just pops out somewhere, trying to steal the baby. Oh, how beautiful A small sister is given a ticket and instead of going after the trident, she decides to kidnap a month old child. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> Her sister plans the same, same minions (who, in the way, do not be afraid of anyone.) I saw this movie while on my lap a three year old Was there, and he laugh hysterically.) He had no intention there; I saw my mother being a villain. I'm sure he did a better job than Little Miss Tys. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I started Scuttle, Sebastian and Flounder. In the first film, Triton was a strict but loving father, and secondly, like him, he lost the desire to panic in the hearts of his subjects. Scuttle, once a humorous relief that everyone laughs with his 'dingle-hopper'. (Yes, I will accept it; after that I've called my fork from Dingle-hopper since then). In this film, Scuttle has forgotten all about At first even a supporter character, he added something to the movie at least. He was rich with no odor to others, and in reply, they all took him away from him completely. Sebastian was still the same, but worried twice as before. Disney, do not do that Do not even try mess with our favorite crab. Or a little fat fishes of our choice, who became a father and crowded very annoying children. She's greasy, and she looks soft, and she looks like she's going to any other flat line. <br /> <br /> Waller and the Penguin were unneeded, and after a while, you just started to resent everyone. Especially Melody, who has no depth to it. <br /> <br /> And one of these days, Disney, I kick out of my life. <br /> <br /> If I do not love your original so much.
