I'm still trying to determine whether there was a point in this film. <br /> <br /> The issues that Maddox deliver to students are 'rebellious' and 'controversial'. Students seem to be vulnerably influenced by anti-authoritarian feelings and snippets of scribbled words in leaflets. Rebellious, everyone. <br /> <br /> I think, asking a teenage rebellious movie where a school fire alarm can not be set is too much to ask. <br /> <br /> <br /> 'A big fight at the football field' is a fight between two battles. <br /> <br /> Characters can change wildly randomly. Maddox was fighting a football joke (and later got a face-to-face mobile phone), all of which are very happy and the next day is asking for forgiveness. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They were cut to the maximum attempted pseudo-glit soundtrack.
