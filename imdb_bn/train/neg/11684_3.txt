This movie does not give any idea, there are enough plot holes to drive plenty of nypeed vehicles. Whatever the letters do not work in any way possible. I'll put my comments on the chat board, but save your time and money, it's stupid. Hollywood spent millions of dollars on flash bang tools and I could not stand by using fancy editing and cool music and even not bothered about being involved with even a basic level even with more than one basic level. But it is good to see Denzel W. Man, who came on three flavors, Jodie Foster, Mayor Bloomberg and Captain Van Traap. There is a sweet little baby with a video game, which is beautiful.
