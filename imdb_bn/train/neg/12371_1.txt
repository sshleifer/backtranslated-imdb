This movie may be great (because it has got a lovely compound) but it does not just go above the comedy. The acting was severely flawed and the moments where I cringed so serious that I thought I was going to read my seats in the theater. Do not ever see this glorious piece of mine anymore .... The Danish movie has got a lot of good PR in recent years but if this part crosses the border ... then I am not afraid that any dance film will never want to rent a Danish movie. Why I like to register this movie here. I really felt that I needed to remove people from this piece ... My sympathizers who went to the movies who had already gone to watch this movie went to them.
