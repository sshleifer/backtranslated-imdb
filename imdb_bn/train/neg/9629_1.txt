I wanted it free, thanks, and it was better than that, but it seems really foist over us in the last ten years which is really the same old stuff. <br /> <br /> A couple of those who compete with Ben Stella and Jennifer Anthony- and yet they are attracted to each other. <br /> <br /> That plot line does not surprise you and you do not thrill, the movie is not. <Br /> <br /> A lot of sight joke and fart jokes. Halfway through the film I realized that Ben Stiller was not really funny, but he tried very hard. And Jennifer Anniston is not that nice really, but her hair looks great. And Hans Azharia and Phillip Simo Hoffman have paid a lot of money to stay in this kind of average movie, I have come to expect more from them. It was interesting that I saw American Splendor after seeing it, which is really fun and original - and I compared the two to my head, and saw myself that movie executives would be forced to return to these two movies- Perhaps they will lose some of their ideas and <br /> <br /> they are better than unknown sources, Will start to create.
