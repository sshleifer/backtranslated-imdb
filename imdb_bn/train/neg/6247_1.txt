An uncomfortable fact is completely straightforward and incomprehensible, like the Tunigid slopes created by radioactive and stupid Republicans, it matches invisible lines until it tries to blur something in your face, that means we'll die in hundreds of years, which is already controversial, but who cautions By doing, people are selfish, destructive creatures, I undoubtedly extinction of people I for do not waste my time. I'll just call it a "natural progress". Let's start with all the rights, but at the same time, we should talk about the same intelligent, slogan politicians who encourage another "new society", okay, do not fool, we're all still controlled by the wealthy. And those who made the first place by misguided disaster. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In a large palace, cattle, tobacco, pig farming (which is methane Including gauges for gas traces), and those who know, exploitation, greed and its investments, along with many big controversial records, are the world's companies. I rarely think that this person has qualified for less fortunate lectures, but his talent is based on the opposition of another ridiculous political party, because on the other hand, he is making these horrifying characteristics of politicians and politicians cruel. Will this Bozo live in comfortable life and still he speaks poor people in Africa about crop cultivation and cutting and burning techniques? He travels around the world in first class seats in fuel disruption jets, uses a computer with a computerized documentary and still believes that everything is a "moral problem". He fully absorbed in his own confused nightmares, he said that he came to the conclusion that his sister (Tobacco-induced cancer and everything was due to the death of his son by an automobile). He fought against the tobacco company or proposed that the automobile would be banned because they were dangerous hulking machines? No Everything must be done in the "economy", so why is he different, he is not the answer. <br /> <br /> His lazy and exhausting efforts in human philosophies are violent, all while he is being portrayed in the forest or eschewing drunk life affirming quotes along a small river. Well, Mr. Gore, why do not you try to live like ordinary people? He is a politician, general and easy, he has invested in a structure of structure. My question is, why does not he focus on the world's powerful industrial countries which are responsible for most of the complexity? He does not do this because it will be stupid for "investment, stocks and corporations". <br /> <br /> Al Gore has given meaningless speeches on the documentary, which means the wealthy white people among the audience, who jump over the queue, graph charts, numbers and percentages, and while talking in a comet voice, a Harvard Without control, nobody can sense it, but he tells us to go to hell all. There is no fun, but I think the process of capitalism for adoption of this capitalism will not fail to account for this problem, that is, it is expensive and waste dump. He never mentioned how the industrialist created these problems, he just wants to keep the light bandage on them, but do not eliminate the whole oppressive system. It is clear that he was spoiled, sent to school for elites and has the same basic mood for politics, stabbing in any other behind Washington, as inappropriate dullard. Whoever did this campaign, since the Republicans did not have anything different than what they were considered, these targets run by capitalist sentiment were only targets. That is, someone is going to benefit and it seems that the "new green" politicians who support zonal capitalist organizations that have purchased zamindars for the development of "new technology" new "ostrich future". It is the same old story, a believer in the elitist structure of Al Gore, I find a very "naive" in the belief that he actually believes in the US. If we do not pay salaries to oil companies, we will pay their wind and solar companies. <br /> <br /> I finally found the speech, which disappeared by some GW Bush fools, talked about "gathering to defeat Communist" in the 1990s, what was his relation with global warming, He did nothing at all, but he tried to hate the people. In this context, he did not understand that communism was always in the world, in Europe and the USSR system, there was only a shocking form of authoritarianism and capitalism, which is less different than the US interests. Social environments are not even mentioned here, which is really a ridicule. If you want to change the world, then the ancient methods must be settled based on greed, exploitation, and violence.
