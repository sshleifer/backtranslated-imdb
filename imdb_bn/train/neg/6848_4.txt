I would say that I'm fairly frustrated by this "horror" movie. I do not even scared once watching it. It is also not very suspicious .... I could guess the last half of the movie ... so .. what's left <br /> <br /> <br /> "The Ring" is a terrible horror film. I hope other movies stop coping from it (such as trade mark: long hair). Please give me some basicity. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend this movie.
