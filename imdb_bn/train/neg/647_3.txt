The acting was horrendous as well as the plaque. It was poorly assembled and you often wanted to smile on several horrifying acts. The end was even worse. Everyone was going to die, but in the end everything was just like that! They did not give enough history about the teacher's panic etc. Perhaps the film will take more time to develop a good story. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I feel bad for young actors. They need good coaching. They could really make this an OK film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably.
