Many people here say that this show is only for kids. Hmm, when I was a child (about 7-9 years old) I saw this show first. It was hate for me. I talked to other kids about this, sure, know other shows and what? The measure of this camouflage was, whenever we wanted to emphasize some fascination (TV or something else), then we said "oh, just like power ranger" and laughed. <br /> <br /> And before visiting this site, I could not imagine that there are fans of MMRR. It was so strange for me that I decided to look at it again and tried to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy watching that. But it appeared on me: Maybe I do not have enough imagination? It could be. But this argument is not enough to rate me more than 1 star.
