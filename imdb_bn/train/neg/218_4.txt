*** Light speaker alert *** The story feels good and if you read novels, then perhaps you are expecting a deep and intense film that can provide some insight into some interesting and inadequately researched human relationships. <Br /> <br /> Enough is true, trying to do the script, the director tries to do that, but the original cast fails badly. Maria's acting lacks that feeling so dry, her most intense moments seem almost ridiculous. Sometimes he looks nervous due to the camera. His only feelings were near the end where he was dumped by his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Iona Maria seems even more fictional, even she does not seem normal. Marija's attitude was, even if it artificially pushed in a clear direction, she and her character gained some credibility. And to make things worse, we have no insight on it: where does it come from, how is it related to homosexual relationships, how does the relationship grow? We only received some bits from his parents and their relationship seems to be 'to be': it is a content and end, but no beginning. Just like her companion Marija, she sees only one scene that pushes Maria's character Kiki. <br /> <br /> The only person in this movie, Tidar (acting alongside Landlady,), has managed to prove some acting talents. He has his character's attitude and it fits him. Just once or twice he seemed (his father's mother's food scene, when he was not needed, he tried to be obvious) <br /> <br /> I like the story, Tudor is right, the zamindari actually works and Distributes some lines to Pya Style, but it does not save the movie. Very bad, there was a lot of potential in the whole setting and Romanian cinematography could use a movie in this theme. <br /> <br /> Wonderfully, does not seem to be more credibility than objectionable relations between brothers and sisters- no feeling of background (well, Maria's spoken interludes Maria and Ioana's lesbian relationship) is a wonderful try in this direction. I'm sorry to spend money on the ticket, I rather saw it from the comfort of my house.
