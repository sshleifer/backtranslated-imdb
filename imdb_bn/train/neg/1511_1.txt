The first one is due to the performance of about 5 stars (some of which will give me better personal opinion and this is not an intention, it will be a good, inspected, star) but I know that these events are some ratings like actor (s) NAMES To do ... <br /> <br /> I have a problem with such productions; A systemic promotional feature for public access to your rights (at other times how interesting it is that the IPS providers are trying to "prefer", and Americans and Canadians are fighting against war criminals) at the moment) At the moment, harmful file transfers are not labeled as bad (which is intended to remind you of your feelings when you transfer information to the net), but literally tries to create a completely frustrated populist population. Dangerous promotions such as Hollywood's soft days, especially when coming to the thrillers, which have been seen for most of the past 2 decades or more of the "expected" motion picture, is the best way to influence society overall. These levels of violence have been depicted in morality and "moral" human characteristics, which give new necessary necessary funding to "anti-hero" statistics. Do not make any mistake, it is not "Dexter" which was considered as high quality entertainment. Stop the "fear" stop, the world will be a better place than this and it's made dollar. <br /> <br /> Opening views and usually the first 10 minutes really gives a defective cabbage a terrific picture that clearly expresses sexual despair. If he manages a black man, he is rarely boring, if he is not a racist (of course, at least one "clich√©") (In real life someone will probably get a serious blow to it, you can see what you understand). The second scene (in the presence of Clayer Dennis's character) is even more extreme. At the time, I realized that, according to him, Irholbzez is a very dangerous person for the people around him. Many people who viewed or watched the movie were never "closed". , COMMON gratification !? Generally, the movie gives an extreme criminal case (that unfortunately, happened and probably sometimes, happens anywhere) but the fingers can be "indirectly" as well as the fingers, etc. Anyone familiar with Sigmund Freud and Jung should tell very well that sex is not something that directs "ass" by such a fantasy "hero". Safe sex is mostly healthy and some of the bad things that obviously do not obscure Richard Gere's character in some sexual "crusade" way. Have we not learned anything from the many recent strains involved in priests and young boys ?! Or how long has an American teenager seen extreme violence on the "PG-13" but does not see a woman's breasts till "A-18"?! (For example, these art sexes such as "American Pie" in the industry). Kids tester-create one dimension but let them down and drive their underground to developing fetishes for unhealthy ingredients!? All sexual activity (on the basis of individual recognition) integrates some of the "good" nuts in a better manner, which is responsible for the misfortune and errors related to "life of another" (a new German film that will work better than the 2 separate and different worlds) Features on the same subject.), Like this movie, you probably are well represented with actors gratitude Be thankful for. <br /> <br /> I am very disappointed with Richard Gere in particular. The recent "predatory party", a feature where he is really and more realistic about "hero" (after the true fact). But it only reminds me that these people are only an actor who pays for the political play of others. Social Agenda. "Feathers" and "Unexpected" 2 Heads of the same hidden animal)) It just reminds you, if anyone knows the same opinion as Holo, as they have Ariel Bebez here, for them to stay clean for their safety . I'll kill my family more quickly because there is a 0.00001 chance of Paul Gerard in the life of a person ... <br /> <br /> Finally, I suggest negative thoughts about my negative thoughts about this issue. The movie (and "unreasonable" actually), so you could probably think I like the same way. Somewhat sweet then shooting a promotional movie "feet" itself.)))) Once I agree with the rating, this is not a feature for teenagers or kids; Simply because their "money + fame + fashion" and how sexuality will confuse "general" beliefs even more. There are at least one defined entertainment value such as "Shout" series and movies (even my opinion is a fool one). But this one is just "Believe me, I know what's good for you" (I can not deeply add) supernatural messages.
