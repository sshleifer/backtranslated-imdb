Benard rap died last year and was a very well-known journalist. The movie was one of her biggest feelings (she composed a comprehensive dictionary of the worldwide film) and so she was forced to run a camera at least once in her life. But he has completely reviewed the films he has left behind: Despite the exciting performance of Terrence Stamp, "Ti A Part" (1996) was very curious about the character's characterization, "Une Affaires de Guat" (2000) Bernard was even a fierce affair, Giroou also had an opposite performance Delivered, "Pass Sea Grave" (2003) is another frustrating and "Anat Pete" Sa "shocking as his ancestors. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> To play with their guests, they pocket the company with each other.

Two lovers started thinking about the legitimacy of their couple. <br /> <br /> The superb direction of the form can not guide him to give life to this game. Unexpected result This plot follows a well-dressed pattern that is characterized by specific well-known functions and masks that they actually express. Oral or situation comic effects often fall flat. With this bad habit from a bad editing rap, the film spins a bit more and suddenly crashes a lot. Even the intriguing input of the actors is controversial. They seem disturbing and their text rather than sending their texts, especially the Sandraine Kibraline. Visitors are soon caught on a deep terrain. Sorry to say: Barnard Rap films never live up to its motives, such as "You Payee Jiu San Consciences" testifies.
