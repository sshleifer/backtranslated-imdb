Do I ever have a film more shockingly inactive? I can think of the abundance that this one equals, but anyone managed to overcome it. Cast plane is all horrible stereotypes lumbered with dialogue. I am ashamed for all the people involved in this involvement. Everyone wears the expression of fear not being scared, but realizes that this project can easily ruin their career. Even many of Mr. Diaz's characters do not provide enough reason to add to this issue. Avoid it, apparently it is a film that Americans have not really realized. If you want to see the final results, and see what you see, but do not say I have not warned you ...
