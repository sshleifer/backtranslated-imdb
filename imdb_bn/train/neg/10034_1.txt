If this film is the worst movie of this year, the first media of Tashan gave a hint of a boring 2-style film, and I knew well that it could be just a bad film because it could be a felicity film or perhaps Chasey Promo Seeing this picture gave me a shock, it was worse than smoke 2 and what I hope is Saif al-Islam, which is the first presentation of the Law annoying. Then Saif and Kareena meet, Kareena is so artificial and then Anil Kapoor hello God, what is she doing in such a strange film? What kind of role is this? What is he acting? His first scene was right, but his work became repetitive and he was imposed, then Akshay provided some wonderful scenes, but the film became even more annoying and all the old stuff childhood romance, the Balakshi Rajinikanth style action scene and all the annoying scenes <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, cats are the creators of music film Actor Akshay Kumar arrives in the film as fresh jerk of the wind, he actually provides some exciting moments, Saif Ali Khan is boring, Kareena is also badly hurt by Anil Kapoor Ham and humiliating shows and even more spoils.
