Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlew, with big names like this and their minor roles, have a much less-so-named name. It was Technicola, one of the few movies it made in 1939. <br /> <br /> Now bad news ....... Sad, I can not say much positive for the story. It portrays James Boys with a complete positive light ... and it did this even after Hollywood. Why these criminals are always shown "good boys" are beyond me. This movie fascinated them and made them enemies - the people of the railroad - among the wicked people. The latter was over-exaggerated so it was exaggerated. Well, this is the world of film for you: evil is good. Good bad <br /> <br /> Hey Hollywood: Here's a news flash - James boys were criminals! Really - look it up!
