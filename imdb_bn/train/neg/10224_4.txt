Spoilers <br /> <br /> Well, one line essence says it. Melville's "Le Samurai" is original and contains "Leon" material. And they're good - a lot better! <br /> <br /> "Samurai" Alain Dahlen is a solo warrior / professional murderer who keeps birds in cages and stole cars for his job (among these so suspecting the scenes!). Even the last is the same: Samui searches for death in honor and shot him with an empty gun. The earth has changed, and there is no place for samurai. <br /> <br /> Dellon Ghost does not kill many people like dogs. But I think Jermas likes "Leon" too much or even Rodriguez of "Dipperado". So he added this. And let me guess: The girl will become professional like a ghost dog (such as "Platman" in "Leon") <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> So what is Zarroch? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> Conor
