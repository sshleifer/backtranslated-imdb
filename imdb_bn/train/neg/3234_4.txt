Well, how do you rate a movie like this? Is it really even the quality of the movie? This is a film that tries to get closer to the snap film as much as possible. Originally a bunch of torture boys in the whole movie a young girl. It's not too objectionable and it's not real realistic too. <br /> <br /> It is certain that the film tried as realistic and frustrated as possible. However, for the purpose of the movie that purpose is just all very fake to work. Slapping and stumping are all looking soft and fake, as well as sound. They are kicking in the floor more often than girls. Also appreciate the way the girl responds all the pains. I mean if this was real, surely he would scream it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> While this film does not seem to have a great effect on its release, It must certainly do something good, since it was released after six series. <br /> <br /> Shock fan and Gore will probably be disappointed with this movie, though there are still idols that will come out of this movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
