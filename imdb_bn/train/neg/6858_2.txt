I could have imagined, rather than a much more gross misrepresentation than John Hewton's Weis Blood Flannery O'Connor's book. In musical scores that were suitable for a single episode of Rockford files, from the terrible acting performances (and you did not, "Oh, you did not get the purpose that was done"). Rebellion I saw it with no inconvenience at the beginning, and, in fact, expect a joyful experience. But the misrepresentation of the South character was not ridiculously filmed by laughing at the ridiculously deluded southern drill, portraying their beliefs. At the very end, which was completely disconnected from the feeling of a character, the book of Okanor failed in every bright and iconic place. The "south" police officer who portrays Godfather from NYC Street Studs, has starred in a cheerful hat-dog. To liberate the acting activist, living and dead-representation of Neid Batti's representative, religious congressman representing Huevre Schwaitz, who preached Christ Church without Mike's Christ and watched the dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's strongest book is most well-known for its obscure, religious underwriter, which makes the unexpectedly alive surviving word of "faith" alive. Mr Houston's filmmaker's motives are shameful spider, because they are understood by me and most of his fans, if I can be brave to say this way. Although I acknowledge that I do not know exactly what the author is trying to say, I have enough love to be a fan of me and his works. If I saw Wisdom Blood that Haston clearly saw, I would throw him in the trash. For flannery, and mine, I apologize to you, John Houston. Forget about it .... It will take some time.
