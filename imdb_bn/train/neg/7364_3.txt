In 1629, Slam objected to a whole community of false allegations of involvement in slavery in a witch child witch. The costume drama played by Colt Colbert and Fred McMurray is not static, although it is not a brilliant screenplay of an infectious violence. Working by three authors (Walter Ferre, Durvard Grimstead, and Bradley King), the story is rather interesting (especially coming from Hollywood in 1937), although anyone who read Arthur Miller's "Crucible", on the display here melodrama for too long Will not be tolerated. The biggest problem with the image may be to cast: Colbert and McMurry, an unfortunate couple of lovers infected by kittens, many contemporary appearances in this neighborhood of Macmoor. * **** to 1/2
