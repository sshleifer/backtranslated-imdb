I did not see it, and I do not plan to include this movie or any other Lindsay ... Until and until "poor little rich girl" made her life straight for her 2 year time in the year of recent arrest in July 2007. <br /> <br /> Actually, I do not know if anyone visited Lindsay's recent movie. I imagine that 2007 will be a high water mark in his film making career, until he clears his work. All of the recent promotion has prevented his film career, if he has more desire to make any other film <br /> <br /> At this time, movie producers actively congratulates Lindsay for their upcoming generation. Now, Lindsay might have to go to audition and actually compete for any role. His fame can now have a "poison" and a negative impact on the box office ticket sales in a movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " > <br /> <br /> Everything is just my opinion. I have no inside information.
