Back when I was a kid and lived with my sister, she bought that scary movie she bought, and it was one of them. VCR's became a family item and we did not have around 150 movies, and we found out all of them. <br /> <br /> I was in another yard sale and I saw VHS. Bload Legacy copy and I bought any horror movie and I knew that this movie seems to be familiar. I thought for a second and realized that my sister bought it. I guess he was selling it in a yard year ago - who knows. <br /> <br /> I did not think anything about it and because I saw it at night it saw it and it refreshed my memories because of a few scenes. I'm not sure how I felt about it as a child but I am sure it was enjoyed because it was new to me and I would like to see and enjoy something then. <br /> <br /> I'm scary, but for me it has certain requirements to consider "good" and it's too small. This was one of those discussions and I had a type of death. The death shadows that you see are followed by the blast of blood, and if you are lucky they will get more. <br /> <br /> The story is good and I saw some of the same plot. So I think this one is buried and forgotten. These people do not see until you are rigid.
