I saw this movie in 1959 in a drive-in. I never saw it until "Howard the Dock" is the worst movie. This movie tried to unify all the generals; Comedy, horror, teenage angst, and hot rod which must be born "my mother, car." Maybe it's a second viewing capability to see if it's a perfect reflection during its time.
