I want to be a person in America that does not like this movie. I think it was not my style or something, I just could not see it so impressive, it was only entertaining, one of the greatest achievements of film history. <br /> <br /> This is the word of a person who came from nothing and became a drug lord. Very simple way to describe a complete movie, and that's my feeling about the whole movie. Many people think that movies / drug trade / criminal groups do not automatically make a great movie, so do not forget the good story.
