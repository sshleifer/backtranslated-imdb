Many years ago I enjoyed this movie by enjoying Gregory's Girl. This was drivel. The plot was very strange with the teacher and his friend to save 14-15 year old girls in very small scratches. Previous commentators do not think that it does not matter, but I think it is rather painful. If you have children in school, your last thing should be that every young teacher wants her students after. We were surprised that through sensors. Besides, the film was a waste of time only. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair tried very hard to revive his schoolboy's image, was a little fragile and closed the wall. Why would anyone want this performance after him incredible? This image has failed all calculations for me. Horrible Please do not waste your time while watching it. Life is too small
