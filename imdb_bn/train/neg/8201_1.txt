Slug into your favorite chair and switch to the game station, because you toss it in the waste disposal unit. Spend a useful 90 minutes. Living your favorite game Hesitant - weakly drunk - non-directed junk It takes a bit from several "science fiction" films and tries to take part in a thinly flawed story. There is nothing new here, filmmakers do not realize that providing easy entertainment will earn a financial game, but a touch of skill and mood will make it a good movie. It's a waste of money spent on seeing it, and personally I'd like to get back to my 90-minute life.
