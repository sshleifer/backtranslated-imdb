I grew up to pour over the intertwined stories of Wrinkle in Time Chronicles. I had a dream that one day a screen writer would be waking up at the time while sitting a large sofa across their child, and would think that it would make an awesome movie. Sadly that the script has failed, the characters change, throwing in the lame humorous, and all the destruction of the plot out. I know it's hard to change a good novel into a movie. But why can not you be true in the book? Why do you think the characters and change the way they work? For those who do not read books, pick it up, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.
