I could give this movie a zero. Chess influence and acting. The only reason you see this movie is that you can see how bad it is. Let's start with Brian playing with the kids. What the Gaik! I could not believe! Then was talking to myself. I think they can not remain silent in the movie, but still. Of course, they wanted to sink him, and did not want to see anything. But the General gave a great performance, compared to the special effects division. I could have done everything from the beer to the crashes, and the better. I seriously suspected Gary Pelsen to do something about production, because the film was not known as a hatchat. Finally, I do not think the author ever read the book because there was nothing the same. I think the book was great, but this movie stunk like a smelly goat!
