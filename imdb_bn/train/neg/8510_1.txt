When we were in junior high school, some of us sometimes stop the sting bomb. It is then considered fun. But the cast of the producer, director and "Samana Santa" (the DVD of your local video rental "angel of death") is adult and they are still closing it. <br /> <br /> If the past critic Kest is concerned about the set and the exit of the house, I doubt that any of the scenes has been done for one. <br /> <br /> Mira Sorvino, "Magnificent Aphrodite" and other top-rating films, seem to have undersold themselves in this project. His acting is limited to the existence of most intelligent strokes, which is believed to refer to the problem of various victims of the film as "sensitive". <br /> <br /> Let me warn you - do not let the next victim! If you look at it step away from the DVD Mirror's very good leg shot (the only high point I can find in film) and supporting cast is worse quality, which provides a torch of poorly spoken dialogue with the appropriate "Spanish" accents for high schools.
