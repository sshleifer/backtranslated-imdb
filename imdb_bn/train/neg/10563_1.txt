The time spent watching this movie wasted time. I do not dislike science fiction. I do not reject any type, because good work can be done in any way. This picture, however, is not a good job. I can not blame visuals (when do not involve alien makeups), and special effects are impressive. The story was not BAD-out-out for a tricky comic book. But FX visuals were evidently where all the creators' interest / attention / money went away. Changed aspects between loose and confusing (one was not sure what exactly was and what and with whom and at least one important juncture) "Acting" was mostly very bad. Most line-readings did not have any basis, "This page was on this page and the director told me that I'm crazy / sad / awesome / whatever." OK, so it was a SF series pilot. Since they should be considered as essential for a dramatic medium, an excuse for correctional relaxation is in place. I'm surprised the pilot has sold the series. The money in the hands of the technocrats?
