This could actually be the worst movie that I ever saw. Incorporate will be a compliment. No idea was made until the end, but it was finally an extraordinary relief. I saw it with a separatist chatter and whether it could be bad to see and did it. After finishing this mess I am sorry that any characters survived and I was not feeling very charity about the actor. If you want to see a train debris, I recommend hanging on a train station. Waiting at even a deserted train platform this mess. Apparently I am not sufficient enough to fill ten lines of mine, so I will say once more at the risk of vulnerability. This movie is a zero and it will be less if I have a word for even less ratings. How about zero zero?
