A few years after the collapse of the last major corporations, the world has fallen into a dark era where cybercops are cut for their parts. Cash, a female cyborg, travels to a pregnant doctor that she is pregnant. Run from the recyclers, who try to find their way into cash semester, the mythological shelter for cyborg <br /> <br /> "cyberbank 3: reuser" third (and so far so far) CYBORG triangle entry. The first film was originally planned to be a Universe master's signal, but it quickly became a post-apocalyptic martial-arts festival, which became something of classic classic due to its Chess action scenes. CYBORG 2: Glass Shadow is a preview that was originally developed above the predecessor but was not widely seen (and those who saw it as a cheap sheets). <br /> <br /> This image was one of the first two films (probably the first Cheerleader action movie when the first was a smart cyberpunk story), but it unfortunately became smaller in both numbers. The film was obviously less than CBS 2, the film was set up in desert enclosures (such as many post-apocalyptic action films from the 90s), firing around old industrial buildings to save costs. <br /> <br /> The movie story is based on a plot device, like pregnant Cyborg, it is considered as unreasonable (this film is not the first to use that idea; Anime OVA series archive III uses it in larger quantities ). But the film falls into the same trap that has become a victim of such low budget cipher action films, due to that the characteristics of the synthetic organisms are nothing more than arodi. Visual effects are nothing more than artificial arms and makeup effects. <br /> <br />, the film is a commendable map for this film, the main actress (Christine Haj) is the single bad actor in the show. Instead of being happy to hear that she was pregnant, she did all kinds of clutter and vacuum. His co-stars are very good, Malcolm McDowell is a common Ganga ritual, and he illuminated the views of Richard Lynch and made much fun like the main villain. Especially the note Andrew Bysschiki is playing the right tool of Lynch, who was subsequently rebuilding Chensab Mossas of Texas and present on his eve.
