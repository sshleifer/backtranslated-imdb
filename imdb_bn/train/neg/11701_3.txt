Just another example of why Stepehn King's book should not be made in the movie. (Even the best Carey book is destroyed by the adaptation of the screen.) The story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" killed an old Gypsy woman. In the court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he was an accidental accident, although he blamed the fact that he was not paying attention to driving. The deceased Gypsy woman's father gave 3 damages, our main character Billy (lawyer) made the day thin and thin. The film is mostly kept in the book, and your ideal king is ending, but the act is forced to fall and be compelled. We went from one scene to another without anything else, sort of like reading in a game. King himself made a cameo in the movie (like Dave Barry), which further strengthened my belief that the authors should be right: the author. Leave acting actor. This movie was not that great anybody. I saw the main characters in the movie where they were very good.
