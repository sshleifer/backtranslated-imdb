Last night I decided to watch the prick or the so called prickle in Carlito's Way - "Carlito Way: Rise to Power (2005)" which went straight to the DVD ... No wonder ... it's completely .. and I'm completely S% and KS mean !!! Waist of time and I think it will be a perfect waist of writing time .... I do not understand how to make a debut for this movie, De Pal agreed. Only I can hit my hat ... J Hernandez who is playing a young brigante ... reminds me of how Dante entered the brand shoe to illustrate the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ... but DD iro is amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!! J. Hern√°ndez has guts to try his best to be a small Pacino .... For him too bad I do not think he will be playing in the film longer and after watching this sh # $% tie movie, I sit down to get bad taste from my face Below is the original Carlitos way down and saw.
