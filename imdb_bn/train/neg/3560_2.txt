This is a story for me that starts with an interesting joke about the Franks fantasy when he is traveling with the stairs and when he is sitting at the business meetings ... The problem is that when you look for this moment for an hour you can see again and again and The same imagination / funny situation. It is predictable. This is done as a TV story where you can go and come back in a absence. <br /> <br /> I like Flex Herrgren as Frank, but it is not enough to be a comedy but its diversity and some of its audience <br /> <br />
