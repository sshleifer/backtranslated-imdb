Following the "Walking Tall" of 1973, Tennessee Sheriff Booster has continued the real-life drama surrounding Pousa, but this installment is playing like a hair TV movie. Bo Sawenson plays a major role from Joe Sank Becker, but he is not very light for the part; He comes off with a guitar instead of an amazing country singer with the bat. Good supporters such as Richard Jakeel, Luke Liquew, and Robert Dukieu are rarely finished. I will firmly give one star of his good intentions, but screenplay routine predicaments are a transparent and lazy mass and production cheapjack. In 1977, "Final Chatter-Walking Tall" was followed and in 1978 the television film "A Real American Hero" was followed.
