Setting up a new value for creating a movie bad movie this clunker. Jared Rautan has given an adequate performance of a very poorly-made character in an unfortunate movie, resulting in a total effect of a very bad movie. The main intensity of the film is that, after surviving the plane crash exclusively, a boy on the Canadian thigh allowed a troubled teen to cope with his pain in the discovery of his mother's marriage. Unfortunately, it is a random "survival event" (two especially in hockey scenes involving a beer) and turned into a malignant collage of wonderful hallucinations, which makes you wonder that this child is not dreaming about this film (and is it a nightmare !). Furthermore, despite the critics of some of the critics of the film's family, there are no small children or family-friendly scenes, one of which shows the scene of dead pilot water exploding in the eye. <Br /> <br /> Not everyone should be a terrible movie to anyone, less innocent children.
