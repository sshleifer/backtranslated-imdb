I wanted this picture for one reason - Al Adamson. He was the worst director of all time - Ed Wood, Jr. and Ray Dennis Stackler and on the right side of the horror pantone. However, I was disappointed because this movie was really bad, but it never contacted the horror levels of previous Scolike movies. Because of this, this movie was not particularly fun for our bad movie fans. <br /> <br /> Now I was aware of watching this film, as the title "Naughty Stewardess" film makes the movie a film like pornographic - I will not be reviewing some IMMb. However, this image has been shown occasionally - especially the first 10 minutes. However, you can say that this script has brought many changes, because for most movies there is no title at the end of the film and there is no plot at the end of the film that is violent and certainly not sexy! All these results are total confusion <br /> <br /> Sadly, many parts are not good. For example, as a pornographic video, it looks astonishingly little and it's some unimaginable scene why they keep 71-year-old man in some scenes of love. Sure, 71 year old Mr. Livingston loved it well - but she was still in old age and someone wants to see her with a little nipple! Then, after the final 20 minutes became very violent, Livingston became a Rambo-like person! Talk about weird and inappropriate. <br /> <br /> Overall, this sad movie has little recommendation. It is not bad enough or enough, and the film is driven by crazy titles like "Naughty Stearnses" to be even annoying.
