The story goes something like this: a small urban girl, Katie (Jessica Simpson), decided to meet her boyfriend in the big city. When he came, he discovered that he was as faithful as he was not faithful. Katie then ends up venturing into that adventure in New York. Bike Messen ensues admission as comedic and charming mishaps. She fell into a hole on the ground and thus got the nice guy Ben (Luke Liesson Wilson) to work hard. It is not at least love for him at first sight, at least for him, but the fate and Ben, are not so easy to give up. In a building firm, "Just" a small urban girl and blonde two miscreants decide that they are the perfect skaggat for their impressive plan. Following misunderstandings with ridiculous and sad consequences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Jokes are confident and appropriate, and the stories well developed. The relationship between KT and Bennen feels so natural that it has made Gararme to shame. Multi-talented Jessica Simpson was once again surprised by a strong role, she could only pull. Simpson is really our day's Marilyn Monroe (a look of honor!). She is completely balance between helpless and whimsy. Katie really shows us that you can not judge a book by her cover! Louis Wilson is as charming as before. Even if he is appearing as someone that people covered in the queue. Its light touch makes the puppy difficult to prevent dog eyes and back mechanisms. Andy Dick plays the role of playing the role of a player playing two roles. He can not really be underestimated. The power of performance lies in its restraint. This is great, because most actors will simply run away with it and play it for the cheapest laugh. This guy is not! At the conclusion, the director Scott Marshall has created an intelligent and frequent sunny comedy that is becoming a classic as well as the superiority of movie like Epic Movie and Nerbit. Kudos, especially Jessica Simpson for everyone involved in this. Her hearty smile and impressive smile even put the hard people in big spots. You might be difficult, but you are not that hard! Those who want to tear their legs are warmly recommended and look for a romantic comedy for a while, honestly. Thank you for this photo! Oh, and soundtrack stone! <br /> <br /> Now you do not get it. I'm annoying. 1/10
