Anyone who reads the novel and watched the movie, I have different reasons why this image was so floppy. First, any comparison between novels and movies is fully sponsored. They are two different animals. <br /> <br /> The novel is probably considered to be the object of ridicule, but instead it appears as a cross between the tragedy and the spine. Since then, any comedic elements that make up the stylistic foundation of the film version are only accessible to the author's equally alarmed significance. And the writer's universal white suit can not fool you. It's another Mark Twain, think again. Ambrose Bierce's viewers in a top hat and tail are more suitable literary examples. Tom Wolfe equals parts shoes and hacks, more celebrities than writers, always looking for a new grist for his self-absorbed calls. <br /> <br /> Excellent production efficiency and direction for creating this image started from the beginning. True mockery, which translates very well into the film, the spine is not in the publicly accessible observation on a form or other of human behavior, but the only psychological attack on a particular person - real or imagined hay men - who have somehow received the author's anger. From such a beginning, any effort to create a story or a narrative of a successful film must be clearly begun, free from the author's influence or interference. <br /> <br /> Not saying, I can also find fault with Casting. It just failed to measure the inability of Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith, but Tom Hendes, F. The original genius of Murray Abraham and Morgan Freeman is simply a complete breakdown or acting that is just mere joke. <br /> <br> There are substantial topical elements for the genuine film satire, but it also fails to stop.
