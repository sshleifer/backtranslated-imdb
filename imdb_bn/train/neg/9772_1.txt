<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, and there is a film in me without a fight, something missing. But please do not be one after the other. My reaction was not shock or horror, it was: "Here we go again." There is a similarity to the story of violence, but through the two-thirds of the film, I completely stopped, and could not wait for the end. <br /> <br /> If this is done by best filmmakers, they will have to do something else about their sad lives, such as making shoes or providing mail.
