A psychopath on a distant planet is protected from execution by an asteroid monk. He released some fellow prisoners and broke from a spaceship jail. They docked onto a supernova spacecraft which is rotating a supernova star. This massive craft was populated by just three people, probably the budget of the film was not extended for the sake of the selection of many actors. However, cutting a short story short, the cat and mouse with three goodies baddies end up in a game. <br /> <br /> This movie psychologist is weird that he is boring. The 'boring' is not usually a word that can be an insane - evil, dangerous, dangerous, but it is not 'boring', but he is. It is incredibly important to play three important people in this huge ship - this ship is actually a city size! In the future, the film is thought to have been set for almost 50 years, it is somewhat optimistic that such a large human creation can exist, it is not used for such a relatively hypocritical work. Despite the huge size of the spaceship, the crew unexpectedly decorated everyone, in small rooms and dining rooms, like plastic tables and chairs. But there are a lot of ceriders. <br /> <br /> The picture played fairly well and it acts as an average science-thriller. But nothing is great.
