From the point of view of a plot and movement, this movie was terrible. I saw myself in the theater clock and saw that it would end and it would be forgiven after 80 minutes. Originally, there are five characters in the film, there are two male characters of son and father, son's friend and boy son, and disappear without context or explanation. Movies and scenes seem to mean homo-romance, but in reality it has not been published in any way. There was a couple in the bright scene. At the beginning of the film, the boy's girl friend shows a window outside his room and they are involved in a strange conversation. Photography and acting interact between the two, incredible temptations, which gives them "old" consent to another person. That's the end of the story.
