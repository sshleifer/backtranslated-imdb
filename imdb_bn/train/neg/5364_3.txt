Complaints are valid, the biggest problem to me is that these soap operas are very targeted for women. I am like soap in the night, like Gray's Anatomy, or Agley Betty, or West Wing, because the stories are so interesting that it will never end in the end. However, when the concept is parallel to the day's soup, it's violent men (Taye Diggs, Tim Daly and Chris Lowell) in sexual masculinity and in the ropes and a lot of humorous difficult situations in the so-called small hospital, it seems like a general hospital ... or Baywatch A female opponent. The men did what they wanted and they did, so if women want it, it's just that it's an unruly show (or some men will see) unreal.
