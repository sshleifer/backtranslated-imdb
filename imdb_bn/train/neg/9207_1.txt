This film has sold for Wal-Mart DVD for $ 1 and so I do not think I lost anything to watch this movie without my time. Enjoying Tom Hans's performance (Robi Whirling), who was very young and thought it was an extraordinary script, an extraordinary performance. The story is about college students who decided to play game majes and monsters, only in a very realistic setting. Robi Wheeling has had problems playing this game in other colleges in the past and his parents advised him to leave alone and get a good grade. Robi looks at a very beautiful girl and flashes with her romantic and she starts playing the game, she stops her love and acts like a monk. There are some scenes in the film which are running around the former World Trade Center and observatory floor and roof area. It is sad to see this part of the picture, where many people have died due to evil in the world. This is not a very good movie, apart from trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment, besides Tom Hans,
