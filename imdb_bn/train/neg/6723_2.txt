Charlotte's deadly beauty and lethal kick make the movie cooler than it otherwise. The story is so poor and the character of Charlotte dies so foolishly that you think that for the sake of this end they think for this movie. I want someone to say that the option has ended, but I do not fear it. For the rest of them, well I would say they did not do very well; Although the fault should be kept in poor scripts. This movie reminds me Rush Hour 2, where Zhang Zia stupidly died, because she stole this theft during the whole film. I could give this movie 2/5
