For a fan series, I must admit that the Hidden Frontier is not that bad at all. However, reviewing this series does not depend on whether it is a fan series. The initiative itself is commendable. As well as creativity. I guess people with this common job, and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But, doing all of this is working. Pulling all these resources. For all this time, and still all errors. <br /> <br /> All the acting, and the line is awful. For the most. The dialogue is in the military exhibition of 70, or they are in Star Trek Captain (Mr. Squite) looks like he can laugh at any time. And most characters are just reading their lines. The directors should be aware that the "retake" dictionary is not just a word. But I think the series was created in "Two Tech Fraces" system, which directed TNG episodes and movies, and also, I could not help but think most actors usually think of Trekki. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> When they first started this series Decides to spend time and resources - why do they not provide it in the appropriate quality? A waste of talent using quick time format with low low resolution. Even "hypers" episodes are considered as worse quality than the standard quality series. Using the Xvid codec, the experience has improved greatly with a larger resolution and file size. If there are band problems with issues then a torrent tracker will be set up. <br /> <br /> I hope the crew decides to brush the series and will probably leave it in the DVD, it will give the project quality as worthy.
