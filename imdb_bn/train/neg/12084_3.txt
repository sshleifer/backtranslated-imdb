Take: <br /> <br /> 1. A famous game <br /> <br /> 2. <br/> <br /> 3 A copy of a popular theater production stage design of the game mentioned 1. <br /> <br /> 4. An actor for leadership - he has no feeling of playing that part and you will get: "Hamlet, Prince Von Dunmark" <br /> <br /> I heard Hamlet and I was very disappointed with the "Hamlet" Radio with Maximilian Shell . I hope the illustrated version will be better, the shell must have at least one physical language that he says - there's nothing to do. Then the set ... the lowest design is not the taste of everyone, but it usually likes if I have enough levels to determine what I like. Hey, that's a theater, at a stage. It will not work based on a game that actually contains credible settings. The idea of ​​the set was copied from the production of the theater, where Shell Hamlet already played ... Let's say that if the complaint is the only thing ... I ask myself how the shell can take part in Hamlet's first part. The place and how Hamlet can play him for the second time. If you prefer to watch about 60 movies based on "Hamlet", then you will not watch it, unless you are a difficulty, or are not really hardcore, or want to make fun of actors immediately.
