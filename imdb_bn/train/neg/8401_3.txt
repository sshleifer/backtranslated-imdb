Just looking at TMC, it's new in my mind. It is clear that the stooges they featured featured, they did not really run the show. First, they are divided into two groups - Mow, "Short" and Larry and Kolly as a pair of magicians, so there is not much work for the whole team. The plot that the love story burns is not selfish, only with the power of two women, the other musical stooges that are unreasonable, unless you think they are fun. The music is tedious, they drive in Randhur and then depending on the horse, Darky Western wear is stupid, and there is a lot of film on the camera without any studio. However, it is obvious after the first stroke of KÃ¤rli and its low energy level is clear. Vernon Dent initially appears in an unfamiliar role. I like all these guys ever, including all non-curly stuff, but this little dogie is quite lousy.
