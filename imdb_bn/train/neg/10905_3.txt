Guy is a victim. Girls can not get up, build up, be picked by more powerful people, saw, saw, etc., it has been removed. I want to say that Rob needs to remove Adam Sandler's part of his life. And get out of Adam Sandler Plot. There are two interesting parts of the whole movie. I could not even finish the last 5 minutes. I was bored. "The Angel" is an accurate film. I enjoy Adam Sandler Films that are usually the same plot. But this was very difficult to print. The joke is too old. So, trust me. This is not a movie that most people really can get. But something did, so I'll be nice. <br /> <br /> 3/10
