As a fan of Suookie Stackhouse books, I see this series as their completely cross-presentation. The vampire bill does not look very good and the book looks much older than the description. I have already found that the wonderful colorful characters are very courses and rude. One of the things I liked about books was that the shit that she was going through with Sookie is always a woman, and then she does not seem to be in the TV series. Only prejuices shown in the TV series are not nearly extensively in books. I do not expect accurate copies of books but I hope at least the feeling of using them for the series.
