Even the single star gave me this movie the only reason for me to finish it. I usually had high hopes as High Camp Holiday horror movies, but this was not just qualified. It's not really a bad plot, which is a bad endeavor, showing an insane slide slowly showing insanity slides, but here it is done badly. Some scenes (like the end) that are not intended to be fun, but actually make me laugh loudly. I have been a few times because the film can actually go in an interesting direction, but it can not be what it is and what should not happen. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slash flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
