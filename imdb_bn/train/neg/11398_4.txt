I saw the movie primarily on Brooke Chuck (as Jill), I briefly met in LA at a modeling trade show in his first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she had played her role very well. Since he is so beautiful and equipped TV host and model, so it was not surprising. I was surprised at why I was killed, and what happened. Maybe I missed it <br /> <br /> I was not really sure about the style of this movie, and although I liked the actors, it seemed like it was for college viewers. I tried to remember the horror, I did not have the custom of my thoughts, but I felt that I was able to increase the gags. It started dragging in some places, you guessed a little bit about the power of a bad persuasion, and there was an unpleasant ending like many other films. <br /> <br /> Some scripts have been written, I know it can be very difficult and come in personal opinion, how many movies you've watched and read, and at that time you are connected with it. <br /> <br /> <br /> It is interesting, but not a satisfactory plot and the end for me. If Jill (Brooke Chef) finally comes back through the portal and kicks everybody's ass, which ends in a satisfactory and achieves high ratings.
