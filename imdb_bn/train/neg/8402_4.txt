A feature Western comedy-musical of three stages? Perhaps Rocky "Rockin" was intended to combine short stooges comedy with a western musical instrument on a small stage; If so, it was a great way on Saturday afternoon. "J Kirby" (as Rusty) is a handsome young hero, and, Mary Beth Hughes (As of June June) and Gladys Black (as Null Rattan) are pretty pretty. Hoosier Hotshots is a consistent group; Their songs are pretty safe; However, it is not in the late 1940s, 1950s, so the film is not actually "rock". There are a few smiles; But Stooges' funny brand is more subdued than usual. The talking horse is also underutilized. <br /> <br /> **** Rockin 'in the Rugges (4/17/45) Vernon Keys - M Howard, Larry Fine, Kelly Howard, Mary Beth Hughes
