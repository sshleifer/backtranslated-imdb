I have read another comment about this movie, and generally I do not try to be stern in my criticism because I try to be an excellent person. However, this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. (And it's top of the worst US network plus Sinemex night.) Anybody who thinks of this film will have to stop making it another. This picture hated me in such a way that there was no other film. I really think these people are crazy. Just save your time and do not see this flmm. Please - I had the desire. The acting is terrible, the plot (the plot) is strong and humane and insane. I really do not think this should make a movie. But that's my opinion, and I'm trying to save you from wasting your time.
