The idea of ​​thumb is not such a winner in the second round. ThumbTanic was not as good as thumb fight for many reasons. Primarily, I think, there was little to work with Mr. Odekar sending the Titanic. In contrast to Star Wars, the Titanic film still (still?) Has become a cultural myth and has very few references to resonate with viewers. <br /> <br /> Thobhanyani, one of the jokes off the filling of the holes, which really does not seem to be related to anything. For example, the heroine's intimacy is not clear that the heroine is "clean at the end of the ship" - it's not funny. Rather, you feel yourself, "Did I miss something in the original movie?". There were many such baseless jokes (C.F.Archinad). <br /> <br />, the shipwreck's ship's ship was meant to be fun and fun. It was also very interesting to send a movie block, who wanted to "go faster", which is the ship's sinking and everything is becoming faster before it dies. Such jokes provide meaningful humor in relation to Titanic and meaningful humor to the thumbnail. <br /> <br /> Thumb "Media", faces and voices are still fun. Props and sets and CGA animations are worth the gratitude. Overall, though, Thomattanic proves that the waist will not work alone, the film still surprises you and ultimately chocolates.
