As a fan of Erik Rohar's research of contemporary war during sexual relations, I was really interested in seeing "Lady and Duque (L'Anglo and Le Duke)" because he would deal with men and women during the actual war. French Revolution. <br /> <br /> The film looks beautiful, is designed like the timeline of each scene, such as a tablecloth vivant. And I said a lot, like Romer's style. But maybe Rumor was stopped by the basis of screenplay in the real women's writings, why it mostly felt like a documentary version of "The Scarlett Pimpernel". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do the French dictators recognize some of the broken brats? I kept myself threatened: "Murat, we are poor / poor; poor people;" You can choose a tune from "Les Mies". <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> At one point his maid claimed that Pantry Bayer was also managed to find a fine repast. I just did not understand him, an English sympathizer who rejected and saved his former boyfriend and patron, because he and the revolution had changed the political focus; I think I was sympathetic to its consistency compared to its political continuity, as a character of "The Scarlett Pimperel". Hey, because he did not return home, there was a relationship with Prince of Wales or any other person and after his child's disrespect. <br /> <br /> The relationship between men and women has changed somewhat during the revolutionary period, but I have not seen anyone here. I once went to the Herbert Marcus lecture which ended with a long quiz; The last question is, from older people, older than the other members of the audience, he is gray-haired ankle, "Why revolutionaries are so dead?" He was disappointed and Marcus did not condemn it for responding seriously - but the whole thing in my whole evening was the only thing I remember. Rohmer demonstrates that revolutionaries are also serious and missionary. <br /> <br /> (originally written 8/11/2002)
