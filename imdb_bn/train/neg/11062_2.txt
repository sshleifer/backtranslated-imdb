Goats go way! You just make a soft, gentle, dramatic, fair playful story of a necrophiliac cannibal, a cool. Obviously a movie called Dahmara can be of two kinds: Horror, or the documentary rights? This was not. It was not close to any detail information (it was actually no component of it) It was not really unclear or frightening or even tried to be very annoying. (If you had to try !!) What is this writer / director thinking? Here is one of the most common examples of sick serial killers and we got fired heavily, poorly gay bar roofs and long droning flashbacks alone at the time of their old parents' house. I think Jackson is actually J. Trying to present Dahmer's 'soft side' (or discovery).
