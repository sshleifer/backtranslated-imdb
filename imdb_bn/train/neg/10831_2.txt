My guess was to say to some of these directors / writers. Let's see, it could be ... a. Will Frog storm be weird? B. Someone like Tom Cruise can tell me the word "C" many times and look like bad Patrick Ruffer? C. Cast my wife and tell her the word "F" every 2 seconds. This aside I really liked and started frog storms. The rest were a relentless, long (edited under), too much helpless failure. Enjoy it a lot! <br /> <br />
