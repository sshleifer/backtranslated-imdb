When I saw the name of this movie, I always thought it was a musical. Like "Harvey girls." It's not a pudding that overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and was pried off and cobbled together. There is no music and not a fragment but it is completely unlikely. <br /> <br /> It starts, Father James Woods is the eldest of his three daughters, repeatedly telling a small child to be a Stanwick, his family name should be maintained and at home. <br /> <br /> We think it's going to be a historical interdependent story. And it's for a short time. Then it turned into a story of the cold-hearted Stanwick fight against lawyer George Brent. Why did he die so much against her? Well, why? According to the strange flashback sequence described by Stanwick, we learned that he can inherit some money (with his sisters as well as himself). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> - Well, you know ... they had an endless marriage and they were together in a very short time, she conceived. <br /> <br /> One of his sisters, Gig, who is acting with Gig Young, is a young love for a painter. Another sister tried to take her away. Etc etc <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
