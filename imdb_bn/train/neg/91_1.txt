I hired this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands my mind as the worst movie. I do not think I ever end it. It's worse than a home video made by a high school student. I think they were doing some flashbacks in the 1970s and there was a man with flashbacks like polo shirts, oculi sunglasses and a new SUV such as a Toyota RAV-4 or something (I do not remember). I could not understand how they could say in the 70's. He can have a cell phone, I can not remember, it was just horrible. I came back to the video store and asked why they also carry the movie and if I could get my life hours. To date I saw it the worst movie, and I saw some pretty bad.
