This short series tried to use the same formula based on a book by Alex Helly as 'Queen', which for many years tried to build a long history after living a family life. Where the 'Queen' result was excellent, here Mama Flora did not have the inspiration. Perhaps in the book itself, and certainly in the production of this TV. It is not too rude in years to rush too much, such as the publisher's singer is not nearly as pure as a shallow, sponsor, 'queen'. Full marks for visibility in the earlier parts of the film, which was carefully prepared, but due to the film's progress, it turns Dallasian-Fasciethian into an incomplete mixed mixture on the last day of three hours or more. I had more hope; Clearly, Halley was inspired by this story and her closest biography was 'Queen' and Peter Bharara was not a match for John Arman. The only recommendable for those who have the hunger for this long story of generations.
