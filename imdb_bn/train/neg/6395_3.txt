At the beginning of the night of comet, the world is once ready for lifestyle event, passes 65 million plus years old comet. Instead of showing the show of light, Regina Belmont (Catherine Mary Stewart) decided to stay busy with the movie the movie producer Larry Dupree (Michael Bowen) at night ... They wake up the next morning and Larry is trying to leave the movie. Killed by a zombie, attacked the same Zombieie resina but she managed to escape from where she discovered that the entire planet has turned almost everyone red dust. Almost everyone can be the only person to survive by some amazing phenomena, her sister Samtha (Kelly Meroney), they suddenly search for more survival and meet a long distance tracker named Hector Gomes (Robert Beltran). Meanwhile, an evil piece of science requires human blood for the development of a blood transfusion of people's own blood and they are looking for the culprits of the poor ... <br /> <br /> Written and operated by Tham Eberhardt. A fantastic garbage viewing experience of comet night, I am amazed about the amount of positive comments on IMDB because I thought it was a boring shit that was never alive with its potential. With the entire population of the world and the violation of a zombie attack, the script starts at 100 miles per hour but it does not go anywhere, and finally, at the end of the film, the terrorist blood stealer represents the scientist, because that's a thin story of that time. There is also a hole in the plot, if these scientists want blood, then shoot three or four gang members and protect two sisters, when the boys supply more blood for their testing, then killing them seems to be very malicious and almost suicide work. Think of the need for their blood to cure the disease, what do you think when you die and five or six donor blood supply or if you need to be tested in the blood, only two? I do not believe that the two sisters are independent of each other living independently, what do I have to say on her opinion? When Hector encounters female scientist for the first time, he never mentions feudal or underground facilities where he took Rajina before committing suicide, so how did Hector know these things? I thought the image was gradually boring at the speed of a snap after the first minute of the twentieth century, and after listening to many good things about it, comet came to me at night, as if an extra boring piece. <br /> <br /> <br /> Director Ebahartt has really worked well, I like the look of the film with his red sky and he maintains a really cool environment of isolation. Manage to keep. Unfortunately there are many shots on the empty streets, there is permanent mounts of permanent roads, solitary roads and abandoned buildings and it becomes very repetitive and relentless. Okay we do not have anyone else about it so our throats by constantly showing the road without car on them is necessary to keep ramming it. Zombies are completely destroyed, although there are two zombies attack on the whole film and that there are a couple of different zombies as well as a functional nightmare scene. With a compulsory completion of the world's shopping spree in a mall, taken from Don of the Dead (1978) on the night of comet, many more good films, which you like, pay tribute or rip-offs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Actually it was exactly for Marin, Samantha's air-head blonde who became very excited. <br /> <br /> There was a big disappointment for me on the night of comets, I expect much more. Personality: I got this film in a nutshell, boring, unknowable and cruel trend, where sisters can buy the song 'Girls Justa Wanna Have', perhaps the worst moment in this movie. It's really bad and I do not like so much people, I'm sure I'm shocked to say so that abuse can start, I can take it ...
