Even in a bad movie, there are usually some redemption features that you can say yes it was terrible, but that performance, or part of the script or special effect, was only terrible. The performance was ridiculous, the script was terrible, the references to Tiffany were done with many inexperienced lovers and even special effects were very good. This is a very bad movie and even Drew Barrymore's desire was expelled from history. See if you want to: a) Hard to take tough harsh disaster. B) Just see how bad a film can be. This is a movie where I can use Clive "ninety minutes in my life I will never return" with some logical reasoning!
