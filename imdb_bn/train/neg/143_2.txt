If the scary movie fails, try to bring back the slaughter of the evil slavery due to the scary movie and shocking ridicule. Why do people like Halloween? Because it is real, new and has gone beyond what has happened. Why do they like scrolls? Because at least it's knowledge. Valentine is just a stupid slasher-flick that rarely has any gore. The plot is similar to Halloween and urban legend. And at that moment the killer comes to the screen, you know who it is, it is only sssssssssssooooooooooooo predictable. Teen slasher style get it to die! <br /> <br /> 10 out 0
