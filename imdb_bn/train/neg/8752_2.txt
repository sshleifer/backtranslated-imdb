I have seen this movie late last night and generally I am sorry for films when I am late. Although I tried, I could not fix the film properly, because the film was going on, it was getting worse. Although I know it can be a comedy but I'm not too funny at it. It was a particularly unrealistic, and witch screenplay in rural life. In this case, if you think that the life of a country is not exactly what it is. I must agree with the fact that some people were intelligent men, but the French people were really fake. I agree that it has tried a good lesson in the story, but overall I recommend that no more than 8 people will see it, it is very annoying.
