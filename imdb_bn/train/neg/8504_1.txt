Semana Santa is bad in the eyes. It's so wrong that I will not start where. So, let's see ... Mira Sorvino, her justice husband was shot while protecting her, for her police work was seized from Madrid. During the Holy Week (Semana Santa, see? ... everyone started to sleep ... told that they were too bad since the beginning), a killer forced his victims to make them calf-like calves. She is grouped with male champion pigs Olivier Martinez and excellent feeder atkine. He soon discovered that he would be the target of the killings (who wears red clothes). Why, oh, but why? <br /> <br /> Why is this question in my movie full of my head? <br /> <br /> Q: Why did you see it? Because I love Mira Sorvino (I have excused her for the first site buff) <br /> <br /> Why were we only 8 in the first week of the liberation war? Answer: Ah ah ah Spider-Man got the same day's release. But the film blasts on arbitrary reviews. <br /> <br /> Q: Why is this movie made? Answer: I guess. But the boy needs money for Mira. <br /> <br /> Why then ???????????? First of all, there are always some mistakes with productions including European. Here you have got a French-English-German-Italian-Spanish-Danish production. Yi-hah <br /> <br /> <br /> Then it wants to play the same 3G in the US Thriller / Slashar / Hoodadin / Mystery / whatever. Even VALENTINE, although there were unnecessary and badly scripted and shot, it was a lot better in obscurity and fun. <br /> <br /> Then, to give some credits for the story, the scriptwriter's story wanted to add some political eyesight. . False: Working like flash-like photography in flashbacks, it must be one of the most interesting topics in the movie. It can have the stick, it does not have to sit through the whole movie. Go to the Devil's Backbone (El Espinzo del Diablo) directly to Guillaume Dole Tros for some fun fun. <br /> <br /> Then Homophobia. Darts! The first victim is addicted to gay pair addiction getting stabbed to die S & M Drug. The annoying Olivier Martinez went on a dating agency held by a badly heavily overweight transvestive with a blonde platinum wig. Mera Sorvino's character calls a big dyke all the time. Do we need such stuff? No Just lazy abusive comments, just as ol'times. <br /> <br /> then mystery. Yipee. No clear purpose The first killings are common misconceptions, because it is a famous painting presentation. But not And the release of the murderer (of course, a terrible fascist) could have started from the beginning, as he appeared at the end of the movie, I think it is time to say, "The time has come to say," I watched this photo while melamulin, who is the killer and why he <br /> <br /> Director feels that he is a director. Mistake: There is no sense of suspicion, there is no sense to point out the actors, the speed change There is no knowledge, a giant, Mega-bore, the scenes of the Holy week are unnecessary (perhaps a co-production rule saying: Okay, shoot in Sevilla, but show some credits in this beautiful and historic city with Easter celebrations, where we are: a mystery for tourists Movie!) <Br> <br /> Then the actor is all wrong.More Sorvino bores death himself: without stabbed in the right hand he is virtually nothing, what he did The book was good (to replace the assassins, the Mighty ayaphrodaita ...) they did not exist. Olibhiyara Martinez ... Hello, anyone here? When the producers will know that he is not an actor or a feeling, however, have no power of speech? Feodor Atkine, soft and transparent We only respect this past century's best actress, Alida Vali (and I hope to have some more role in this present). He's the main attraction here as he is the only one to give life to his poor line. I will not mention other actors because they are only side-sized characters, unwanted and shallow. <br /> <br /> Incompatible direction, inconsistent actor, impossible plot <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
