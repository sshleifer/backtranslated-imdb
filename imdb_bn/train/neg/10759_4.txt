In spite of remarkable future design touches, this film does not live in expectations, with the strong assimual firmness and dependable cool performance of Will Smith. Clich√©s come thick and fast; (Waking up from a repetitive nightmare, the Macric cop has been discontinued by its hardness lieutenant, further listed - you can see the last mile). This movie is in phases - you do not think you've traveled anywhere; What is supposed to be a global disaster does not leave a clearly CGI Chicago. Robots are good for shutting themselves, but the 'crowd' scene looks more like bad Disney - CGI is again overdone. And if you destroy them by destroying the robots, why do they need 'nanites' injection? When you know it's a duff movie that starts to bother you before climax that's like fooled questions. It may be great, but it is a small part of its parts, which is basically due to the expected plot that can come from an action film of the past 40 years.
