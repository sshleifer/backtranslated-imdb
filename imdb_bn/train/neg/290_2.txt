Killer Tomato Movies This is particularly funny - you hate it or hate it. I personally like it, but the feeling in this fourth movie has gone. Tomato is not the same, rope hair, and even the actor is not funny. Because such movies are considered to be the only fun - so laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing. They should not really be the fourth part of the killer tomato trilogy.
