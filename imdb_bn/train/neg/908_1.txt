After buying a bargain bint DVD in the dominant amount of features listed in Dhaka, I popped it in the DVD player and all looked good. Nice animated menu and many more features ... but when I play the movie myself, what is frustrating. It's the worst thing I've seen and I've seen some bad movies in my time. The comment that praised the movie on IMDB has actually come from people who created this movie. So do not believe if you do not want to cash your cash!
