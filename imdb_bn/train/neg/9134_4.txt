I tried to like this program; I really did. I bought the pilot film, first VHS and later DVD. However, I could not read this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddy" (Cyber ​​Shepherd) fell in love with just one thing. I acknowledge some trickery in the program, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I greatly appreciate that dialogue. <br /> <br /> Basically, it was like '30 and 40 'with men like old sculble comedy movies. You get many debates, complaints, yelling and screaming. Many people obviously like such annoying love, but I hate it, so I never get on moon illumination. <br /> <br /> "Agnes" was just as entertaining as Alice Basley Haplal Assistant. It is very bad he had such little air time. The shepherd was beautiful in the eyes and I think women will say the same thing for Willis, but due to many debates between the two, finally I was stopped.
