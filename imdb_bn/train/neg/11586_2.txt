Elm is a nightmare on the street: children of dreams <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie. It has no escape. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character in the horror movie. But I can not be a fan but I can not see the movie in the middle. <br /> <br /> There is even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. Now they have just left. They do not even try. They are certainly producing, expecting a few simple dollars. <br /> <br /> The story does not attract your attention. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Coming back with a dream At the beginning we know that Alice will have to find her mother to stop him. And that's it. <br /> <br /> The story has been progressing slowly, since such a small plot means that it has become quite annoying after a few minutes of bad dialogue and horror. In fact that only awesome thing, acting, death is not even slightly cooler. <br /> <br /> The characters are so reluctant that we could not be less careful for them. <br /> <br /> Girls are as unnecessary as possible. The whole cast reminds me of a bad amateur theater group. I've seen good actors in the school drama. It's really embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wilcox still has some classes. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material just does not let her shine. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Stefan Hopkins, He tried some fantastic shot at the end but where the tone that Harlan and Craven had made so well in previous films is not available. <br /> <br /> Dream Child is just another unimaginable series. This is a film that gives a bad name in the Horror series. <br /> <br /> <br /> The very scary Freddy. It is very sad to see him now. A shoe that is not funny. A bad joke. Goodbye Freddy.
