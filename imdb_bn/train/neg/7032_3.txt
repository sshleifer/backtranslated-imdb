When Carroll (VENESA Hidalgo) starts looking at his brother's death, he starts to suspect some sinners more than "natural causes". As much as he found the truth around the truth, the more threatened his father-in-law, the Fiona (Helga Line), and other local Satanists <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The movie is full of lots of nudity and formal soft-core sex. Especially a believer in a young girl and goats will be believed. Unfortunately, all the puzzles in the world can not save black candles. Most films have total bore. Other than a scene I've already mentioned, sex sex scenes are frustrating and are certainly not sexy. Acting is the best spotty. Even the generic favorite Helgo line gives a frustrating performance. The plot really does not matter. His main function seems to be holding rude sex scenes string together. I'm only familiar with another film directed by José Ramón Larrez. Compared to the darkness of her daughters, relatively lover and horror mix, black candle comes off as an amateur. 3/10 best about what I can do
