Unfortunately, there is nothing surprising in this review that there is nothing to hide in this movie. Even if b. Although Masti did not break a master piece, he used to use his work with humor and madness, which made him a fun Eurotrash director. But it seems to have lost the last 10 years. This picture is empty, not to wake up from a sleep, but to sleep first in our first sleep. There is no gender, no blood (it seems to be a snake?), No actor, no conversation, bad like a 90TVV film. This is worse than its last cannon and junkie epic. So rest in peace Bruno, you keep our mind forever, thanks to James 3, Roberva, Rats, L'Athro Norfol, Virus, Crowel Jawl and some. So if you have appeared in B-Matte's new film by the spirit of Jeff Franco, pass it apart. However if you know the track below its old films in this excellent artisan's career and have fun.
