It should be one of the worst movies, the graphics are ridiculous and the script is frustrating, and the biggest question is how this little script is emptying the selection process. <br /> <br /> I like the movies that you see in movies of all kinds from deep plays, killing more men, so I can not say that I'm Piki. I've struggled to find something to compare it to, but I can not remember what I got together with it, maybe starships fighters 2. My opinion is crying to the movie god and I'm thinking of throwing my DVD player, but compared to this The effect is great. The acting should be fantastic and scripts should be rewarded. If you know a movie bad when you have a fun way, good folks are not one of these by minute minutes kill your soul.
