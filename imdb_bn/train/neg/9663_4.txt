How shameful the authors are, so terrible. I can be an American citizen, but I do not want to see the stomach of other Americans for one hour and half an hour to enjoy a film. I am very surprised that the remarks about how much jingostic, sensitive and dialogue really are spoken in this movie are very few. Historical flaws of the film are not fairly offensive as "U-571" (which converts British submarine to Americans), and you still feel a little feeling. Indeed, the Germans of this film do not appreciate Americans in battle scenes! How sad, unnecessary! I just want to say to the authors: It is clear to us that we can not capture real people in real life, under real pressure, and you have taken very well-tested shortcuts. Lucky for you will always be your sugar coated tripe grateful nationalist nutjobs.
