It was a copy of the 1942 Doris Day Classic, romance of high saas. <br /> <br /> The story line is less or less synchronous. Govinda is a sharp intellectual colleague who replaces husband in a tour. Queen daughter plays a friend of the college, who likewise liked her. In fact, the husband and wife tried to catch each other by trying to travel to each other in Bombay. <br /> <br /> During the trip, Govinda seduced another girl for Sanjib's wife and spied on her when she fell in love. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> They were pressed against each other for war criminals. <br /> <br /> This is a poor effort to copy the original classic and the songs are quite uncomfortable. The comedy is not slipping-stick and a lot of fun.
