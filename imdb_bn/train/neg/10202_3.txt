Films you made for the minorities killed are made for the TV but not so. Considering Bulk of the only actor of a note (though Michael Pitt seems to be going to great and better things), it is not surprising that the film goes far away from memory and is replaced by more important things. Like ... think when you go outside lock the door in front of you. Or when you come out of the shower to serve the clothes. <br /> <br /> Bullock played Casey Mayaider with a police case (not all of them) with personal problems. Together with his new partner (wet appearance Ben Chaplin), he is investigating the murder of a young girl. Perps Teenagers - Teenagers - Teenagers - Some think that they have planned perfect killings and executed executions. After the investigation continued, Casey and the main suspect Richie Heywood (Ryan Gosling) emerged from the war of Wills. <br /> <br /> Here's a worrying problem, two leads are frustrating. Bullock, though he is looking very nice, Rodney Dufferfield (actually, he would be better!) As a rigorous classical copy roles are credible. Chaplin, for his sin, is completely non-existent and I'm sorry he will have to try to break this movie on his civet Hollywood. At least Gosling and Pete, as suspected of conniving suspects, abandoned themselves adequately. As Doody Leeds was not bad enough, a story that someone sends to sleep and at the end of a highly anticipated (but unreasonable), it can manage before it gets the chance to shoot in the head. <br /> <br /> "The number killed by" is not going for absolutely nothing, even by a knockout naked view it is not released. Well, just a few but still not enough to save it. Forgetful, anticipated and unnecessary - this is a film that is not going to move the Cop style. Cassie probably said in his next case, there is nothing to see people here. Move along, keep moving ...
