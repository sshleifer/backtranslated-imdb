Bobby is a secret child who wants a lot of smile and sex. So he purchased a van helping this search. The length of the acting, the comedy is kind and the script is not more than a light string chain of clich√©s and cheap thrills. The filmmaker apparently wanted to capture some of the film's craze for some time, but it took long-term short. They even burst on Bobby's banana skin, because it supposedly adds the comedic value. <br /> <br /> I am struggling to find the release of the movie. If you like Davito, it's another classic Davito type role - but he's just there for a supporting actor and review quality.
