In the days before Gore and receiving sex, real horror films were created. Cass of Off, according to my guess, is one of the best, although other critics gave a mixed rating. In a strange way, it reminisces a few more in the theater in recent theaters. <br /> <br /> Director Antonio Margarithti rebuilt his own film in the title of this film in 1970. Spider (AKA Nella Stretta Morsa Del Ragno) Why did he not understand this work, although Rimik acted in Anthony Fran√ßaisea and Claus Kinsky and was very good in his own right. Perhaps he saw a good story and wanted to do more to American audiences. I do not really know It makes the original and colorful remix of black and white colors attractive. <br /> <br /> Bloody glasses are excellent Italian Gothic La Donza Macbra is considered an undiscovered work by Edgar Allen Poe, who "appears" in the film. Poe and Lord Blackwood, owner of a spooky castle, told American author Alan Foster (George Rivier) that he would not be able to overcome the All Souls Knight and survive. Foster accepts a bet on interest, but will soon forgive him, because he is a series witness of the murder done by ghosts. It seems that every few years once the ghosts return to life, they are destroyed for the rebuilding of crimes committed in life. Lord Blackwood has conveniently forgotten to tell Foster that all the souls of his next blood need his blood to resurrect himself. <br /> <br /> It does not take long to fall in love with Foster and the beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood (portrayed by impossible Barbara Steele), although their romance gets destroyed, because one of Elisabeth's Ghosts I will not end up in the end, but just say that the Blood Castle is a horror story as a romantic tragedy. <br /> <br /> Comment. This film is largely atmospheric by the Italian standard. My personal opinion is better than those of a real horror, and gradually black and white filming only increases it. With fairness, Spider's web was fine with its own color and even brilliant. I prefer lingering shots, have some patience for modern day managers. In fact, when Alan first enters the entrance to the debris, he takes a few hours apart from him in the room, roams around the room, faces his face and fears terribly. The audience is fully prepared and ready for the first time when the first ghost appears. There is a wonderful dialogue between the Allan and the Ghosts, which is not often done in some other common ghost stories. There is also a very visual, memorable scene for this type of film. Elizabeth's "killing" and drama scene (reminiscent of a dance drama similar to the death of Carnival's death in 1962) was particularly good. <br /> <br /> Sadly, some of the common interest visitors will ever hear, much less see, this image. It's embarrassing, because it's a cut over others. I received my copy from Sinter Cinema and I'm not sure that it can be purchased elsewhere. For those interested in this style, it must be seen.
