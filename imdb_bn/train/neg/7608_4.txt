I will admit that I do not expect much from the Roger Cromanne film. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. Yet in this case, I am very surprised. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> Miss Garland has made herself a nice shot, the next day her husband killed a murderer in the funeral. His first work is to close the local bar in violation of city curfew. The owner of the bar (expected) is trying to buy land in the hope of buying and selling through railways. However, Miss Garland hired a man to kill Mrs Garland, a thorn in his plan, and a bar metron. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Except for a few exceptions to wrong passes (except for the interior door, zip tracks, and two races waiting for a ride in the corner for the screen), the film is quite useful as a movie rent. However, Karamen could not stop his film from padding with the cruise scene, he was walking in other movies. <br /> <br /> Sterno says that Ghosle Opera is a horse of your time.
