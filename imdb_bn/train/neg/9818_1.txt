This movie raises several questions in my mind. First, Jennifer Tilly has managed to maintain her acting career this year based on the ridiculous voiceless voice and the limited range of Hammy facial expression she uses? Secondly ... Was the people of the world responsible for this objectionable and deeply adverse movie? And thirdly ... since people have been distorted enough to get distorted in such a way, there was no one in the system - studio, distributor, or anywhere - enough to get it done and enough to be released. You really have to find a very, very long way to make another movie as deeply as nasty ... and it is not billed as a horror movie - which can be seen as related to any validity of the film genre, it's Of course. The film ends with the worst ill madness, violence and abuse starting from the beginning, and these are not basically a feature of freedom. I'm not actually supporting censorship (which I do not believe) ... but I can not really see how anyone can draw some positively from seeing such a film.
