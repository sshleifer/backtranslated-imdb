what happened? What we have here is basically a difficult and potential courtroom and with a decent and gifted cast, but somewhere in the movie to lose it. Actually, it's not really going to happen. If Angelie was not truly pregnant we were a little excited after that, then she found out that after all, but that was. Steve Martin, who was very gifted and usually brought a lot to a movie, was terrible and his whole character was not important for this movie, except to make it more. I really liked to see more interaction between the original character, Kate and Angie, and perhaps a pure comedy, which was unfortunately not it, but probably did not try for a play with comedic elements. I think if the film did that, it was very interesting because both actresses were very funny in their own way and I would have been very rioting here.
