This movie reminds me that I missed some important scenes from the very beginning. Continuity errors and plots which suddenly stopped as soon as it began. I was very disappointed because I love Hooper Goldberg and Danny Glover, but always Danny Glover gives her taste and respect according to the preferences of her roles, for example "Grand Canyon". I just could not finish this movie, which seemed after eternity, but was probably more than an hour; We were close to it. There was no comedy, there was nothing about characters to sympathize or sympathize with them, there was no emotional rise in the film, and past clips were poorly edited, confusing, and unnecessary. There can be a great idea for a movie, even a play and not a comedy (although I think a comedy was good in this situation, because I like to see the white man look amazing and start acting like a totally stupid, it lets me laugh) My $ 1 credit wasted in the video store.
