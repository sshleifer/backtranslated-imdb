<br /> <br /> When I started watching this movie in Cinemax last night, I was surprised that it was made. In my opinion, cruel objectives are one of the best teen-based films made in years. This prequel was some things incongruent with the original. (Sebastian's father was married in wealth, then why was he a rich aunt on Long Island?) <br /> <br /> I found today that this is not a new film but rather a television series Manchester preparation. After listening to this, it made me realize that it is not like the movie, just like the buffer vampire slayer is different in the TV form. <br /> <br /> I think Roger Kumble probably finished the end of this movie, after which the series of Fox was not taken. It seems to be happening very quickly (Sebastian is becoming the male version of the conversation) and I do not know where he will go with the next episode, because it will not move towards the 1999 movie (which is directed at the new end.) <Br / > <br /> One thing that I do not like was that Sebastian and his father had married in this property, which is generally good in this area of ​​New York. Do not slice. , And Saat Katarin's mother was just an adult version, it does not seem like a woman that in her place a woman, not a man, will marry her social class. <br /> <br /> As a preview it is fairly hair. But I would be interested to see where this has gone as a series.
