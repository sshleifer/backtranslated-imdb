The film is an extra-long story of a classic novel that fails to capture the spirit of original courage. American citizen Patrick Soze was cast as British national hero Alan Quoterman despite his nationality. <br /> <br /> The story goes on changing both the story and the character of the "Hollywood-Eye" story. Fit more comfortable in acceptable mold. Until the film is known to the story, until it is familiar with the story, and some very badly played and deadly frustrating are affected by the order of the war. <br /> <br /> There is a bad collection of movies based on a horrifying addition to all of King Solomon's Mines and Alan Quoterman's legend.
