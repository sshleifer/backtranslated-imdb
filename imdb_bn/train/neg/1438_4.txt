Well! What can one say? First, this adaptation is more than 4 hours long for complexity (or lack thereof). Actors have tried really hard to do something about this movie but there are very little content for the time available. Swayzee is not really a Quatermain character. After watching the interpretation of Shane Connery of the great person "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen", Swayzee is not really grade. Winchester is not part of this chap part with the repeat rifle, there is no part of the power, miserliness, neutrality or humor, and everyone, including a direct doctor, is influenced by it, which, incidentally, from my point of view, thinks that cast as a more convincing actor. Some are pleasantly pleasing to vistas but have silly mistakes in cinematography. For example. When the happy group reaches the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible to the osis, only waiting for them to walk in. There is no exit (to the next shot) to get out of the mine. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I had the desire. <br /> <br /> Followers of the Russian leader Kotreman are a continuous stereotypical character that just shoots everything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Swayzee things that Should have She can not afford a hearty heart, life experience, and a brave lady with fair play ideas. <br /> <br /> 10 very few
