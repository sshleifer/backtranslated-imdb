This self-proclaimed "very talented artist" has managed to easily direct the worst Spanish movie of the 21st century. Emotions, solidarity, rhythm, lack of skill, humor ... it repeats again and in the same situation. It shows no character development. It does not show any violent and / or sexual content and does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub-genre. So in the first film it should be shown in the film as an example of "do not language" in the film. <br /> <br /> Where is the "talent" of BTW? There is a scene that has been shot almost identically; There are two scenes that have two or more master shots and for some reason it is quite dangerous to see action jumping from one master shot to another. The camera does not go around, as the "very talented artist" fears the lack of visual skills. Performing a major role like actors amateur, and supporting cast is very less credible. The script has more holes than the plot (if ever there are) ... <br /> <br /> A really frustrating movie and a talented director
