I was really frustrated with this movie really. It really started well, and created some great atmosphere and mystery, but eventually got round to express "monster" ... it has turned some psycho again with skin problem ...... again. Scream high-de-do Yet another brown movie ... just as we do not have enough yet. To be justified, "cripple" is really inauspicious, and he's going on the way and sounds strange that he makes quite pretty, but I'm sick of renting such movies, only to discover that the giant man, though a twisted, demented, freakish one. When I looked at all the conversation rats at the beginning, I was expecting some strange mice-hybrid hybrid ... it was disappointing when the crypt was released. <br /> <br /> This, this movie makes no sense to some things. (Spoiler) <br /> <br /> Why does the opposition kill the security guards? What is the point, without sticking up a great honking sign that "Hi I'm a PSYCHO and I live down here!" It seems that his stupid, and only Franka Potente character is prevented to get help. <br /> <br /> What is he eating there? I think that he was effectively wall-bound and only let loose the unexpected opening part of him ... so he was always climbing high and if so, why do they wander around him? Why is it so difficult to kill so deadly? He's not like thin, ugly and ultimate performance ... but it seems that despite the similar injury they continue. Scrap non-cycore letters in the image. <br /> <br /> DVD commentary is intended to empathize with the crippling we say, but I just find him cruel. This is an effective movie, but it has ruined many opportunities that make me sick.
