Roy Rogers and company "Syntouton" tries to bring life back - it's a Scrub City that can succeed if silver mining succeeds. Andy Divine (as "cookie") slapsticks around. Jane Frazi (as Carroll) lost a part of his deviations on Mr. Rogers's sharp layers. FO-Wing and Purple Rishder Riders stand-in for AOLL (or, is it singing?). Bob Nolan and Pioneer's son. James Finner (from Laurel and Hardy Films) added "Slapstick" in the description of "Grand Canyon Trilogy". A loose floor board delivers winning comedy performance. Mr Divine's cage has shaken his heels. Energetic people have performances, but - the material is not the grand. <br /> <br /> ** Grand Canyon Trill (1948) William Witten ~ Roy Rogers, Jean Frazzie, Andy Divine
