O Allah, so bad! The story was weak - in the best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even the kids were there. This image takes itself very seriously ... until they want to be fun. I saw this last week at the London Saawai Festival and the whole audience began to laugh at each scene. I think my favorite should not study opsalph! And I think they tried to see how many times they could crack in the only line of Nichollo, we'll be together ... it's our fate. I'm sorry, but the words for the first time lost all the money. <br /> <br /> And what was with Apple <br /> <br /> I suggest it as an American lesson: you can not animation, so please do not try. You just embarrass yourself.
