Hi everyone, if you've seen "Singing in the rain", then you dance to the scene of Gene Kelly in the rain. You also remember the number of Donald O'Connor's dances, "Make" M. Hass. "If you've seen" Royal Wedding ", then you remember Fred Astaire dance on the roof. If you've seen" GillHouse Rock ", then you can also remember the title of the King of the Coreyograde title itself. <br /> <br /> There are some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation, the closest was to Chuck McGowan's "I Can not Do". You've got some talented people at the ongoing level. The truth is not that a great dance film Richard Attenborough was responsible for this failure, he pointed to the camera on stage and thought it would be a good thing. <br /> <br /> Hearing the public to participate in the production of Broadway is not entertainment. If Douglas is in Western or comedy, he will be thrown very badly. When he is in the movie Michael Douglas, he is right. It's not working here. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly, Cast was better than Michael. There was a good movie stage production that could be made using the song, but Anyone should figure out how to film it. <br /> <br /> Next time they do this one I hope they call me first <br /> <br /> Tom Willlett
