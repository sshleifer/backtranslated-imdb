I'm starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this image. Do not read more ... come here, bind your eyes! The main heroine, who always lives in other slash films, is murdered here. There, I saved you 79 minutes of your life. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Poor junk <br /> <br /> <br /> Students of priests and colleges got bad rap here. They are portrayed as foreigners, socially dead, who manage many internal problems for the behavior of the junior college's campus life ... and the college students become even worse. <br /> <br /> "Splatters University" There is nothing to fix your VCR when you do not have anything to do, although I would recommend to show your head cleaner tape but it would be more entertaining. <br /> <br /> It is rated for strong physical violence (R). , Impurity, very short female nudity, and sexual references. <br /> <br />
