Generally as a big fan of Gorilla movies, I hope that it will be great - and for Gorilla influences, they were quite good, but - I can only write about this flop. The film is based on a true story, but in reality it does not even come near the "body" which actually happened - in real life, the famous Gargantua, our supposed "heroic" Gertrude Lintz, known as a female animal who is very well-known for the well being of his animal There was a good interest. As far as Buddy is being portrayed as aggressive, it was a total imagination, and in reality Gorilla did not resort to such behavior at any time. The friend escaped from the wooden piece (not a plush bus room like the picture painted in the movie) to find shelter and comfort around the house to find shelter and comfort for the home, which fears Gartrude Lintez to sell him. No, Badi was not released in a gyzycological paradise surrounded by an arranged tree in the Gorilla family - he was left deeply in a piece of wood behind the garage, for which only a single light bulb was sold for comfort. Circus - where he had lived a good life until he died before an event in Miami (actually historically the oldest Gorilla record), leaving him in a good way by placing him on a peanut until his death. Also notice, in film, how the body grows, but chimpanzees do not ever age. (Chips were not raised alongside the path alongside other animals including Buddha, pictured in the film)
