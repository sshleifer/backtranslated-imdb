Tierney is an authentic hard guy, but this movie is usually under its influence in celebrating misfire from normal RKO. This script is considered as OJ Simpson in about 10 condominium dinners. Just count on Tierney's incredible car companions a lame excuse after another for his evacive and violent actions. It is about old clich√© "movie only happening" here in spades. Then the man is playing the guards, who seem to wander from the Www Fields comedy, a musical instrument, wasting the mood of the process. Static single-room sets do not help in any way, and there is obvious lack of sense of feeling for the director and also the element. Then add both missing imagination and pay off a final car, and the results are quite flat. In fact, this movie is only found in station-house scenes where the hard-pressed police discover the hidden power of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney's career is not really gelled. I was getting bigger in that big as a hard guy off-screen and getting into a sleazy scrape after one was mainly due to the gathering. Its ice cold system and emotional reminder reminds me of Lee during his tough time at the best time. However this project has worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising silent title, it is frustrating.
