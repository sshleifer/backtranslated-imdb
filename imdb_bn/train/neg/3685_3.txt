The main reason to see "Red Eye" is that of Rachel McAdam, who provides a great performance and a wonderful hotel manager, On the other hand, Sylley Murphy is so bad that she has become cartoonist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> A summary of the plot. Rachel McAdam's character (Lisa) operates in a hotel where the new Hard-Named Homeland Security Director plans to stay that night. Rachel is returning from the funeral in Miami, but the fielding call from her assistant before leaving the airport. In the meantime, someone is standing outside outside his father, Joe (played by Brian Cox), if CÃ©line Murphy (Jackson) is ready to kill him by calling. All Lisa should call the hotel and transfer the director's suite where Jackson's partners are planning to shoot a guided missile (fishing boat) to kill the director and his family. <br /> <br /> So, here are some plot holes or strange coincidences: <br /> <br /> 1. Jackson finally believes Lisa to call, and in the middle, the airplane phones lose their connection. Lisa is trying to fraud that she is calling, but eventually, a guy across the Jackson side's side is calling a call and ordered his phone to die. Jackson holds the phone from Lisa. <br /> <br /> 2. At one stage, Jackie's head lisena and she must have been lost ... but only for 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> 3 Jackson Lisa (unusually large) wrote a note in the mirror of the sculpture, and he beat her around him. Miraculously, anyone who hears 11-year-old daughter, of course, is discounted. <br /> <br /> 4. While landing Lisa stole Jackson's cellphone with a pen in the neck, and created a crazy dash for the exit, the middle of the 18 rows of seats and permanent passengers were placed. Even after finding a passenger with the stuck in his throat, flight advocates forced Lisa to open the door to Jeis-Way. <br /> <br /> 5. OK, those are all reasonable (if not extremely unlikely). But here's where it gets really stupid. Lisa enters the terminal at Miami Airport, and there is no cell phone signal (there are great cell phone receptions at every major airport in America). <br /> <br /> 6. He traveled through the airport with Jackson and no security officials delayed him. <br /> <br /> 7. Jackson, who lost Lisa at the airport, pulled the train from the gate to the terminal, lost some of his voice from the pen, but he still understood a bit. However, he does not bother to call his guy outside Joe's house. (PS: There are no trains at Miami Airport, but they have shown that they have seen a lot of terrible things like the airport in Orlando. <br /> 8. Lisa steals a car and away the road. Of course this time, when she goes to make a call , Then the cell phone calls "low battery" and soon closes (when will it stop using this inactive plot device?). <br /> 9. The phone is still called "low battery", only when the Lisa fishing boatOn the 40th floor starting from the room reached the room of his assistant to rescue the director and his family from the guided missile directed by the room, of course they expect that the hotel is surrounded by the sea, so the missile may be launched in the first suite. As a result, the need for the entire Lisa-Jackson plot has been denied, what is the story here? The real room in the room was a scary scene among the only rooms in the hotel? However, just before the missile hit everyone came out. <br /> 10. Lisa travels to Joe's house to save his father just to watch out the killers. . Although he is putting his jeep in the house and running on it (though he is shooting on it), nobody seems to be seen in the neighborhood or bothered to stop. <br /> <br /> 11. Jackson arrived at Joe's room (we could not see ... maybe another head butt). Then explained to Lisa that he did not kill his father because he wanted Lisa to die first. (Please break me. What is this? The cartoon on Saturday morning?). <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie (about 20 minutes), Jackson challenges Lisa around the house, and she beat him slowly. Of course, the real killer (who may have been played by Jason Statham) went through the first 30 seconds with Lisa (or in that case, who was not a trained killer). During this retreat, Jackson jumped out loudly. <br /> <br /> 13. Finally, Jackson became stronger, and when she was going to kill Lisa (you guessed it) she was shot by Joe. <br /> So here's my suggestion ... Tell Ves Cravan to be scared. Or maybe he should be together with Michael Bay (who evenly points out the foolish "Island") and must create "Red Island".
