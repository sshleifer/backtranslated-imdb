I was lucky enough to see this at the Sidewalk Film Festival. Completely Sidewalk was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail of the coffin. Being a fan of Luis Carroll's 'Alice' fans, I was very excited about the premiere of this movie, which was more uncomfortable just to see it. If they are generally treated well then I'm passionate about modern re-statements. Usually it is interesting to see parallel between past and present in a familiar story. Unfortunately this movie was less than a modern recovery and a pop culture distortion. The main character adaptation seems to be kids and is generally awful boring. Perhaps it did not help that the actors were not very good at all. Most performances were ridiculous at the top, which I think is an effort to create bad scripts or bad script. I do not smile once through the duration of the film. All jokes are not the current events due to the old references that are sure to lose their brutality. In fact, the only brightness in the film is that the first is going on to meet White Rabbit Alice, but then the score was a bad imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I'd say that the conversion of the game to Cruve was awful in a dance drama closing. It was a doubt the lower point of the film. <br /> <br /> What fun is it? Do not watch this movie. After his conclusion I was really angry.
