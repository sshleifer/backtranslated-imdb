A superb obvious thriller-by-number, which only becomes possible to hide anything in wrapping. I was mainly watching for the English language performance of Isabella Huppert. It was not great, but then it was a weird role. I would not be surprised that a few weeks later the script has been half-contributed to the cutting-room floor. <br /> <br /> Acting is the least interesting subject for this movie. . Steve Gutenberg looks like he is trying to muscle his role, which everybody has told him that he has. It is a sensationally stupid sequence which is proposed that its sexual power will be able to help treat PTSD. This is an unexpected performance. Elizabeth McGoughen is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it is a little comfort. 3/10
