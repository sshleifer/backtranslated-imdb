I was in the initial love of this movie that led me to find out, but the problem quickly found that to know what would happen in the first 20-30 minutes (the doubles will come behind the mirror and <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It seems like a movie to search for a story or more compelling script, 80-90 minutes Sounds scary in the design of the atmosphere above the atmosphere, the atmosphere and it really is not cut, it actually becomes quite soft.
