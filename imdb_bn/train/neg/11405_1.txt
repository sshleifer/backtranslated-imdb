I had this watch at school. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, do not even watch the movie. Do not disturb. You will be so frustrated My teacher is supposed to be good at it How was he wrong She even slept through a little bit. The movie's actors were just bad. There were the best actors in the old man and it's not saying a lot. It has awesome plot with terrible characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly say it was not a dot. The script was neutral and confusing. The point in the film was when I furrowed my brows and said "what?" There were also very loose ties and plot holes. It was just terribly awesome.
