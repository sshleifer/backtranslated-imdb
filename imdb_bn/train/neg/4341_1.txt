It's so long that I stopped the DVD ... maybe halfway through It was very weak, I could not pay enough attention to tell you how far it was. Although I really wanted to believe that the image of the young Carlito would be somewhat different, I could not buy it. I do not really blame the actors because I think it's a script that can be flat. I saw myself laughing a few times, but I do not think these lines wanted to be fun. <br /> <br /> It's only for saving, I bought it on a 2 DVD set and I've paid the original price for myself alone. In this case they should have given only the classic stand alone.
