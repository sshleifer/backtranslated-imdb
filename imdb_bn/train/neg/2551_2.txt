"Awesome American Pie", my girlfriend and I were sitting in front of TV waiting for the comedy ... and it's not the same. If you do not feel like a jackass, sometimes you will not laugh at all. It's even a erotic movie, which was not something at least, it's about sex ... <br /> <br /> What's this? An unintended plot is related to a person who wants to lose virginity (the emptiness of originality, I think it is "losing it") and the gang of his friends. The remaining characters (such as girls) come and go for any credible reason. Come on, even Darfes (so easy: "Dwarfs Majo Ho Ho" ...) is very much like a TV (as the video is shown throughout the film), and most of the girls must be amateur <br /> <br /> Shocking movies Amateur, badly produced, and not all fun. Children and peers love to see it with friends because of oaths and sexual jokes. More than that, do not even think about renting this movie.
