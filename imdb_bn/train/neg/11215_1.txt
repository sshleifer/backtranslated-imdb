Okay, this movie is very good at first, though it was running fast and even though it had just $ 60,000 in budget, but if you see your sister dead in a lake and found who killed him, why would you chase? Shoot him around him with the only bullet and drag him into the gun and destroy him and try to run away from him and kill everyone? You also found your sister dead in the lake and found a pillar and found the murderer why do not you think the killer killed the police? At the end of the film, when she worked as her sister, who was a waitress and she was talking to the bad guy, she had to meet him somewhere and told him that she died and what happened to her "evidence". I do not know I was not happy at all. This film could have been even better if it lasted longer and the acting is even better and ultimately it is not so bad! Do not waste your money in this movie because you wrote a review here and would not be happy.
