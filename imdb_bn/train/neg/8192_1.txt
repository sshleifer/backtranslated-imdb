Well, I have to say, this movie is so bad that if I can not do it for the review, I would have been out of the house. The worst part of Anand, I wanted to see it so badly that I went to the city, the list of newspapers was wrong because 10 times 10 $ parking was given. Vince Vaughn always plays what he does - John and Travolta, the film that he is seen to be seen by someone else. However, the plot is possible - in the east it seems to be great, but it is full of ridiculous, expected, weak plots turn points. And I hope that it will be a Christmas movie where Christmas Daydan does not have to be saved, and Santa does not need replication, but Nap. The only cool part was the seam side, and the little baby boy was the best character. I'm sure this movie will be great for young kids, but for adults, it is so long that it will be sitting through it.
