Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in English and this photographer has to read it. I hate how the author uses spark notes for the novel. This movie is unbearable for reading. If you read the book <br /> <br /> The entire 'red room' played so far that I wondered why they did not want to enter it. The book "Red Room" is predicting the whole story and Jane's life for the rest of the year. Helen Barnes was treated so badly in this movie, I'm sure she died and moved quickly. In the book he was one of the most compelling characters and he was not in the red head. The Christian theme of life is missing from his life and the rest of the movie. Make yourself a favor and miss this movie and read this story with the expertise of Charlotte Bronte.
