A big disappointment. It was one of the best UK crime dramas / detective shows of the 90s that developed an impressive title character directed by Robby Colton of Scotland. However, there is no need to add some of this off-off, and perhaps an expected event may result in abusive deterioration due to the expected expectations raised during the long hiatus. Coltrane is not really given a lot, the unintended killer is spending more attention, and what he has to do, he feels uninvolved, almost annoyed. Ex-soldier's stories have written books and attempts to update our life in Calltrain's life seem lightweight. Perhaps the whole series was in front of the writers instead of these two hours, but they wrote it in more depth. For example, leave it and see the old cracker 90 that is far too far.
