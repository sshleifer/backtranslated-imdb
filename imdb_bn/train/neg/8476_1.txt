There was a terrific excuse for this movie ... a movie First of all, the welding may have been better; Catalina's main character did not see anything like her TV mother. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot was pathidic. It was extremely clich√© and expected. The end was very frustrating and tasty. (But that's all I'll say about that). <br /> <br /> While Bag's nail nail, Kelten (Jordan Hinson) was crying, but the girl could not cry! There was no tears streaming down her face, just a few incredible sobs. She is not always a dynamic actress at all. He gave a little smile to the same fake that duck on the lizzie Maguire (SP?) Mountain. That's when the movie was very good, just went plain bad. He was acting really looked it up. <br /> <br /> <br /> This story was really bad! Since the 1990s, each cliche was like a mix of child film that everyone was sick - just bad! <br /> <br /> I gave it an 'F', because it was so hard that, b / t / w, I saw it when I was babysitting). <br /> <br /> <br /> If you are 9 or younger then you may like it. ;)
