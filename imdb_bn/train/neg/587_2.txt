This movie bravely divides itself from the wonderful "documentary" of the human body, if it oddly dislikes viewers. In one scene, the camera closes at a teenager's 50-foot jit, as a teenager rashes and pulls fluid from it. On the other hand, the camera is semisubmerged in half-digested food and the plum acid folds. A final tour de force, take a harrowing ride visitors through a forest of the camera ... teenage bog hair. Unfortunately, I'm not making any of this. You must of course watch this movie, however: bring your vomit bag and pasta salad in the past.
