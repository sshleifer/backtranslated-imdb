I was enjoying this movie for most of the time, but I feel like I was watching a child movie. I honestly believe that some people wrote a PG script and then decided to add some blood, nudity and language while filming. Let's give it a big one. Child children believe in magic that "babe" (dry) or "Outfield in the Outfield" exists in the movie, which defeats the evil teeth Parikh. Parents believe their ability to see ghosts and defeat the teeth using this skill. When I bought this movie, I thought it would be a B-Film reaction that would be a terrible dark fall; Somehow manage to make a good film with 1/4 of the money, but they do not. They made a bad film and probably lost the amount of fall in the amount of darkness.
