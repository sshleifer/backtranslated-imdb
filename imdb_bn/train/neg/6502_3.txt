To write, write and star in my own movie, I will probably choose something about robot women with guns. However, Anthony Hopkins, probably decided to create a weird movie that has ever been seen. "Slipstream" is a movie that is so weird that David Lynch may even see the person next to him and "what's going on?" Say it. <br /> <br /> This is a movie where a scene, a man crosses the road on a yellow car facing right, which suddenly turns into a pink car on the left side. This is a movie where two characters have conversations with random people smiles and pistol climbing shots. This is a film in which a man only starts talking about the "badist's attack" for the actor of that particular movie and suddenly looks like himself (and then disappears in thin air). <br /> <br /> It is a film that decides to throw out the need for a coherent conspiracy directly outside the window, and there is no reason to change it using black color and white color as well as fifteen different editions. <br /> <br /> < > <br /> I must appreciate Hopkins (many of whom show multiple characters) in order to choose actors in this film. Those who are involved in throwing themselves into the role, even if they probably do not even know what they are actually doing. One of my favorite hats was the Christian Slater, who was fascinated by falsely making fools and singing American national anthem. <br /> <br />, quoted by Anthony Hopkins, that he has made this movie a joke and is probably the best way to add "slipstream". It's a joke to the audience. You will see it from the beginning to the end, trying to understand what is happening and hoping that the answer will come, only it will discover that the answer is not really that. What is the fifth of this particular trick, only Anthony Hopkins will know. <br /> <br /> I have mentioned David Lynch before and I am a special fan of that special director. I will assume that Anthony Hopkins will share my love for the choices of "Twin Pick", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway". However, "Slipstream" is not as happy with any of Linch's films despite his many strategies (although I'm surprised that no one talks to "slipstream"). It is much more chaotic and random - another critic mentioned here, this is the film version of Alzheimer's Disease. There is no doubt that there is a small number able to see it and draw something from there. Unfortunately for all of us, the "slipstream" becomes a boring and confusing experience because of the rapid involvement of Hopkins. <br /> <br /> Look at your own risk.
