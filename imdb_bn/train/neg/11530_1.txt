In the last 10 years, I have worked in 3 different Indie Professional Wrestling Organizations, managed several Pro Wrestling (2 backward wrestling stars), have worked in 2 different Wrestling TV programs and have voiced and commented for many wrestling DVDs. I do not fully see the level of amateur amateur stupidity, lack of talent and skills, and the level of shoddy production found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. This list also includes the complete misuse of the word as a wrestling video. Shot with a low dollar video camera, it is basically the main video of the fight for kids in the back yards. Sound quality is bad, video quality is bad, and terrible acting. "Wrestlers" wear temporary dresses, including hand-painted T-shirts and ski masks, and wound up each other by participating in different types of items and in half competitions. Sometimes "matches" are grass. Sometimes a trunk yard trampoline. All are poorly executed and executed with a shameless lack of skill in any wrestling. In short, do not bother with this stinker. Whether you're interested in this DVD or academic (both in my case), you'll be very disappointed.
