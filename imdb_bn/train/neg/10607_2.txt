Jean Claude Van Dam created public signals and tried to save his career. But, that movie saved him? I think he goes to hell after he dies. <br /> <br /> In the first minute, we can see an advantage inside, where you can see the bad guy in the film. Scary, huh? But not as scary as acting (the details are followed). <br /> <br /> Then, we saw a black girl in Dam (do not remember the name .... it does not matter), trying to escape from some muscles. Of course they are new universal soldiers. More muscels, less brain (just like movies). After a while, Van Dam fought Goldberg, but then "Mission" was canceled. It was just a test (this movie is a test for our nerves?). This proves that Van Dam is the new Universal Soldier project (the government's first movie that it thinks is the most reluctant thing that works for the government by seeing Van Dames character). But it's a signal. And there is a "story" to come. Ah, I forgot. She has a daughter. Very important for "story". <br /> <br /> Almost 20 minutes later, a super computer listens to the closure and closes the project. Of course, he gets angry and activates all the soldiers to kill everyone. Van Dam escapes from this facility but the computer sends some soldiers (it wants Van Dam as a soldier - because he is the best (really?)) And guess, Goldberg is one of the raiders, who always got a stupid sentence for the audience, before he asskicked. Ridiculous? Yes, just like the rest of the picture. <br /> <br /> After some "stories", Van Damme tried to rescue his daughter (his wife - the first film reporter). It comes to a final show where Van Dam beat a bad guy and you can see the most expensive movie on the whole movie (please see for yourself. It's funny to say it.) <br /> <br /> You see this movie is a waste of time . <br /> <br /> Do not look so. But if you do, keep a six pack with you!
