Well ... I have to say in front of other comments written before, that the only good thing about this movie is that a person saw a little like Jason Donovan, reminding me of my youth. I have no idea that it won a prize, and even though I'm sure it made enough effort for an effort, it was a result because the final result was shouting at 90 foreign soap operas. The plot existed, the movie was frustrating and the level of performance in a level was similar. It was unfortunately unusually long and sub-plots were incredibly unreal .... For example ... If your best friend is asleep, after 6 years of 2 weeks, you are asleep with your ex-boyfriend but you are not good at all. Friends It was all imagination. It's over here! Oh yes, and weird 90's house / soft core India was upset!
