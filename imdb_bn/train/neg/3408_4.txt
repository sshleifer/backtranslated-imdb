I was in the second grade, 12 years ago. I think it's clear. We were learning about the place. All the little kids want to go to the place, right? Well, I saw this, I was so scared that I was suddenly caught up on the spot with a little psycho-robot mind. I had no idea that I was in a movie. I think it's some news program or something. I think this was my own version when people were exposed by the radio program 'World of Words'. So, recently, I got to watch this movie again, realizing my favorite actor, it was Jacqueline Phoenix (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was smiling at the dramatic part and even hard smile at the acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she comes at a slow pace, have you ever noticed? I do not think you will talk slowly or slow down because of being in space. <br /> <br /> The best part is when Andy Oxygen becomes unconscious by the tank, and begins to float behind closed doors. . Little Max is trying to drag him. Suddenly, we were completely closed on Max's face (slowly) "What's Hot?" I had no idea.
