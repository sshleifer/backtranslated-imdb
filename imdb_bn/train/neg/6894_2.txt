It's a tragedy that you're sorry to see which movie you're trying to do, and it's pretty obvious that it's far less than a symbol. Students of this film will take this as a lesson and a warning. There is an idea that will be graduate. He wants total control. So he writes, manages, produces, best produces his own film himself. Generally, his idea is far beyond his budget. Usually he can write an overblown script with each tag line full, he can come up with. Generally, he is more interested in the story's grand suave than the diverse cat working with actors in separate scenes. Generally, he ended up with a weak film in an effort to create miracles in a small budget. Usually, he ends up with a few conflicts (we can not do justice by calling the scenes), it seems that he wrote at the age of 12. And usually end up with a badly played scene that fails to capture the audience. When you look at the judges from this perspective you can immediately say it's just normal fares.
