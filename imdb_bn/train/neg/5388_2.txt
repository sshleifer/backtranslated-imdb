There's a good movie hidden here, but it's not. The basic idea is good: to explore moral problems that face a group of young people. But the logical reasoning is so complex that it is impossible to get involved. <br /> <br /> For example, our four heroes (understandable) paranoid about mysterious air infections, which often wiped out all mankind. Yet they do not wear others, surgical masks. Sometimes they're fanatical about erupting with an area bleach to be touched by the infected person. Other times, they seem completely unknown <br /> <br /> Worse, after these weeks of new murder or killing the world some weeks or months, these people always behave like new beginners. They do not bother accumulating appropriate equipment, or food. They are running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere forever. They do not accept primary alert when visiting strangers. And after wading through the body rolling bodies of the whole human race, they are as sticky as the shelter debutantes. You will be surprised how they can survive this long ... and even if they did, then why would anyone want to make a movie about them? <br /> <br /> So when this conflict gets disturbed on morality, it is impossible to take seriously the level of action, the search of their souls seriously. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The screenplay of the discarded young man James T. Cork may have been cut off, when it shows isolation. But in the career he played the same note: arrogant and unsteady It is not impossible that it constitutes its entire dramatic range. <br /> <br /> On the positive side, the film looks * excellent *. It's an over-sharp, saturated look that's really suitable for Southwestern US locals. But that can not save the thin (and annoying) letters that really weak writing or paper. Even if you're the last public fan of the world, you'll be able to see the pain of your career.
