Inspector Gadget was probably my favorite time of 80's cartoons. I enjoyed the first and second seasons of the series and the Christmas special 1992 "Save the Christmas Inspector Gadget". Some gadget fans try quickly to criticize the second season of the show (1985), but then it should be compared with the DIC's 2002 "The Last Case of Inspector Gadget: Claus Revenge" publication, they will get gold free in the second season. <br /> <br /> Being a gadget fan, I could not prevent the animated inspector gadget from seeing the gadget which is not related to the gadget à¦¼. I bought the picture, and I swore to myself that I would be motivated; I knew that sometimes artistic freedom will be taken from the original series. I was not ready for what I was about to visit. <br /> <br /> <br /> Contrast for this movie: * Humor does not exist from the original series. <br /> <br /> * The absence of action for fifteen and fifteen (mostly roughly the same series of gadgets), <br /> * Soap and Levi have no original music, and the existing score is sub-par. (I understand that soap now has its own production company, but at least "Inspector Gadget Christmas Sevens" was music in addition to good soap.) * Do not expect to see any gadget gadget that has made the show so beautiful, such as gadget-copper, gadget-braille, Gadget-malllet, gadget-coat (which is not used to be the same thing as it used to be), as well as its other hats and hand gadgets Uli. In this film, his gadget had a telescopic look instead of the springs. That kind of stuff bothers the real fans of the show, and just do not need to change. <br /> <br /> * The original series gadgetMobile is now fast talking, the supposed "hip" is convertible. All fans gadget gadgets in the original series enjoy transforming van gadgets and vice-sculptures. <br /> <br /> * Chief Quimbi is now very small and gentle and even gadget means. He was always unsteady in the original series, but it pushed the situation a bit further. <br /> <br /> * Penny and no computer computer. <br /> <br /> Is there any positive in this movie? ? All right, here's ... <br /> * Maurice did a good job of taking responsibility for the Great Don Adams as an Inspector Gate in March. <br /> <br /> * In one scene, a real villain in the combi cartoon series: Great Weambini <br /> <br /> Looking for more abandonment reasons for this movie? Well, you're out of luck. Choose life and be loved by those who are living. There is a purpose even if it teaches a lesson in most situations of life. Learned here: Keep the original formula! "If it does not break, do not fix it." True gadget fans should clean this film; You must be frustrated. <br /> <br /> I hope, DIC and scream! After the publication of "Inspector Gadget: The Origin Series, Volume 1" of 2006, the factory continued to have more versions of the original series, which included the first 22 episodes of the series. As a lover of the real gadget fan, 80's animation lover and many other DIC programs, I encourage you to buy the "Inspector Gadget: Original Series, Volume 1" and "Inspector Gadgets Christmas" DVDs which are excellent and sure to be good memory.
