"Will Triphof", I can only say this movie terribly, even in the historic times of the time, we have also measured against the "criteria". Naturally all of it is fully fabricated and prejudicial. What will the German campaign of 1930 hope? Unfortunately, the presentation value itself is hackneyd and cheap. It is so ridiculous that the contemporary Germans kept the theater holding their noses. In a trend known for its original appeal, originality and lack of unexpected flaw-lead, this film does not qualify as "bad". It must be significantly improved to achieve that status!
