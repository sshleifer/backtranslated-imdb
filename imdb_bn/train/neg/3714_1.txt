This film can be rewritten in the 1978 Warren BT movie "Heaven Can Wait", but it was written for Rock Stud-Up comedic style. The compound is similar: Lance Burton (Rock) returned to Earth as someone else before working out of his life and working with the contractor of God, Mr. King. As BTV movie; He chose the murderer Charles Wellington, a rich white man, because he will return to Wellington's house during the assassination of Sony Jenkins (Regina King). The role of Mrs. Wellington and her boyfriend is suffering from this rebuilding and the idea of ​​pulling black white multi millionaire, which tries to trick Sony into a black comedian, does not work. Intercoms also show Rock as a Wellington, and then, as a real 'white' Wellington, unfortunately fails. The basic bot can be improved in the plot - which does not itself depict the concept of death after its own life - but they are certainly not found in "down to earth".
