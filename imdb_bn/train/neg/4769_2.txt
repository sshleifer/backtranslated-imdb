Sadly it was confused. The end of this movie ended stank. The clock was difficult to see because I explained it to Clarissa Niklodian every day. I loved him Then the next thing I got was he did an expansion in Maxim and he was fantastic! I saw this movie in an accident until I heard anything about it. I could not believe he would give something that would be seen in his name with his name. Everything was wrong about it, but it seemed somewhere somewhere that the team was really trying to save a solid ship. Very bad .. I hope he continues to act and I want to see him with a real cast in the real movie.
