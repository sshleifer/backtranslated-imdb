When I noticed that "Hamish Macbeth" was being broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. I was then lucky to see the darn thing. I'm wonderful about the Scottish Constable. C. Biton's books are worshiped. Book Characters are entertaining and very good writing. The power that is responsible for this mish-mash has never been seen in the books of Biton. There is nothing called "Hamish Macbeth" with the series. Besides the lack of familiar character, I found the whole show a lot of loud. It seems as if the actors feel that their lines will shout and shout to each other. If you m C. Biton's boyfriend loves Hamish Macbeth but this garbage will not waste your time.
