This vague failed TV pilot can be found in the special edition "Burning Saddles" Extra 30th Anniversary DVD. Imagine the movie without the adultery, humor, or writing skills. But all the trappings of a 70 's seat-less show on a common lam have been done with an intruder delightful track and you still will not have any idea about how this failed show was like. What did Lou Gusset Jr. think of when he signed this disaster? This is probably the worst thing he's (and yes I'm including the first "Punisher" movie and "Iron Eagles 3".) Steve Landesburg, I do not understand that he can not talk nonsense. <br /> <br /> My grade: F.
