I can not believe how popular this show is. I consider myself a weird sci-fi fan. I read countless science-fiction novels and enjoyed many Saifai films and TV shows. I will not really consider this true sci-fi. All the episodes I was sitting in was a hairy, wait-down version of the Star Trek episode, which can make something interesting or exciting. <br /> <br /> It's basically a bunch of people standing around ARMY fatigue, talking about annoying things, which sometimes go through the stargate and end up on a planet that looks like the Earth, the human being can see and hear With people! It looked very low budget. All of the characters forgot a dimensional cutouts, and humorous attempts to fall flat. It tries to be fun when you see a commercial with a famous athlete, but he does not think so. It's just sad. <br /> <br /> The movie was also terrible. You can do so with a portal through space, but the place where ARMY people go is everywhere! This shows no imagination! I actually did a few years ago (based on the Alien Nation movie) TV series "Alien Nationation" was very good. That show was actually good story lines and decent letters. I'm not crazy about "Allian Nationation", but it was great compared to that cats! Also, like the new "Blaster Galactica" series, copies of "Stargate" look and feel. The long movie very closely! Whenever they can have special effects on "toilet flushing" during the stargate.
