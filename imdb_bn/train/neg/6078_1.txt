I rarely comment on movies but I have read another comment and I can not believe that this celluloid congratulates the garbage. I know that they have some people who have some agenda but are able to take it with it; Unfortunately acting, shooting badly and directing the director was that it was made when the director was taking it. I'm not going to concentrate on the sexual orientation of the movie involving little kids because filmmakers must know what they want and what their audience wants. I can say that this is a terrible movie, the material is poor and objectionable, the production is amateur and I'm glad they could not make this movie as of today.
