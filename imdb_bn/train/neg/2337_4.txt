I do not preach about this ... it's really a bad movie ... it did nothing to me, the only real scene where everybody comes together in the party, and playing a beautiful song, the best part of the movie was a bit better and beautiful ... The best part ... otherwise there is nothing to suck the viewers in this movie. There is no story in it, there is nothing to think like some people, there is no coordination in the story ... it was more than Anderson's 'Magnolia' effort to repay, which was brighter, but it failed vaguely ... Well it's light and easy to see, but it's movie clips too. Maybe you write a story first before creating a movie ... 4/10 One of the worst Belgian movies I've seen
