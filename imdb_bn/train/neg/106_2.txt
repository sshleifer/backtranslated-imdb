First seen 8/3/2003 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Brad Sykes): Uninterrupted 3-D film about meat-eating jumbo in one of three stories in the movie Chronic. And yes, we'll see zombies eating human flesh part of the 3D people !! Wow, no !! The real story of a zombie movie that has time and time, but usually produces a zombie movie does not eat the actual meat. That original zombie classic has made well. Eating meat is just throwing in an extraction. We are actually annoyed in the chunks of these three parts because lam (evening-zone-like) is easily understood and publishes slow-pencil finhes. The last story is actually a story starting with the movie (being a so-called investigator investigator in the city) and of course we also see zombies eating meat together. Well, I think I said enough. Look at the classic, this is not 3D bore-feast.
