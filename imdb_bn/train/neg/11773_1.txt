I have been hiding on these boards for a few years due to the lack of intelligence that is communicated through the phased reviews published in the IMDb space of this movie. I saw this movie as a courtesy of Subway's New York Asian Film Festival (one of the best films of this year, June Sang, June Snake, Chao no NGI, Survival Style) and every day sorry that the scene of the movie <br /> <br /> I'm sure you can read the complimentary summary of the subway movie clash, which I probably did not mistake My friend the film dragging. The description has created such a horror movie that I wanted for some time, which depends on cruel terrorism rather than cheap terror. P was actually different. It depends on the cheap smile <br /> <br /> This incredibly annoying announcer describes this film as "Group to Fight Giants". Completely untrue. There is a sub-plot created in this movie which is actually going anywhere like a relationship between a girl and a pool. More lies Looks like a short made for this picture "Are you afraid of darkness?" The story is ridiculous, and has succeeded in making the audience happy and confused, finally they have canceled their efforts to look at this compromise seriously, and they tried to forget about $ 9 4 in the door. I was often among the listeners of Paul Spirir so that I could laugh at him and asked why he had lost 5 years in Thailand, so that a bad software from the torch channel could be made low-indigestion, which was exclusively expelled from his family, and belgium The film festival created a minor stir. It's only a stir, there was a girl at the bottom of the grove because it did not get out of it. However, I hope I can disagree with some of the serious mistakes of watching this movie, it was one of my top three bad movie experiences, the self-assaulting the director for the number 2.
