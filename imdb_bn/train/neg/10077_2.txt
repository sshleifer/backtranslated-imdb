Well, at least my theater group did not, lol. I must have been a little girl, so remembering to think of Greece, although it was not my favorite musical or story, it still kept a special place in my heart because it is still a lot of fun to see. I heard the terrible thing about Greece 2 and that's why I did not decide to see it, but my boyfriend said that it was not really bad and my friend agreed, so I decided to give it a shot, but I called them and just smile. At first the first plot was completely stolen and it was not really cute, it was not mentioned that they used only the same letter, but with different names and actors. Tell me, after leaving the former gang, what did Pink Lady and T-birds continue for years? Goddess Mouth motor cycle is not an enemy, GI, what is an interesting similarity with the boys in the first film and these T-birds were just stupid and ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Another year was not stopped by Riddle and the music and dance. But when Syndy's cousin arrives in a new student scene, she is hit by a pink lady, Stefani. But he must be in the code where only Pink Lady will have to live with T-birds, so the new student decides to train as a T-Bird to win his heart. So he dressed up like a rebel motorcycle bandit, who can fly well and easily defeat the evil bikers to kick the T-Bird boot. But will he tell Stefanie that he really or will he find himself? Well, find out for yourself. <br /> <br /> <br /> Grease 2 is not like a stupid TV show that does not work. The gang did not click in Greece for the first time, it was somewhat silly and unbelievable that Frankie was not supposed to come back, because I thought he had graduated from Riddle, but apparently he did not. That the song was not really interesting; I'm very glad Michelle could get back so early, but perhaps that's why he was the only one with this stupid little success, if I'm not really interested, I would not recommend this movie, but I warned you, more from this famous musical instrument Money is a compassionate effort. <br /> <br /> 2/10
