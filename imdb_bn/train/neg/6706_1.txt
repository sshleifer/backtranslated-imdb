I think if I saw this step in the Central Florida Film Festival a few years ago. I liked it, it showed great potential. I think most of the people here are deceiving this movie because the film seems to be confined together (filmed on the film's manufacturer's official site - the brief was displayed as "rough cut"). <br /> <br /> But still, it was a simple comedy. I think many people try to read too much in the comedy. They are all supposed to make you smile - all of that. I just did that in its display, so it's a success on that level. Anyway, my 2 cents however.
