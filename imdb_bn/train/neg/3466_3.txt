A slash created in the early 80's is a curse on Flickr, whoever tries to save the dead. A few years later, a group of movie students tried to complete the film - the films revived the fatal curse. Great idea for a movie, but sadly 'cut' is just another spoiled opportunity. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Australia did not have the best track record in the world. 'Rezarback' (1984) is 'Holing Third' (1987), which was almost like half an American film, and was out of the fog. For the comedy-shocking us, 'Body Me elt' (1993) is well-forgotten left. The 'cut' problem is that the makers are trying to create a tricky horror, which is 'La Scrim' (1996), but its insights or it does not work. And even though it seems weird about a slash film, a 'cut' actually lacks a "heart". Definitely it follows the basic "rules" set by 'Scrum', but it does not want to play with the formula, instead it copies a previous cardboard. <br /> <br /> Slayer, Scarman, is probably one of the most annoying and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. Curiously, the lam one-fishing boat will have an obscene conversation like Shakespeare. Throwing does not feel like they are completely involved and they just look like waiting for a shoot so they can collect their salary checks. And the feeling of the film is not to be deliberately vague; Looking more like an episode of 'Neighbors' or 'Heartback High'. However, these attempts at MTV style are found only during the "research" sequence in the hyper-cinema, only lamps, dates, and places are found. If Australia ever gets a chance to do terrible things (which I hope we will still do), we will have to take a leaf from our 'Mad Max' (1979) book. Instead of copying to the United States, we should try our own continuation.
