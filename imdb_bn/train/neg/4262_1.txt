This is simply done, the worst movie I've ever seen. It started from 2+ hours, and box art was completely confusing. My friends and I rented it because we thought it would be 300 of a poor people. You know, make fun of laughing No There is nothing funny about this movie, only pain. Then, the movie starts, and they are talking a little different language. We think, 'Oh it just started.' But no, the movie has been reduced from there, and you have become like a very annoying book reading at grade school, which literally does not happen for hours and war scenes compete with two kids fighting at the playground. Amit cinematography, and this film belongs to the trash compactor. Such films will lead to the world seen in Wall-E, which was a good film.
