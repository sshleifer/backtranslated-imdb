Of course, a strange debut for Michael Madison. Madsen played in Seychel Moeck, who is an alcoholic family, whose life revolves around him. Seychelle occupies a phone book, sees the name of the preacher and calls him in the middle of the night. He went to the preacher's house and discussed his problem. The preacher teaches Sicily to pay homage to God's Word and to teach Jesus in his heart. That makes everything good. Ah ... if only everything in life was easy. This "film" shows what has been made with around $ 500, but of course it does not help. 1/10
