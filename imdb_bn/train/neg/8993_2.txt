In the 70's, when I first saw it, I was in high school. It was then cold. Now I'm looking at it as an adult and I say to myself ... yes okay. What was so funny? It's moments but they are a few and far away. It's so long that Jokes is no longer standing. A small crowd will display this and they are completely lost. If you like such humor, you want to stay with the Amazon women from the Kentucky Friday movie or the moon. Tunnel Vision as well as Groove Tubes are very date-wise to visit today.
