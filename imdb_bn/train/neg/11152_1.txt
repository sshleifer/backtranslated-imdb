Why is this movie annoyed to see if you have a great movie? It is a total waste of time and money. The movie is so bad that I felt bad because of lacking it. It is everything BAD. The actor was bad. The script was really bad. The story is stupid And the worst CGI ever The first 60 second movie of the only good moment Strip Club. One interesting thing is, we have a feature that we want to die because he is so stupid that we got him enough. (I do not remember the name but I was a friend of "Selected".) <BR> <br /> Note: This movie is not the right choice if you want to watch a good movie. 0-star out 10
