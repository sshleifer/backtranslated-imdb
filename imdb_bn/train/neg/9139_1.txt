I do not know what this movie is about - director Sam Marovich is somehow some upgrade about the little aspect towards this movie. I would normally say that this is a film that should not exist, but this movie can always be the most important. The only purpose of this movie is to 'never make the worst movie ever', without doubt. I saw bad movies in my life, but the way I feel bad is something more difficult to break. <br /> <br /> Everything in this movie is sunny, but the only interesting thing is that Marovich considers himself to be a great movie. <br /> <br /> Oh wow ...
