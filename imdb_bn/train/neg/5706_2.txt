This movie is like thousands of "cats and mice" movies (The following may seem like a mockery, but it actually only describes the big movie) in his humorous comments, his corrupt, intelligent main character, his disgraceful but deserving creator. But soon the inevitable "unlucky" love story, the beloved lady took hostage, and of course soft gorgeous lady who triggered unforeseen evil hostile with her cruel minions. Everyone has already seen the tones of this film, and "National Treasure" is just like any one of them, only a little correction wrapping. Each turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you that I am not the most important tool in the shed). I think I'm feeling the money after coming out of the movie from the movie in Hollywood, and if you feel like this, then take my precautions; Stay away from this movie away.
