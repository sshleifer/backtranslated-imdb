The first cubic film was an artist film. It has established a world that represents all the major features of mankind, and how they fought to maintain the senses of a hostile world that they could not understand. It was at non-literal level, the "man versus cruel nature", in which the person representing integrity and righteousness came to the end, won the victory against a new, indefinite world outside the new harmful side of man; A world where there was no struggle, but peace was there. I rated the cube between 10 and 10, and it was a movie that was never for a signal. <br /> <br /> The second movie, Hypercube was a big disappointment. The ideas were somewhat cool, but in the context of the real movie, both stories and setting did not understand and it did not even have the meaning. Still, for fair entertainment, I rated it 5 out of 10. <br /> <br /> The third movie, Cube Zero, ignores the second, the first one is a very bad commercial B-movie rehearsal, symbolism sans. There is no "respect" or "respect" here; Only ripping off is Similar plot, some elements have changed in a stupid manner (such as those that have characters instead of the main numbers in the cubes - it is a concept that looks more clearly than any other that it is not a basicity and is not worth speaking). <<br /> <br /> We can not see anything "behind the scenes", because there is nothing to mean, because the observer is only part of the big test, the architects do not hear anything. And, in this movie, those who quit (as did the end of the first film) died only - where * sleep * means? It's just flipin 'stupid. I'm glad I could not see it. <br /> <br /> Playing in the production price and the thicker zero is not too bad, but the stories and the ideas can get ridiculous without any inspiration from this inspiration only to get 3 ratings for 10.
