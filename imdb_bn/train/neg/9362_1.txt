It sounded like the promise the plot sounded. I did not see the whole movie to be honest. About an hour after the movie, I had to make a decision. This movie is valuable until the conclusion? The answer was definitely not! It can not accept a replacement of different species without rejecting the human body. Or he was pursued by the secret government authority to replace human / wolf. Because the movie was badly written, there was a lack of acting and I did not understand the sequence of dreams with wolves and Buffalo. When he walked in the zoo with a dog pack and put it in the front of the zoo gate and said, "If you can not walk with a big dog, do not go to the verandah." Save yourself time and avoid this movie. If you see the courage to show it, then I can guarantee that you will be frustrated there, because I am surprised why anyone who damages this humiliating humiliation in American movies means money, time, energy and effort.
