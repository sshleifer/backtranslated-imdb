Audrey, I know you really enjoyed your husband Ted's memory, but please judge his inheritance and obey his wishes. Dr. Suez refused to license his letters because of his very good lifetime. We ask for your cash, pictures, imagination and cash withdrawal. They are being disemboweled by the power of Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will be stuck with these historical and wonderful explanations that will pollute the loving warmth of the ever-increasing and the innocence of its books. <br /> <br /> This is your property with your will. I wish to hear the advice of others for just a short time. Save what lead to Dr. Lead. Thank you.
