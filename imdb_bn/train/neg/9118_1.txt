This, quite literally, the worst movie ever seen in my life. This could be the worst movie possible. Some movies are so bad that they are good. This movie is so bad that it makes us enjoyable camps and only strangers become horrified. It is anti-antioodromia. We bought for the purpose of rush, and all of my family gathered in the fun of the shiny comments; Instead, we sit in silent stunned pitying Peter's vendors, silent. <br /> <br /> It's worse than the ring's animated lord. It's worse than the matrix sequels. It's worse than Cruz. It's worse than a Batman movie. <br /> <br /> In no event, this film will not let you reach ten feet of your television.
