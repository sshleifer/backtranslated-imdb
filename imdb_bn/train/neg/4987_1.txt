This image is so bad and every fantastic fashion gets bad. It's not just poor performance and scripts and it's a waste of watching it over the long and opposite times. How shameful this picture of shame in my hall is that writers and producers are making fun of the film and are clearly struggling to make it. Gene Reeno's reproductive actress was old and learned her texts in the first film so that she added a new girl to get married. Returns almost all the original xgas and gags though this time I want my eyes tanned from my socket because it is a waste of perfectly good film. In any of these scenes, continuous camera cuts and torture of shots can keep the viewer in violent Condolutions. This second film accepts the successful title and pulls it out of its coffin and expels the body in public and reduces our intelligence not only to the core idea and its heredity but also to our intellect. This picture could not fly against Spruce Sire, because it was not a plot of princess coming back for a 'necklace'. Visually written and added every day, because no script. No focus on camera or shot in mind Due to poor lighting and special effects so done. The film will not pass the film for the main movie 101 also. No one knows how this pill is. It was a big disappointing investment and it seems that we did not have the power to remove this irrelevant cruel mistake from our suffering. This is a good part of the movie ... its the end! This movie is my # 1 worst movie of all time, finally "Howard the Post" is no more.
