"Dominic" is a film that has been called "slow melt" Many endless and repetitive sequences (how many times we see Robertson walking down the stairs, because he can hear someone playing piano?). It is only to be left free by a wonderful twist, which, which is unfortunately, followed by a second twist, is only successful to leave a bad taste in our mouth. Not a very enjoyable film.
