In my knowledge, Laurence Wich has told a famous Belgian comics (never read) the courage of a playboy, without James Bond's kind of spying life! So, when I choose a movie for a 5-year-old child, I picked it up because this baby was already a great fan of James Bond <br /> <br /> But, after the first credit, I Doubtful: When American films make an amazing start, here, a step and a radioactive sex scene? Then, the story is very complicated with financial measures ?? I said to myself, I have lost my child <br /> <br /> But, surprisingly, he was caught by Largo and more than James Bond! <br /> <br /> Is this an excellent explanation of Tamer Sicily? What is his relation with her father with Largo? Friends who have bad guys, bad friends friends? Hong-Kong, Yugoslavia's external location? <br /> <br /> <br /> But she really knows Largo ("she will get up?)" and we've enjoyed our momentum.
