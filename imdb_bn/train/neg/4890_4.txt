A photo of Wixen (Erica Gavin) who loves her husband ... but she loves too! During the film, he got more than one man on the bed - with his husband and brother! There is also a (tame) lesbian sequence. <br /> <br /> This photo keeps Rip Girl on the map and I (believe) was the first critically acclaimed x rating movie ever. It was a big hit when it came. Unfortunately, it does not date well <br /> <br /> This is well-directed and Erica Gavin is very good (what happened), and it was very colorful ... but according to today's standards it is very tame. I was surprised that it now has an NC-17 rating - there is no hardcore sex here and it is only confiscation of women and no male nudity. Also it was tragic (tragic) quite lazy and the link to politics at the end was confusing (and fantastic). It was interesting to see what was very frustrating in 1968. I've seen the cut version completely (which has a rating) but I've heard just a few seconds here and are missing out there. <br /> <br /> The next picture of Mayer "The Wall of the Ducks" is very good and the date is very good. That catches instead.
