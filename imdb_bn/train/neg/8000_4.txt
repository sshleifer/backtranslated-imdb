I already know that critics and some listeners say that it was a satirical, there were many political and social messages, the names refer to some other names. It could be I do not understand anything (I do not want to do it) because I'm not interested, I'm interested in 'movies'. For the film, it is said that the movie is cute and dramatically strong. I do not see anything other than half a movie that we see in the second half. Yes, the scene says something about humanity, but it does not brighten the movie. The film is entertaining (lightly) and exciting in some moments or scenes, but not much more than that. As the biggest error in the film, it has visual effects. It was just frustrating, I could not combine myself for a while, because I was expecting a realistic monster, because it was not one of the oldest Goji films, it was created in 2006, but it was not. If you have a demon that you do not believe, you can not take care. If you agree with me about this, I recommend Cloverfield to be very realistic. Giant design is not attractive, but at least designed, there is an effort. Dramatically Strong Criticism Some critics like to talk about it as it's a Kurosawa movie. Yes, this is a play rather than a thriller or action, but it is not dramatically strong. I do not want to compare hosts with other giant movies, but I do not try to host other giant movies without doing it. However, due to their sympathy for Asian film, some people may call the film's superiority. Yes, I like Asian movies, but this is the truth.
