I am annoying to comment on this movie only because, all 97 minutes of your life and your money will be stored. <br /> <br /> I bought this pre-rental for Â£ 3.00, it was interesting, so I took a chance <br /> <br /> <br /> I realized within a few minutes of launching it I am wrong The entire cast should be stored up to winter and then the nearest log is thrown into the fire, where they can meet them more often. <br /> <br /> As Deven Hamilton (writer and director), he must shot, sorry, it should have been done before creating this garbage. <br /> <br /> Avoid this picture if you see it in stores. <br /> <br /> 1/10
