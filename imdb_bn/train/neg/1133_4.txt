I've seen a romantic comedy and it's one of the easiest / worst efforts. Scenes work in strictly inserted plug-and-play games in a number of romantic-comedy genres. Usually it's okay because we're dealing with a genre, but the challenge is usually new and innovative. This movie failed to fail it. <br /> <br /> Apart from Cinematic Miriors (the original star of this movie, Isle of the Blues), the characters are not really understood. They fit into this one dimensional clich√© and they become nothing more than simple dolls to serve the purpose of a very light description. <br /> <br /> With penning penning unnecessary, unnecessary close-ups may be lacking, rhythm, and editing. I should naturally try to think that it is very normal, naturally should mention excessive styled decors by creating some scenes except natural scenes. Of course, as well as you have the right-on-the-cou music, which unfortunately is often matched. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that a movie that makes Windy Allen clear is that fraudulent. If you expect romantic comedy in a good light heart, it is not. Or rather, it's a poor effort. The film is now more than 100 years old when the film is so much appreciated, leaving the theater in mind, and the more well-known QuiBXI directors are very good for creating a better flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What is it? But as the film's artist and director, you feel as bad as it sounds bad though.
