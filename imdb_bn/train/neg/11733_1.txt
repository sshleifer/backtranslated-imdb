I am surprised that there were people who liked this movie. I saw it in Tribeca, and most of the listeners were smiling through this scene which was not funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but in reality the plot of this film needed major correction. Even this could not even understand, one-second letter asks what they are doing ... the scenes are addicted to them and how to create it? Finally, the cake just took ... I'm not going to waste the grand conclusion ... but it has been mixed with most of the terrible plot / script ... if you must watch this movie for comedy.
