There are only two things for "Happy G Lovely". And these two things are sheep's legs. This is a street (Excelsior Films) version complete with second-level stars in the M-GM musical instrument. I would imagine that sheep-allen is thinking about this role that eventually it could move towards a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Mrs. Allen's scope was not stopped. <br /> <br /> With a terrific Scottish number and frustrated by the horrific dialogue for the next dust tune, this movie seems too heavy and sloppy. The predictable fault detection plot is very thin, and except for David Niven, Cesar Romero (who plays a role of producer) and Bobby Whaas (who did not completely break any role) left completely forgotten. <br /> <br /> Dance is boring, but Miss Allen gives it all. He was not as famous as most of the other musical instruments (and he could not "dance" in several songs of his song and he could not dance.) But when he was dancing, it was right <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It is so bad that this image could make her a star, she could not provide the necessary equipment for her. <br /> <br /> <br />
