I saw Nürburg on Dutch television yesterday when I could not believe my eyes. It starts very slowly, from the footsteps of the Nürburg trial to step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step, step-by-step step-by-step gradually, with a step-by-step step-by-step step-by-step. I have never seen <br /> <br /> It is very important for people to see such footage (although I do not completely agree that there is no age at which children can be exposed. Such stuff), but it was ridiculous in this film. This is meant to improve the effect of a typical TV series. It threatens the audience which is very cheap and incredibly easy. Due to trying to take us with good work scenes, inspirational dialogues or funny perspectives, the audience is being tortured with horror images of skin-and-bone camp prisoners. It does not show any respect for Holocaust victims. <br /> <br /> I am very angry.
