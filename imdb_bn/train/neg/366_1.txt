Bad actors, bad filming, sticky conversations, shallow letters, but then again it was a bad premises. Basically, a 11-year-old who was bullied because his very little money was given a blank check by a neutral criminal. Of course, there must be 11 years old technology and intelligence, to buy a home, to cash a check for 1,000,000 dollars, and even three ridiculous idiots who remember three scandals. <br /> <br /> <br /> Preston Blake is an annoying, objectionable boy who decides, when he writes a blank check by a whole newborn, he will take his best advantage as much as possible. In other words, he is admitted to a bank, <br /> <br /> gives a printer a check on his printer, and miraculously cash goes through cash. Preston is clearly capable of reaching the incredible speed on his bike, because a person driving Jaguar after Preston and his 10-speed could not catch him, even when Preston rode the rails of cars. <br /> <br /> Of course, with every hockey adventure film, there must be a hot heroin. In this case our hot heroine is a child who is abusing FBI agents, who gave birth to 11 year old Preston and promised another date after 17th. However, the entire worst part of this movie is not casting it, or its sloppy conversation, such as "Another way to think of dying of a cat is to put a hose of hose and then take the wool." Rather, the whole thing is that nobody in the whole movie could understand that the FBI does not disrespect the random people. I failed to explain that using the word "Macintosh" as the entrepreneur of Preston type, using the term "Mackintosh". Of course, the FBI finds this mysterious and sends our young heroine after Preston, who uses his 11-year-old intellect to shout first in front of him, then treats him with Hamburger, where a cemented area ends with a ridiculous ramp. Water jetsisan from the ground. Our heroin failed to realize this whole adventure that criminal criminal FBI is following and following the slides, because they have chosen to go to Preston Limousine, complete with a 1-dimensional driver who fails to deliver a cheaper, third rate <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> 1/10 incredibly kindly for this picture. I do not see how it is 4.4 / 10 only.
