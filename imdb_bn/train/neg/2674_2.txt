There was a great idea to anyone: Will do its own work in Brain's Mind, Lara Croft's R-RAT version - only to shoot nine gunshots in Skimpi groups, but haste. It was really a great idea. The problem is that its people can not bring a script or budget to support it. Therefore, we get a "movie" that reaches the middle length in most of its parts (often slowly slow) and apparently shot completely inside a garage. The appeal of Misty Munde is still clear: She is incredibly intelligent and has the beauty of a natural girl-next door. But here's her two female co-stars, with whom she shared a tall lesbian scene, there is no closer to her league. If "Mummy Rider" is presented as a YouTube video, I am more harsh than that, but it can not be more than 4 * in 4/4 as defined by "film" for the use of the DVD.
