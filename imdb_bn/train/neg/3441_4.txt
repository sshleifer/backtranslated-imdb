What was this hack? Some definitely read Stephen King and Sartre of the same semester. We get mixed existence mixed with the cheap horror. There were some annoying moments but each was canceled by awesome music, CGI, or acting. <br /> <br /> The problem of this strange story seems to be lazy. Even David Lynch's work seems to be occasional, and it's a long way, like its interesting show and movie. And sadly this is only 98 minutes. <br /> <br /> Cast was interesting, and its limit is about. I think it touches the feelings of teens and the fear of the loneliness of all of us, but we do not like the letters enough to care for them on fate. The final scene obscures the whole matter page.
