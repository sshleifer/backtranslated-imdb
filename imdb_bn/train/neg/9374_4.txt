This is only when it shows Ayurvedic cure and treatment preparations. The devastation of poverty in India and even the frustration of their rich clients can not be denied. However, as an argument for Ayurvedic medicine in general, this film is sadly unsuccessful. Although Indian clients are mentioned to show "allopathic" doctor, those doctors are not interviewed and patients will have to take vague statements in front of them - "Doctor says there is no remedy" "Doctor said cancer" etc. Well, "no cure" means "no treatment" and what kind of cancer does the patient have? It is the weakest while showing Ayurvedic practice in America. Apparently it has suddenly decreased that the high powered wall street may damage your stomach.
