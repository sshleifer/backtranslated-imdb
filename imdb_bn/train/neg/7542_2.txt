This movie can be a mysterious, serious thriller in search of a lost girl. However, 30 minutes in the movie, it turns into a funny, unreal story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can not imagine that smile when that laughs the sunny karate that blonde girl or when she kicks that old lady "bear". Lines, characters, and all of the acting are done poorly. I've always liked Nicholas Cage as an actor, but he made some terrible movies this year; This is the worst one yet (yet ...) <br /> <br /> I will not recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see an intense story-thriller thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, hire the original. However, if you want to see it, instead of taking it seriously, be ready to laugh at some lines and the last scene; The only way you can enjoy this film.
