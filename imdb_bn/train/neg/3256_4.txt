I dig this out and saw it tonight. I honestly believe that it should be 20 years after the end. I remember it's a seriously flawed film. I do not think it seems bad! <br /> <br /> <br /> I was very upset that a project with this feasibility should have been so insulted. Who am I responsible for this? The script is written by 2 people (and I am using it unexpectedly)? Casting Directors So Awesome Story: At least three big characters in the story? (Only 2 of them are "amazing 5".) The director, who refused to take it seriously, and raised bad music at the top of bad writing and everywhere bad acting? (I like the theme song - but it should never be used throughout the whole movie!) Don Black, in some of his songs he wrote for the song. In less than a week of re-reading this comic-book adaptation, I can drag it. The first thing in the first 15-20 minutes or less (really, less) of the comic parallel is the first thing. I saw this tonight, I was surprised - why the total details changed? Dock shows, then his wristwatch begins to open the safe by using remote control, and the sniper bullet leaves him 5 inches because the unwanted glass leaves only the same thing in the same way. I mean, if you are going to make an "adaptation", then why does God's name change? <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < I read somewhere, they actually meet two different novel elements in one movie. Why again? I heard it changed because they could not protect the kind of budget they could choose. I see the film, and think ... by no means lacking money, I explain what I saw on the screen! <br /> <br /> You know, when people complain about Joel Schumacher, they must take a look at this thing. I can say the best thing, I think it will create a great duality with the 1966 Batman feature - and perhaps it's a great triple bill with the flash and Gordon in the 1980s. All 3 films are "stupid". Maybe we can "blame" the 1966 film (and TV series) for this. Some fans have complained for years that Adam West's Batman has destroyed the comic book image of the generation of non-comic fans. I think the same thing can be said for Hollywood. I think exactly how much, BAD movies are based on "classic" characters, especially (it seems to me) in the late 70's and early 80's. Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Bak Rogers, Flash Gordon, The Lone Ranger - Everyone seems to be "murdered" like Hollywood, "Oh, comic book! So you know it should be stupid!" More like they are "stupid" ones. What potential waste <br /> <br /> I say something good ... Despite the script and guidance, Ron Eli is the coolest. When I read a DOC Savage story, I do not think of James Bamma painting, I remember Eli. Bill Link (later who was regular in T.) is remarkable. Eldon is fast (I've seen somewhere else, but can not remember where) horrible. Paul Glesson - I'm completely disappointed with a passion and revenge on the FFA Club ("Teachers who" played as they should be prohibited from teaching anywhere), "Amazing 5" might be the best in this movie. Pamela Hensley - though her part was almost unknown to the original story - horrible. Before she dropped her hair down, I realized that she had seen things like "Ardala Valmaar" from the terrible John Calvin's Buck Strape, I only read another day. He got a big nose like hide - not only pronounced. Comics Aadal was actually more like the 1936 film Princess Ara - or the Chair. Or maybe Streisand. Take Yer Peak. (Ararmal actually got plastic surgery in George Tuskra Strips - later, he was stunning!) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Was the character that he wanted to play? I do not know, because the character was not sure in the film, the film accepted its title.
