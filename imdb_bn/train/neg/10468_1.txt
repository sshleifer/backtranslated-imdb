I do not know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. It was a really terrible film. The screenplay, direction and acting were equally bad. The story was stupid and stupid. The director can create a smart and thought provoking film, but he does not. For the last half of the film, I could look at my seat because it was very bad. Where was the focus of the film? Where was anything in this picture? Instead of preaching to Christians, this movie should be excluded. It was done shabbily and my money was a waste. Do not see these pictures.
