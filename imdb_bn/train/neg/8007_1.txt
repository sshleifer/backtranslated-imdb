I really did not expect this kind of a film outside of America. How anyone can accept children of sexual abuse, and it becomes "adventurous" only sick Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) was often going around like a child saving Rambo, making all the sexually harassing children in the world abusive and insulting. <br /> <br /> What's the dubious depression and the ground that came out of the movie "Happiness" of the year before the movie. Menges and his colleagues will be ashamed of themselves. It is appreciable to read some of the comments by more intelligent viewers. They were able to see shoddy and ridiculous handling on this issue. The person who made this great movie unconscious, shows an incompatible amount and you have to open your mind to the true fear of podfilia. <br /> <br /> Do you think your child is more likely? Selling abducted and sex slavery or being oppressed by neighbors, teachers, friends or even relative? Hmm ... I'm surprised. If they push this button-push instead of making it a movie about any kind of international child slavery that is real and emotionally involved. 1/10
