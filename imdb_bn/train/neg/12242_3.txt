I expect a bad movie, and got a bad movie. But I was not really imagining my worst fantasy how bad the movie was. I do not even want to try what can be explained about blood surf. Blood is not about surfing, but a big $$ crocodile. They are complaining about the jaws of shaws, but Spielberg was intelligent and did not show shark till the end. Here the crocodile has been shown many times, and the worst spider I've ever seen it, and they do not try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a suitable surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad B-giant movie. She had the opportunity to make an original surf movie, but she wanted to make a giant movie. So you have understood how bad this movie is, is it some good part? Not really, it got some nudity and a sexual scene that was taken directly from a playboy movie. Half of the acting is not bad, and Kate Fisher looks good. Very bad he did not close his top. The lead actors are not bad. They had some potential. The location was nice and the movie started well with some beautiful surf scenes. Blameful author and director blame. The conversation I saw is the worst, and the script was written really badly, and the director did not get any talent, so no such fiction. <br /> <br /> Do not see it. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fisher It's not worth it. See Ceres to see Kate naked, and see Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile work. 3/10 Because I'm in a good mood, and Moorin Larajjal looks like a nice and Kate looks good (but bad actress,) and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Burlingi, to work with them sh # T worked well with pieces of t.
