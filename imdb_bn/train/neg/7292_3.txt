European import from Hungary began in mid-1880s through the mid-1980s, it was the epic story of the Hanahani Jews, the Swvenschin family. Sunshine translation in the literal sense of this name The family starts humbly, then flourishes, turns upward, changes its name and hopes to get together in the Hungarian society so that successive generations can progress professionally. The story is said by the eyes of the greatest son of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed WW-II and Europe's Holocaust, Sonasenchan's life style did not work very well. <br /> <br /> <br /> Sunshine is being praised as artistic success, but it missed a chance. Affected by world history, story lines are predictable and transparent; This voice cover is strengthened with cover narration and newsreel footage. A 'expectation' of the churches is a prospective event [i.e. Happensburg, WW-I, WW-II, fascism, communism, etc.) with a little consistency, depth or detail later. Focusing on the Jewish prosperity theme, and the important sub-themes ['secret' diary and family philosophy] that can provide family character and credibility are ultimately up to the end. Alternatively, filmmakers provide continuity of generation by using common themes of immorality / infidelity. <br /> <br /> Ralph Feenance shows the glow of brightness, but its performance is far from the award winning element. "3 for 1" welding format seems like a cheerful movie gymnasts than a visitor's protests and good theater. Sunshine is originally a Hungarian "History Channel" element. The look and feel of the war wind with Forrest Gump have some sex with them. <br /> <br /> <br />
