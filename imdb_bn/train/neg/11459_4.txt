Whale hunters pick up on the wrong freaking whale. <br /> <br /> Yahoo is a group of whale dryers to capture a woman and string her up by her tail. Whale's companion shows the whole thing with which the woman's unborn child breaks down and falls on the deck. Captain Nolan (Richard Harris) can say that the big man really showed him crazy, as he says, "get out of the city before the high tide." <br /> <br /> In this story of revenge, Harris has presence and beauty of Bo, but nothing else. It was Bo's first release film, although his first acting career was released four years ago, 'One Win Upon A Love' in 1981 as 'Fantasy' (directed by John Derek). <br /> <br /> <br /> Today, this review date (20 November), the birthday of Bo Derek. I hope b have a 'whale' in a good time ..... get it? ..... whale? ..... Hee-hee.
