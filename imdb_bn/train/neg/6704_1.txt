This is a terrible 'comedy' - it's actually a bad movie. There are no fun stuff. Any funny joke I do not know how this guy can claim this impossible short movie as 'smart' or 'quality'. Perhaps, if its the only movie that a person sees, you can claim the brothers. But, I have seen thousands of good films: Leonard six parts (now, it's funny)! I do not know how the brothers are considered worthy of being listed on the Internet Movie Database: It's like home video compared to an actual movie. <br /> <br /> Have fun together, just skip this movie. This cliche-ridden unfunny material that is more enjoyable in a main canal.
