If, within the first 10 minutes of this movie you can not understand that a major character, who wrote the Life Advice column, will be converted to table-to-gloss and learn some valuable life, then you probably have some wrong with you. The set was expected to destroy the movie, even the rest of the movie was good (which is not it) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The behavior is not funny, embarrassing. It is difficult to believe that the enchanted character will show her any interest. Then finally it wrapped up all the wonderful and everyone lived happily afterwards. That's not great America!
