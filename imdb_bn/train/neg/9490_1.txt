This is complete and absolute trash, which is a good example of a BAD movie, it can not be objectionable to any person, even the fans of the film. No, I repeat, this piece of trash does not waste precious time in your life. Bad acting, bad direction, horrible (but I'm really terrible) scripts, and entertainment (no form) what a complete lack of ideas. I bought the DVD for $ 3, I swear that I can almost take it. This image is not enough for me to do. I like B-movies, killer toys, weird launchers, but it's not close to anywhere. Do you know that movies are so bad that they are funny? Not even Just plain old compassionate.
