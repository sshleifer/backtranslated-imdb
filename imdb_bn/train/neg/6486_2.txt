If you can do one thing in Disney, then take it a story and say it again and again and it's their extraordinary power. Even the commercial observer for Lady and Trump II was an awesome experience. Disney is going to destroy one of their most awesome classics. There was even Spaghetti meatball scene. It has been done before! And what I mean directly to this video is to say sorry (the whole idea should be banned). Everything is a rehearsal of the original film and several of the really bad movies of blues. Penguin and Wallars Duo (I forgot their name too) Timon and Pumba have a very bad carbon copy. Morgan is another Ursul. He even repeats all his old lines even real. The song is unfortunate, really abysmal. I have not heard so many bad songs from them before. And the dialogue is violent. It's kind and simple. Plus, it took time to make the animation somewhat modest. The usual characters are not as boring as they (or it may be a substitute for Little Marmad fans). Negative back, Melody is just so awful knowing you could just vomit. I almost did. Make yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Do not waste your money on this. Truth is not as awesome as Jafar or Pokhantas 2, but it is a little comforting.
