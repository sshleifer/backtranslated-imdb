Wow, this film was just bloody terrible. It's really bad that even though I could not see it, I wanted to get my money back. <br /> <br /> This picture is not something cute. This is a mash-mash of science-fi cliche which is well-presented by many highly skilled filmmakers. Especially in Lead's performance, Ed Wood was at the top of wood sorting at an early age. Ed Wood said, he would be proud of the character's dialogue. It is very radioactive with no hint of ridicule or humor. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, instead of being a good plot device, "be cool" will be thrown. <br /> <br /> Another sound of the soundtrack was that it never set any kind of mood. Again, it seems that the director is just throwing in the song in an attempt to "cool down" the cinematic lyrics. <br /> <br /> which brings me to my final level. Perhaps the director was more worried about plot, stories and conversations instead of trying to "get cold", but he did not create such a dark clay of a small film. <br /> <br />
