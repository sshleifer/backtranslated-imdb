This movie has some great silence / novelist visuals and it is a story that is freed from the cover of Hollywood Sugar, which was only possible because it was originally an independent foreign film. But for a few of the scenes (wedding, especially), and I found out to be more suitable for the stage than the screen of silver and the extremely unusual acting and unrealistic conversation. <br /> <br /> The dialog was particularly confusing, and it got worse if the movie continued. In the twentieth century and thirty years most of the letters in New York were Italian-Americans or Italian immigrants, but their dialogues seemed to have been practicing the line for Shakespeare's play, when they mixed cement and brick bricks. Eventually I was laughing, not because the filmmakers wanted me. I guess that the poem can be saved by saying a poem in Italian language, and literally speaking how literally it will speak. But it did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Another line of dialogue mocked me for a different reason: The son of the protagonist, born and raised in New York in the 1920's, suddenly a beautiful smile seemed to be a British accent. I'm just convinced of the idea that this film was made in England. <br /> <br /> I tried to try and intend this movie 'A', but provided a low grade for execution.
