Watch the movie website, this movie has more time than writing scripts. It can not be more off in pride. Original story Original? They found the old rule scrapped script, or tackled legal responses to the horn-tooting. High end special effects? Come on, I can do better with a closet of 7600 and a world of connection. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, America's fun home video look is still a classic. I'm sure they had a little money for this title, so SFT is not really good at all, or it's a bit bad now, and just a little sunny, but it's a story that makes this movie waste time and money. One of the 4 stories and all their brainless bits were shown and already been done.
