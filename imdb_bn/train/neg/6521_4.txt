I probably would not give this movie a fair shake, because I was unable to see it all. Probably, if I saw it in a theater, in its original presentation, I could appreciate it, but it is running very slowly for me. <br /> <br /> I read the book 25 years ago and the plot details fade from memory. This does not help the film, because it is less than clear and clear in the presentation of events. <br /> <br /> This is actually a movie in four linked films, or four parts, and I believe, a theater presentation will be seen four nights. I found the part I was enjoyable enough, but I drops the intermediate which was what I could sit through part II. One of the things to read in Tolstoy's Philosophy. If you can get a better translation or read it basically, then there may be a problem with the speed of its brilliant writing story. However, it is difficult to reproduce without ponderous in the film. <br /> <br /> I have seen that there are other problems with the film part. It's a very splashy, rather than a hay-Mac-Latter-Camera camera that focuses on itself, instead of serving the story. <br /> <br /> Clearly, I've lost something, but I can not call encouragement to crank up the third and fourth part.
