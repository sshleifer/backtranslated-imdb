I want to think of myself as a fairly open psychologist and it takes a lot (!) For me to dislike movies but it's the most cruel, great movie I've ever seen without any doubt! <Br /> <br /> I have no idea what went wrong with those who gave it a good rating (IMDB is usually quite reliable when rating) ... the only thing I can think is that the only people who voted one or the other In many cases: <br /> <br /> 1. Isolated / stone being thrown away from their minds 2. They got cash for their votes 3. Under the gun. <br /> <br /> I can not believe that I was good for 1 hour and 45 minutes for a movie. Merciful excuse
