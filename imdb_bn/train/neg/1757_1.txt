Do not make me wrong, Dan Jansen was a great speed socketer. Dan is a man worthy of his gold medal in the Olympics. <br /> <br /> How could it be possible that Bill Carcorn created such a bad movie about the story of Dan Jansen, because the story of the real Dan Jansen is really incredible! Especially when you see this movie in the eyes of a athlete, then everything is wrong, Matt Kisler and other actors skate, their technique, speed slimming oval levels, it is wrong! <br /> <br /> Getting involved on you, Bill Kerran, Dan Jansen good, a lot better! <br /> <br /> <br />
