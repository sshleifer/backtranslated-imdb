If this is some of the "favorite" movies, they need some serious support. There is nothing funny or tricky about this crapfest. I did not see the original movie (this film in the 1950s), but it would be better than just this new bastardization. <br /> <br /> A head was expelled from the military. fringe components, and wind up teaching children in a ROTC school. Unfortunately, the main repression is ... so there is a world of children's annoying, laughing infinity. Can this damaged whip in the shape of Wayans? Can they become a little more people? Like most Wayans films, movie bombs are just a few moments of fascination. William Hicky gets about one minute screen time, very few. This impressive old man (best known to me as "Chris of the Crypt" actor, who is best known to you as "Christmas Vacation" from Uncle Lewis) is enlightened at every moment of the screen, which is not too much here. <br /> <br /> Left-handed Bigelow has created a look like a biker, which fits him completely. I do not think I'm a little too left left, but it seems that he has played the role of "Bike" as much as possible for the military. <br /> <br /> And then interesting teachers, who falls for a major penny, though it does not behave badly for the kids, does not have any social skills and it is impossible to convert someone who wants to spend time with you. He will be incredibly stupid or incredibly frustrated. I'm not sure that (although it seems "fool", the film makes it clear that he goes out often outside the house). <br /> <br /> Wayne had a bright moment: a dance sequence where he performed a series of films (with a very nice "robot"), and with the help of music from 2 live crews. This scene was enjoyable but this movie was rarely made for any item made by the dog. <br /> <br /> Seriously, avoid this movie. If you want to see a movie that helps a harmful person to become frustrated kids, hire or buy "go to Ernest camp". At least he damaged a lovable, and actually funny. Probably, if Major Pain fought a badger, I would have felt better, but he did not. Forget Payne, Wayans forget ... you can do so well.
