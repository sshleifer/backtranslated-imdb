This movie was terrible. <br /> <br /> They did not develop any characters and the story was played horribly. It was a specific sleep. If you want to have strong positions like a movie action scene, De-wires will also surprise you in that section. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < And I seriously mean that. <br /> <br /> I was really happy to see the last credit that was bad !!! Whatever you do, do not waste your time and money in a crappy movie like D-Wars.
