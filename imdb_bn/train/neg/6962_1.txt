How can a good actor like Jean Rochford and Carol Bucket be involved in this way ... a ... well, such a thing? I can not get it It was very horrible, too Buddy had played (but there were some leading roles), the jokes are stupid and not funny ... I will not say anything more about this film, except for a little bit of advice: do not see it, time and money will be a waste .
