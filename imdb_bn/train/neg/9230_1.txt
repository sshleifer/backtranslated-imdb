I should qualify that title, now I think about it. Checkout is not completely worthless. I got the opportunity to see it twice, and the second time I got a great smile on the movie's expenditure. So I guess some value for it. And it is also suitable for the pain of Creator God for my first visit. As pointed out by other critics, this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. There is no real idea in this movie (which makes me totally annoying about the true originality). There is nothing other than a movie that is arranged around as a long line and movie together. This is definitely not the next clerk, it is certainly not the original, and it's absolutely "not good, it's not fun." Completely painful for the film (it can be seen for the first time, second time may be quite funny, on the way of insulting sorting). Since I was looking around the theater, it was clear that almost all of the elderly people, the film was completely disturbed or disturbed. Especially in the mental scene, where Nick shouts to his mother, the audience is actually crying because it was so bad. I even heard * the cry of the theater *, something I have never seen before. I have no opportunity to see this movie, movie festival, or indie theater, or wherever there is. Avoid yourself in this movie with a vengeance, a vengeance. Unless you're like me and sometimes the worst movie can not prevent the opportunity to see it.
