I recently watched this movie because a friend brought him with him from NYC. After 30 minutes, I said to him, "You have to have fun, is it a joke?" She was good at it. I told him that I'm probably one of the most silliest movies ever made. "What was it supposed to do?" I asked. "A campaign movie made for children?" The plot is stupid Most of the plays are principals and are really the worst and those who see such triangle and feel that they have something to do with their life, love or even after living, in which it provides an incredible stupid attitude ... some psychological needs help. . Please, if someone tries to block it in your DVD or video player, consider that a virus appears on your computer ... it will not destroy your player but it will destroy your evening. If they make raazies in the '40s, it will win in every division. (PS. It also goes below the suspicious Sobir of "Stairs of Heaven".)
