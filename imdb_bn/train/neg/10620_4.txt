Despite having some exciting (and bold) sequence, NBTN is not just going to do. There are all kinds of explosion boats, hat pin killings, mass suicide, patients in the body, and classic mysteries / horror scenes, but they are divided with extended expansion time. The movie shows everyone bored. This is shameful because it will be considered brave while portraying most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Add it to "extremely suitable" Brit characters and you think that you Sherlock Holmes movie. Finally, cinematography is very common. There are many opportunities for beautiful shots in the countryside, or a complex shot is being dragged into a huge shake, but the whole thing is unrecognizable and lazy. <br /> <br /> Definitely only for Li and Kousing fans.
