I did not see a movie in such a short time. There was a fast function of the movie DVD unit only. It was like watching a bad produced CBC movie. There was no money for lighting, filming, sets, location, authors, editors, actors ... Oh, there was absolutely no story! My comments will write ten lines ... bad, terrible, terrible, wicked, painful, oppressive, annoying, vomiting, sick, annoying, annoying, holesome, icky, lucky, pond, stinky, smelly, vile, putrid, all-you Down, and I do not know how I will continue to finish this ten line, how much of this piece-drug production is bad!
