Hello, anyone can hear me? I do not know why you come to this page, but if you are a colleague of this movie then Join FanClub! This movie was so incredibly bad when I could not smile at it. I think it must see, it's a great way to get bad. Every cliche ever discovered for a scary movie can be seen here. I find it very difficult to get a copy of this movie, but it will be the worst movie ever made in the top 10.
