Well, I do not have much to say about this movie: I've seen more than 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2300 films are horror films. Although I have a problem, it's the best (which opposes my love, which I can tell you is the claim of Romero's death in George), I can tell you without hesitation that Todd Sheets Junkby Bloodbath Absolutely, I have ever seen the worst horror movie. <br /> <br /> There is nothing positive about what I can say about this movie. Acting, dialogue, direction, makeup, music ... Every aspect of this movie is so much appreciated that it is in my mind that it was also released. <br /> <br /> If you're a horror or zombie filmmaker, use my precautions and do not waste your time in this trash. There is no pleasure to be gotten from watching this. You will not get any smiles from the display's ambiguity ... believe me. Please
