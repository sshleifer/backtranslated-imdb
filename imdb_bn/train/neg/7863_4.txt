THHE2 laughs a lot and cringe and probably "oh oh!" That would be to say that is entertaining. And "you face it face-to-face, which you silent ** s" or things along with them, but I do not know if it's really valuable- I'm completely completely annoyed with such terrible military characters who do not seem to be the first thing about war To know. <br /> <br /> Yes there was more violence, cohorts, and high body count than the first violence, but I still dispute whether it announces my feelings across the whole film whether it is a ridiculous (and a good like dead or alive Not ridiculous). My time spent well for the Aajar Remki for the fifth time. <br /> <br /> So go for some laughs, or go for something, but do not expect to be satisfied with it.
