The title "1st" is more disrespectful for the film's audience than its victims. At least they will not have to rotate around them and this intermediate movie does not have to reach its own death. <br /> <br /> The first one should mention the first draft of a script; The first final film takes the use of each performance; Post production first edit; Etc., etc. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> And when you are suffering from this united film, you want to express your sadness with a 2 hour mark. It's easy to be edited in the 160-minute long time that it should have been edited within 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The link works in script related details and acts for a little purpose. Even equally awful, Lake Placid, at least performance Bill Palman and Breedgott Fonda were created from a very weak script, you even felt quite a bit different to laugh at this movie. First of all, waiting for a woman to see what is going on after the first scene of preparations for a suicide attempt, she just apologizes for the lost time. <br /> <br /> The edit is so bad that it is never turned on. One of the main characters, I think (sometimes called) is a DA she displayed a scene in the middle of a conversation. This view was clearly excluded from the editors' floor by the audience. And no one could understand that a character that came out of nowhere is an abnormal film scandal. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this one word. My wife and I do not want to. But at least we were able to mix mixed science theater at different places of the film. "Already, in Cleveland ...." !!!!
