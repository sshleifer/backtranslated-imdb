Even possible, even if, potentially, than the original (I hope that the IMDB can say under the guidelines). The French connection attempted to absorb at least European influences to complicate the current aspect of US police intelligence, even attempts were made by Friedkin's conflicts, Americana, and General IndraConction. In the 1960s (apparently) the emergence of novel ambiguity (relative) flashes allowed for the huge influence of Hollywood's European film. It gives new energy and complexity to a tedious medium, and the best among them (such as Banani and Clyde, Primary Scorch), a new distortion of the practice. The original connection was part of this movement, its difficult distance style and detective intelligence Two of the right-wing recycling of the old Hollywood values ​​of the United States. <br /> <br /> It is portrayed in the film's extremely rare America vs. dialectics of France. For example, TWO's were shot as 70's French police. It was certainly French, who insisted on the greatness of American film when their home was neglected, and in a favor, an alert against the concept of gale. These two movie patterns have seen. The French romanticists have attacked New York, with the French style of cheating the American thriller - it breaks the intelligence and creates immunity - the badie is gone. <br /> <br /> Two Americans returning to France, America's thrilling values ​​have imposed on American descent - detective power is rebuilt and the conventional solution is achieved. This has become more dramatic in relation to the relationship with the Dutch director of the French inspector Berthelmium, which has the effect of reducing the dominant influence before controlling the plot. <br /> <br /> Two of his detective heroes desperately follow the original. From the beginning, the importance of the dailies has been reduced every time. Despite the completion of the connection, he is regarded as a hero. But he is American in a foreign country, and his inability to control language or customs means he can not master the plot. He even mistook the signs of the police force, misled a criminal and killed him by an informer. <br /> <br /> A detective power comes from its power and comes as a matter of understanding, but seeing and controlling the view, control, an object, spent most of the film in the body (literally dumped by the church) and explained. In the connection, he strengthened anger, behind criminals, awakened the action; Here he is passive, tied with a bed, locked in a cell, an addictive, a dependent. <br /> <br /> Fatal power is symbolic of this damage to its predictable damage, and the film is a depressed Oedipal refuge. In heroin sequences, he was comforted by an old gentleman who said that he looked like his son. His drug addiction status returned from the womb, loses adult pressure. By accepting its watch, this state further reinforces the timelessness, which is twice as important for a person who depends on timetable and precision. <br /> <br /> Oedipus was the first detective and to avoid his fate, he must reject this false mother who is breaking his united identity and killing his father (Charniyar) so that he can take the role of his acceptable male in society. PsychoAlatilic theory was popular among academics in the 70's (ridiculously inspired by Jacques Lacan), but it is very rare to see a film in a literal sense. <br /> <br /> If this information is reduced to Dial, then the film's style is not. Friedkin focuses on the platoon of the plot, refuses to inspire sympathy or character, and removes us from her hero. Here, Doyle is a very popular Hollywood hero. Instead of losing to a long shot, he has become familiar with and understood by the audience with traditional devices - point-of-view shots, close-ups, shot connections, etc. <br /> <br /> Two fall and Popeye Doyle growth. In this case the subservient to play the plot, which is the usual hackman rally. Cold Turkey Scenes, therefore, are not boring, despite their fatigue. We are allowed to share in cold storage instead; This is a much less uncomfortable experience. The scenes are also shot through Lacrymose Manny's Censimetti which is very American. <br /> <br /> So when Connection tried to imitate Jean-Pierre Melville's complex thrillers, TWO is completely opposite. Melville's Le SAMOURAI featured a gangster who started a complete, strong, external language, and listed his last tearing. The two start with an isolated character, partially attains disability through language, whose domination remains outside after the start of it - the last verb is largely silly. <br /> <br /> Local and language are important in the film, because they correct and reduce intelligence, but when it gets back to its power (its gun snare and its primary site has cathartic burning vulnerabilities, Charnia, where tower blocks hold it ), The Marseilles setting has become more irrelevant, and the legendary stand-off that can be taken anywhere. Compare the end of the two pictures: One accepts ambiguity and frustration, another absolute certainty. <br /> <br />
