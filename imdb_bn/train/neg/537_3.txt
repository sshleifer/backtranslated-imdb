I went to see "evening" for casting. I went to see the "Norman Room" for that reason - the film also dedicated to Dean Keaton, Leonardo de Caprio and Marilyn Strip - and liked it every minute. Although similar to "notebook", it's a cock-flight light. And I had some feeling, Vincea Redgrave, Merrill Strip, Patrick Wilson and Glenn Close's suggestions would be better at least. Instead, I sometimes trite the greatest actors, straightforward and - on an occasion - can not really beyond the offending material. <br /> <br /> Now I had no problems with the way the film was made. I actually enjoy stories that spend time and behind telling the story ... as long as one era illuminates another and the verb shroud. But Veneca's character showed that she was "wrong" after her death and repeating the events of the past, sometimes it has done nothing to clarify what the part is actually "the mistakes of the past". Indeed, it seems silliest in the silliest way possible to lead the silliest "girl girl meets, girl gets boy, girl loses boy", and most incredible, clich√©d, misguided. <br /> <br /> And to be spoilers here, so remember that you should remember reading. <br /> <br /> Firstly, Claire Dance was brutally miscast. She did not look like Vincea Redgrave as a woman at a young age, she did not have any time to act. Do not make me wrong, he can be good in the right role - not just this. And Patrick Wilson was wrong, although acting chops have to pull it off almost. He was more suited to the part he played in Hugh Dancy - the confused WASP of the wealthy - and not the one and all the sex attraction; He's a bit too much for WASP-Y. Hugh Dancy? One note - "I'm drunk rapist and wait until you find out why." And "why" (I have a hug lawsuit in the world of sexual abuse, so I must drink extra and I know that making myself fooled in front of everyone) was so obnoxious for me and how he died (you know that he wants because this is the only thing False can be a fad in the fifties) So ridiculous, the wrong head stands and mishandled, I almost threw my candy on the screen. <br /> <br /> Tony Colette and his sister, the fear of commitment, his jealousy of her sister's "perfect life", her sister thinks that she has made the right choice, her pregnancy and her very perfect lover (which is actually more Interesting) and Patrick Wilson plays meaningful, and Ibn Moss-Bacharak became more attractive with his dreamy eyes) - however, all this ended in the 70's and 80's. And a lot more depth. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The old lady makeup that hides a lot from her mouth expressions. He is still good, but only because of Marilyn and Merill can even find ways to stop the silist dialogue through the most massive dialogue of makeup. <br /> <br /> To keep it simple, each movie has a cliche of the "true meaningful message" movie book, and it adds a few things that have not really been found in a business. Two hours long and "Lifetime Movie of the Week" music that is composed to ensure your raw rub, it is a complete failure of both "meaningful" and "moviemaking". I just gave it "3" because of Merlin and Vince. Now, if everything you need from your movies is twadd le, please comment about "evening" on my evening and your time life. But if you want a truly meaningful experience to serve by great actors and filmmakers, who knows what to do with simple stories about life and death, and the nonsense that it brings, rents "Norman's room" and finds out the real great acting. .
