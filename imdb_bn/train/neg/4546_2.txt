I just saw this movie and did not read the book. The best part of the movie is that in some parts it is thought of for a while in your part of the spiritual subject, evolution, sync chancy and the world. <br /> <br /> The immersion of film is easily broken and there is very little relationship between visitors and characters. It is very clear that the book has decreased a lot in this film version. The incidents that are synchrony are almost unrecognizable. There must be many reasons to see the scene that the scene points to a restraint and can do more to do more to do more. <br /> <br /> The illuminated scene is apparently poor and it does not create any supposed feeling that it is supposed to be. Do you remember the illumination of Qin Reeves (with Little Buddha)? Well, nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Most scenes are badly executed. There are many scenes that do not really develop stories and do not even help to create the atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Save this film's best actor Hector Elíjando, Jokim De Almeida and Jürgen Prokō. It seems that the first 2 films have been acquired to save more than their characters and they have made more money, but it does not work. Most of the scenes are not really necessary and the story does not help. <br /> <br /> Jurjen did a good job in his view and sold (always) as a bad guy, but the script does not help him. The scene where he tried to convince John (Matthew Setal) to join John was just bad scripts. When he executed a blast death scene absurdly executed. Flashbacks can not even be commented across the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall this movie is a big waist, read the book! I could not read it, but perhaps it's a billion times more than that, it must be. <br /> <br /> It is so bad that my first comment was to write to IMDb.
