Plan B is a fast-paced, inappropriate, sloppy script's appearance for a movie to go out of the way - to be free from the start. It's just another Mafia-based comedy, which does not have anything new and that reduces the criteria for participants. <br /> <br /> Joe Malone (Paul Sorvino) is more concerned about the appearance and appearance of the offender than his owner. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony Desmondo) was wasted from the dirt and his ignorance was considered to be funny. Malani has trapped one of his lenders (who has only been married in the book of Fran-Dean Keaton) and Malani took Franco as his assistant to stop the loss of his deceased husband by having his ownership 'Hit Man'. Frang is frightened of his own shadow and unable to carry Malnoni's assignment, instead of choosing to go to Florida in his Fakriya Florida to hide in his brother James's house, he is elected to know what he should do instead. The option to kill these three candidates is called Plan B, plan to kill them in the plan! The ending is completely predictable, such that each line is allocated in the letters in the script. <br /> <br /> Diane Keaton has made many good films and is our most gifted actress and actress, but here she shouted and rants and twitchches through her way of a ridiculous part quickly became annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino, well, throwing Paul Sorvino type from other Mobster film. Supporting Caste also allows a wide skeptic, prattling fashion fantasy balloon play. What is supposed to be a comedy is just being silly and overdone. Director Greg Yatanses will have to go back to TV sitcom: This may have been an opportunity for the story of this volcano to be contracted for half an hour gigabytes. Grady Harp
