Potter's awesome acting and flat plots with no tension. And for feminist polemic, it's ridiculous. I saw this garbage when I first released and although I found it tiring out of faith I was happy I went to see it. Because now I have an immediate answer to the question that have you ever seen the worst movie? Plus, there is comfort to know about the movies that I can see in my life, better than Tango. But I have to admit that how Potter has written a script, which will provide the highest Arts Council grants from all over the world (as expressed in closed credits). <br /> <br /> I just recently saw Orlando and I see how Potter learned the wrong lessons from the making of that movie. It's all about frilly dresses, some hard straits in leading female cameras and open-ended plot to open up to the public. So why can not she remember that she can go away from her selfish selfishness, which is the tano lesson?
