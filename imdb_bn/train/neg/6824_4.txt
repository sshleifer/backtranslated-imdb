After seeing Koyaanisqatsi two or three dozen times and loving it every second, I had an opportunity to finally see the transformation of his life. I really had to first dissolved because it did not stand the first high value around. I'm not a good movie about 90 minutes on a basket with a basket on their heads. Phillip Glass's score was not the beauty or related power of the first. This movie seems to be slow and vulnerable to koanakatsati. A lower version of Barack, which is the same idea but did a good job. I hope the third movie in this series will not follow the example of this waste.
