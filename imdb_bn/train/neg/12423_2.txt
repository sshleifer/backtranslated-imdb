Cage (1989), due to 48-minute movies, thanks to a huge portion of 80 thanks to the low budget "friend" action flicks. And lathal surgery. Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno stars as those former vietnam vans who run it on a local dive bar. Reb took care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou's head shook his head and was quite soft now. Although he is huge, Lou has a baby's brain. One day some ruffians threw the wait around them and beat them in Lou and Rebb to find them. But a mother of piabac They leave Lou and Reb with nothing to crush the bar. These two thugs come in the photo (a real nice guy among them) who have plans. <br /> <br /> The movie is a waste of time. Probably, if they go all the way and create a hard core action flick instead of dragging the situation, then it probably can work. Hey, do not do it and there's left to hold the audience bag. Well good This is very bad because you have all the elements of a great B-movie. Good luck next time, I guess. <br /> <br /> do not recommend. <br /> <br /> xxx
