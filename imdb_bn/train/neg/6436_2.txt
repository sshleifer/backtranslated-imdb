I'm a kind person, so I gave this movie 2 instead of 1. I saw a very long film without any doubt. Very little plot and a very interesting place that was touched, Jesus really wanted to tell us, was highlighted on it, and instead, our heroine was given a disciplined punitive punishable look. Crucifixion in the first 15 minutes was more humane for both his character and the audience. The act was just and the direction was unclear. And, if I see another dripping water or a camera flying in front of the camera, then maybe I started screaming crying out of Patricia.
