Not even me, but this flashing is unfortunately one of the movies which is very bad and very good to be terrible, which is totally useless and time wasted. There is nothing more to do than medieval films and my name is humility: whatever subtitle takes the mediator of a new level. It is full of B-actors, but it is not funny because it takes itself seriously. It set itself up as a thriller but some growing up drama turns into a flashback style. Beautiful Alexandra Staden, Sunny out of recognition under makeup, is like a top-member cast member compared to Mod√®se Blaise. I'm not one of the few common books in the body, who want to adapt to every adaptation of its valuable "graphic novel" - in fact I could never even read Modesie Blaise - I wanted to see what I wanted to see. But it was not. The film feels half-end, with a weak and very unexciting conclusion of a weak plot. It explains every small detail of our plot and shows some flashbacks that happened before three scenes (I think we all are Alzheimer's). <br /> <br /> Now, I love the good B-movies - what better than closing your brain and consolidating the cinematic equivalent of Calgon? - And "Moddie" is not operated except Scott Spiegel, who took us from the amazing Splatter Cat flock at Dusch Leal 2: Texas blood money! I like Doc Leal Dawn 2 because it brings everything to a bad B-movie table bringing it - nudity, gore, gun, you name it. "Modesty" is simply dull. Flashbacks are not attractive for life in modesty. The performance is not good enough to laugh at. Actually, I like acting like Nicholas Costaar-Waldo (hey friend, pseudonym, your friend!) Badi. <br /> <br /> Overall it's just hair. Weaker Uninspired You call it what. Tenantino does not see anything because it represents it. It's a very forgotten, half-hearted thriller, and does not try to be more than that. Allow me to rotate this review very seriously (seriously, even I'm crawling): My name is Humility: Flexible waste of time - 4/10
