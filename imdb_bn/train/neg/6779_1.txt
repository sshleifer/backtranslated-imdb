There is a high level of expectation when viewing a comedy to see a custard headed by Kerry Grant, Jenny Manfield, Ray Walton and Warner Clapper. When this film, directed by Stanley Donne, is stronger, its expectations are stronger, whose comic touch is among others, Dam Yanks !, Bedzeld and Sharad For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that those expectations may be met? There is nothing. A light comedy is supposed to be, lead, heavy transfer plunges into melodrama, nary was a chuckle. <br /> <br /> Relative new advance Suzy Parker has often been criticized for its performance, or lack of one, in this film, but in a film which seems even great ary grants frequently appear flat and wooden, Parker's invader seems inappropriate. Even bright lights such as Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day did not change the fate of this scary, perfect and completely unreadable script, which shy away with the interest and patience of the viewer and drag it with it. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walton, is trying to breathe a little bit in the proceedings, but the horrific script is out of reinstatement. In the final moments of the film, half-hearted laughs at the heart of the spectacular effort to frustrate, striking insults only. <br /> <br /> This movie is nothing but a big disappointment at all levels.
