I would probably go to watch Woody Aleb, because nobody knows when he can actually return to his past glory. Only one or two great moments or lines can make it fit. Sadly, this image does not make it to a square. Saying is actually my sad and even guilty one. I'm sure my reaction is like many other Woody fans, but one can say what? Perhaps it's probably his time to concentrate on Clarinet, in my opinion, he is rather quite good. Not saying all this, I still have to come to the future with no new film will go. There is always hope and I will continue to respect and respect WOODY!
