I was attracted to this movie to see how the adaptation of the Whub Shelby's brutal novel was adapted. I thought that the depth of such a literary part can not be translated into bad films with rich letters, rich tactics, horrific situations, and social criticism. I was wrong <br /> <br /> <br /> This flicker is a horror movie experience, not its content, but its form. Director Ulrich Adel implemented my sincere opinion, is a terrible directory that does not judge any of the original books. Edel is not the director of TV; This movie looks and feels like a bad "made for TV" flash. Some of my bombs in this bomb ** (** ** spoilers **): <br /> <br /> - The lack of directional creativity. The scene shows slower, slower, weak shots and sometimes moved to a dirty position. They are the only freedom, cinematography areas, with a nice bold voice. Furthermore, the movie has the same technology creativity as a TV sub-opera. <br /> <br /> - All actors do a great job to illustrate these acting characters. The problem is that adaptation to platform development does not deal with a basic element: motivation. All these characters move around like robots without a clear motivation for their actions. They seem to be doing something like blue, like robots, for some reason. Edel missed every opportunity to enrich the character by not exploring the motivation of the character and avoiding the personality of each character in its full development. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Playing this wonderful whore does a great job, but in the inspired decision of the sailors, she is not allowed to violate sailors. It looks extremely stupid, we see this character blue works this. This is a clear example of the development of poor character. <br /> <br /> There are many secondary, token characters in the film that do nothing, nothing seems to be done and nothing adds to the plot. For example, and want to know more about Harry's wife about interaction between the two. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The lips also have a joke due to their lack of development. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack is the worst one I've ever experienced. Terrible work by Mark Knopfler I was seriously expected from a former leader of Dairy Streets, but his work in this movie is critically unthinkable. Occasionally, the war between the union workers and the police is completely off the movie. It seems completely poor and anachronic; I could make a soundtrack to be made with a casino toy keyboard. It distracts from the actual steps. <br /> <br /> - The adaptation of the book by Desmond Nunk is so literally deleted that story dot. It seems that they have worked so hard to keep the book's action-program-program that they have forgotten to develop the characters and again explain their actions and objectives. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie seriously, even without fan fan, because it can destroy the original book. It's a relentless effort to attract the novel, and shows very little creative inputs.
