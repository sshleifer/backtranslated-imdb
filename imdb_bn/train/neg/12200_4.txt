Generally, any film with Sylvester Stallone is usually going to suck the ass. Rambo: First Blood Part 2 was no exception. Sylvester Stallone was the only movie that was Rocky and First Blood. These pictures are extreamly unrealistic, and annoying. It does have actions, but not very good steps. I did not enjoy watching it, and I would never see it again. No wonder that it has won the Razzie Award for the worst picture. I would give it a 3/10, why it got 3 was the only reason it worked a bit better, but not good enough.
