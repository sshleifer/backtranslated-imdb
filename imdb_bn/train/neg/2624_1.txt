These films will insult skunks saying stinks. According to other commentators, this movie is humiliating for a 7-year-old mental age (this is particularly unbelievably abusive to the gays). It's terrible - and in some way "not too bad it's funny" sort of - it's just plain awful. No, I would say it: stinks it! (Sorry skunks). <br /> <br /> From the first opening to the last title, your eyes are not open for more than 10 seconds in this movie. "Intriguing" incomprehensible, irrevocable existence, on top of mugging acting "Look at me, I'm having fun!" School and so it goes. Set pieces are set up suddenly (if all) and badly executed, it's just awful in front of each - except music, I do not think that the song is lost (without song). <br /> <br /> To be justified to the creators, they keep the card very fast on the table: The opening credits have titles "Betty also plays Itha kit as satellite voice" (since the question-answer formula has never been activated, In between, one can lift Miss Kitt's contribution from a record) and the second line of the movie is running as follows: "... and scientists Iuranasera have discovered new information about around the ring. "Iuranusa -" Your School "geddit? geddit? is not it? Huh ?? Your anus? This humor is really cheap. It is a strange thing about the "joke" of that time that the hero was deliberately allowed to shoot dead people in the street deliberately but "shots" loudly. <br /> <br /> I paid fifty pence (about $ 1.00) for the sale of this movie. I feel ripped off.
