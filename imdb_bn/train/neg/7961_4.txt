Five years after the original Kreppov, another inferior horror genre has been written by Georges Romero and Stephen King: Croppo 2. There are only three stories in this period, instead of five. None of the three stories are really original or different. The first story is a horror staple, a story about an Indian statue of wood that seeks revenge against the killers of the owners. The effect is really clear in this story, but it is quite familiar to be quite mandatory. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly shop owners. The second story, "The Rapture", is the story of Stephen King. This is about four teenagers who weirdly spend in a wood palette in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon children are crying for their lives, because Pirates Blob does not disclose them for any reason. However, instead of being suspicious, the children are involved in bad conversation and doppy-headed behavior, preventing us from taking care of what's happening next. There are some strange humor in this section. The third and final story "The Hit-Hiker", which is actually re-adapted for Crippo 2. The original story, Lucile Fletcher, was portrayed in 1953 as a film silent suspense film. Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Onzer Steven. "The Hit-Hiker" works best in these three offerings, but it is not without its problems. Lois Chiles is a deceiving spouse, who is running on a hitch-hiker end or so, so he remembers. However, we can not sympathize with him or denounce him. Similar to many of the above average stories, the characters exist only to tell stories with their twists and turns Bullies seem to be a little bit of places to wrap around stories. Tom Savini appears as "creep" in this installment. The good thing has not been any more sequels. * 4/2 star 1/2
