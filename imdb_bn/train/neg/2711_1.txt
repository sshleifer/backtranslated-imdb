Even if you can get the idea that these annoying characters have personally seen each important moment in the 1960's (OK, so KT did not join the Manson family and none of the Altamont died), this film was still incredibly awful. I think the "author" has locked itself in a single room and has seen 60 films from "Forrest Gump", "The Wonder Years" and Oliver Stone, and researched it again. A Canadian television critic called the "Head Spinning" conclusion of the first episode. She was right.
