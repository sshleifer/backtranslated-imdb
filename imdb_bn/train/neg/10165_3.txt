San Francisco is a big city with great acting credits. This one, the filmmakers did not make any effort to use the city. They do not even manage the most basic of realistic details. So on the basis of San Francisco film I will not recommend it to anyone. You do not think "Oh, I was there," you think, "How did the firestap / stony bogey of two stories become lobby in a quiet hotel?" Lead something used in East Coast lecture styles and effects. It detractcts, but was always capable of acting. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, at least three distinct styles were shot. The story of Chinatown was the most effective and interesting. Plot weak, ripped scene for a scene from the classic Hong Kong Action movie. Originally there was much more tension and emotional resonance, they were created and well-paced. But acting is fun and we will see James Hong and other illumination. <br /> <br /> The role of the white boy was in vain. I think the filmmakers did not know what to do, so they cut it off leaving each other narrowly. Dad is a Barclays liberal liberal effort - really, people, everyone knows that it is not "cow" to live in the gateway - but its parts are the most ridiculous. They threw some good opportunities. Educated and confused in the West Coast, here is a Yuppie oxidation of a different type than a Yuppie cavity they made in New York. They are equally helpless but always the difference. That might be interesting; This was not. <br /> <br /> The Hunters Point Protocol was the most frustrating. It was the three most derivative, and artisticly the most distant from San Francisco. You've seen it done before and you've seen it worked well. Even video games were good! <br /> <br /> Despite the generic non-locality and the missing script, there are possible possibilities of these characters, the talent of the actors and the start of some fun, which suddenly forces the tide to move about ten minutes early. Good idea is in the wrong hands. <br /> <br /> PS, here is a missing minority, see what you can guess.
