How nice. I really do not think much about this movie, except it hurts. <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot is basically; A girl's father neglected her, so this ill PokeMon pretends to be her father. Is this the only annoyance I am? Then, be the girl girl kidnapped by this strange PokeMon Ash's mother Mother. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> She was an intelligent brat that just wanted her own way. He acted with them, with the help of "daughter" of Antoi and apparently her "father", the age of adolescence can grow and shrink. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I remember most, but I It seems you can take it as a hint, and do not see it. (Or if you see it, do not expect too much.) 1 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Seriously. If you want PokeMon movie then rent "PokeMon; First Film"
