I've started to dissolve so I'll make this review as short and sweet as possible. <br /> <br /> This astronaut has, and he knows, up a spaceship with two other people? If nothing is revealed to him in radiation, and then when he comes back ... well, do not think of what happened to other people, but our astronaut has started to dissolve! No, just do not burn, but Melt! Like ice cream in July! Well that's not fast, but what I mean? However, he gets all red and gobin, and he melt that actually makes him crazy. I think he also examined the "Guiling Man" handbook because suddenly he knew that he would have to eat human flesh to stay away from the melting, so he began to separate people. <br /> <br /> Another character, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need any other? What is important is that the WHE will do next, and what will be left to them? How long will it take for him to have nothing? Why is this movie made in the first place? Where did they get the money? How do you sleep when you fall asleep? <br /> <br /> I'm almost melted, but there's still plenty of time left to tell you that this movie is horribly annoying, though the concept is really cool and kind of total. Clear the makeup but everything else ... SPLAT
