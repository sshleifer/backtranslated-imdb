Sometimes do not consider watching this sorry excuse for a film. The way it is shot, shining, acting etc. not just knowledge. It's all difficult to see so hard. Clip load exceeds the annoyance. The entire film does not appear to be a 'normal' person, and the existence of the 'outer world' is fine, it just does not exist. And why the bald guy suddenly becomes strangers? This picture is stupid. Zero.
