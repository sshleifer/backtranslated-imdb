Well, I do not know where to start. It was obviously made for TV movie, so my expectations were low. I am surprisingly surprised by the overall instruction of the second hour, but before that or any subsequent picture, the number of pictures started to be a paint. <br /> <br /> Talk about bad chemistry between hat and love detectives. <br /> <br /> <br /> I will go further in depth, but this movie is not really worth it. Grade: D + (IMDB rating 3/10)
