Richard is a good word to describe this movie. <br /> <br /> Every movie has a selling point, a hostage. Transformers' hostage influence is as well as fan boys nostalgia. The laziness in Seattle's hostage is situational in their tag-line, "If you never meet someone, did you ever see anyone, did not you know anyone who is the only person for you?" Many romances depend on heavy through this hostage and some big name drawings. Lap uses the Irish people as a situation and uses both famous names in the country. <br /> <br /> Now viewers, in addition to all the common elements of common characters, conflicts or consequences, crisis, solutions and denials, they are in the afternoon, interesting sub-plots and possibly something, a good twist in the middle or the end Dialog stimulant, wants to look at more dry conditions. The story that supports the character's position. <br /> <br /> This gene is not trying to achieve Yeo. If they have tried, their goal was apparently in another court at other stadiums on the other side of the planet. He and his authors, Alain Lerac, failed to provide provocative dialogue. Most of the lines are contracted. It seems like they have a bag in their movies that they want to use in their movies: "Well, I read from the lines and quotes that I saw or the films that I saw or read books, and they all are good to me. If they look good to me, they will love the audience. So, all I have to do is trim them together. I'm going to use everyone. "The results are cathartic. I can not say that the lines were unnecessary and they were not related to the story or were not related to the plot, but they are stopping you from quoting citations with no quits anywhere. <br /> <br /> At the personal level, I know by quoting quotes based on most of the situations in our conversations, as well as trying to make it meaningful with themselves. I will not go out with them anymore because the desire to punch them is too shocking. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the letters depicted are silly and one dimensional. An exception to the irrelevant conversation which is their motivation (necessary for plugging the plates), there was no firm determination in them. I do not have an idea of ​​who they are. All the availability of spreading lines from women-based magazine advice columns <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> then again , The movie is low but better shown, there is not. They made it with my first and second point. Moreover, sub-plots are incompatible (it is not bad for movies) and thin (bad thing). <br /> <br /> ZenYeh and the producers are trying to stop the terrible plot with fancy locations. Passable photography For this reason, they probably understand that with the film's good use, soundtracks and movie positions, it is possible to get approval from some viewers and easier than others. This senseless audience. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie is so bad that it's good. It's just bad. Do not see this.
