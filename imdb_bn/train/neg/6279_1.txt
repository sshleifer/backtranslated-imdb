No, <br /> <br /> Basically you see something that you do not understand. The film is not meant for those who really want this. I'll explain this story. <br /> <br /> Every day you have to walk down the street in a normal street, then drive yourself. His own car He followed her and there would be many incidents involving her and her family. <br /> <br /> I created an account specifically to comment on this picture, how horrible it was written. The performance was great, the event was great, but the story did not bring it anywhere - it could turn out loud and global epidemic. I'm not sure that the writer is trying to accomplish this task, usually at the end of the film, most of your question answers can be found, but this movie asks you what happened and only 1 hour and 20 minutes did not pass to do anything. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> They had these two dimensions (behind us and the back glass) that would come into our world and kill us. It was not mentioned at the time of the movie and you never knew it was happening or never knew when it happened. Nothing is interpreted during the film. The main character will not even be the main character. At the end of the film, the person who eventually portrays all of them and goes away (his sister boyfriend) may be the main character, but sadly this movie ends in 20 seconds. <br /> <br /> I bought this movie for 10 dollars, I just threw it off. Do not waste your time. I really do not expect anything like this.
