This is a really stupid movie. It can be fun with the coolest finder alien and country settings, but it's not right. <br /> <br /> Some alien people hear the broadcast of war around the world while running a small country radio station in Halloween. They come to earth to kill people, but instead of killing them, they make people their slaves and fool them. The cover in front of the film ride on the surfboards of the aliens spaces ... is not actually what they are doing. This party is not alien, they are stupid cartoon idiots with bitter high throbbing modulated voice. Alien with the most tolerant voice is also always Jacket Nicholson Rip of Arian who always wear his sunglasses. Other than the Alien, acting is terrible. Writing is meant for children, because each character is written like a child. <br /> <br /> This is a mobile phone, which will appreciate only children. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** of 1/2. 100 minutes PG for light language.
