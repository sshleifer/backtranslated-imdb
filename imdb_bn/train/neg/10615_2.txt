While sitting through such a flat, uninspiring drivel, it may seem like a lifetime of less than 2 hours is weird. If this story, like Sally Potter is considered to be personal, you do not expect a little emotions to show her performance? Her performance was completely isolated, and I did not feel any chemistry between Sally and Pablo and Tango scenes, which should have been burning in a dance form, rather painful and hateful than that. Obviously, it may be difficult to publish such personal stories in movies, and just as Sally Potter wishes to use her best to act as a good actor instead of breaking her love.
