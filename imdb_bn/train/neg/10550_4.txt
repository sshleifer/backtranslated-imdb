After 'Stella Street' being a big fan of the ten-minute TV episode, I waited with the excitement and expectation of this movie. Unfortunately I went off feeling very frustrated. <br /> <br /> I was almost frustrated that almost all Gag and a fishing machine was taken directly from TV episodes, and delivered with less encouragement and humorous times, as the actor once told them, and again Can not be disturbed. I bought my copy in DVD and felt cheating that I again took part in my hard cash to see the same joke. The film's plot begins with Steele Street (in a typical English street), gradually 'Stylish 40 Years and Most Famous People on Screen' Michael Kain, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Bringing a population with Stones. All celebrities in the street are brought out of their entire fortune through local forgery and are forced to live like trams and ordinary working groups. There are some nice moments, but overall, writers take a fun idea and make it quite annoying. * Spinners end * <br /> <br /> T.V. In Episodes, all characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (with female), but Ronnie Ancona is portrayed in the film. I think this is a mistake. His impersonation was not funny, and like his feelings, his characters were included in the story only for doing something. <br /> <br /> If you were not a fan of Stella Street, you could find that this film is entertaining. But if you are a fan, you may feel a little cheated. 4/10
