Knock this out of running for trite, clich√©d dialogue and plotting (through the 1980's fantasy movies we saw all of the same kind stuff), hottie music, and character characters by a single paint for all but the most hardcore fans. <Br /> <br /> What does this movie save from Junk Hip? Bakhshi's work, Rotuscoping, and Frank Frazeta teach that the animate to draw like this is beautiful. This is the return ... speed. Violence spectacular and art direction and animation are different from the other times of the sword and museum. <br /> <br /> I would like to close the soundtrack playing the first Conn film.
