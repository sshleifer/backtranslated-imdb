As someone else mentions, it starts with a wicked temptation about a little blonde girl to murder a cat. Then the main story: A photographer (Gafari) and a writer (Shepard) meet the opportunity and travel to the mountains. First of all, they roam around the house in the night, where the little deaf landlady roars with Gaffer with excessive irritation of the audience. Once in the mountains, they are looking for shelter and are invited by an elderly lady who thinks of guests as guests for strangers (Hansel and Gretel, someone?) What will happen next, I will move away for a brave spectator because I'm sure 'T' Now, I like Eurohora, and if it was something Artigat (writer and director) tried to tell a logical story, it would have been better. Backdrop (Pyrenees?) Makes a wonderful and playful position for mysterious and occult events. The pure peak is easily supernatural forces and those who can obscure their commands. Photography is excellent. Just willing to make sense of the whole thing. You can see this image at archive.org.
