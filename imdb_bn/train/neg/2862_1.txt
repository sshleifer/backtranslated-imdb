Nobody needed to send this Uli Lommel guy back to MOVIE school. Who ever told him how to make a movie? Can just make movies on this day? In the past, it is always necessary to make a list before filming can be made. After seeing this luncheon movie made of movies and others, it seems like a poor person like me has made a film making business. Actually, I think I could even make films like Ully Lam. This film has nothing to do with BT assassins, except the name of the other, the killers have no names. That's it. This guy got a bigger idea that Bitter has cried with people and all the other mockers in the movie? This is one of the best examples that people are trying to greed for the fame that people have earned to see their movie on the basis of the word "BT K". Most Merciful The only series of killer films I respect that Liam "Dahr" is a movie. The child who washed many cigarettes bothered me. Anyone that needs to make a shot
