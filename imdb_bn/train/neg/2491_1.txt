Maiden Voyage is exactly that. I want to say directly that I saw 5 minutes ago and I could not stand before. As already stated in another comment, the film does not fall into the "so bad it is good" thing, it's just bad. Acting horror, SFX is poor, and the stories are blue and stupid. Even the extra kiss, "bag guy guards" and they can keep their arms as water pistols. <br /> <br /> Do not be bothered to see this movie, the only thing about it, no matter how low your expectations, you will still be disappointed.
