Clothing, dialogue, historical accuracy is terrible. For example, - Stasi dash and hanging scene. The pebble was right (as I used to say), but that kind of gravel broke the person's throat. Until the ropes were shot, the rope was left with a great disaster. Such a person was not disturbed, they killed them at the end of the drop. <br /> <br /> And they strapped a group of stops on the street before going to robbing a bank (flashabaya) - with their bandanna concealed their mouth - the streets were clear to the people. <br /> <br /> Poor editing - that packs a battery under the shirt and it is clear, the clip's "long journey" shows them to ride along, then reverse the film. <br /> <br /> I liked the scene that they kept the scene with horses and horses - it seemed to be symbolic. The whole movie was shit.
