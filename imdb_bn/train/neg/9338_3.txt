Pam grier stars as authentic. She is a nurse who is a drug dealer for revenge, who hid her sister in a bad actress. Like a blackschupting flick of 70, you can expect racist bad guys to see their desserts only. <br /> <br /> The majority of these films made in the 70's were frustrating, and they were absolutely frustrating for both black and white audiences. This is mainly due to the harmful racial animosity between these movies and the frustrating, intelligent characters. Especially female characters. <br /> <br /> Among other common threads in coffee, and among other movies, cruel violence, corrupt police, car driving, insignificance and lots of crazy women are included. Do not mention populated urban ghettos by drug-vendors, pimps, mobsters, and other criminal scum. <br /> <br /> Pam Greyer, the 70s Blaxploitation was the queen regardless of the queen. He's great, both tough-as-nails, and being drop-dead pretty. Like his other films, Palm coffee outshines other characters. In fact, the Palm screen is so charismatic, that such films are unknown, without its main character. <br /> <br /> If you like Pam Gray, you like to watch her other films, such as Foxie Brown, or maybe Friday Foster. These films have much less sleaze than coffee. Palm's character in the coffee reduces its path to getting bad guys. Palm characters in their other Blackploughting films will not move at least for revenge, just like coffee. <br /> <br /> I said, keep an eye on coffee if you can not see any other palm gear film. Otherwise, the time of coffee is wasted. Only talented talent such as actress, coffee is portable.
