Do not waste your money to rent this horrible, awesome, awesome movie. It's like a low budget made for TV Canadian movies. The worst movies I've ever seen and there are many others there. This movie is not worth the time to apply it to a DVD player or VCR. : ~ (Ten lines can be written? Acting was horrible, there was absolutely no flow. I saw watching TV movie in BT killer and it was very good (compared to that). Make sure to do what they were about to create this image but If it is a story about educating us or telling a story about the killers of BT, they have exceeded a mile, which is an infusion of animal rights. Marsiyala considered.
