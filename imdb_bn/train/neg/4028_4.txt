It was all a very well written film - good actors (Robert Logzia, Allen Parker), a good plot (threatens to burn the mysterious missile from space) and many of the stock footage (if the air force film was Jets Rocket Firing, Is). Unfortunately, it is too much annoying by melodram and an impossible timeframe. <br /> <br /> The movie concerns a ballistic missile from the Soviet-infested site and is unconvincingly transformed into less atmospheric orbits. Under five miles and over 4,000 miles, it drains a million degrees, burns glaciers, remote early warning (Dewey) line bases, and grounds with eskimos. <br /> <br /> Every attempt to destroy the missile failed. <br /> <br /> The first flaws in this movie are primarily displayed. Although we do not expect more than low budget movies, some things can not be forgotten - a little research. For example, missile missiles, including both the Soviet and US anti-ballistic missile firefighters, accuracy. However, the first successful ABM test was not done by Russians until March 1961. <br /> <br /> There are too many melodrams. Dr. Lering (Loggia) and his assistant Joan Woods (Elen Parker) play their romance with wood like a log cabin. The character of the park cried to Logi's enthusiasm and was in the examination of the wife-in-law screen. Loggia is about heroic as a bored trader. A scientist (Philipp Pine) has done so much that he saw William Shatner like Thespean. In view of the scene, a bus driver spit on the end of the last world. The only good actor film depiction, starring actress Lawrence Dubins ("Nude City"). <br /> <br /> It can be ignored if it is not for the time line. After sending the missile information to DC, the Pentagon brought a group of scientists. A general (Larry Care) announced that the missile hit New York City in 63 minutes. After this, discussions were made by scientists and the words were sought from the angels, such as the missile attacking the Russians and if the reaction is needed then it can be seen. <br /> <br /> The picture shows the military being completely scrambled. Civil Defense workers leave work and go to their stations. Eight million people are expected to take shelter in school buses by selecting millions of children. (And we'll see that white white New York City, though 50 science-film movies seem to have been ideal). The news was kept in the dark for ten minutes. Then, incredibly, a man in the Pentagon declares that the missile will hit Canada at Ottawa, Canada 51 minutes! In 12 minutes all previous happenings happen! Then to add fuel to the fire, Loggia thinks of the way to stop the alien missile. He gradually made a cathode of Plutonium, load it into a jeep and move it from the DC to a remote missile base to place it on a missile. On the way, he is closed on the road by a wild driver, is broken and then carjacked. He finally gets plutonium and gets the missile arm drive base. Again, this is the same frame of 63 minutes. <br /> <br /> The movie disturbs the viewer as if it seems to survive, only men, women and children can be roasted. The missile said five minutes after reaching New York. Loggia is still driving the base (more 4 miles to go). When he gets the base and the missile weapon, a two-minute countdown is announced. All in five minutes. New York bars should have squawk at least. <br /> <br /> If you do not guess, the missile is destroyed. ABM Warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium-based nuclear explosion. After five seconds, the explosion dissipates and cleans all. Yes, they caused a simultaneous nuclear explosion of 100 Hiroshima at the outskirts of New York City, and nothing happens. <br /> <br /> The image was all the elements needed for the good B film, but destroyed them. Loggia played her character so lamely did not care for you that you eventually sacrificed herself. You do not care about other characters, even smeary scientist played by the pine. The excitement that should be removed in the film was not physically possible during the time limit (it will not be today, not even with Jack Bauer). <br /> <br /> This image is very difficult to find. As far as I know, it has not been reinstated for any medium and good reason. I do not know if the film is meant or it is not a mental habit, but in a scenario where the government sends the best of the best scientists, military men and businessmen, they say they are very valuable to lose. The bunch is not a single female or minority. Hari Rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a short bit of playing a piano. It was worse than "27 days", where an alien five earthlings give the opportunity to save or destroy the planet and not include any black or Hispanic. <br /> <br /> I'm a special science-turned-fighter on Turner classic movie and I do not expect to see it again. If you find a copy somewhere, then you want to keep it on Amazon.com.
