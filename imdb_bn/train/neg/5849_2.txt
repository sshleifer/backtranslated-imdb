Being a fan of silent film, I was looking forward to seeing this picture for the first time. I was quite frustrated. As mentioned, the film seems to be long, long, commercial for Maxwell Automobiles. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the Chase view is about half the length, but I may have enjoyed more. But it got very old too. And when I realize that the reality is expanded many times in the movie, without hurting the audience, what were the Mexican bandits? I mean, they are driving the car through the mountains, a car that is running almost a mile every hour, but they can not catch it?
