I was surprised to see how 2008's Oscar won the Best Picture of 2008 and thus went to see Heart Locker. Sadly, what I got for a two-hour investment is the firm assurance that this movie has won awards for the full off of the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie's direction and visual style is the weakest you will ever see. When it is not busy, while honoring other Bourne identities with horror, annoying "Shaky Cam" visuals, it shows all the harmmakers of second-rate soap operators in lensing. <br /> <br /> Character features are also marked as Beetle Comedy Strip ideas and discarded as conversations - in which case the film releases to be "lowest" and for any apparent reason one or two soldiers are correct Does not turn into Chatterbox - some record is the worst. Perfectly, the actors can do the right maker in this situation, not enough to hide just how bad the project is. <br /> <br /> The whole movie seems to think that it was the kind of "musician" they had stopped watching from watching humor and thus they were re-edited so that they could pass it as a serious play. <br /> <br /> If you spend two hours in this movie then two hours you never come back, and two hours of waste that you will regret for the rest of your life.
