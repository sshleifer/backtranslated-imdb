For reliable trusted fast supporters who want to watch a good music video, skip this. The producers decided to become creative and this 80's video created something of a science-fiction story, which came out of the band's name, Bad Barberella Villen <br /> <br /> The idea that the concept fails is that midway between the distant, distant and annoying cut scenes of 80s, imaginative rivals are trying to stop the band in their concert. Good music does not interrupt repeatedly, but we are damaged by some of the cheap spin-off stories hosted by a bad Dr. Maria. It's almost too much to bear 2/10
