Ga Raichi's extraordinary effort to be fiercely beaten, rape, rape, kicking, shooting, hijacking, spitting, hitting, sodomized, and tortured and left for the dead. His performance was very memorable for graduates of Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Richie made some good efforts to reconcile this, and if you exclude all the scenes from his wife, this is the best movie. I think that the best acting action was sometimes to comfort Guy's wife that her performance was good enough to not shoot again. If you get the chance to show swipe hour or your tenell clip for 89 minutes ... go for extended pedicure.
