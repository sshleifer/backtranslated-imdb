I think this cartoon is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. I recommend this cartoon to people under 5 years old. When I liked this show when I was 4 and 5 years old, I only saw it when there was nothing. Now I want to do my homework other than 5 and I rather see it. The cartoon was a little funny but they were not enough for me to laugh. Now I'm old I'm not interested in seeing the underwater sinker. I started to see Doctor Who (12th), Torchwood (15) and Sarah Jane Adventure (PG). I am not interested in doing anything with the doctor, because I am not interested in cartoon of 5 years. This cartoon did not last for just 6 seasons, it was less spectators because it was canceled, but some people say that writers have withdrawn from the idea, but for most other shows they have at least 8 seasons.
