If there was a 0 star rating I would gladly hand out this absolutely awesome pill out of waste. The actual summary is perfectly fine and if it is isolated then it can be bright only then it can make it worse. Locking a group of people in a test chamber is fine, but the experience is fine? I see unaware of surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture I do not know or want to know about ... The challenge is unfortunate and silly. The reality is to show the whole point of TV reality. If you set a 'challenge' they do not play with the overpriced props of food and stereotyptical cultural elements in 'Friday Night Games'. To make them a real challenge. And as the meaning of 'earnings' reward, it is fine, if they actually earn it! These people are nuts. If they make the shot better, the real idea will be magnificent. But that does not happen!
