... and I actually gave it a ZERO on my personal 1-10 scale. I joined the films since 1952 and have seen more than 1,000 good at the theater (I do not only rate movies that I see on TV). This is the only movie I've ever rated zero. <br /> <br /> My wife and I took our four children (then 15, 11, 8 and 6 years old) and even the kids thought terrible. Actually, my daughter (now 26) warned me about this site (I'm surprised that this movie got the overall rating of 4+). <br /> <br /> The dinosaurs were amateur during the animation (and the worse the retreat), the fame (especially by Shan Young) is fierce and the story lines are simply silly. <br /> <br />
