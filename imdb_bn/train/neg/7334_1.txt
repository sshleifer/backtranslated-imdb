I've seen Stuart Bliss the worst movie ever. <br /> <br /> The acting was terrible and the plot was ridiculous. I think the main character's wife has caused a mental break because of leaving him, but it has become so stupid and annoying, after some time I could not be less careful about a character. <br /> <br /> Over the same concept without adding something fresh or amazing for adding the platform to the movie. Stewart started to open his wall and after a while he got very much. After seeing something in the counter, to see what was behind him <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> I was an actor that when I could not recognize an actor, I had the idea. When you come to this movie yourself, read a book! You will be well off
