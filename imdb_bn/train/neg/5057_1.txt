Extremely old film with horror, clich√©-ridden and mawkish dialogue and a very poor construction. In addition, Cassavetes and Palka are constantly unchanged. A disguised "good movie" This intellectual turkey takes time to discover how disasters are. The first scene is filled with a total bore, histrionics and hysteric exchange. The sound is horrible The character building is without imagination of the camera movement as well. No poems, no subtle psychology, no attractive shot Actors continually smoke and we see advertisements for beer drinks. Very cheap, indeed, indeed. (One exception: Nothing is nice and easy way to play Hit Man).
