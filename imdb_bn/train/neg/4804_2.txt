I do not see many television and came across this show. Reality show? I'm not sure for this real. If I was a man and had such nudity and used to marry someone who would marry, it would be the reason for divorce. I think he sets a bad example of how he should treat a person who loves a person. This is something that is wrong with our world now, many of the bad relationships, selfish and others do not understand the meaning of true love. It is not something that will be self-sacrificing and Merritt. It does not give a great feeling to see what should be in private privacy. If his personality is for the sake of the show, he claims to be better suited to anyone who will truly show genuine love and care and who will praise him for whom. This show is for a reality or rating ???? I really want to know. Sincerely, GB
