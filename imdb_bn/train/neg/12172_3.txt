After the defeat of the first Slipway camp, who thinks the franchisee may be born. Second aspect of SC is higher. More inspired killings and just a lot of fun. Although it's not saying too much (compared to the first movie), Slipway Camp 2 is worth the renter. <br /> <br /> Professional: SCI. Due to its inspiration, killing is not very attentive. Cons: Kopi acting and mullets in plenty. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: 5/10 <br /> <br />
