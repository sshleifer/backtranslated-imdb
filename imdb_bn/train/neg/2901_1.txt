There is a positive comment about Dan in Real Life in IMDB, it only understands that their junk staff are trying to try people to see this stern movie. <br /> <br /> I have no words, there is no idea to describe the real horror movie where I sat last night - Dan in real life. Steve's characters in previous films believed me that I would feel anything for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for Cast. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so narrow, family was the family of this cookie cutter Walton and this movie has long been that I think it was a real idea that someone laughed. Do yourself and pass this horribly bad movie and do not trust the things you read in IMDB because the first comments people wrote in a different theater watching a good movie.
