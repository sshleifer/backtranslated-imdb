This film is not like the 1954 version Judy Garland and James Mason, and it's a shame because the 1954 edition, in my opinion, is very good. I'm not denying the genius of Barbara Streisand She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I'm not familiar with Chris Kristoferson's other work and so I can not judge it. However, this movie has many pages to be desired. It can be very difficult to gradually, it has undesired nudity and dirty language, and sit through. However, I'm a big fan of rock music, so it's natural that I like the goodies of Judy Garland. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Chris and judge for yourself.
