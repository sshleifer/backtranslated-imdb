This movie has a redeeming feature. At one stage, after a character is attacked by a letter fairy, his brother asks, "Why is your dick there, chalk?" After nearly a one hour of bad movie trouble, this almost all of my drinking came out of my nose. <br /> <br /> Some acting is not too bad, but kids will be ashamed of all stink and PJ Seals to make this film themselves. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or dictates a common sense) They <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > For example, at one stage, younger children should have a strong focus on moving the physical body to the ghost so that they can prove that they exist, a solid credit because they can not communicate with the physical body apparently. However, after a few minutes they all took off the branches and beat the tooth fair with them. Apparently they sometimes move matters and sometimes they can not. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many blood and throat, though ... some beautiful boobs. But it is not created for the deficit. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie about Tooth Fair, rent "Darkness Fruit". I think it's great, but many critics do not share my opinions. At least it's a mood set.
