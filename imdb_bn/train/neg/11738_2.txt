Want to "Iowa" for Midwest Meth, "Rifle for a Dream", but it comes as a hard-rated "Refer Madness". <br /> <br /> Yes, medicines are bad, and meth is very terrible, an addiction and how to destroy people, families and communities. But these characters are fools or laughable and eye-tricked plot, they will not teach any lesson. <br /> <br /> There is some charisma on the screen of the author / director / star Matt Farnavarth, who has played a stupid, intelligent eye-pleasing innocent actor by his partner Dean Foster Drugs, Susan Sarndon's "Rocky Horror Picture Show". Sorry for all the complete unnecessary nudity I made. At the end of this movie I did not understand that these two recent High school graduates were meant to explain some of their atheists, because the bomb blasts took place in their school photographs, but if so, they looked older than the "OC" people, they have good chemistry on the screen, but they are a "badlands" -the pale of the white couple Imitation. <br /> <br /> The guest star is used badly.TV "The Pretendor" was well-liked by Michael T. Wes. Completely stupid as a corrupt parole officer and her cruel violence is simply crazy, because her character has destroyed many social significance for the film. Rovana Arquette's low rent will be more salvage than David Voyenberg's move to David Craneberg. John Savage has even put me in front of the pot to make an outcry of old baby boom but this is bad. A goth chick shows, with a wonderful explanation that he is a stripper of Des Moines. Mandatory Latino drug dealers appear - Iowa? <br /> <br /> With a limited budget, the indoor scene is very scaryly portrayed for use in meth. We certainly see them go crazy. <br /> <br /> Although Iowa locations have been used very well (with a ridiculous view of a propane gas robbery), the pronunciation and churches mention confusing South Baptist Guns are legal and law enforcement people seem to be using more than an in-city drug-dealing film. <br /> <br /> The best known guard in Aire is used throughout Greg Brown's song, but not surprisingly, the credit is listed. I hope they have been used with permission. <br /> <br /> I caught it in NYSE with its commercial drive because I missed it at the Tribby Film Festival where it was notable - and vague - buzz.
