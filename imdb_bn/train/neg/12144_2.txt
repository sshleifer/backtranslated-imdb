Although nothing can compare vs the vampire. Zoom ... I try to judge this movie in any film making film. <br /> <br /> First, special effects were breathing. When an explosion occurred on the television screen, I thought my whole room would explode, and when the automatic machine guns were fired, I thought that the shells were landing on the ground beside me. Just my friends are stunning <br /> <br /> But the scene when Jack Black is giving the worst sound of the sound-like, I've ever heard that I almost killed myself, but do not worry after being worried. In the film he can stop acting his terrible "be high on me". Sincerely, he must have seen himself fooling about unrecognized thoughts that does not completely give any idea and adds that he must be "high" in order to justify his horror performance. If you talked to writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors, but if you can say it for acting terribly, you probably will get the same response ... seriously <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> -O-Rum "I was surprised, I did not have a sari close shotgun in my mouth, and my life ended with this frustrating horrific excuse during a movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, <br /> <br /> you should have killed Lt. /> <br /> <br
