I have expressed interest in this movie by reminding the movie of Silent Hill's critics. <br /> <br /> Being a huge Silent Hill fan and frustrated with the debut of his movie, I thought I would give it a chance. Mind, Fearnet only lists this film as "Dark Flores", not its full name. So when I saw the name "Mr. Lordby" in credit, I thought the band (there were some friends in college like me) but it does not seem that it was important and quickly pushed the thought away. <Br /> <br /> The film has become stronger The real "strange little girl" has been with Death, yet the feeling of good use and isolation of the audio really begins to piece together the story together. The atmosphere of tension is created quickly, and each indication is excellent in the film. Giants are horrific genuine big and large big big stones. <br /> <br />, and I found myself involved extensively. When I appeared for the second time, I actually felt like coming from the Megadeth concert, and the impression made me completely closed. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere on the film remains continuous, and the story left you just wondering what was going on, but the scares had quite existed. However, I hope the last one makes it right. Unfortunately that would not be the case. Until the end of the film, I was completely in disbelief, and I immediately recognized the big bad in its final release ... Lord's Chief Singer? Seriously? <br /> <br /> Did all this fly in this movie? A band of poor souls taking shelter in hospital by Lord band members? Sense giant design suddenly created in the sense. If you are going to be pure, then Marilyn can be a member of Manson as well as even KISSO. A few years ago, in the Lord's music video, I finally saw that I'm not sure. They have to go and close the whole movie? Worse, when I wanted to know what was actually going on, I could have awakened everything. I'm not going to "destroy" it for you, but I can safely say that this is probably a plot device that you've seen before. Probably once. <br /> <br /> So, stay away from here if you're a huge lordly fan. It's not terrible, it does not bring anything new to the table (though it does another good movie, basically doing a good job of borrowing from Silent Hill). And, I'm not able to put enough pressure, Lord Rival. Lordi Talk about a buzzkill. <br /> <br /> Truly, you are trying to frighten yourself by seeing Slipkot music videos. In other words, it is not possible.
