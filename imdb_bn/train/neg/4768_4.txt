I was recently frustrated over the nine dead and wanted to read the current reviews that I could deal with an average movie. But the film was still less than the average, yet to be seen. The script was poorly written, and for a B-level movie, acting was fairly good and the couple was average with the couple. Plate borders of SÃ£o, teach people that they have made a mistake in the situation and are trying to make their life more grateful, but it ends in comparison. Nine tries to heart and purpose behind simple concepts that are not nine dead ideas. The main culprits found in nine deaths were in front of the Flashback audience, which took place 3 minutes before the film and was completely unnecessary and was completely inadequate that people are not coming in bad way. Without making any fools, I've seen bad movies bad and even did not end it badly. Disrespect, bad acting and ending ...
