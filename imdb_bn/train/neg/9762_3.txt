Alan Elda plays the real life "Sports Illustrated" writer George Plimpton, who once invited the Detroit Lions football team to join the honor. Rather wan, weird drama, whimsical with imagination. Director Alex March takes an interesting step on this material, shooting it in a mini-documentary fashion (with Macho commentary) and still touches the catapress very tale; Yet, by bringing cinematic flashes to this set-up, he turned the headline into a quarrel. Alda's smug, uncharismatic performance, is another difficulty, though the supporter cast is filled with real-life pro-athlete (and how Scrantillating Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend - for a fantasy?). * **** to 1/2
