My spouse and I found this movie very schalky. It started well, but got quick incredible and ridiculous. Most of the acting was poor, except for the exception of the little girl, Abby, who was really awesome. In addition, the dialog was expected and there were lingers - especially Gideon, the angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when a character has a tragedy, he appears almost helpless. At first we thought it was a 'shock', but then we realized that it was a terrible script. We like almost all of the Hallmark films and their heart-warming stories, but this film is not an event that emerges. Have a great deal of time - do not waste your time with this awesome movie.
