Acting, other reviews, however, had significantly better work. Brad Pitt manages very well in the role of an annoying, overwhelming Austrian climber. Other acting fine. The story could have been written, but anyway, it misses - nobody really understands or does not think about the characters shown, and so the story, which can be quite dramatic, fails to draw the audience. <br /> <br /> Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a wonderful dramatic true story, an important event that we live in the world - but I could not, I could not try, include myself in this story. As a fan of Brad Pitt fan (I think of him as one of the best 5 actors of his generation), I want to choose this Flickr * - and yet, it keeps me cold. It may be a failure in me, but I am directing the creative edge of the film - directions, writing scripts, production, editing - just as they lost me. It can be nice because it's embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Good acting, dramatic story, shoot nicely - it should be supernatural. It was not. Perhaps it is valuable to monitor your own mind - but do not expect too much, and you probably will not be disappointed because I was. Mostly, it's my bored.
