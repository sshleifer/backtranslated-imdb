Day of the greatness of 90 (God rests in his soul) You can turn great comedy Central any day of the day and watch satellite night live is the greatest sketch show of all time ever. A glorious event was going on, it was the original note-ready-prime-time-primetime players or one of the SNL's golden age - Chris Fary, Adam Sandler, David Spade ... and then, all of them went to hell. I was open to Madtey almost a year and a half ago, and I think I'll be out of shock. How many days so terrible can show a show? There are many terrible errors. I think I'll start with the writing. For writing, the most part is terrible. It's nothing but kindergarten bathroom humor. Cast, for the most part, is talentless. I've enjoyed a few sketches, such as some of Mrs. Swann and Stewart, and some talents like Shona, such as Fantastic Alex Bourstein. Phil Lammar is not a brilliant actor, as a curiosity. Even though some of the Spar Ha Ha Ha moment, they are not enough to liberate this endless line of terrible drill caused by Bumbandhu Idiot. Miss this one
