Calling disturbed is a horror movie difficult. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Acting is ok but not great. The story can be somewhat interesting at the beginning, when someone is trying to get what is happening. But at the end nobody understands that there is not much to understand. Sometimes the "fearsome" material seems to have been added to the script without reason ... <br /> <br /> So ... (yawn) If you do not have anything interesting to look like this, watch this movie Or looking for the clouds.
