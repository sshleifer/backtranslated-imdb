I just did not enjoy this film. But then I loved Babe, liked a pig in the city and was hurt by talking in a lively film that is well-done all the way. Animals were not liked. They were all boring of Chris Rock's Guinea Pig, but then what I could expect, it was Chris Rock. I believe I'm one or two couples lush in the clever line, but that's it.
