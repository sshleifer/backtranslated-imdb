This is probably not fitted below the barrels of medium slash films, but it is definitely a bad movie. <br /> <br /> It was interesting for holiday hikes, but after the first scene, the film shows that it is poor production value and stupid plot. I mean, this sub-section was no objectionable reason for an invisible psychological slashing at this moment, but it was too far away. There is no solidarity in the events or there is nothing else to add. <br /> <br /> The clich√©s are more annoying, lesser, and mysterious. <br /> <br /> A vest medium slashher entry should not be hyped even if there is a video nastie label. <br /> <br /> I'm really frustrated by this wrapped piece of this garbage.
