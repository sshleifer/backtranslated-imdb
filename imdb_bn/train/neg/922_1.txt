When you really stretch your skills in this movie, you get exactly what you get, it's like a person who has passed the driving test and then put them in Formula 1 Grand Prix (I can not add, as all US Grand Prix can take away Dodgy tires and you can only win), how far is this film small. Now take the wrong path, I love B-movies, almost half of my collection is made in B-movies, but I do not think there is enough character in the alphabet to describe how bad this movie is. <Br /> <br /> The first story (for B-movie) is not bad, it is likely to make a B-movie brand, Friday 13th is not likely to speak, but potentially none is low. But acting out of how this movie actually plays, I do not believe anything in a second, it looks like QVC, which seems to have a heavy tone on QVC's presenters. <br /> <br /> I do not want to say I saw a bad movie, but I can not.
