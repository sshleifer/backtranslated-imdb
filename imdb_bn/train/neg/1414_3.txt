After watching this movie I came to IMDB and read some reviews, which compared with the Last In Translation Lite. When I read it, I immediately saw critics' points. <br /> <br /> This movie was a bad attempt at the same theme. Interestingly, the format of the film is almost identical, but PACING is incredibly different. "10 items" viewer pushed the viewer through line 1-day time, and well-planned "Lost In ..." seems to have been extended for a while. <br /> <br /> I'm sure that some people can see it because it's Morgan Freeman, and be frustrated. It seems to be a good role now - supporting role in one day's big blockbusters, 10 million limited release movies and Indie, in terms of the main roles.
