This picture was pure pain. While sitting in the theater for an X-minute minute, I was thinking when the movie starts. All the setup was in place; Generally love stories, characters must overcome their little feelings, villains should appear, but none of them ever started. If these incidents happen, I was already annoyed and the device was not fully effective. The scenes require lots of pressure and buildup, it used to spend the necessary frames. Kid's stuff does not have to be this way. Children's shadow may be as attractive as an heel and adults. Excuse me, "Hey, it's for kids," say. I have to take "Stone In Talwar" any day. This was terrible. I'm going to get the feeling that Disney will be making some out of these days. And for the kids, 10 years I saw this ... would agree ... pure garbage.
