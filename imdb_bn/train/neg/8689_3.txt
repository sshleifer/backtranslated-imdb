The main problem of "power" is that it does not add anything to the movie in such a way that the characterless characters and subpotts are not. After a while it became annoying, waiting through the scene that could not find anything to take the movie forward. You can probably turn it off like a character development, but all of their movies are recycled from the previous scenes, or only flat and selfish. Lumet does not give enough time to let the cast blister support. He should cut a few of the letters (Hackman, Wife) and others should (concentrate on) the difficulties. It can be a great, rigorous political thriller, a awkward mess that has lost any message in the bad writing and acting ocean, it's a story that makes me wonder if Cast is a surprise.

All of Gere and others have done far better performance elsewhere. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>} It has not worked yet in Sydney, and it probably will not be.
