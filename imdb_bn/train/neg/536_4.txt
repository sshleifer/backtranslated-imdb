A woman related to her death bed, her two daughters (Nina and Constance) and her thoughts about her past. Flashback is related to a weekend where young Ann is her friend Lila's wedding. At the wedding, she will show Haris who will influence her for the rest of her life. Through all of her professional and family life up and down she remembers her as her true love. Her daughter Constance is older, more "responsible," there are two moms and things together. From Nina Boyfriend, he got involved in a job from a boyfriend and a job and is uncertain in his direction of life. <br /> <br /> First of all is good. Movie duration details are great. Dresses, hair, cars, home, etc. really keep you in another time and place. And the movie has played some acting too. Vanessa Redgrave is very good at portraying her character's last character and her frustrated mental condition. Claire Dannes is a beautiful and a great job as the main character when she was young (and she's a great singer). Hugh Dancy Lily's brother came to life with the life of Body. <br /> <br /> Now for the worse, which is unfortunately something else. The incident constantly disrupts the story as it is being expressed for us. Chemistry between young anan and body is great. They have fun and dance. Then ... you can believe that he really does not like him more than a friend and his pinning just bothers him. And I think the whole thing, "She could be gay" things were out of blue and serve a purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. Characters do the wood and awesome work. If this is another section, you know that Harris is available from serial killer. It seems an incredible stretch that all these girls love him (but they try to help other boys as a beautiful loin and represent them to help). <br /> <br /> And the biggest problem for everyone. Why not Ann and Harris together? They fall for each other. They have this great night of sex in their old messy mulberry shake, to know about Badi's tragic end and then ... Home <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After and after all get all the dirty eyes about each other and I can not help but wonder why. Why? The film does not let you know why they were compelled to marry other people and so there was sad time for them. <br /> <br /> The story of this story is quite boring. Clive is good girl and Clive bad girl. Although I definitely do not change in the movie, I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what convinces her to change her life. There is a "sensitive" scene where the girls follow the old anne dream and follow a butterfly. It's really long and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "There is no mistake", Ann advises us. The statement does not ring the truth with the story. After watching the film and it did not spoil the talent of a good performer.
