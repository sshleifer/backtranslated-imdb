Badly pointing to garbage. A middle nihilist sadistic gorefest ... if you like that kind of person ... look a shrinkage. Even if you are that person, it does not make a good film, acting is really poor, full story of plot hole, the director must leave and find out the real job because he has no such talent. I can see why people do not scoff. We recently got some of his movies and this is the best among them, which is really sad! Any kind of complete absence of humanity seems like some people, but it only consumes it here. Horror movies may be full of solitude, they can be the smallest work in the industry, without any other things, they just look good ... SEED is really poor.
