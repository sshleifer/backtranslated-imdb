I was given the book version of Kazam for my 8th birthday, and people always say that the book version is always better than the movie, but this time they were wrong. <br /> <br /> This act is terrible, which I expect from a picture with shock, which is an old veto blaster (which was probably a good reason he was trapped there). Max playing in the movie Baby Helo and the terrible actor. She bullied by the surrounding kids, I do not blame them because she has a small douche bag. <br /> <br /> The story is just simple foolhardy and extremely clich√©. A boy who always works about a father and often finds no new friends who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father. <br /> <br /> Even at the age of eight, I thought it was a stupid concept. It is not surprising that there was a career after the wards of those who worked in this film because it was an embarrassing reason and never should have been created. I could ramble even more about how this movie sucks, but you should already know by reading the plot.
