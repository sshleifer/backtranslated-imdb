Before watching "Dahmara", no movie could be worse than "I did not think Freddie Fingard". I was roasted. To add "Dahmara", it is a story about a gay serial killer that almost does not feature the murder and almost completely encounters before facing them with Dehmar's homosexuals. There is no plot available, and it has no purpose until we say something about "Dahmer". You will learn everything about Dahamah watching this movie that he likes to have sex with men. Dreadful acting, terrible instruction, horrible writing, horrible things ... If you like to see "Dahamara" and butterfly flip for three hours, then turn it back .... It will be less painful .....
