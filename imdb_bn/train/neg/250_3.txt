When I see the other three versions of the same film, I'm scared for me, it's the weakest, primarily of neutral and led performance instead of Scott. Throughout his life, his emotions are so colorful that it makes it hard to get busy with movies. Alistair Simem portrays the role in infinitely. When Scrooge was in the middle of it, you can not understand that Scott is talking to a lot of conversations and when he transforms, he is equally uncomfortable. I can not think of any of the actors in this movie who are aligned with the Alistair SIM version. Even the musical version (and apparently muppets) are executed to take this well. Very frustrating.
