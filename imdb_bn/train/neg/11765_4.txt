You know what you got when you purchased a hallmark card. A sappy, trite verse and that would be $ 3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a hallmark movie. Here we put out a ninety-year-old Arnie Burgenne to come out to retire so that we know that he is not really like death. Poor Arney, he is a poor soul who married Ethel Marman a few years ago, and the marriage lasted several weeks. In this flash, Arne jumps on the first leg and shows Grandpa with bonds of his long lost grandkids. We have seen it before. You can enjoy this movie but do not be careful that you do not say please.
