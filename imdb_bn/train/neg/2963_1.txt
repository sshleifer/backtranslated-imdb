As I started to visit this site and voted for the movie, I never could get a rating of 1 movie. Even boring "Dances! Barbie has got activities" There is a reason for this. <br /> <br> Any time I saw my own opinion that it is really bad movie, I ask myself to stop and ask yourself the following questions: "Is this movie really bad as the horror of self-sucking in Theodore Rex?" I have never been " Yes "was not able to answer. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, Kierd Had said, Hey! Harrison Ford's land blasted with 'Blade Runner'! And decided that it was actually a good idea to spend time and money committed in the film. Nevertheless, I would like to know what kind of market it was going to sell if it did not get straight into the video. This is the rare giant: a movie that is very violent for kids and extremely insane for adults. I used to ask, "What were they thinking?" But in this case, it could actually be ineffective. However, what you need to know is that if you are one of these five or six incognito fans, you should express yourself only in this privacy "Howard the Doc", or if you are the most vicious man of all time Interested in watching movies, or you want to punish yourself.
