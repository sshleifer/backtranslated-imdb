The film's form is a suspicious Shankar There are surprises, twists and turns, reverse and tension. Occasionally, it's really a "edge-off-seat" movie. But it is frustrating, and seriously disappointing. <br /> <br /> piece arch is not credible; Do not put his character together. I refuse to "loot" the film, but only to say that we can not see the character that we got in the beginning. <br /> <br /> The second big disappointment of the photo is - finally, it became a bloody slasher film that became more and more. This is one of the "Friday 13th" movies and there is little qualitative difference between them. Not every picture will always be tasty, but this movie works as a drop gore on the occasion. <br /> <br /> Although the film has shown the magnificent Shaun Connie, yet it does not measure up to its normal values ​​and it seems almost often walking through the passes.
