Okay then I just saw a shit-loaded movie - with all the different degrees of quality. I was not very sure about what I first wanted to review. Then it hit me like a holes-a-rat: Rodentz. People about Rodentz warned. This monstrosity is busy with someone big and grieved. And it killed the mutant rats. Yes ... real freaking 'original "God's Food," or "Willard" Anyone? Who was better than this, and which did not say much ... <br /> ** Possible spinner ** OK Story: Ana Laboratory scientist and his lucky assistant, mice and their laboratory are testing a painful surroundings and The moronic friends of the ugly building and lucky assistant show the drunk and everyone becomes food for crazed rats and just everyone dies and, oh, a giant rats that looks crappy, but It's dead, the end. There is a sentence at all! Spoiler, you say? Pffff !! I want to be different! Second, we all realize that there is a giant mouse, we all know it will die eventually !! ** Last spinner ** <br /> <br /> Break here: <br /> <br /> Well: <<br /> <br /> - Well, I saw it free, but everyone else ... Hmm, no There is nothing good here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Gore was good. - Very high cinematography. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> And among other shots, CG Chit was looking pathetically cheap. See, your film has low budget, probably you should not rely on CG. Take the heart of the lesson. <br /> <br /> - Very poor acting. <br /> <br /> - Characters are uncertain - Cliches have a mosquito net and none of them works well. . <br /> <br /> - <br /> - <br /> <br /> - Stupid stories, just fools. <br /> <br /> - The giant mouse looks like a thick man on a poorly dressed beer suit - it was fun - but not quite funny, this image is worth a price. <br /> <br /> - Reserved, unrealistic, and annoying dialogs. <br /> <br /> - All college students are drinking Tikilas from huge plastic milk jugs - and they still seem to be drunk more than a few seconds. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Just terrible. Can imagine worse than you. For example, it is "sunny" (2002) or "house of the dead". Now those movies are shit you can enjoy. Even if they fool you. <br /> <br /> Remembrance scene: <br /> <br /> - Link action-movie is complete, ruthless hero and full of blasts. Because this did not feel like the rest of the unrest - but still sucked. Acting: 2/10 Story: 1/10 atmosphere: 2/10 Cinematography: 4/10 Character development: 0/10 Special effects / make-up: 4/10 Nudity / Sexuality: 1/10 (I was occasionally going to my son during the film, so maybe I missed it, but was supposed to be) Violence / Gore: 4/10 Dialogues: 2/10 Music: 1/10 (Average for Time) Writing: 1/10 Direction: 2/10 <br /> <br /> Pinch: 7/10 Curement: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 1/10 <br /> <br /> If you are a rat Bong-based horror films like Fatal only to see it. Wait ... check that. Do not see it. It's crap. <br /> <br /> (www.ResidentHazard.com)
