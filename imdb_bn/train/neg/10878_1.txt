This image is much more than masterpieces' "night" tie-ups and it's the only thing that makes the movie worth watching. Actor is terrible, action scenes are fast, the script is almost painful and the budget does not exist. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is good but you have not seen a real horror movie, skip it and get a copy of the movies demons
