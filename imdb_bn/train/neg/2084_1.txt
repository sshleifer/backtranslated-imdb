If they give me negative numbers, I'll use it. This movie was really God-awful. I hoped to become horrific in the theater, and how it could overcome my expectations. <br /> <br /> The script was poor, the acting was painful. I wanted to go out but my friend was driving and I wanted to get his money, I think we both were frustrated. <br /> <br /> Growing breast of breast when the girls were super poor and hair color changes were just wrong. Eddie Ezard is just mistaken for Super Villene, he was curiously weak and stupid. Jenny Johnson (Uma Thurman) came as a psychologist and weird, like Matt's (Luke Wilson) friend Von (Rain Wilson).
