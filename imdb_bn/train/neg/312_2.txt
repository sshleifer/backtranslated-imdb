If you have never seen this movie, you know it! If you are not and want to see a classic BAD movie then I would suggest you to watch this movie because it is on the right side with the worst. So, if you're really bothered, rent it. If you want to know it, then this is my little summary: Adam Sandler is rented for working with some MS Universe models and a giant cruise ship with five other people. Adam does not like how a passenger got all the kids, and he tried to take an impressive curiosity. But wait! It just gets worse! It's really bad that you will have to hire yourself in the movie to watch.
