The gene-mark bar (light, large blue, doggie) indicates this strange movie and explains what is the second installment of a triangle. I can be wrong, but I do not think this movie is part of the Dogma '95 manifest, although it looks like it really. I'm not really sure about what I'm thinking about this image. All the actors are good They provide good performance, especially Rosanna Arquette and Gene-Mark Bar. The story is somehow interesting. But I do not know, there is something about a movie that I do not like. Sex scene is very long way I do not know exactly where it stands from a erotic piece to the art from an interesting job. Sure it is not a bad movie, but I will not suggest people to see it and I will not ask them to look them up. Just like you want. If you feel weird and you feel open, try it, you can choose it.
