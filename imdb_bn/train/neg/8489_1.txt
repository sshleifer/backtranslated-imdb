Yes, for 35 years I have finally seen a stinger that I have seen to cross all the other horrific movies. 'Good Will Hunting' Baise Moi 'and' Flirt 'for the horror. It blames the blame on the first order ... even the modest victory is not entertainment. Impact is cheap, and bad - dotless. <br /> <br /> The script is written by a first-year filmmaker, which does not get much, but the portent wants to be full! Acting is simply ineffective - Tilada Swinton caps a career filled with dry work in a career that continues nervously between comotose and ridiculous 'intensity'. Apparently, some fools have allowed this film director to do another ... be warned
