"What happens when you give homeless people for $ 100,000?" By asking such questions they are morally absolved of what is going to happen suddenly. The creators of "Fortune Reversal" are trying to make their antics impersonate any type of responsible social experiment. <br /> <br /> They bring homeless people to Tedek Passden and give him $ 100,000 to see if he would turn around his life. Then, with only the most straightforward guidelines and suggestions, they let him go on in his pleasant way. <br /> <br /> What do they mean? "Can not you make money to buy happiness?" "Homeless they deserve homework because they are homeless?" Or how about, "lift up a man - it's more fun to see him fall from a higher height." They took a man with nothing to lose, gave him something to lose, and then saw him drain all down the drain. Is that supposed to be entertained? They sow this seed with some toxic music and dramatic camera shots, but in the end it has all moral highlands of car crash video - this time they asked the car crash engineer, "What will be the sign when you stop?"
