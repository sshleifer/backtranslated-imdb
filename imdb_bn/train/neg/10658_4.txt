On the way back from IMC 6 (San Jose, California), our five (minds, you are our three Kamal devotees) have got our agreed verdict; VVi was a strong shit and we have a pretty screwed up to the on-going cinema thanks. Not to mention, we swore to stay in theaters next year. <br /> <br /> I will not blame Kamal because he gave a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan (Vijay TV). . He said something like, "Tamim cinema" photography, editing, N Munnerar's Madre screenplay, direction, acting innum namba munnera'la "(Tamil movie has increased in photography and editing, but we've rarely improved, when it Screenplay, direction, and acting) ". You are watching VV, those words are very true. <br /> <br /> Now, here are 10 reasons to hate this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Harris Joyce <br /> <br /> 2. Harris Jairaj <br /> <br 3. HARRIS GEARZ I am holding myself here using applescences, but really Hajj is like the background of it with the forgery of recent movies ('Ananya', 'Gazini') for him. Next time I have an airplane transplant, he is paying for it. <br /> <4/4 Songs do not help the plays move locally / temporarily in movie descriptions and they do not help you to sit and receive notice. The film seems to have been a few scenes with four songs like N. <br /> <br /> 5. A short has gone too far. The best VV is a short story, 2 hours plus "Thriller" is not appropriate. To use a clich√© here, Energizer like rabbit and goes on and on; Only in these cases do you want to do it. The next section of the movie looks like a big draw. <br /> <br /> 6. Two cans of Kamal-Jothika pair rubbed together can be produced more sparks than this lead pairing. There is no reason you would have to route them together. In fact, when they meet together in the second half of the movie, they are good at describing them. Hate to say this, but Kamalini Mukherjee's 10 minute romancing Kamal and Jothika do more than achieve 'Tanili' in this movie. <br /> <br /> 7. Kamal Hassan's pronounced Kamal says in this utter utterance that nobody speaks in India or America; And it's not new. He is doing this from Thungangde thumbi Thunganga. It only gets nerve. Imagine what it is to do when its mood fulfills the location shooting in the US to use this weird accent. He also does not give up on immigration, he must have consulted his staff (intelligent TN police with Kearner, Sathur and beyond) in clean congress ("Here we are going to be very bad police walk here"), obviously annoying effects. <br /> <br /> 8. There are a few directors of reasoning that you expect to stand up to a certain scale. Gautam fails us badly with some unclear performance in the General Knowledge section. In his own opinion, a DCP will fulfill his love interest on the road to discuss his own life and the issues of living! The scene inside the theater was so bad that towards Clifax; We could challenge the Hero IQ to hear the people behind us too. "Is he a fool, can not he use his siren or light?" (Kamal-d-Police-Police-Zip on a busy Madras road bikes ride like a common man!). "Is not he just able to use his gun?" ("Bicycle guy" starts at the feet and we have prepared Kamal for quite a lot of hot pursuit). I do not vote for later on, but I'm just trying to explain the mood. <br /> <br /> 9 If I see women raping women, they break their throats, more women are raped, and blurred genuine is truly thrown into the bush, I sit in the house and see "police report" or "kuttagram". The use of excessive violence will have to go on the way to expand the story, it can not be broken! Somewhere down the line, the Gautam extension (rape, murder) and the mainstay (story) seems confused about what! <br /> <br /> 10. Even a double shot could not get Espresso headache.
