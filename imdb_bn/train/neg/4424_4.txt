Oh oh! Another gay movie. This time it looks black side. Keep your last dollar It will be an unhappy ending! but why? Except for just half a dozen exceptions, the death of all gay films or an "Adio" final. It's like the release of all European films, Nir, in 40, 50s, 60s and 70s. Lead ... male or female must die or walk alone alone. Why should God's name, author, director, and producer certainly have felt the views of the theater theater felt? After all, it is supposed to be gay ... not glum. Perhaps the section should be changed to a 'glum' film. A big percentage of homosexual relationship ends and the couple travels together at sunset! Whatever is written or produced, he only looks down on homosexuality life and gives gay impression the wrong impression. This movie is just my point proof. If you hire a DVD, take an antidepressant, another 'gay' film comes here! It's wrong!
