Recently, I was so optimistic that I was able to panic about this movie. Well, today it's seen, 5.8 ratings are fully understood. I think that if you expect something that makes this a terrible need, it will not be worth it. <br /> <br /> Of course, there are two eyes on the mountain. This is a very cool and well-developed story that is closely related to the actual product, but the whole thing is so spontaneous that it has become so difficult to follow. And if it is not produced in the film Wes Craven, then it does not have anything to do with the original rebuilding. <br /> <br /> But the whole thing lets you go "Is this supposed to be horror or comedy?" Because many ridiculous, random hanging moments and stupid one liners (ie "sh ** er!" Have a hand or "you muffin ** er! I te ** t all!") And acting (remind me how bad God is) <br /> <br /> Styleline: (This part contains spoilers, be careful!) The movie starts with a woman giving birth to a mutant child (Oh la la!), And then the screen screen turns black and the movie title is black Then mango We will go to this office where there is a senior Manquine fighting randomly, we see that it is a scientist who is looking for a mutant man. The box has been left to track the audio feed, and everyone dies! After starting the tone setting, you can expect more <br /> <br /> Then, we will go to this team to train military recruitment in Baghdad, the captain called them "a good thing in stupidity" They did the last training in New Mexico, in the desert where the last THHE family used to be stuck. During training, things went wrong, people died, and ... What else would I have to say? Because now I have a time of goldfish attention, force myself to sit here and type it. <br /> <br /> The thing that is wrong with THHE2 is that it does not work. No flashback here, and the end is very safe ... but with a twist! A stupid one, that is. I am sure that Ultra Super Director will show a holographic cover with the cut and Heil's ticket all 3 options will end, but at the moment I'm not sure I care about it. <br /> <br /> In all the ways, if you loved THHE so much then it is almost no sin to watch, then watch it forever. But otherwise, then avoid all costs. It's for yourself <br /> <br /> 3/10
