I saw this obvious concert festival in a video store shelf. And before I get my first VCR, I will name it with this little gem and best of its best movie production! <br /> <br /> The dialog is weirdly ridiculous. And it also has a camio with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is unreasonable. And like in the next years like Christopher Walken, she'd be starring in every bad movie. This movie is m. Queen's Country Bears <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "<br /> <br /> The priceless return is:" Unfortunately it's sh_it, the tough rage sh_it! <br /> <br /> You will have a somersault across a billiard table as you will be awed by a battle scene! And when he comes to roll comes a beautiful Kung Fu! Chop socky action and T and a thrills !!! <br /> <br /> What schllock movie fan might ask more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and comes back to Boho like a ghost, he asks why he killed himself, then he had to deal with his weak illness? He says, "True men do not eat kochi." <br /> <br /> Oh, yes, yes. If Bo is a smart cookie then she will be called an exorcist right there and there!
