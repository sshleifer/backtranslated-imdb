A fun idea, but poor executioner. Except for fairly good makeup effects, it's not really so much. There are obvious problems; For example, after feeling like week and week to get normal size from the fat, the main character seems to be going from thin to thin leaf in the day to day ... and once it is thin to death, it is equally thin for execution. <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />, Robert John Bark is always trying to make some strange strife in the incarnation of Churchton Haston and it is really painful to see ... the only thing that is bad is both Lucyina Jenny and Curie Wuhera. <br /> <br /> <br /> The only reason I give this film high is that once the movie enters its last 1/3 or more time and Joe Montgén's character ends, the film is a fun, Campi feels 'cheesefish slaughterhouse', and Gangster's crazy plans are a bit of fun to torment the whole objectionable Gypsy. The end, if predicted, also has excellent meaning. If you are not a King-on-Fail or actually terrorizing the Gypsy camp, you will get the idea of ​​Fat Tony's voice from Simpsons.
