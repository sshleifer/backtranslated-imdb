An unmarried woman Stella (Bate Miller) is pregnant by a wealthy person (Stephen Collins). She offered to marry him from the feeling of responsibility, but she flattered him and decided to raise the child on himself. Jenny's baby (Trini Alvarado) is ok until she becomes a teenager and becomes slightly slowly (and predictable). <br /> <br /> I saw the silent version and the word version of "Stella Dallas". No one influenced me a lot (and I easily cry) but the date is made well if they are made well. Trying to reunite this in 1990 was just a stupid concept. I think there was enough power in the middle of the "deviation" after the impossible success. This (predictably) bomb attack. The story is ridiculous and date by today's standard. Middle and Alvarado also gave good performance, but the film really dragged and finally I became stupid. Stephen Collins and Marsh Mason (both good actors) do not help to support the role. Flimsy and dull. Really - Who would think this would work? See the 1937 Stanwick version instead. I give this 1.
