Massachi is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi (Barry Ground) and produced by the legendary Italian Awesome Director Lucio Flori. Now with this mixture of great talent you will think this movie has been a true gore festival. This can not be more than that. Being one of the most annoying slash films out of the Italian cinema, the genocide goes out of the mouth. I was actually struggling to stay awake during the movie and I had no problems with Italian horror films. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This scene is used in Fossil's Nightmare concert. This is not a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as a deaf deaf. Unfortuanitly, the next hour of the movie is so annoying. The film takes a set of horror movies and many characters have been developed during these scenes, but the characters of the film are so neutral and working badly that your interests start to leak. The last 30 minutes of the film is not so bad yet still very good. The film's gore was unfortunate and at the Nightmare concert, Floris mostly used the Gore scene, there was nothing new here. The end of the movie has left a nice wrap but it was still very inappropriate and consistently consisted of fruit. It was not a very good movie but for true Italian horror ruckus (like myself) it is very rare because this movie is a must. 4/10 stars
