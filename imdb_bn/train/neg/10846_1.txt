From Kaligula I did not say to stop filming in the middle ... But then, when I considered it was only 15 minutes. Unfortunately, I made all the way through it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> It's not that it's anything, yet it's so strictly all about them. Instead, it is boring, quarterly, general, predictable, and unexpectedly executed (in the video shot, high school special effects, even basic visual stories, the dialogue is not very audible ... it is not audible). <BR> <br /> This film proves that even plain-to-video distributors must draw a line of sand somewhere.
