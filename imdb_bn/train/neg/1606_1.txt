In this movie, Chavez supporters (Venezuelan and non-Venezuelan) just talk about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /> <br /> They did not say that because of Chavez's announcement, many PDVs were shot to death for political conflicts. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about 96 more TVs. Interruptions sent by Chavez in only 3 days in "Canadian National" (only a kind of personal TV signal fraud). With every 20 minute duration. <br /> <br /> They did not tell us anything about General Ann Jeff Lucas Rincon Romero, the inspector general of the army's army, quoted by Chavez's traditional supporter. . Even now, despite his announcement, he is Ministro D Internal Y Justicesia. After Chavez returned, he took charge of the Ministro del Defensor (equivalent to the United States Defense Secretary). <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Chavez's order against the density of the peace-loving people who demanded the election. <<br /> <br /> They did not say anything about the people of this density, who were killed by Chavez supporters (both civilians and military official forces). <br /> <br /> They present some false information, to lie. <br /> <br /> They did not say anything about Venezuelan civil society, which is now demanding elections for Chavez's actions to solve the crisis and avoid elections <br / > <br /> <br /> So I'm telling you ... this movie is just a lot of lies or falsehood.
