Tim Robbins and John Cusack are two actors, I applauded throughout their career, and the only reason for this movie to choose to watch. Well, I'm totally sorry about what I say! Many of these two great actors humiliate themselves by thinking that they are supposed to ridicule humans by using sketches, which are not irrelevant, unknown, and extreme (which is not bad on their own), but fail to do so. The only reason I can think that the director was his friend and he decided to support his film by acting - I can not think of anything else because the movie is so cheap! Thankfully Tim Robbins and John Cusack never disappointed me. I'll recommend you avoid this movie, unless you want your opinion about two actors spoiled.
