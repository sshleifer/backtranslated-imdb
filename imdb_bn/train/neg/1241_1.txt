The worst movie seen over the years! It starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. I'm going to happen in this movie, neither, nor, and bad acting. Finishing it lifts a bit and saves the movie from the total flop. A bad actor in Mark Wahlberg's bad movie. Sorry Tim Burton Batman was good but this one sucks.
