This picture is so incredibly bad that I almost feel sick about this. To this point, the other installment was at least a good thing about it. Part 1 was suspenseful and magnificent. Part 2 was off beat and entertaining. Part 3 was interesting with great effect. Part 4 was great music, good special effects, and a new entertainer Freddie Krueger. Part 5 is more annoying than anything I've ever seen before. Alice, a very nice blonde, part 4 back with her boyfriend Dan. In part, this supposed Elm street installment turns into a soap in a day. New characters seem to be rigid, even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder. Freddie seems completely out of this one. She looks tired, and does not seem as terrible. Its one liners seem to be out of place and different, where part 4 they can be quite funny. Leslie Bohem's story never falls on the ground and Stephen Hopkins's direction is so bad that it looks good to my grandmother! The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic. It's confusing and quite stupid. Avoid Part 5 at All Costs!
