It's amazing that this movie has become one of my hit lists. This is the number 1 worst movie ever seen. <br /> <br /> I have never been annoyed (fortunately not more than 155 hours), pre-adolescents have the humorous attempts that do not get even closer to it but one of my mouth tilted slightly in the corners. After the first very strange part, you expect that the other part will be at least slightly better. You're terrible, it just flies from there. <br /> <br /> This story is not worth mentioning and it repeats this story three times. Someone can expect that all the copies of this movie have been lost forever by this miracle and Trent Harris never kept his hand in the camera ...
