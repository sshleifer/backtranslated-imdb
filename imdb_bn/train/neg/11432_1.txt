I saw this movie yesterday and was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham and Tom Kaavanagh were originally supposed to carry this weird incredible script for five hours (or it was actually long). From the beginning, every element of this movie is incredible. This movie made me chocolate several times, but they are mainly under threat that the director / writer really wanted to believe in many dirty detachment elements to try to break our movie. <br /> <br /> The focus of the film is its subject with Gray (Graham) and Closeness. When he realizes that he and his brother are unexpectedly overwhelmed, they seem to be attractive. <br /> <br /> Interesting, engaging. However, instead of revealing this story as being credible and flexible, the director accepted Gray in the smoker twists that do not really understand in any sense. As an LGBT person, all the hexoxiasas believe that this film is going through an upcoming process. (If the writer's queer I would have been humiliated.) It was not for knowing chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham (which, by the way, was compulsory to understand), I would give it a negative 3 stars.
