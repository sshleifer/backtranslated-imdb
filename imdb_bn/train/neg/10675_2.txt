When you want to list the name of the star in the early credits incorrectly, you can not fix that you can read for a good time (the credit can read "Cuba Gooding, JR"). Some nice car chase, shoot 'em up, if you want all the actions, if the action hits up, because the plot exists, the relation is neutral, and completely incredible. The motivation of the characters, especially at the end of Gooding, is incredible, when they are not frustrated when they are illusory. I can remember that Andy Cheng must definitely get a lot of good actors in this great film of this great actor (he can not do anything about them all?).
