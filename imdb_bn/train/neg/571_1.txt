I only rent this because I liked the first movie. However, it is calling the John Vampires: Los Muertos is just a playful strategy to rent it. He is actually the executive producer and obviously there is nothing to do with the creation of this movie (Zipper's Crypers Someone?). <br /> <br /> A tragic story, terrible special effects and John Vanity is at all times as the Believer Vampire Hunter. This is not even curiously intriguing. <br /> <br /> What we have ended is a terrible, uninterrupted movie that is a terrible script and uncertainly bad and clean acting. It's just looking forward to less budget. <br /> <br /> Avoid like a bobonic plague.
