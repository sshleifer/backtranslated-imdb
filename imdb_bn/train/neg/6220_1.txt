This movie was a real disappointment for me. I have been a fan of Grameen Persons for a long time, and when I came to know that I was making a movie about him, I was very excited when I got out, I got the movie in VVS, and I got sick of what I saw, Life was not about, it was after his death. I thought it would be a descendant film about Village Life and Music, but there was a film about their death. I was tired of hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not his infamous death. I was very frustrated. I want people to see more of his life, more of his death. The best thing about this picture was its soundtrack. This picture is frustrating for a Gram Person fan.
