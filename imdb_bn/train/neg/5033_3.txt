A Texas desert city is organized. Who is responsible? Little novels of the mystery and racial tensions (the next is not really fitting), but otherwise, for strictly slash fans, who will appreciate the nurturing of the womb and nudity, which are two common elements for these movies <br /> <br /> Dan Kimmell (Friday 13th part 3 infamy) bratty quasi- stars as detective teenager. <br /> <br /> * **** <br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> MPAA: Rated R for violence and rust, nudity, and some languages.
