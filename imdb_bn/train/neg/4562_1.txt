I did not feel like I was raped like an anointed Christian, so I was raped, but Bellele's Magazine World is still beauty and best competition. Like Christmas, BMW hates its viewers, although not so extreme degrees. It's ugly, blurry, stupid, and terrible bad writing. None of the stories work. These are not the characters we like from the book, but they are a bunch of pod people. I wanted to disassemble it, but after a few minutes, I gave up, because someone on their right would not take this clapper seriously. There are three stories we have here. "The Perfect Ward" is a forgiving, very forgiving study. "Fifi Folie" works only if you can admit that Bobet's name is actually Fifi and he is a closet for James Bond Vilnese and a fool for Lumiar's women. "Broken Wing" (or "broken air" I like to call it) is probably the most serious of the bunch. Hate the animal bird? When? Do not see this shit - the transcript of this video is apt to be sympathetic. BEUTY AND BEAST is still an extraordinary celebration of a cinematic classic, love, art, intelligence and human spirit.
