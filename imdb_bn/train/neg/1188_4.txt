Kurosawa really blew it on this one. A failure of every genius is allowed. The idea is fine but execution has been executed. <br /> <br /> This movie is fantastic about an air it is some of the art industry. To get poorer of Tokyo, deserve more realistic and more realistic scriptures. Many of them have fun stories. A very frustrating film.
