Although not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised to see his name on credit when opening 'Joshua'. Hack, I was not even aware of 'Joshua' even until the movie began. So it is not saying, I was watching movies on film or not, Lead. Bill of 'Rosemary's Baby', 'The Omen' or another giant girl's movie 'Joshua's Bill' was paid. Unfortunately, it falls flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Nevertheless, I see how all these solutions will be resolved without expectation, the last episode will focus on the subject. Okay, I've admit, it's (a whistle bit) but what's a stale off. And a low-budget movie, or at least how they are designed. A man fall ?? If you do not see the drop, you see someone lying down what lies in the blood. A man gets hurt by a cab ?? If you do not see it, you keep up a bike, to see someone complain. I'm not sure whether this "style" or lack of laziness or simply, lack of funding for special effects. We have a "rich" family with a crazy mom, a workaholic parents are trying to adjust everything, a baby ?? Joshua, who may be the antichrist and the daughter of a new born child, who can cry a lot. As long as he is alive, he is crying ?? And what was that about? Is there a rat above or is it Joshua? His mother nuts? Joshua is crazy? Is he just jealous for the newborn's family? Is she going to be bigger than Michael Mayer? Or he takes his family to the dam? I do not think so. They had nuts before, and no "so-called" acting might have me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, only a question was answered, just open the door open. I'm sure the idea might be, but let me give something for Pitt's request. Something There are many good kid-wild wild movies to explore. Joshua is more like the Antichrist Mini-M
