The first few backgrounds; I lived in English and my whole life in London. I have had many games in 'The' and many other London club grounds. I know the kind of person who gets hooliganism and I know how they work and how they talk. This has to say in a bad, bad movie. I can tell you that Green Street is one of the most unreal movies I've ever seen. I mostly spend cringing with movies embarrassing. I think I would write a mini review because I felt that I had to point out some things. <br /> <br /> In real life, people do not speak in London; The filmmakers took away the completely unclear thing and made it fools. Unfortunately the boxer kind of exists, but more like parody who you see on the green street. B) Acting as Pete Denham (Charlie Hunnam), the actor unfortunately played 'English' or 'cocoon' like Osama bin Laden. He came from Newcastle North and I am surprised that another actor can act directly on his side - how we can take him seriously. Why do not they just play it from East London, so that's out of me. I could myself 'work up a bank', hehe. C) Mr. Fredo. I mean that Elijah Wood can be taken seriously, kicked the man twice the size of the human being, and actually the nasty people who He'll die. That's as simple as that Sincerely (as a Brit) this picture was difficult to see. I'm sure this image will bombs in the United Kingdom. It can do a little better in the United States because America simply does not know (or cares) how bad it is. <br /> <br /> Please do not believe this dirty word of my American and foreign friends. Yes these companies exist but it is all very underground and hash, and a tiny scale. The film only gets 2 from me because they have actually portrayed some of it in London. Usually, they try to try these movies in Cardiff (Wales) or anything else and hope to notify us all.
