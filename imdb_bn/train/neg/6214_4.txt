What?! ?? Why is people saying "mind blowing?" Cinematography is the worst end of history! 4 left and the whole world is over! Not to mention the character 9 A fool was killed by all of them. 1 was perfect for the whole time, if he sacrificed nine, none of this happened. Is it for man to spend life for fools ...? I accepted the film as part, and the whole idea was interesting. But it was a lot after another one clich√©s. And someone else got this feeling that this "Lord of the Rings?" Characters have died due to stupid, almost no character has evolved, and honestly ask yourself that only four are left in the world; Her stupid and stupid It's one of the shortest movies I've ever seen, and thank God! How to turn the robots in any way against the creators of the human! It's been done a hundred times! Watch this movie a movie that is really stupid, star trek, hangover, or English busters, they are good movies!
