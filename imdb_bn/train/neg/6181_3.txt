If you are a fan of Science Theater 3K, Giant Leach's Attack, or Pinta Survival Island, this movie might be for you. <br /> <br /> I live in Nashville and I do not even know this film until the day of its release, when the advertising company confuses and cries with dozens of flyers and billboards. It lasted for two weeks in a theater in some way. <br /> <br /> Bad acting, bad writing, and poor production simply started to describe this embarrassment to a movie. At the beginning, the names are a little more: bom price, angel, and dixie? Ish <br /> <br /> It was also helpful to keep the camera locked off couches due to the strange delivery of Tobi's curve. Angel's character moved quickly from a pregnancy route, moving away from her city, after two days on the bird the south was destroyed. Her dress goes from a toe to a female version - in fact, in the final scene, their teams are similar, creating a surprise if the garment assistant is ill. The audio is inconvenient - perhaps the most notable example is when Toby decides to swim and his voice suddenly sounds out loud in a gymnasium. <br /> <br /> There is not enough enough explanation or character development that will happen on the screen. Overwhelming, frustration, and mood explaining the best actors and the direction of terrible scripts. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This alcoholic beverage is the best choice to enjoy this movie after eating some alcoholic beverages and eating it with your intelligent friends. But that's not saying much.
