If I can not read Pat Barcar's 'Union Street' to see this picture, I would have liked it. Unfortunately this is not the case. It's actually my kind of movie, it's well-made, and in other ways I do not want to say, but as an adaptation, it fails from every angle. The frustrated novel about the reality of <br /> <br /> retained my heartbeat in North-West part of the working class in North England and refused to go after a few weeks after the end. When I read women from Union Street, I threw tears, vengeance, mourning, anger, sympathy and sadness. Nice A novel that I occasionally felt that I could not read, but I could not throw the novel easily. Yes disappointed, but completely gripping <br /> <br /> film. Oh dear Hollywood took the truth and reality of Barker, and on top of it the sweet ice layer of sweet ice rained. A beautiful movie, an inspirational soundtrack, great performance, hope stories and romance ... yes. An orientation of 'Union Street' ... is not <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Many of them are canceled. I acknowledge that Barker's stories are very sensitive to the subject and the public, and a movie with about 7 leading characters is not real, but the content is not my main problem. The original and true heart of the novel is lost - the broken windows covered with darkness and rain, the cardboard, and graphical graphic stenchs are replaced with sunshine, beautiful houses and a wonderful William's score. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the movie to face the reality and hope that 'reality' is facing, I advise you to do something more like 'Scandlers list' without preparing yourself. Do not hesitate to read the book ... but without a happy ending.
