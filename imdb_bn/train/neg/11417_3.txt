The youth group of "St. Elmo Fire" has graduated from the college, which can create it with high schools for at least four years in any distinguished university. In most cases, these children seem to be unlawful, selfish, greedy and foolish, yet co-author and director Joel Shumacher holds the touchstone for their generation. With an old cast of "up and commerce", a background score very similar to "background conditions" and gets ridiculous writing of this circle on us, "fire" is a harmful fire, as one that passes years also gets even more embarrassing. * **** to 1/2
