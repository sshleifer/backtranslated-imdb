This movie stinks. I do not think I've ever seen a movie that is shaky on the shock quality. The plot was relatively interesting, but the dialogue was flat and the role was very strong. This could be a good movie. I think it's just depends on its wonderful visual. I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos, but it's like shooting for Mike felt it's like shots. Just a badly executed film. Watching this movie will not be entertained only, unless you are tired of being tired of the obvious view of anxiety, pedophilia, nicrophilia, rape, self-milk, parental and siblings abuse and lung abuse. I think I've just sold this movie to you, but I wanted to mean when I drowned it. He has succeeded in other movies, but I think you are not watching anyone beat.
