... but if we were in the first place then it would surprise you! This movie is just as bad as today's terrible horror. A man goes around looking for semi-clad women, trying to determine which one can kill, so that he can give his girlfriend a new body. In one scene, the whole set is sparting around a person and for a full three minutes, which must cover everything that is good on "Ten gallons of blood". The film tries to create an idea that what people are doing to their girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but it is impossible to reduce the feeling of shock or disrespect to the audience so poorly done. Undoubtedly dark and irrationally sinful, this movie can not directly get its title - credits at the beginning are "the brain that will not die", but the last credit list is "title that does not die."
