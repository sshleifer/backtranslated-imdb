Famous painter Freddie Francis (Gary, the Elephant Man) manages this beautiful bad horror / drama film. There is a different view of how the practice of medicine should be handled more closely than Dr. Thomas Rock of the 19th Century England, this law states that only the bodies of harmful criminals can be read and examined. But the stockpiles of these bodies are small, and Rock needs more - and they like to have them renewed. One of his circles is being fooled, he started to find out the body to study and test for the people. The helpless sleazebags Robert Fallon and Timothy Brood get this work opportunity to get wind and start killing people and selling this agency for rock. Naturally, in such activities, criminals have worse consequences than the practice of corpses and cause problems for everyone. Although the overall story is disguised on paper, almost everything about doctors and the Devils is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> After the first fifteen minutes of the film you decided to watch the watch. The whole look of the photo is ugly. Seeing how filmmakers played in England's slums in the 19th century, perhaps the filmmakers were taking a "ugly" appearance, but they are not a clever way. Cinematography from the set is all cheap, weak, and abominable. Also, everything in the scene is filled with something that you can not take seriously with, and most of the time, it does something with small and big roles that seems completely ridiculous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> " The nature of their character is by crazy, but over and overact of parts of the price and rays die. The problem is that they have the same access to the shot from the shot, especially - especially the primes, especially from coconuts to iris long to long silver animals and thus, and so on. Seeing Twiggy in this movie, it is a comedic riot which lets the street prostitute play the only claim because she can not work to save her life (though her song is not so funny during the final feat). The boy definitely has a long way: "From the strength of the flower" "I'll loose my clothes for a shillin"! As these three actors are bad in this movie, Julian Sands receives the award for the film's worst performance. As soon as he is getting ashamed, anger, love, happiness, anxiety after another, one after another is a cheerful endeavor - a passion, choosing a passion! <br /> <br /> There is only one thing about Doctor and the Devils: The role of Timothy Dalton. Rock Although surrounded by cinematic shawl, Dolton is quite nice; An overly powered but well-rendered people provide an electrical screenplay. The film is very bad that Mr. Dalton was not as good!
