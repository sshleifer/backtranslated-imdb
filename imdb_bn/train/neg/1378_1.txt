This is a bad 80 TV show that has been loose and has tried to be a soft-core porn movie. Oh my God it was bad. Each character plot had little relevance. There was nothing to talk about the plot itself. Something about a stalker, I guess. Finally he shot himself? It's not really clear, but like how a volleyball game is involved. And the main character (Randy) sleeps around a lot. My friends were the only reason to rent this movie because it was the Caspar Van Deeveni and they wanted to go ahead with the scenes with them, which were only visible to them. Thank God, I did not spend any money on him, but I want that moment of my life.
