This is really a mad little film. Certainly the third (third) of the Holy Trinity was directed by the decrease of the sentence, almost half of the way through the movie "The Final Conflict" was frustrated by the ridicule, for the apparently deceitful death, now the whole raison d'etre for the series "Omen" But to counter this zoom up-up TV movie (beware buyers of Oman box sets in DVDs - do not be fooled by the widescreen setting of the transfer, it was behind a series and it was strictly small-screen stuff) Generally fine giant squirrels were powerless, in particular, Supported by it, by producer Mes Nufeld and Harvey Bernard's producer and producer. In addition to normal death scenes (I was depressed for TV sensitivity) and I saw that there was nothing except mostly bad acting. Food suppliers should be ashamed of all those involved with this project, so that they become screened, only by the name of Oman. If a person is convinced by my review to avoid this mess, I will feel better about him.
