This sleek, sexy movie would certainly see. Only on the philosophy of the film can understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no issues are stagnant, the type of description. The role keeps you immediately and keeps you close to the edge of the film. He provided wonderful insight into the world of trains and allowed the listeners to 'connect' with the internal horror of the film. The script itself surprisingly holds the movie together. Not just for kids, but adults will also get higher understanding of trains and modern perceptions on sexual experience. Before the time of cinematography and the ground breaking, it definitely defines the word 'masterpiece'.
