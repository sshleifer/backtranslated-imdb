I can not believe that anyone can create a comedy about a problem like homelessness. Of course, Brooks _real_ has not created a comedy about homeless people. There is no mention of drug, prostitution or violence on this street. The people we meet in this film are homeless in fantasy land, so the only difference between them and us that they often do not eat often. Brooks Cinema has been bad and bad over the years. Just another nail in this coffin.
