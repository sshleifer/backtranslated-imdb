Scorsese's worst one. An average thriller; The only thing to recommend it is playing De Niro Psycho. The phenyl is usually like this style, as is the most illogical, immune-pain pain medication. I did not like the original 60, and this version did not have any progress in this. I have no idea why Scorsese is wasting his time in a remake. Then again, considering how bad his recent films have been (I am mentioning everyone with his stupid Buddhist film and his new favorite actress, blonde girl de Caprio), it is not a bad one. And Spielberg wanted to remake ... could be worse to consider.
