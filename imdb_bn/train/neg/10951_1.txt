These statues were not given to Pam d'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was violent! I really saw the whole thing because I could not believe anyone would make such a rude film. There is nothing interesting about the plot, the characters are not in depth, and there is no effort to give any kind of culture with music or sound effects. Also, if you see this movie, you are planning to spend 2 hours of your life, but do not forget to bring it a bit, because the cinematography is only running with handheld camcorders and half the time you see even the main topic. This style has been used more successfully in the film as "Blair Witch" because it creates the mystery. In Rosetta, there is no plot and no mystery which will lend something to that style. I was supposed to be in the morning when it was getting worse.
