.... because if I had been, then I wish I was crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this film - and I'm "generous" that even there was a plot to start. As mentioned earlier, this is a misconception of the DVD cover that Richard Dreyfas is actually the star. He was just a movie. And if he was indeed "frustrated" because the back cover indicates that he was, perhaps because he probably was frustrated by the disaster in a movie and could not get out of it! The film actually began to draw attention to Gerard Martin, and his role in the film was no other than extreme mortgages, which really did not have the role of Gene Barry - was it really mysterious? And "big" ... whose hymn was a brilliant idea of ​​filling Gene Barry in the dummy dress, which pulled her pajamas literally to her chin, she should work hard to throw stones in this film. How horrible I was this film, from the conversation, with the appearance of "actor" faces (Clutch Cargo mind), from the visual scene, to the uninjured jumping (again, to be liberal for corrupting the photo frames) ", for the lack of a plot .... , If you get upset in the early 70's and if you're hiding in Michigan, then this movie is just a picture of a child and a cat She's gone. You can film a good bottle of wine before the start of this strange journey recommended to drink, because you'll be grateful that you did not remember the next day!
