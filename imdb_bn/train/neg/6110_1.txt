Bow was Jean Parker, whose father, long lost anthropologist (Richard Harris, the worst part of the very incompatible career) read some or other in Africa. He followed him (how?) And he told him the story of a giant monster's natives who were heard all night throughout the night. Apes Man Man (Miles O'Keefe, who has made the best conversation in the film), who saved him from the bad boys and fell in love with him, took enough time to roam naked for two hours at this sad time. Looks horny monkeys and cheers. Generally I'm very open about the opinions of a movie, but this is the only exception. This is the worst film ever made. If you do not agree, you have not seen it. (Note: Newsday has called it "inappropriate", the best one-word summary I can think of. The Multin movie guide comments that they had to think about rating less than BOMB.)
