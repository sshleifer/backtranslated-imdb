I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival. It was a strange thing! Every clean, violent, rich son was in fantasy displays, you just knew how it would end, especially with Chef's wife and her first daughter rape. <br /> <br /> The worst part was the question-answer session with director / writer and writer / producer, they tried to fill them as intellectuals, but you can say that they attack violence. I often wager for prostitution and medicine. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time. I was keeping my boyfriend from walking on it.
