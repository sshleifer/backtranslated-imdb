I think Elizabeth Rohm, although she can try hard, is not very good. I think it was due to the budget that it could only get it for that price. I have seen this mainly for the performance of Mayan Nautique, whose work I know very well. <br /> <br /> He is most credible and most obliged to see without any doubt. When he was not on the screen, the matter died. This was pictured in Vancouver. He gave me the cripps, but would be assured that in real life he is a kind, funny compassionate man. He said that this role gave him the cripps. <br /> <br /> I'll look at something with her, but Elisabeth Rohham - never. He was as exciting as the Lincoln on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.
