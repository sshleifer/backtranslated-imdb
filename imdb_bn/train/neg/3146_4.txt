The author of the book, by the same title, should not have used his name for this movie. If you have read this book, this film accepts the original fact of the book and the liberal interpretation of his soul that without the title and some patronization, the film and book seem to be less common. The film adds nothing to the artistic merit of achieving its own literary art. <br /> <br /> You will also be disappointed for those who did not read the book. Plot can not move incredibly slowly, it does not offer any further speeds while running slowly (like the development of the character). After some observers, the graphic gay love scene can be entertained in movies, but you can see specially shottime specials for the stuff displayed in Threse and IEBle - it's fairly perfect and not fantastic.
