Keeping myself as a film maker, and a bit dark and humorous, I thought when I was "my mistakes ..." (I did not give any DVD cover a bit, rather than just touching it, I was in no mood), controversial director Chris Morris , Quotes from "A Short Film With Scenery"). I really would have been well-known, and Twiddle avoided these insipid (and often offensive) pieces. <br /> <br /> The view of the church is despicable (especially because we are very familiar with Morris's warped attitude on all sides, since Padmophilia is her infamous TV series, Bras I) and has no other purpose than Shock. I will never understand how this image is labeled a comedy. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> But this is not sadly the case here. Rather, we consider some dogs angry about dogs in school, but before the end of the dog, there is no great movie to perform. All of these are very interesting, but celluloid is not a single frame value. <br /> <br /> Tell that this film goes somewhere will be an understatement. It carries the cost of plot, character and dialogue, relies heavily on its high quality, makes the viewer curious and incomplete. His most simplified message - the person who takes charge of his actions - both brilliantly and clearly portrayed. <br /> <br /> There are moments of pseudo-Kafsakek's immortality in this movie, but ultimately, it fails to satisfy, entertain, enlighten, and end up boring. If you really want to see a really great part of making small films, I strongly recommend "It's a wonderful life of Franz Kafka", by Peter Caplady.
