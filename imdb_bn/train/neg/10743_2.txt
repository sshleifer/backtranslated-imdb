This picture is really bad with a 'memorable' line and a script full of incredibly bad performance. Special effects are bad (the worst I've seen is not the worst) and the music is so bad that you have to believe it. Only two short themes (30 seconds long or so) are repeated throughout the whole film. <br /> <br /> Finally, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
