It was terrible. Andy McDowell is a terrible actress. So wood makes a rocking horse look like he could do a better job. But then think that turn into four weddings, equally critical as it is. Another picture that filled England's chocolate box and green leafy vegetables in the village. I mean, how many schools in the school might be different from Hogwarts? The TV police station looked like a set of heartbeats (a boring British series set in 60 seconds). This picture simply did not seem to mind the mind - a comedy or female friendly friendship undergraduate serious test. If it is stuck in the east, the sex scene in the graveyard and the extremely stupid storm of marriage can only work (I just say). But those scenes did not work with the tragedy in the second half. I think it is impossible that Kate will talk Molly again after her terrible behavior. A final note- What is a modest actress like Stuunton doing in this Paul? There is no mention of Anna Chancellor. Macdowell ads should be rooted in the roots cream.
