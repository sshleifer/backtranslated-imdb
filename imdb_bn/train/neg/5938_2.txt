If you're not in the 90's or never listen to rapper !! This movie may be right for you, but any fan or any single person who heard this movie was boring and there was no point in film where I said it interesting or I do not know. Another thing that fights me was that he saw anything in his life, which he saw very easily. He had no struggle to sell jail, easy to sell, and even wrapping it. I think the movie was released almost 15 years ago, probably its impact could be more !!! Do not try to rop capsize in the hood and flows of the movie, do not get rich
