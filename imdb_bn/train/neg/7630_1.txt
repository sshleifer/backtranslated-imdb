An annoying movie in a boring movie 50. How can anyone think of this as a classic? The producer most of his girlfriend, Cybele Shepard, ended his career by pushing many actors into more movies than acting. I think this film gives insight into how bad Peter Fogleigne's future films are going to get worse. Cyber-Shepherd's career took a dive after being in several films produced by Peter Bogodoniich. His career began to come back, until then, not until "the light of the moon". I was acting in "Graduate", poor imitation. I noticed that this movie was not shown in the United States. The only place I saw was that it was late at night in Europe.
