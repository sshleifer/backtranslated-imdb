What was the deal with clothes? They arranged something in the late 70's in the late 70's. The cars were even old. The school was old. The nun's dress was old, and the hospital saw its ward and wood stairs and things like 40 with things. Nothing happened in the whole movie in 1991. My mother smiled and said, "Gai-odd! When was this movie made?" When we put the "info button" on our remote, we were sure that the 1991 will be typo! Anyone else notice this? My favorite part, though, is when the woman said about her objectionable muck husband on telephone, flip cross in the mirror, and he just said, "Look, I got a Congress meeting. I will talk about it after you." That line was just classic . Just like a man! My mother's favorite part was when she gave her "The Devil Child of Spaw" to her very own Rootweller. My mother said, "What does the devil's bird need ... a rutillier?" He also enjoyed the collapse of all the church people, throwing them on their chest. His other favorite part was the school parking lot, 5 miles per drive driving, Garbage truck / dump truck / Front and loader thing. It took about 20 seconds to stop the car ... but he kept open, a vague look on his face. I mean, how fast can you go to a school parking lot?!? Anyway!
