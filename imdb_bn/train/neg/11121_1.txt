I do not really understand that anyone can give this horrible movie to more than 1 star ... how can you like an annoying movie where all animal torture scenes are real? I do not want to imagine such a terrible pain that those awful moments of innocent and insecure living were realized ... Jesus ... what kind of "human" would they torture them for any reason, or just money? I'm telling you that the director has become mentally disappointed, or he's just a giant with the 'heart' of the stone. Or both. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> and throwing water back, a dog is beaten, the birds are thrown into the water ... <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is terrible ones; This is sometimes the worst and worst film ever made, the other one, which has been called "Canibil Holocaust" or something like that. I would not see or buy any film directed by this hearty giant. No one will waste their time watching, especially when there are many big movies, where all animal torture scenes are conducted. Fortunately, only a few have liked it - which is natural, because it's the worst movie - so it was not successful. I am hopeful the director of this obstacle should understand that this unreasonable barbaric act of violence of extreme cruelty and insatiable animals will never be appreciated and that he will keep all animal torture scenes in his next film. I really believe everyone is satisfied but what they give! There will be a day when all the disabled and cruel 'people' will feel the same pain, which they once presented to others. <br /> <br /> This is probably my only "negative" review. I do not comment on the film when I dislike it, but at the moment I just could not stop it. I had to speak the truth, because animal torture must stop!
