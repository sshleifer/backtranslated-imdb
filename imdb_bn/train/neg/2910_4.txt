Tom Hans, the highlight of this movie for me was without doubt. As Mike Sullivan, he definitely threw against the type and showed that he could manage an irrelevant (for him) role. Hendes is usually a good guy in a movie - your choice, praise and route. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It is true that in the context of this movie, he came in some noble ways - his intention is to take revenge on the murder of his wife and younger boy. Yet, he was a gangster and a murderer before the assassination. So Hongs took a role that I could not expect him, and he pulled it well. <br /> <br /> Good performance of Hanks, though, I certainly could not say it was an enjoyable movie. After an opening ceremony, I would describe the most beautifully (it was not entirely clear to me where it was going), it became a very complex film, Sullivan was formed as a gangster in a complex relationship - primarily Rooney (Paul Newman), who is in a kind of congregation The resident and trying to raise his two sons and talk about them as "clean"; Isolated from his business. After witnessing the murder of the eldest son, the gang tried to kill him to keep him quiet, the wrong boy (and mother) got him and run Sullivan and his eldest son (Mike, Junior). This is a curious father / son bracket film. <br /> <br /> Although it ends in a little optimistic note (at least in the entire context of the story), it is really dark, the mood is being strengthened, most of the scenes are being shot in the dark and snowy rains. I have to admit that I praised the performance of Hongs, the film did not drag me completely. 4/10
