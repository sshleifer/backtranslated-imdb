I just saw the movie in the theater. There are very few good points to talk about movies. Can be the beauty of Kareena and some songs. That's it. A complete frustration in all areas of the movie. Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even the Mumbai Indians (now Chennai have been in the semi-finals). <br /> <br /> But what I think is bad about the movie is the action scene. Now Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they have forgotten that Hollywood directors have many implications for making it a reality. But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have much time. They spend time on song time and during the campaign. Now the audience can work on this stupid action scene to pay attention to seeing just watching their favorite actor killings bunch. But it's certainly not going to work in Bollywood. All the action scenes I wish I could go forward. Finally, some Chinese people did not come from anywhere to defeat Akshay Kumar. The height of this stupidity. The audience is not paid to look like stupid. Bollywood should now forget about action movies. They can not do it. The last good thing I saw was the "Ghatak" and "Khiladi kan Khiladi". The current Bollywood scene is really sad for action movie fans like me. Do these people see movies after their finishing? Do not they think that slow action (which is used in the ropes) is very unreal and child? If you do not have to handle it then the action scene is good. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era, where Zanjeer and Diyar were the thrillers of the thriller act. Sound effects were not very effective in those days, but apparently it is much better than current-era scenarios. <br /> <br /> This movie will now open the eyes of Bollywood film directors. Please do not have any more action movies, until you achieve the art of making it realistic.
