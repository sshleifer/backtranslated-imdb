This "movie" works so bad! Nothing seems to be even trying and realistic. Plot is weak, acting - sad, the actor is thinking of producing the first year, trying very hard to start without any chance from the start. What a flop! What is a waste of all related time, money and effort including the audience? Well, like any thriller, murders, dead bodies and blood here too. Imagine that anyone who killed a knife 5 minutes ago and be calm and laugh as a laugh, as if the neck slash is done by a virtual agent. Also, this assassination should have been done by a small woman on a high stiff man, and he threw his throat !!! Did he ask him, humbly, to bind him? The same kind of stupidity is going on, and the audience is surprised if it becomes a joke which just becomes a bad one. Continuing another major problem is: The unstable-hungry groom is lying on the bed, his virgin daughter is waiting to come out of the bathroom and after a long time she is asleep (!!!). The next scene opens with young couples entering the reception area, to find directions in the visible places! Not a word about the last night ??? This kind of waste even tried and write about this low-end supposed "movie".
