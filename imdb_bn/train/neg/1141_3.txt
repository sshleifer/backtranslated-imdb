Less prospect is going on, new footage opening for 'spouses' (for more than five minutes) came as a surprise surprise. I did not say there was material in the new footage grade, but it provided a very solid foundation for what would be a good "all what" the original picture. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was put together in 1955, during one day shooting timeframe. After the new footage, Jules White has decided to stop the stock footage from this little 'Bride's Groom', so that an extraordinary story can not be made for transformation, which tries to remedy new footage with a small view of Jules and Felix Adler. In the end, the old, hard work of our boys (in this case bees and Larry) got shot on the butt. <br /> <br /> 3/10
