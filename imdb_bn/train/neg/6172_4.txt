I get the movie in one minute. First, someone wanted "proof" about Clinton's comment in Georgetown, where he claimed that the United States "deserved" 9/11 attacks Well, what Clinton said here: <br /> <br /> "At the first Crusade, when Christian soldiers took Jerusalem, they first burnt a synagogue with 300 Jews and killed every woman and children, who were Muslims at Temple Mount I can tell you today's story is still being spoken in the Middle East and we are still paying for it. <br /> <br /> Are we still paying for it? The meaning of "we", the "grave", did not sweep the temple. <br /> <br /> However, Clinton never came out and clearly said that we are 9-11 "worthy." That we are 9-11. Just point to "true" A, B, C, and maybe DT, and the audience must decide that they must be added to the conclusion. In fact, most of Clinton's " <br /> <br /> We talk about movies, not politics, unfortunately, when Oliver "Captain Conspiracy" Stone makes a movie, you can run away from his warped politics. No It was only a matter of time before Reagan almost bought the farm, before focusing on his pano and bitterness on the Reagan era, and how good it was to have Stone's dream almost exhausted. No dirty plots or schemes were found in the attempt of the assassination of Henkley, he discovered one with Al Haig. From a simple misunderstanding of the spirit of constitutional authority, Hugh transformed from a government job, who actually turned his remedial civics into a rising megalomaniacs. You almost hope to knock Hogg together like Montgomery Barnes and talk about Cap Weinberger "releasing the hounds". Stone even recruits Hollywood memorabilia to play our former Secretary of State Richard Dreyfas. A guy loves to hate you. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is okay. Holding down on average, average. Do not rent or buy. Try to catch on the wire. 10 out of 4
