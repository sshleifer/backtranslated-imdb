This was really the worst movie I ever seen. Michael Wharton is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely horrible through the whole film, hair is so bad! They speak like a monotone voice and have nooo chemistry. The DVD's cover does not even come near what actually happens in the movie remotely. Really, really annoying. It was so painful to watch it because I had something fast forward through it. I really want to know how on earth I can think of this good one? hhaha They literally just like talk and say "yeah" and have no passion. I could not say at all that they had loved. I'm sorry but the most tragic excuse for this movie that I think I've ever seen.
