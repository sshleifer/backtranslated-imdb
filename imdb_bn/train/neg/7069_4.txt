This is the biggest blow when the film is released and it soon becomes Blockbuster. But honestly, the movie is a ridiculous surveillance with a plot that glorifies a victim. There is a tagline in the movie - "Sweetheart sweetheart, taigaa amara" which means love is sweet but sacrifice is immortal. The film's leading lady (Ganesha) has dedicated her love to leading women (Puja Gandhi), although the two love each other! His justify means the tag line. This movie has influenced so many young broken hearts that they consider this "hungry-like" attitude to be very thoughtful and that is why they can move towards their life, they are the movies of the movie. Ganesh actress, cross and childish boca has played in the movie. He actually seems to have guessed a song, (Andy Vandu Sara ...) when he supposed to look stylish and cool at all. His appearance is not helping the leading role. Her hair style is badly done in most parts of the movie. Puja Gandhi Kant Law Her costume is horrendous in the movie and very inconsistent. Good part about the film is Mano Murthy, excellent cinematography and brilliant music, which in fact is a truly protected quality of the movie. Also the songs of Jayanta Kakini were very well written. Director Yograj Bhat praised the song for transparency. <br /> <br /> However, the song is very common with all songs !!!!!!
