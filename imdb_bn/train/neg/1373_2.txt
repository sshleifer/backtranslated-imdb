This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> I usually appreciate any film for some aspect of its production, but intensely irritating behavior of half-letters is hard to appreciate for any part of this photo. <br /> <br /> <br / > The most common idea was that the design designed to collapse the building was a collapse of the disaster. Er OK. <br /> <br /> Also, trying to figure out the swimming sloom style will not work. Running 10 feet in some trees will not work. Well it's here. The starkness described earlier and the cruel idiots of some characters are ridiculous before it is mentioned. A four-year-old person with limited oxygen around can not tell you that you can start a fire. <br /> <br /> However, about 5 minutes of the movie itself rebuilds and some are grateful. However, if your intelligence has a modicum you too must tolerate this film hard. <br /> <br /> It hurts me that many quality stories can be unproduced and someone will pay for such things <br /> <br /> Oh, did I mention the last five minutes? The better you see the latest avalanche strategy to see give a hook. Absolutely invaluable
