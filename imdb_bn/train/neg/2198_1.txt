A scientist and his girl friend is driving out of friends because his speed caused a car crash. He escaped brutal but he is decapitated. She saves her head, brings her home and lives (!!!!). Then he returns to find out the model and strippers for the perfect body for the head. Her helpless assistant colonist begins to rotate and has a telepathic (or telepathic) link placed in a disgusting giant closet. <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is quite a fool, but I had a particular love for it. When I grew up in the late 1970s, the local TV station showed this movie about 20 times per year (no exceptions). They always show TV on Saturday afternoon - Uncut. Looking back on the TV was good! A bloody giant and sleazy sexploitation along with clear blood and ego - who was it good to care? Now, seeing this, I understand how shy it really is. <br /> <br /> The acting has become quite bad, the production costs are incomplete, the script is slow and (still very bad to besiege) these soft things Two women fight a light cat and end up confession is a great demon. Also add a loose finishing page to the end. On the one hand, it was an interesting example of the exploitation of the 1960s. Another trash her wrist However, this is not a good movie, but only for scary and grave fans, only to see (only once). <br /> <br /> The head smile is quite unclear. Notice the last credits that TITLE incorrectly (this is called "title does not die")!
