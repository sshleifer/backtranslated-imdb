A man with a muscular man in the forest of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic campaign team; The leader of the party found the girl first. Most versions of Tarzan's story have a good production, but I'm helpless in the worst part of any film. John Derek is quietly refrained from the slow action shot and the inspiration outside the wife Bo Derek's ornate body pick-a-bout Glimeses; She has many talents as behind the camera as Ed Wood. Try for tongue-necked sex, Dereks laziness, snappy time, and lack of taste. They have the idea of ​​self-parody and barbaric abandonment (they take precautions to the wind), but after the committed opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Faffe (who was probably marble in her face all the time) played the title role, but John Derek's ego and Bow Derek's self-importance assumed the third thrust. * ****
