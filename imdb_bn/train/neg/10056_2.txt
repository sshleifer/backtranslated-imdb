So ... we see so Brando add footage ... interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy thing. Susanha York was rarely a slouch. Lewis shows a new scene in Clark's search for Superman, where he does not think that he is coming out of the gun instead of the actual rose. The real bullet goes into the inside of his clothes and blows it on the floor, but forget it ... The version of Lester's version of Donner makes it funny, which makes it more logical. Jod's presidential speech "defacing" was when the Washington Monument was originally Mount Rushmore. That view tweaking made quite a line that is ferrous. Superman's "Press of the Press" line was thought to be stupid compared to "Outside to carry", which was well distributed, and it was a perfect connection with Clark's previous view on the track stop. Then there is the end with the effect to "go back to the world back to the world" back to the world. It took everything back in the whole movie and surprised you where you put the rocket right for hacksack, n. J. Never went because it does not freeze and add company.
