Yet we have to take care of another film about a repressive self-centered, arrogant, unreasonable hateful, self-destructive lead character. <br /> <br /> Do not make me a mistake I have a bold self-destructive character that is an open lead character for all kind of friends that wall movies. What I object about this is that this guy has so little backgrounds. Why did this person hate himself and the world? If this script is more and more confronted, they may express some sympathy for it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Perhaps the author got the nerve to end happy ... <br /> <br /> This is not a bad movie I've ever seen but it's setting a good fight! People! Do not waste your time.
