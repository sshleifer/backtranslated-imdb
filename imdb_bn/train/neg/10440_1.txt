You have 10 to 14 years (except R rating), there is little to choose from here. One or two lines of Canaan Thompson, David Kochner (we can see him more) and Sam Jackson funny and Julianna Marjuli may be considered as good as it is around, but sadly, that's it. Poor plot Poor performance Bad writing and delivery. Special effects are dull. The whole situation is an odd and horrific joke, all equally terrible in important embedded situations. If we consider part of the action, some movies have incredible action sequences that make you abominable and have something that bothers you. This movie only contains the next type. Leave this little left. I am so happy that I could not pay for this. <br /> <br /> Despite the publicity, I can read and think, so I do not expect to sit well to sleep. I had no expectations, but I was somewhat worried. Yet, like the debris of the train, no one can just look. And even with no prospect, I was given below. Bad Even 'Not too bad, it's good' element. I am _v_ tolerant of bad movies, but it makes Oscar worthy "Six String Samurai" (which I like). <br /> <br /> No, this piece of CGI garbage is in the same company as the battlefield, Earth, Little Man and Gogli. This is a 7.2 currently rated how completely mystifies me. I can think of the answer as benmawashing or how the voting system can be stacked. <br /> <br /> I could go but tonight I said, I saw the ruins of the train. I must go to wash my eyes. 1 of 10
