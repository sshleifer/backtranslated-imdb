This movie was so potential - a strong cast, a reasonable firm idea and definitely a decent budget. I'm sure where all went wrong, but those of each of those components are wasted. The story has not gone anywhere, the characters had the lowest lip and the results were a very annoying, stupid, waste of a movie. I hate it. By judging another vote, I am among the minorities here and there must be some enemies. However, I thought the movie was horrific. I had high hopes, but were very frustrated. A special disappointment was Jodie Foster's character. Types A very nasty "fixer" makes an excellent idea. Jodie was confident and sexy, but the character did nothing and went somewhere. Denzel Washington played the same character as he always plays - nothing but new but exciting.
