Another entry of "new best friend" is to "steal the life of another woman" sub-section; The best "single white woman" and "The Hand the Pad Cradle"; You can do almost anytime in the Lifetime Channel. For some reasons, this type of theft is only done to women. <br /> <br /> There are only two basic ways to play this kind of story. At first you can make the woman mischief and watch the audience intelligently and know the audience when implementing her evil plan. Or you use the wrong instructions to show him as a good person, as long as it is apparently officially scheduled for a cereal event, it may be bad in the weather scene. Unfortunately, the creators of "New Best Friends" can not decide how they want to play it, and how it crashes and burns quickly. We first met Aliciacia (Mia Kishashner) for the scholarship money scam of the College Financial Assistance Office. We now know that he is a bad person and can doubtfully see his next activity. But the director and editor obviously forgot that this publication was made and the wrong idea was made in the next 50 minutes so that we think Alicia is a good person. It introduces the only element of terror, it is not about whether it is bad, but the director and editor will never waste our time with intelligent and transparent misguided instructions. <br /> <br /> "New best friend" draws a Caste curse very old graduate student from the most damaged teen movies. There are really two big parts, Hadi (Meridith Monroe) and Alicia (Kishan). They were 31 and 26 respectively during production. It works for about 26-year-old Kisharare when she runs the Mausi version of Alicia, but it is frozen after being converted to Glaciated version of Alicia. Monroe's cast is simply a joke, as Nicollet Sheridan trying to pass as a classmate in "Leigh McGuiere". She looks much closer to a mid-life crisis than a term paper. <br /> <br /> Many of the producers must be indebted because this age problem stretches the most supporting characters. The city's Sheriffs are smaller than most of the students. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < They are lucky (as their student residence) and share a palatial better than the real world-New Orleans palace (a footballer is more credible than the football mother of the game). Elisea came to the palace and began to take over the life of Headley. At least in the same way Swine finally receives a roommate from his own generation so that two people can have a lesbian scene. Swann's performance is the only good thing about "New Best Friend" and her love scene with the teenager is fantastic, so cool and the arts that do not fit it with any other category, it's probably been a good director and cinematographer <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The most humorous story is the presentation of a wide range of sexual and nonstop party flashbacks in a series of flashbacks. In each hospital bed, comets are operated by a shot in Alicia. About half of Kirshner's screen is spent motionless lies with a tube in his mouth. Mia is not a good career. <br /> <br /> Again, I know what? I'm just a child.
