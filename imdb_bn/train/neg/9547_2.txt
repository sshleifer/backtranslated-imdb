The conspiracy is a somewhat simplistic video game conspiracy to detect the next terrorist in the backyard of the United States. Welcome lunacy created directly from cheap movie videos. <br /> <br /> This strange game is going on and our "hero" gives true money and works well in it. It's sort of gambling, except the part of the gambling has gone and it sucks. Instead it's a real game and you'll find the authority in your tail if you feel better. <br /> <br /> It turns out that two strange computer programs fight it anyway and everyone is protected. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Please lend it, please.
