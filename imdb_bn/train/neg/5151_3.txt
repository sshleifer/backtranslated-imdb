I thought it was a great idea, boy, it was weakly executed. We get a broad knowledge of how complex and challenging a show's back-stage operation is, but effectively it's no specific about any work. The producers did not find a story to tell a story or to "line up" the viewer. (Which do not say they do not try, but the stingshands add a summary of the ring cycle because the description of the program does not tell us about the work of increasing the opera physically.) <br /> <br /> We are going to do a lot, but people What is doing and why little is said about it. Who has a little sense of how to fit together and how different production groups work together and work together. For example, what kind of problems we hear several times - we hope to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it will be resolved. But instead the filmmakers usually cut it in some other way (generally, the nice genuike footage of people to talk about stuff or headset). <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The whole film feels more like images that you want to run under the closed credits of a show. See, something to look for for his own talent.
