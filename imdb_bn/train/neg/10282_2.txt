I did not expect this to be a great movie, but I did not expect it to be so awful. I hate the mother's character, so I had to start the channel. I turned it back, hoping it was only one in the movie, but not so. And the girl feels embarrassed to sit there, or almost works outside of the job, or goes crazy inside her house? Are you kidding me I was encouraged (even fear) to pay respect to my mother but when I was provoked, I kept her fast at the nearest hotel. I was expecting to obey my mother's house, <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I did not buy it. I've tried to give it many possibilities, I really did. Sorry
