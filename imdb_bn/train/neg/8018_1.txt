Wow, I hate this movie. The subject should really be made as a fine film and the main actor was clearly sensitive and talented enough to handle the issue, but the script - if there was a script - there was a mess. This is a low-end slideshow that does not go anywhere. I would say it does not go anywhere, except that it is actually the longest time of 81 minutes. I mentioned, the main actor is good. So Farja Balak (SP?), Sometimes as a harsh but last-loving-and acceptable mother. There are a lot of answers for the film makers here, because it's a mess. A real shame, because I really wanted to like this movie, but it was originally taken from a movie that was never created. Leave this one - it was not worth $ 6, which I was open to every scene.
