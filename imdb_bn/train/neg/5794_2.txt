The Germans are all standing openly and have lowered down with a machine gun. Good guys do not die, until it's done for dramatic purposes. The "plot" so laughs her is ridiculous. (Where did the German soldiers go when they were running a fuel tank on the train? Eric Astraa? Please!) And the whole idea, a train hijacking? How stupid that! Germans know where you will go, do not leave the track! What a waste I would rather fool myself over the head with a ball pine hammer 10 times and then sit through that again. I mean, it was made seriously in the 60's, but it was produced in 88 !! 1988 !! The team is more believable on this horrific excuse for a movie. Only watch it if you need a good smile. This film was going to the television series, which was John Wayne of Heine Beer.
