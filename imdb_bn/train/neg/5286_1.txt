I'm the fan of General Zen Austin and I've ordered the movie from Amazon.H. So I did not want to wait forever for coming to the US, I could really save my money. What's with Anne running after Wentworth? The whole point of Ana Eliot's character is that he is calm and refined. She is not impulsive and indecent. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? His statement was not normal, nor was his usual walk. There was no chemistry between the two main characters, which made their entire "romance" totally unbelievable. In the final scene, they put Sally Hawkins on the same suit wearing Amanda Root in the private scene. The same clothes do not have the same movie in it. In my opinion, they did not see the 1995 edition, although it had errors, but it was very close to the book. In the book, I do not even think they read it. It's kind of like a cliff's note movie. Hurt over all the high points without explaining anything.
