A few weeks ago the German broadcaster "Sat1" released the movie as "TV-Event of the Year" - sorry, but I saw something better on TV this year. <br /> <br /> I did not think much of the movie, but I soon reminded two other horror films when I saw commercial-titanic and Pearl Harbor's films because the picture was so familiar: "heroine" (if I Can I tell the truth?) In the middle and the next two "loved ones" - Pearl Harbor, anyone? Actually the story of love is a poor man version of Pearl Harbor and it was already poor! <br /> <br /> I like to watch movies and analyze their patterns, I finally agreed to see the trash. At the end of the Third Reich, this film began with a doctor who left his family for a military attack against Russia, pledging his wife that he would return. In the spring of 1948, it was rapidly moving: Germany lost the war and took over the alliance and Russia and both of them tried to overthrow each other for the world power and their ideology: versus Communism of Communism. Well, I think you already know the story because you have to tell it - the film does not really bother with it and literally takes a dump in historical events. The film is trying to portray the US government as an angel, and especially during the Great Britain's air force, while ignoring the contribution of other countries, despite bombings from countries trying to help the country, about a quarter of the amount was accounted for. <br /> <br /> The historical comment made by the man in this story was very annoying, as the mother of the heroine told her daughter that Germany could be divided into two parts: "It is impossible!" Or when Stalin (where the director thought that we saw an identical statue like an actor and he could see it like this) said that Russia has to stop "Coca Cola" in Russia. Yeah right, Stalin ever said something like this. Or this one American pilot who said his colleague with flesh and everything possible - please! <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Once you see a map showing the plane, just like the map it seems that it came straight out of the laser printer - 48. American general Lucius Clay, who was originally thought to be in Berlin, was portrayed as a man who was united and fearsome and historically historically he liked the opinion of the aircraft and went on to improve the idea that it came from an impressive character, Philip Turner. The main actress's interest is to take me by the other side: Suitable for the movie The best African-American soldiers were not two like the whole movie! Relations between the US military and the German nationals were not allowed and the American soldier was sent home by expressing such relations. I do not want to say that there was no relationship here, but there was a couple in this movie which was almost married, if it did not die on a fake CGI plane, which is very uncommonly CGI <br /> <br /> < br /> If all the Americans in this picture were not enough, they spoke non-Germanic languages ​​even though they had been in Germany for a few months - see, I live in Germany in my entire Germany. Life and even I have a little pronunciation. Notably bad children also played - the children had two expressions on their face: "Normal-e-Appearance-Monotons-like-Robot" and Greening. <br /> <br /> All the movies were boring from the beginning to the moving path, especially the story of love which was like half the dialogue, like Pearl Harbor. Sadly, the movie was very successful - the first segment of 8.97 million and 7.83 million watched the second day and thus SAT1 achieved consistently two victories in the overall market share and got a huge victory over the commercially relevant group. But I always think: the biggest lid of Bull-father where the most flys.
