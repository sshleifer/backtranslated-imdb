This is not just a bad movie, it's one of the worst movies ever. It is very bad that I found it quite enjoyable. Acting, O my God, script, you have to be kidneyed. ' How can you think of the author: - A child who makes fireworks at school is so strong that when someone gets hit by it, they are behind 100 yards behind and explode. - If a girl is trapped in cellular, the killer is trying to open the door. He gets a drill, but the cable is not long enough. He is an extension cord first, awful awful, and then, when he is done, he makes drills through the door and drills through the killer's head. WOW - and there are many more examples like that. Oh yeah, and what happened to George Kennedy, he was cool (Thunderbolt and Lightfoot / Cool Hand Look)
