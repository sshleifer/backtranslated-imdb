Simply say, "Police Academy: Mission from Moscow" is the worst movie ever (if you like this movie, you probably would like it). <br /> <br /> What were they thinking? Some ideas should be right, an idea. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, one word ... everything. <br /> <br /> Cost to pay: $ 4.50 Viewing time: 89 minutes <br /> <br /> I want both money back!
