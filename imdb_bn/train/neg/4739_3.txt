In the end, today I came to see the fate of the accused as the killer, the consequence of his character and so cruel in the first song, that he came to see me in the final attempt to grasp deeply on the earth. <br /> <br /> Like this poem, I will say Azimi 2: death or love when I get attached to the intimate feeling of the Flying Dagaar and after watching the blood-killer assassin, I am complaining about the authenticity of the Au Yutas. 2 I began to appreciate the errors mentioned earlier previously. <br /> <br /> The determination of each killer is not only lazy and irrelevant, but many important elements are excluded from the whole experience. At Azumi 1, we have seen that the smugglers use the stealth technique (which is their number one priority) as well as logic to make their markings easier for the speedy execution of the death penalty and the rapid escape. But I will not be so long against this film that this story has spread a little over a little while and obstructs him further on the way to Azumi, so that he can not reach the battlefield and charisma show any signs. However, Chaiyi has tarnished for the most part of the movie, and originally played a ton down version of Goo, at the bottom of the feeling of cold arms and danger. <br /> <br /> This brings me to the final stage of the epic 'Death' headline, which spreads only in disguise; In the first half of the film we see the promising appearance of many promising opponents, with amazing looks and even flashing weapons. As soon as they are surprised they fill their last road or any other, but the film becomes too small when each of them dies very quickly and easily. At Azimi 1, the young assassin most often defeats the opposition party with a slightly satisfied war, and compared to the final procession between Azzumi and Bijomoru, at least 2 were far less final and better than the clashes between Azumi. Some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve inventions due to the competition in each competition. I am not destroying the traditional style of samurai films with fast and realistic war, but both characters of Ajmo films were so fantastic and direct animations that the rules could be broken and the process should be more enriching. <<br /> <br /> Ajumi romances to fill the time between side-of-the-scenes scenes and unfortunately it does not make any sense and provides a lot of necessary resolution. <br /> <br /> An open mind for a variety of films and animations, I will not lie and I will accept my neutrality and disunity to the first movie, but I will take the right action and say that the original was after viewing Azizi 2. Make look like flawless masterpieces. It is worthless, Azumi 2: Death or love can go directly to the video, with its invisibly rich budget and the failure of the desperate killers to expand their journey or to fail, to do their best to restore peace. Brave trying brave to die.
