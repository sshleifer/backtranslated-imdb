This picture has spread to the scandal so long that it was sought after the item ... all the turmoil, mystery, etc. were all a big part of film production, but eventually failed at every stage. This is a terrible bad comedy, a sad film horror, a hairy erotic film. <br /> <br /> There is a fantastic booklet with a comprehensive interview along with 2 disc DVD styles, interviews, interviews on vivid, etc. More proven than the director. For those who have heard about it but never seen it, it will be astonishing for them as long as one sees the movie. There are 1 disc edited movie, badly translated into English but with good visual quality. Disk 2 has the director's cut, a terrible transfer, in French. <br /> <br /> Can I talk about the actual animal? A doll was more effective and frustrating in the hands of the frog cremator.
