I had a really hard time making this through this step. It was very slow and sometimes surprising when the film's plot would actually come in life. <br /> <br /> This movie started flowing slowly and after the end I was surprised. I'm usually a person who sometimes likes a good indie file but I'm not satisfied with what I'm looking for. <br /> <br /> It looks like they tried to do a lot outside of this movie. It was turned into politics in a moment, which is not a big fan of the movie. If you are looking for a running movie with a plot, this is the right film for you. For me, I felt that I could have done anything else after 2 hours.
