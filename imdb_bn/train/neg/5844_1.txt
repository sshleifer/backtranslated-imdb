This picture is the worst one I've ever seen. And I do not mean that a good way. We wanted to see a crappy scary / thriller, so we think the store is that lousiest. Once, the film was what we hope for. And more! (Or should I say less?) <br /> <br /> Actors have seen their lines reading the poster behind the camera. The so-called special effects are made by installing red scenes with plastic in front of the camera, which we see through the killings rats. And the script? Even I do not have to start in the script ... and when you thought it could not be worse then it ended that the first part of the film was Oscar-stuff compared to the end. <br /> <br /> Take it from me, if you are in the fuzzy horror-film, this movie is fun, but if you want a good movie then see. This is not for you.
