According to my ratings and my title of this review, I can assume that I do not like Johnny Test. Now I think what people will say, "How bad do you know how bad it is?" Have you ever seen it? "I have seen this program several times because I am reading movies and animations and it only 'hold a candle in my values. <br /> <br /> I first want to talk about animation because it's one of the confusing things I've ever seen. Hand Animation like the first two seasons or only the first season was drawn. I think it was a great show when it was hand drawn, but then it switched to animation flash and the quality went down a great deal. <br /> <br /> So there is a strike in my eyes but look at the show story. It tries much harder to be like Dexter's lab but it differs because instead of a red led scientist there are two and they both are women. A talking dog (why?), And parental attitude is a bit switched on. I have others but I do not think I can write them here (I do not mean curses but I do not mean I do not know if there is a limit for words.) Everything else spot though, even an DD character does not own herself. It just tries hard to be Dexter but it seems like my heartless imitation. <br /> <br /> Finally, I want to talk about jokes. Remember the Dexters Lab involves engaging in some joke? Yes, it feels good for aloud or both, but Dexter's lab has the same comment that forced me to go back and check for joke. Johnny Test just forgot all that and just 50% yells and yells when a folly joke or one liner appears on the music. It's not a joke, stupid comedy (I know what some people think, do not have a stupid comedy in three studios? And see Johnny's test come back and you make more humor in the first option.) Sometimes the joke is based on malicious situations, like Chowder, makes me crazy. There is a rule for all my cartoons and comedies: Not many wicked comedies are equal, do you just "I see what?" Thinks <br /> <br /> So it is the strike in all accounts. If you do not see any of this show, there is no respect for comedy in shape, shape or form.
