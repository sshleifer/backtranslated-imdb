As the casual audience of Rolling Stones, I thought it might be interesting. Not so, in the 1960's, the film was much older. Hippies look forward to me as a mystery (someone born in the 1980's), but I'm sure this movie was not made for me, but active people in the 60's I hope to have a lot of drugs with Tho Stones, I was frustrated, it actually showed real life, hard work in the studio, so I think I was working with them to reach the conclusion of this angel horror movie. I have not seen any other director of the film, but they are suspecting that they follow the same style guidelines, such as 'AmuRushish' which gives a feeling like a TV show Eurotrash, is badly directed, firmly integrated and lacks genuine entertainment value. This is my only good opinion that I did not waste money on it, it was free with a Sunday papers.
