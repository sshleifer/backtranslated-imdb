You will find it if you allow 10-year-old (manic American) moon travel stories. Absolute garbage with no ransom properties maybe held in some estuarine in it's 3D depth. But as a descriptive and entertaining animation it did nothing to waste a hour and a half-price waste. Save your time and money and instead see Bolt <br /> <br /> breath. Not enough lines, yet I think its amount ... Well, I agree with the above review - it's like a cold war campaign story If it dies at the first moment of unfreezing lunar fires, it may have been more interesting. BTW - Why has all the main characters been distorted? There was not a whole full praise!
