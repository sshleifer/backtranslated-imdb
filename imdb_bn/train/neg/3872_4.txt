The movie does not become helpless to watch. And to say it directly, it's nothing to show in parts of a strange non-sexy character in the release of some sexy dresses, except sexy Alicia Silverstone. It is very easy to follow the story or there is nothing to follow - you can see it anyway. There is no mystery, little steps, disrespectful dialogue, dissatisfied sensuality, same annoying position and very fancy acting. Kevin Dillon is completely worthless. Silverstone ... Well, I'm not too focused on his acting, I admit. Yet I said before, if anyone does not have to do anything except watching movies, then it will not be very bad. 4/10
