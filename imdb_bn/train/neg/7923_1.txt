I'm the big fan of Ted V Mickels and the original "Corps Girders" is the main reason, but this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Even the legendary lease ray ("boring living") has not been able to save this unnecessary junk. This film should serve as a lesson to past, present and future filmmakers ... When you got a movie as successful as "Corps Girders" you probably leave the dogs to sleep and of course you will not try to revive it twenty years Later (if you have higher Celsius with Herschelle Gordon Lewis such as "Blood Fist 2: All You Can Eat" If you decide to do this, you probably should spend a little bit more money than you did for the benefit of God, and you do not make a movie in any video ... why do filmmakers work in such a way When everyone tries to know that the value is going on suddenly ... I personally have a film in this fashion See which powders can blow up from the hell ... If you can not make a better signal than your original movie then sell the rights to the movie that can ... and Ted V Mickels is writing this religion Or smoking) is a harmful script? I mean dogs and cats "aliens" from another dog? Draws like a devastating machine capable of consuming a human body in a cardboard box ... bone and cloth and all? Alongside Lease Reno, one of the actors would have paid more than five thousand dollars more than their roughly expensive work! Avoid this film at all costs and see the original instead.
