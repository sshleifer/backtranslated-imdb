I went to see this movie (I actually went to see family portraits, including Cutting Moments + Douglas Buck has two other small films) Mar del Plata Festival (Argentina) ... I could not see it! I was covering my eyes after the first half of the cut season and took a peek at some point in time. When the time was over, my stomach was flip and I felt light headed. A few minutes after the second movie started, I left the film (BTW, of course I would not leave the room). It was a very violent and despicable WAAAAY for me! I really impressed by many courageous people who loved it. I just can not love these movies! I have seen that astonishing and bloody and horrible images really stuck in my head like two days !! I tried to analyze the story (my boyfriend saw the whole thing and told me about it) and I do not think it's any idea. I mean, the amount of violence and stuff, that makes people sense any other than trying to shock. And that's not a good enough reason, I think. There is absolutely nothing in this movie that I can say, "Well, at least it was good about 'x'. But well, I guess I would never understand such a movie.
