Night came to Evelyn Greiv (Emilio Miraglia - Italy 1971). <br /> <br /> I saw this misleading section of Euro-Tosh on the horrific DVD release of alpha video (it looks very bad) video transfer, but from what I have seen, to buy a recent DJ-release of a sham Not quite interesting. Considering their excellent track record, it will undoubtedly be a big improvement over all previous releases. And do not pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here, it is not taken from this movie (some of the girls have raised heads like Jim Carey) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A sprawling Western star, Athenie Stephen Sports estimates the role of a hip hairdo and Lord Allan Cunningham, a man scared by his dead wife Evelyn's memories. This is a nervous breakdown which keeps him in a mental clinic. Once released, Cunningham recognized the disaster by taking red-handed prostitution from its rural fortress, which they have been subjected to torturous behavior of torture. His doctor and friend, Richard Timberlain (What do you mean, the Italian horror names "created?") Encourages him to forget past and forget, but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a sense of the castle. Eventually, after killing some more girls, he met Gladys another redhead and married him almost unmarried, but his new wife caused most of the sinful incidents of arrival. Bloody animals kill and kill one after another in the family of Sir Alan. Becoming more annoying, Cunningham visited Evelyn's tomb and discovered it to be empty. Soon, the "outsiders" began to suspect that some of the stenches were going on, and Lord Cunningham's treatment might not have succeeded at all. <br /> <br /> Director Emilio Miraglia is trying to mix Gothic shock with Geiolo. Conference with limited success Naturally, there was little effort to strengthen the audience in the film in England. The car is driving in the right-hand car, everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle (and the rest of the architectural) see Patent Italian. This is a common practice in Italian horror, but sometimes they take it very little away. Bad print this is even a little bearable, since it is much darker, since you can not see much of the surroundings. But, again, such a movie, where something that describes the exploitation and the reality, is really not a problem. The Unfortunate Torture Chamber contains a large part of SÃ£o-Masonic-torture scenes, but most of the time, Anthony Steffen attacks her on this way and shows some terrific over-acting. I think it all depends on the state of your mind and if you are in the right mood it can be a fun piece of nonsense. I'm not taking it, at least not the print that I saw. Bruno Nicolaii's great score however, adds some cyclical rock counting with easy listening tunes. <br /> <br /> Camera Asphuara --- 4/10
