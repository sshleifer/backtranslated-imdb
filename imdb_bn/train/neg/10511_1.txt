Note for the horror fans: The only horror here is that when you realize that you've lost 95 minutes of your life in a film, it is so insulting that it is insulting. <br /> <br /> The reason I saw it is <br /> <br /> The court sounded a little promise: it is not. Using the same lam set set from other low-budget slash films is just an excuse that was not good. <br /> <br /> Although the movie becomes awful, the nude forest nude looks beautiful: it is not. That's not it. Amateur cinematography ensures that "fallen angels" are often as sexy as the average homeless person. <br /> <br /> In the Hammer style, Tom Sawini's name is long history: he is a specially influential king of low budget and low budget performance. To think, Savini was not able to see the movie. It's not that bad, but she's almost always bad movie. His only good role was from Doom Til Dawn, and since he is feeding on the horrible conventions. <br /> <br /> But let's focus on its positive: A great example of how the palms of the palms can be made is a movie. <br /> <br /> Everything is a negative. Clear Writer Originality Allergy The script is terrible. That is given after the first 10 minutes. But stupid pensing; The director knows the behavior of "plot" and "charlatan" as a concern, thinking that no one still thinks; And increasingly long and annoying driving, walking, and nature sequences (there is no doubt that added to increase the time for qualification for film distribution) generally lacks the lack of completeness of film and story conversations. <br /> <br /> If a movie is bad, it can tell you that another good example of the number one: if it is written and directed to the same person, then expect garbage.
