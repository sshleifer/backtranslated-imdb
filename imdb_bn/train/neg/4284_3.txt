Jason Lee's pecks are back! If you are looking for that, see more. If not, good step ... <br /> <br /> But about the movie. Clichés Gallery, some weaker shots but but foreign fight scenes (used jcd) and many bad acting and cheap effects Poor Lee looks like he is suffering throughout the movie, and it does not surprise. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not spend this image as a B-Movie - Sure, bloody blonde in Germany was a bad guy in Rutger-Wang, but no unwelcome sex scene or even a single booty shot. None. Zip Nada Even the Starships Truppers 2 also had a general idea of ​​covering their compulsory picture scenes (for my rest of the comments about this wonderful piece of classic movie excellence, please mention our upcoming review on the order of the mind's bliss ...). I felt the feeling that the authors would take revenge on them - in this way I will not come to the movies about "plot" or other related. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br />
