Since I work in a video store, I found it to be a serious responsibility for my worst films and to alert my friends and colleagues. My friend is brave to see BT through a special controversial debate in one of the worst movies of the day. The killer, even saying that if I can see the whole movie and still claim that my previous choice was the worst movie, he would see it. I have lost I believe that I've made even better videos at high schools, and it was rarely a credit for a young talent. This movie was not only lacking in the absence of production costs (it seems to have been shot in a bad camcod, though it is surprisingly obvious), but not acting (do not scratch the wood, hollow, and repressive surface) as well as just the bad movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard the glass cracks, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school dramas (I know that I often refer to here in high school, but this image seems too small) a lot more fake It was, but people were starting to read their lines from the script, not completely sure what was going on. My review does not judge this movie, because I can not describe how terrible it is when I see this time. It's almost ironic that I am describing a sad excuse for a movie, a sad story.
