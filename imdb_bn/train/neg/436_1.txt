If you are sometimes harassed by a Christian underground, who said, "Jesus answered, what is the question?", Then perhaps you should thank you if you do not meet a Laxanian. The Livanians' most missionary Slovoz Jizz definitely exchanged the word "Jesus" in the statement of "Lasan / Hegel". <br /> <br /> The star of the movie is brightly shining right now, because we usually look at movies and pop culture purely for our expenses. So when someone comes up with someone, it sounds impressive and says, "Suddenly, movies can tell about themselves." <br /> <br /> This film is really "true". For example, Jijak explained that three Marx bros is ego, sergo and id (God knows what a zipo, or what? Perhaps they are sinners ... or are these movies themselves?). This is simply what they do. Out of the output of GJK, culture will not be investigated but will only be held as an example of its ideology. People may say that he has something to say - but what he said from Jesus blames everything for God's will? <br /> <br /> What is wrong with illustrating a picture, or somewhere, for example? Well, nothing. Zizek seems to believe, they may even serve as a proof. However, when these illustrations are disconnected from their context, only the ears and the campaign are. In the context, you can say and prove something you want. What's the answer for LJAN? So he goes and makes it an example. To serve these ideologies, everything is similar to the teachings of master and culture. For example, while Jimmie Stewart's espionage with Kim Novak in Zia's Stewart flower shop is taken from a scene in Vertigo, the example of Voyage's fantasy position is considered. But, in reference to the film, this is not a visual fantasy position. Stewart was deliberately led by Novak. This presentation of isolated examples from their context is going on throughout two hours and half of the filmmaking of GJK. <br /> <br /> The view of his blood type "Child wants --- ---" is ridiculous. Tears of lightening on the terrible (feminine) of "feminine jauses" seems to be true, Jijk said that the character of Isabella Rossini does not merely demand its deterioration, but rather inadvertently engaged in the situation. This is an example of its "jouissance". Well ... maybe. But - sorry to be sad - where is the evidence for this? Hooper kidnapped his son, in this film, he partly endured his humiliation. GJK can object to the fact that she also enjoys sex relations with Kyle McClelan. But there could be any number for this reason. The so-called "jouissance" point of the woman? According to Lacan, unlike Falic Jussens, women's jausens can not be alphabetic, it is a falcill capture and beyond the flow of languages. If this is correct, then no such example can be made. This complete concept is non-sensitive and completely mysterious. It can only be nominated by the Digitizers like GJK: "You have a joke for women! Why is this feminine jauses? Because I say it." <br /> <br /> What are the benefits of these pictures really? Only psychology of Jizak Why did he keep himself in his favorite movies, even when he said in a boat on Bitga Bay, he wants to --- Rod Stigger? Is it not a substitute for someone who spends his life for criticism? Saying that Freud has a field day with The Pavverts Guide to Cinema - but there is no other person with GJK. <br /> <br /> The movies of GJK's theories show us how we want it, but these movies can not be universal examples of psychological laws. How does this picture describe Gizk's wishes and only vaguely - almost in vain - how the rest of us want Because, any psychologist knows, how we wish and what we want can not be completely separated - and if not universally accessible. Gesk's love carries the love of making an example of the reply of Laksan: How do we like? Like this, how I do it The problem is, in the will of GJK, everything and everyone else is justified in his will. But GJK is a Leninist and they certainly do not like to talk about "things" for themselves. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br /> <br /> Gizk never questioned what his purpose might be when starting an analysis, his search terms and his ethics are never questioned in doing so. <br /> <br /> Giza is very profitable but all his books and this picture say the same thing. He is a type of Henry Ford of cultural theory: mass-production and as black as black He is perfect for today's very consumeristic society: Critically critically critical people give the same c-app and say that it is something different. This is popular because people mostly like repetitive answers to their problems - which always demand capitalism - instead of investigating matters with a serious consideration. Which is kind of like the brain. For me, the third Matrix Peel of GJK is a suicide capsule. <br /> <br /> I love GJK's serious comments - as a direct release of movies and humanities - in movies where music can affect sympathy for people. Just what Zijeee just came to see?
