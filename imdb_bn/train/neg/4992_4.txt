This movie is just another average action flick, but it can be even better. When guns come out they must have some choreography help. Andy McNab, who hit a great deal of hits in sequence, because they were able to get out of the robbery on the road - if they made a somewhat simpler action act. Because the rest of the movie was right - predictable but worth seeing - you're better than expecting from such a movie. Then the final scene, down the show, we were waiting, but in the 80's it was like to see something from the team. They shoot wildly, do not hit anything, and they try to kill each other and roam around the house - the same age, the same age.
