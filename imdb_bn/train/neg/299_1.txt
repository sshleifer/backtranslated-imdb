The third was restored in memory of this in the wake of Yaran (1995) and Agnokhi (1996) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This story was good, but the handling was not good and the heroine was very responsive and Climax was frustrating <br /> <br /> Directions are bad, music is good. <br /> <br /> Repeat the role of Rishi Zarna (curiously it was the reconstruction of SWTE) and seems very fatty for lead and it is well judicious, and it is very difficult. He played a lot of scenes in his debut and to scoff at the audience, but his voices were terrible, Joey was very loud
