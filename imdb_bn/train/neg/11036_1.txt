It will be the most corniest TV show in the air. This is probably a turn for Jim Belushi and all his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talents outside his younger brother. I hope this show has been canceled and never said anything other than negative use. Jim retired or got something. Please go to their air. I would wash my eyes with a toothbrush and wash if I am a joke from that show here. The ID will be taken from Satan himself rather than the whole half-hour clock in program pieces. I still can not understand why the show is still running in the air. We all want to shoot our TV screen to see Jim's face. In conclusion, please do any more.
