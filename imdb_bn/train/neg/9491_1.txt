This movie really appreciates the discovery of your remote control fast forward button. It's fine finely fine pictures. Once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However, what was difficult for me to do about the film is that though it was shot at the non-shooting 19 years of age, it was actually portrayed much less than the girls. This whole lollita thing, especially in the United States, makes me uncomfortable. The heroine is actually looking younger than the younger ones in the youth area. Come, gender is a wonderful past-agreeable adult. Another thing that I thought was strange, was not that there was not a nude scene in the movies of the Beat or the Shoot, well, at least not right.
