This movie was terrible. The first half hour is much better ... well, apologies for the lack of alphabet, but it was just a bad version of Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from the beginning of the clockwork! It seems that it was a tribute, in the face of the cover of the cover of the Clairvoyance Poster, but the "Reepoff" is more appropriate word The movie felt that it was bursting from the right side of the Kubrick Classic, only with the eyes of the new director. A blind director. Unfortunately, when it stopped the massacre of Kubrick, the film became even worse. Another commentator said that the depth of this photo is just below your neck. Boastful, self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drill. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the hero will probably touch a nerve in the development of this character's character. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I think that if someone could be able to feel something for her, it would be mine. Terrible character development, dialogue and plot. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is the title. For a movie called "16 Years Alcohol", there is no reason for the drunkenness to glitter. Check out the first paragraph - It was a slaughterhouse of Clockwork Orange that I could not find. The more appropriate title is "16-year violence" or better, "A Clockwork Art". <br /> <br /> Just bias yourself and avoid this movie. You ignore my advice and take it anyway, drink it. Trust me
