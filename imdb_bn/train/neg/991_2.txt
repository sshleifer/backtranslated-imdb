If you want to see a good movie about how women can fight against sexual violence, this movie is not a film that you do not want to see. It was a social comment about a woman who was fighting and fighting back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns his attacker into a table. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts using caution. He originally rejected the judicial system. The movie "The Acquired" was a great movie because the hunter uses the judiciary and wins. What is the "lineage" telling the attack victim that their violence should be resorted to? The victim is a good accuser? No !!!
