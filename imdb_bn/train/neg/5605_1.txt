I was very disappointed with this picture. I hope more about the Thelma and Luiz female-girlfriend crime movies. Instead, in this shocking, fleeing women prison, there was no sense of loyalty to each other. They were a very rude pack of Hanna, who beat each other, doubled each other, and even gay rape against other women in the film. <br /> <br /> Instead of thieving thieves, in order to find out the escape plan and the hiding of money, the women were many selfish and wicked in turn, had to trust each other for a long time. These women were not released in a positive sense. They just finished the loose cloth, not respecting themselves, or each other. If you like 70 second female criminal movies, skip this bomb and see The Great Texas Dynamite Chase, which stars Claudia Jennings and Joclin Jones.
