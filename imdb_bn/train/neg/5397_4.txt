I think this is the most difficult job of Kenneth Brangh Shakespeare. Much is nothing about Adoe, such as after great efforts, etc. I think this is poor. Cast was weak (Alicia Silverstone, Nivoly, McLion?) But my biggest key was to hate Bird's work and tried to play something in musical / dancing sequences. <br /> <br /> You do not just shakespeare and do not mess with the game. Sorry, but that's just wrong. I just love some co-ports like the next person, but Jizz, do not mess with Shakespeare. If you want to see a bright Shakespeare adaptation of Tempest, avoid it and see "Prospera books".
