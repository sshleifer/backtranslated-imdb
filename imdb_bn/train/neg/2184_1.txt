This movie is an unexplained analogy and a loose collection of sick plots. <br /> <br /> Movie History: The director of this movie was a pervert, who in the city filmed random women. When his wife discovered film relays, she was forced to consolidate a story quickly. He claimed that he was making a movie called "The Brain That Does Not Die". Finally, his wife claimed that she would show him her "so-called movie". That night he quickly shot some extra scenes with a friend and was born "the brain that does not die". <br /> <br /> I hate this movie! Plot Sinapassis: Maya's main character was killed in a horrific car accident (which he made clear by ignoring the street signs that he clearly posted). He grabs his head from the debris and reinimates it. After reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. What's that beautiful for the rest of the movie? In the end, he is fighting and killing by a demon that lives in the horse. Any explanation of the demon appears with little. However, the monster saves a hooker and I guess that they lived happily afterwards. Side note: The last credit screen claims that the movie is called "head that will not die". <Br> <br /> I hate this movie!
