The original "Les visiteurs" were original, ridiculous, attractive, balanced and perfect nearby. LV2 must be the candidate of the "worst sign of a really good movie". Everyone laughs at LV2, when a gag does not work first, it repeats it with a little vague hope 5 times which is finally fun. LV2 is a horrible parody of LV1 that must be a parody detector. If you like LV1 do not see this movie, only watch the LV1 !!
