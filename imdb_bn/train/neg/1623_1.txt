Basing a television series on a popular writer's work is no guarantee of success. Yorkshire Television learned this difficult method when in 1979 they bought the rights to the books given to Dick Francis, whose three joint titles were circulated under 'The Racing Game'. Mike Glimim had Sid Halley, a former jockey personal injury due to a personal accident, in which he lost his right hand, he only replaced it with artificial one. Gleim was suffering from a severe shortage of charisma (and looked like one of the bad guys), when Mick Ford (who played the boring Chico Burns) thought of me as the ass of the horse on the screen. For six weeks, these less dynamic couples filed complaints against the countryside, usually leaking irreconcilable plots to fix races by Blackmail, kidnapers, or defender horses. Yorkshire television program thrown money, but there is no profit. Violent, sexist, remote and repetitive, it was quickly carted off to the knackers yard.
