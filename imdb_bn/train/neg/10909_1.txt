This is a very bad movie. I smiled once or twice, and took the story! Perhaps a funny joke, it's stupid and it's annoying. Through the whole small film, when I was going to sleep, I was asleep and I was thinking that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some people do not work and everyone is stupid and It works ridiculous. Rob Schneider plays like an animal, I do not want to see anything. It looked funny, but the following line: You do not take proper time on such a restricted and firm film. <br /> <br /> I was surprised at the end of it, though it was a short movie. At the beginning we thought it would be better; But it gets worse. Fool, all the way to the end. I left the theater, and I will remember that movie is very bad forever. <br /> <br /> The author and co-producer of this movie, Simpsons TV is the author, but it is nothing like Simpsons (it sucks the movie !!!)
