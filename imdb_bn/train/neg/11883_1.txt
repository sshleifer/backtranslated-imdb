I did not sleep even after awake at 3:30 in the morning, I decided that I could be happy to suffer from sleep deprivation. This movie was in HBO and I decided to watch it. <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot (potential spoilers, if you care about) here: candy (Jess Cornblum) A neurotic man with an adulterer works as a temp for some ridiculous company. Suddenly, he was given the opportunity to "Perm Param", which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie. But with a secure earnings and a secure earnings in his perception, Josh makes no mistake because he does not want to do that. He frustrates me a little bit of hate and hate me because of lack of laziness and ambition. During his time, his disability is considered uncomfortable to send some "very important" letters, but only fools. Josh meets a lawyer woman and tricks them and they wander around the bed together (actually, a real-life fantasy of Josh, as it never happens). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> For the first time, The initial reaction was one of the terrible stresses) and the second when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yes, right). Josh Cornblut is probably the most scary person in my life. She is believed to have sex with a unattractive, overweight, balding Jewish man who I believe is beautiful woman. I'm not sympathetic to Josh's character. She is lazy and unmotivated and I just do not appreciate the attempts to humor. Leave it, even if your life depends on it.
