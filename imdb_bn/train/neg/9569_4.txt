Certainly not awesome, but certainly not good. <br /> <br /> Cree was directed by The Time Country (1995) by Darryl Rudd, and was written for the screen by Ronald Harwood (from the 1946 novel Allan Patan). James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. <br /> <br /> This picture is pre-racist South Africa, and a black man and a white man intertwining stories. Religious but naive preacher Stephen Kollo (James Earl Jones) found a letter from Johannesburg that he would come immediately; He later saw that his son killed a man. The rich farmer / landowner James Jarvis (Richard Harris) discovered that his son, a warrior for black rights, was killed by a son of Comilla. They are connected with this. <br /> <br /> I can not compare it with the name of the same name as the 1951 film, because I did not see it. Or did not even see the title of Lost in the Stars for Eye in 1974; Both look better than this one. But Crimea Freedom, on the other hand, I saw; It has more urgent winds, as it is actually trying to say something where the film is crying, there is no idea where the favorite country is going. Very "Wishy-washed". I refuse to compare this movie with the novel (except I enjoyed the novel rather than enjoying the novel) because the novels and movies have two very different media and there is no reason to try to move directly to one another or to compare them. In the same way. <br /> <br /> In fact, this film has flown up. Well, I guess it was not bad, - Ten-out-out, - but it was not good. From both sides, the highly capable actor portrays some wooden performances of the most painful conversation in the history of the film (but it can also be blamed by the writer of the genre Ronald Harwood, which is surprisingly close to the film, also called The Pilist and Bailey Julia). The novel's point and theme is almost entirely lost in the transformation of the film for the third time; At any moment in the film, there is a tension between ethnic or suspiciously, if there is any. Music does not help. Painful and annoying Pacific orchestra tracks actually help bow down on this film. Cinematography with a lot of good or big shots, but unfortunately, it does not help much in the film. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < It is very bad that they seem to have been isolated from the picture they were shown. I do not know what Nelson Mandela saw in this movie. <br /> <br /> Thanks for your time.
