Usually a reliable misfire from Larry Cohen (God toll, May to, A, etc.), the whole moon tries so much hard to be very fun and fails badly, even better with Ed McMahon (!) And Kenneth Mars. Alan Arkin feels embarrassed throughout his performance and the boy Adam simply seems stupid. This makes the appearance of a comedy classic like the Teen Wolf.
