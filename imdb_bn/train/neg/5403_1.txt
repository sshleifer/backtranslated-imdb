I gave this movie a single star because it was impossible to give less. <br /> <br /> Scientists have created a formula for replicating any organism. Their lab (a powered warehouse in L.A.), they make a T-Rex. A group of art spies refuses to steal the form and the rest of the film rises to an endless step. <br /> <br /> T-Rex (a rubber doll) is loose and it is selected to wipe out. Some of them have the ability to sneak into 2 or 3 feet without having to look them up and then bite their heads immediately. <br /> <br /> A cast member escapes from a police car and the rest of the film is aimlessly through the city. He has such a higher mental capacity that he can manage the radio. He does not try to run any substation or donut shop and he is lost in despair. <br /> <br /> T-Rex attacks devastating cities, gun fights and buildings (cardboard muck up), but a police policeman, or army, or someone else ever shows up. This type of activity will be a common place in Los Angeles. <br /> <br /> We can expect that a signal is not planned.
