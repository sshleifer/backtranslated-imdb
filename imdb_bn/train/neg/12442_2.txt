If the film is not sexist or racist, then Starr's aggression will definitely be included in the "so bad" category. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> On the condition of being non-funny, during this fairly small film, the same Walk-Through-Cave Gaga was repeated ten times well. Ray Jimmy has a good impression of Cagney (but he can not work for two influences of the substantial Canganite, and he does not try to do Peter Lor). There is, in fact, no production value, such as "Star Crier", making Row-Man from a slow robot, or from Outer Space to Plan 9, Star Johnson is considered to be the manufacture of industrial lights and magic. <br /> <br /> This film was one of the first to make your first free independent movie call ... those who do not have enough arts for the theater, and not enough of all the night's drive features. <Br> <br />
