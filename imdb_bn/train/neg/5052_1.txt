Rocky Fourth Heightsweight Championship Boxing as Platoon Vietnam War. In 1968, the story of Oliver Stone is so ridiculous that the experience of the US Army Platinum in Vietnam Most of the Platoon events or events took place in Vietnam for 10+ years of the involvement of US troops, to illustrate images that occur on a small group of men in such a short time frame (Week), war. In Platoon, Platoon men see the following: Within a week or two weeks, the US military killed civilians, American soldiers raped civilians, US Sergeant killed another US sergeant and killed a US sergeant sergeant in the United States. The soldiers were killed / injured in a friendly fire, 90% + platoon killed or injured. As an ideal experience for an American soldier in Vietnam, Stone is an insult to try to stop the film. Two Vietnam War Films I would suggest that we were soldiers (true story of the worst war for US soldiers in Vietnam) and a bright burning lie in HBO.
