The movie was a huge disappointment. Especially led by Priodaran, it was sad to see such neutral values. Poor screenplay (almost non-existence) and song sequence bad songs every minute and most of the time, the movie kills any humor. Some of the scenes were fun, but it's probably 5 minutes of the full time. The edit was gracious. Dark! The overall lack of the movie was as frustrating as it was very clear. Indeed, some people were waiting to see the second half of the movie after intercourse. <br /> <br /> If you do not see the movie, nobody will miss anything. This movie is not worth the cost of valuable tickets. Wait until it appears on TV ...
