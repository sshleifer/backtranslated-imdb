The real star of this ridiculous story is the glorious technicolor. Eye-visual treatment, the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart. First, I was curious to release religion to find "power" to love Dietrich and Boyer religion. Following is a huge disappointment. Boya was the only real actor and felt his pain. Dietrich's amazing dress outshines its performance - it is terrible to look at its appearance at times - an unfeeling mask. As a monk, Baira's mantra fluid (which reminds me of the true story of Charteridge) holds the formula - when she gave up her "marriage with God", the reaction by her classmates makes the organized religion permanent and permanent. Visitors believe that Boyer got rid of his past. However, following all of that journey is very expected.
