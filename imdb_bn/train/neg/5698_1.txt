I almost dive in Cheese watching this movie. Actually I could not finish it. I want my money back. Hollywood's poor attempts bring a new idea. The best thing is I keep a bowl of lemon in the refrigerator. Just in case. They should give a hat and a bull-whip to Nick Cage. Swashbucklin '. The performance of the cage in Arizona raising or leaving Las Vegas beats this "lemon". Those who are fully and fully marketed (and most of them) are also should love this movie. If this image is animated, I would have taken it more seriously. I would rather pay a whole stupid movie that does not try to hide it. In my opinion, this is an incredible stupid film and it has even made an incredibly tragic effort to try and conceal FACT. <br /> <br /> All Ship seems to love it.
