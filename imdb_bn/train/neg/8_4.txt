6/10 acting, not great but some good acting. <br /> <br /> 4/10 Directors make some foolish decisions for this movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10 Author, the story does not give any sense <br /> <br /> <br /> Total score for this image. <br /> <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time with this picture, it is not worth it. I gave 4 for this movie and it could be too much. Characters that can be ever in real life are so overagrated and some pretty unexplainable stuff "storywise", is not in the best way. Because of the style, the film has been disturbed after 30 minutes (many special effects: slow motion and camera reduction and fast forward). The movie uses music to smooth the story, but it is always good but there are many tracks in it. The first hour has around 50/50 dialogues and musics
