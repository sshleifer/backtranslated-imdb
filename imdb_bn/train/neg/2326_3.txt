Dr. Murdood is horrible. I would not recommend seeing any adult or children this if they are not already rampaging the killers. This is so dirty in this movie that it hurts me yes. When talking in the eyes, behind the stars in the sky, there are eyes. Only the devil could imagine himself such a wicked thing. I could make a copy from the local video store and crushed them with 5 pounds of cruciform. The film should be locked with the other hated animals of Hell while living in a room behind the 4th level. That's where this movie is. If I want you some scandalous entertainment then recommend, go and go to all dogs heaven, or rent Outfield Angels. Those movies are valuable to watch. If you want to sin and love horrible movies, you will see Dr. Murdood.
