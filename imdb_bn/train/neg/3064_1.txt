The original "Vananishing Point" was a great flick. The delicate purpose, the characters that feel real and spontaneous. The reunion was terrible. Promotion, too obvious; Missed the point as to why the original was a classic. The black charger was cooler, but even that could not recover this flick. Why stick with a white challenger? I do not think that was the best choice at '71. Some parts of the picture were ridiculously ridiculous. When Vigo was standing on the steep mountains of the canyon after its "Dream Quest". His Indian Paul was standing beside him. Vigo was wearing only her white briefs. I'm sorry - it looked silly - he's the Vista Survey in his fruit off-fruit. Another scene was over - after the explosive crash in the bulldozers - the announcer said that the impact was frequent in 180 miles per hour. Then he mentioned that the police said that his remains were not found because he was evaporated, but some people believed that he was hiding in the prison by friends. Then 180 miles away from the car! First of all, you could not open the car door 180 miles per hour. Secondly, the car does not have a straight line travel for 100 yds. With no one running it It will immediately roll over 30 times. Thirdly, if you hit the facility at 180 mph, you will make air in various squashy pieces. No matter, we see her last standing with her daughter. Above all, a movie that will insult somebody's intelligence.
