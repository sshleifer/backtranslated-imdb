Sentinel represents everything about Hollywood's soul-weakness and the lack of imaginative sadness in many movies today. I'm probably not able to think about a good thing about it, it's all generic, so the factory is built and so lazy to gather that how it really is to make money from obscure, unpredictable people is only as an informal. <br /> <br /> A plot about a secret service agent may well be a plot of plan to kill Prez. If managed by a good director or throwing care. Douglas is one of those who are made. The first lady of Basing, with whom she has a relationship (an adoption, an unresolved plot consciousness). Sutherland is the best Paul who believes in his guilt because he does not have any movie. And the langria is nothing. A woman with a fortune in a mainline ... and that. Guess there are less requirements for women when I enter secret services. As a naturally the role of a Prize in a film itself is nothing more than a tool, a token and very badly written. <br /> <br /> Clark Johnson, who gave us equally similar SWAT 2003, lacks any sign of mechanical direction and has a cheap TV-movie all visual sophistication. Douglas, Basing, and Switcherland are incredibly indifferent to their performance from the remote and phone-shows. The 21st century's most open woman, Eva Langriya, is basically only to attract the hated householders to the audience. His role is 100% vulnerable and he has absolutely nothing to add to the development of the plot or the character development. He has 2 lines to barely rub together. A real shameful marketing plan. <br /> <br /> If you are a glutton for punishment then do not let me stop. But time and money you will not get back.
