If you're a fan of really bad movies, and you think it's fun, you'll do Shake's superb role. Filing pro pro pro players sometimes works off first. Shake was seen as my worst actor, which I have ever seen beside Dennis Rodman, who made some bad films. Well this movie is bad because of violent kids. I give this a zero but that is impossible.
