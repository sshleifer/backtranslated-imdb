I mean, really ... I've lost my sense of humor suddenly or it's a really bad movie. It's stupid, ridiculous and just not funny. <br /> <br /> As I watched the preview, I knew it was not going to be a great movie, I do not think it would be bad. <br /> <br /> In which movie did you find interesting funny lines, what happened to the old times? Will not the humorous role play while trying to be funny? Now we can find myself in this movie, like Bobat, Little Men, and the horror movie 4 where I could not find the fun part !! <br /> <br /> Note (sorry for my english)
