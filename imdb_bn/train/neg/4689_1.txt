The real horror movie created by cinematographer-director-director-director Ted Tetzhalaf Extraordinary enough looking film but for a time bomb movie entirely without any pull. Ford, sleepwalks, as someone here, sleepwalks though this one with its characteristic reminder. Canadian former army or RAF, unarmed bomb in war, his wife is leaving him - some details have spread here - but none of these stories has added more. Bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to punch this shipment mine? For this matter, are we talking here? WWII or postwar ?? I am the next ritual which makes the bomber's purpose even more original. Generally, though, an awesome film. There are plenty of good time bomb flicks to spare this one. For a more exciting time about the same running time, see any episode of "Danger YXB".
