I'm not sure. I just can not laugh at it I had an open mind. I do not want to be a hard about it @ ss. But I can not seriously laugh in this picture. It was not just funny to me. Some parts like Ben Stiler and Jack Black tried it very hard. Just because you put together two very funny people does not mean that this is just going to be a wonderful comedy. Some movies should not just be done. This is one of them. Because it was very old joke and acting was just stupid. I know, I know it's a comedy. At least sort of. But I just was not impressed. I'm sorry, but I can not give anything less than these two. And that's all I'm providing. <br /> <br /> 2/10
