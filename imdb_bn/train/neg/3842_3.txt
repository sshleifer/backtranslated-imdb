Our teacher showed us this movie in the first grade. I have not seen it. I have seen the trailer though. Does this make you look like a first-grade movie? I do not think so. I was so scared by this movie, I could hardly see it. It mainly cut half the little girl with Sheryl McClane and then the boy was ketchup! I was freaked by this photo. Now 20 years old, I probably will not feel like this. I just wanted to share my experience and opinions that little kids could not see this movie, though it was PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to the kids. I did not even remember what it was, once was enough!
