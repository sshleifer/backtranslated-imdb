"Hey everyone! I got an idea, we have found these egg-shaped items from outer space, so why do not we dig it and do not open it?" "Yes, I know that a scientist can be the most dirty thing and it can be filled with contamination of unknown bacteria or viruses in the world and can eradicate potential humankind, but hey, I want to know it." "And no one else can do it, they can take it from us". "Wow this thing closes vibes!" "Yes, really strong people in touch do not touch it, but it's OK to open it." "Hi handsome, check out my nips". (After that day); "Opening" !!!!! Oh, our lab is going on everywhere and they will not be asked to open it because we do not have phone or radios or intercom but we have other tools of other Gaza dollars. "I have never seen such biological technology!" "Yes, lemme take this stick and stab it." "I'm going out of here, if I kill another 6 billion people in the world, no one will recognize me!" "Look, it's a friendly alien from" The Abyss ", they want us to come with them". The end
