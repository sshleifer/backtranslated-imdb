I saw this movie a few days ago ... what was it? <br /> <br /> I like movies with Brian O'Halouran, they are fun and enjoyable. When I saw a name of this title and style, I thought well, it could be really good ... Some parodies for slash or other movies ... But .. then I read a preview and think it might be good ... but it was not ... <br /> My opinion: If they look like a documentary, like a movie, some comedy may try some Moore's movies or alien autopsy, they are really About chu. This one was empty. <br /> <br /> and enter a comedy title ... no comments ... really bad joke
