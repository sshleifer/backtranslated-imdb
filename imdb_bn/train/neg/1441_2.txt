I put this film on the cover alone that I was for a courageous level of "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Duaam". Unfortunately I was for a virtual Javan. Although I did not have any yawn like before. This mess was so big that I could find something very rare in this movie. The cover describes the amazing special effects. There was no one. The film was so lightweight that stereotypes were widely portrayed. It gives you the idea that you can solve the problem of violence. Well if you want to teach your kids I do not Keep away from this one. If you are looking for family entertainment then you can find something more inspiring elsewhere.
