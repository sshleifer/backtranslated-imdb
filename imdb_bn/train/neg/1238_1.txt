This team Burton has reunited the original "Planet of the Apps" (and Charlton Haston) since 1968, largely crying out of quality and plot. <br /> <br /> Special effects were improved from 1968, but not written. The characters were annoying and the dialog was awful. I was sitting through the entire movie with a friend (who gratefully only hired) and before Christmas, why the "Apps Planet" toy targets were clearance bint. <br /> <br /> <br /> My suggestion to Team Burton: Do not keep your resume in it. <br /> <br /> My suggestion to everyone else: See the original 1968 "Planet of the apps" movie.
