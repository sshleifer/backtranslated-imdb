I would say that this was a little shameful for 'King of Cowboy'; Created in 1948, the film was first published after a decade of the first time in Roy Rogers, of which he had an acting role. Roy and Robert, instead of his integrity in Livingston, portrayed his bad colleague Bill Reagan, who, along with his co-star Jane Pharaji, described Ray's character as a bit weird. The whole story seems to be funny, which is an entertaining hour or so missed opportunity for that. For example, the legend of 'Hanumans Hotel', which says life on the night of hanging night comes at the end. With the keyboard bulffuncher-like actress Andy Divine, you think the story will get a little milestone from this setup. Instead, you have some intelligent work that would be served better if it was a boutique age. It was a frustrating hotel gimmick's tragic ending which relied on the weak old Genevieve, the truth was said to have been wound up more screen time than the trigger, which was contracted as the 'smartest horse in the movies', there is nothing to say about it upstaged by a mule. And then there are her riders of the purple rishi to replace your foil wing and Bob Nolan and Pioneers friends. I do not know about you, but the picture was already half and I was still looking for Pat Brady - oh well! <br /> <br /> If you see hard enough, there was an interesting element found here, and it is still the athletic isolation of Ryan of bad players. All right, maybe it was a stunt double, but I did not see it before a hundred westerners. <br /> <br /> <br /> Other films opposite the judgment in the 1947/1948 time frame. "Under the Stars of California", she named the cousin of Andy Divine, Caroline Bulfchincher. Although you are never convinced about where you will come to this story, since he pretends to be someone, he does not start and accidentally happens near the good person. <br /> <br /> Supporters of the old Laurel and Hardie films will be surprised, because I wanted to see James Finson as the saint's Sheriff. I liked to enjoy some less comedy written in his role, but he played straight straight after all. I was surprised, when it was over, why and old Vanderpool (Charles Coleman) were suffering from a mine with a cookie because there was no reason for it. It's a way to stop it, I suppose, almost as much thought left the picture. I hate to be that rigid, but if you saw enough Roy Rogers flicks of judgment, you should know that this was not his attempted effort. Say <br /> <br />, Syntone - If I find it bigger than Sina City?
