The performance of Gregory Pac was fantastic, as someone expected, and the film was astonishing at the time when playing the film in a very strong moment. However, the rest of the picture was very hard for me and hard to see. I tried to like it, but it had to move fast in the last 30 minutes or so. I feel well lost a couple of hours. If I did not have Gregory Pack, I would not last for fifteen minutes. 4/10.
