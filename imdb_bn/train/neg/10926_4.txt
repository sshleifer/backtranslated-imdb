Although the concept is executed as a basic, generally lacking compared to most Saifai films. Although the real mummy effects are not bad and the character of "song knots" is dependent on the above goggles, the only real draw is to see Marella Bakkirin and Adam Baldwin reconnect on a small screen. I suspect the idea was all along. They make good creatures with what they have done, but in the first 40 minutes I got "definitely to see", or when Morena's character plays some burial Ryder style shorts. I do not know the high torch movie but you can not deny the true beauty when you see it !!! And Adam Beldwin hammers it as a person who likes to hate it again. If you only want to see some of your favorite firewheel letters, there is a good time with some sub-elemental elements but it might be for you. If you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere.
