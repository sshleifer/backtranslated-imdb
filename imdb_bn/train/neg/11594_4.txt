Like Freddy's revenge, this signal takes a pretty strange idea and it does not go long to shrink a story. Originally Alice is pregnant with number 4 and her son Freddy hates him, which gives him an outlet to hunt his friends. This whole series has at least the death and the wise-cracks are poor, so the horror fans or comedy fans are also happy. <br /> <br /> I have nothing to say about this. It is moderately striking to return from Alice and Dan's four letters, but is not eligible to watch a movie. Uninspriring and unexpected, probably only stores it from the worst of a series of competitive aspects.
