From outer space, the gaengeses are quite compressed by his name. It's only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of the world's black glasses for the release of black men. Although I see a little significance for the plot, it is also really irrational. Guessed, it meant to be a comedy / spoof on society and science fiction. I saw myself laughing several times, so it is successful there. <br /> <br /> Special effects are awesome. When the spacecraft is floating around the Earth, you can zoom in stars for some reason. The asteroids shown at the beginning shows fake, the ship's equipment is irrational, there are several misspellings in the textbooks, the actors are disrespectful, the letters are upgraded; In general, do not take the whole thing seriously. If you exceed all aspects that make it a bad movie, it's very accessible and easy to see at the end. Some parts are lovely. But overall, the only ridiculous idea to remember what you remember. It is not a bad thing to watch it in a small film and some interesting aspects. . But it holds its irrational and little long-term value. I really can not recommend it; You watch it, unique idea, so do not value it.
