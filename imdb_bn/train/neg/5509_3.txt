When I was a kid associated with Disney of the 50's and 60's was great by definition. what happened? They are any actress and actress they are able to get their best time. But in no way Disney leads to screw things in spite of their huge resources. <br /> <br /> Disney can afford the best authors, best producers and directors, but still ... they break things down! This movie is shit. Sadly, Disney disagrees with their pride that no movie is good or bad. <br /> <br /> This is the genius of actors only because I can give it a 3. 10.
