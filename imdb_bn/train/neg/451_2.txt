I did not care how much nomination this junk got best and for this, stunk this movie. Whether to stop the set of mistakes for my mental health, or O.J. I do not know that the suit was not filed with the attorney. I have rarely been disturbed this; To call this fungus entertainment, we are facing every movie gear in the world. The whole story was stupid, the acting was unclear, the 'drama' was unheard of. I'm grateful I do not have to pay for this unfulfilling experience.
