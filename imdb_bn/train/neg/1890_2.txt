The problem I get with this title is that I'm not sure whether the director is trying to make a documentary or movie. A blend of two styles does not work and leaves the whole thing moving in the middle of anywhere. As a director, what is happening around our daily life is most up-to-date, it creates even more extraordinary documentaries. If it is meant to be a thriller, then it is very dust and monotonous. In any case, what moral or message is trying to reach the audience to the audience? Are there people around us who are bad for others who want to be mistreated? There are many crazy around us? So .......... So what?
