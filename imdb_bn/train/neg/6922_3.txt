A sheet and newspaper campaign has proposed a lot of lilid and violent pieces (often done by them) rather than on the drive-screens. Claude Brooke is the Americanization of Claudio Brooke, who has worked in films for years. This one is hard to find anymore; I want to see it again to compare it to the second international horror of the day, but do not remember when specifically affected. Chances are it's a cut-up version that made it the US Theater and Video. But oh, one sheet ... still a jewel of my next horror collection.
