Russian-Russian scientist said that two-thirds of the film's path, "I've come to science." I saw this movie in most of this - half-hamerhead shark is definitely a neutral aspiring scientist who is capable of a serious experimental test. Or, they conquer, say my girlfriend brother was remote and the rest of history. Special effects were bad to say a misconduct on the special effects field. This was not difficult in 2005 to film a car without a Chess bluescreen background. Yes, when this interesting and state-of-the art industry was filming the hit "The Birds", it showed only a low budget in 2005. Make clear to me the spell-off of Sci-Fi and let me try an effort in the deliberate suspension of disbelief. However, denying the overall idea of ​​this film seriously, tell me again, that as sadness it may sound, probably your time value. If there is nothing else, then it is a tour of bad sai d.

Crazy Rabbit of a Hamerhead Transceiver Crazy scientist who thinks that it is a good idea to have a good idea of ​​blood spoon in near water, not only me but also the question of "B" film writers. <br /> <br /> This picture fills most of my long movie reviews - bad guys always wear sunglasses. <br /> <br /> If this is not 2005, I really want this film to be a somewhat metaphorical fairy tale for rock warfare. I mean, you might even have to put a hole in Chekhov's ear and eat a Klingon Bird of Prey Bridge. <br /> <br /> <br /> The appearance of Charlton Heston, "Wait for Tom" as he is trying to lift the helicopter to escape from the ground. The thing is that, with Tom's bad glass clips, Kalnichov, or AK-47, bad sunglasses are spoiling the condition of the people in the United States. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "My goal is to develop human species" - enough to say that this film is only contributing to the evolution of mankind. Has kept Furious Fredenian references by crazy scientist are a common reminder for the promotion of a female hero to join Hammerhead Shark, which, in general science fiction, we all find something to laugh at.
