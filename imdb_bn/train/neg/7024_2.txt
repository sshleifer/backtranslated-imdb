I lent this movie because the idea of ​​playing a role, rather than just his gay theme, really made me curious. I was satisfied that I was close to the SF since shooting in San Francisco. And of course Castro district shots were nice to look at (although the catroo shows me more male men than men). But other than that I can not really recommend this movie. Characters did not really improve for my care, and eventually I got disturbed by my mind when they started to "play the role". And the role I played was a little embarrassing to see the role. Some pages of acting are preferred. I do not end up in the movie saying. I want to skip this one.
