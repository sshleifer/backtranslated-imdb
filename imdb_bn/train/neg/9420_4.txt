The image of "Cleopatra Jones" is much better than that of 1973, black star actress Tamara Dabson plays her signature role as a chic, super-hard drug addict agent for hosting heroin rings in Hong Kong. Blackploison Action-Flick and Kung-Fu-Movie Cross-pollination are fun at the beginning but eventually the flag.

Stella Steven played Villains this time; She is good, but does not match Shell Winters in the predecessor. ** **** to
