"The Leap Years" is an adaptation of Singaporean writer Katharine Lim, an e-novel adaptation, the first Singaporean novel / novel to sell on the Internet. The shot was released in early 2005, it was released at the end of 2005, but it was launched on February 29, 2008, just 3 years after the end of a leap year. Before I say something, I must admit that I am not a romance genre fan, so I can be a bit favorable against this movie - I have seen it only in Singapore due to its production and it is available for loans in my neighborhood library. . Here I have two cents in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start by saying that everyone except the Q-UW KS and Oong Li-Lin, looks like a note here. The love interest is a Eurasian (Joy Everingham), and all three of Wong's friends, er-hem, Eurasian. Does this film make sure that the preyotype that falls in love with and is linked to the Eurasians is more "in" than the ordinary Chinese (or any Asian nation?), I do not know, certainly it seems that way. Also, each of the movies speaks of some mysterious "searched", which certainly does not exist anywhere, of course not in Singapore. This is "semi-perfect english" which the authorities would like to talk to us, but it does not exist anywhere outside of the MTV channel. The effect is that the film's dialogue does not help with the lack of true blue Singapore in compulsory and determined, imagination. <br /> <br /> The script writer seems to be trying very hard to make a linear string afterwards. One-liners, one. Twenty minutes later, the film's "Buddha" Paul begins and the film begins to serve its normal plates. <br /> <br /> I think I did not enjoy the movie because the absolute basis of maintaining love relationships for 16 years seems incredible. <br /> <br /> There are other greats in this picture. I can not believe for one that KS (played by Qi Yu-wu) was for Wang's one of the friends. And the scene where the groom says, "Go, before I change my mind", television serial in one hundred East Asia (Korea, Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan etc.) has been used ... <br /> <br /> So this photo For 4 stars. The production value is fair, and Wong Li-lin tries its best, but she is not helped by the script. The 15-minute bit-part of Joan Chan's film is as the old Wang and probably the best actress, but, hey, his role is just common. If you are renting "Leap year" or library, you might want to pop it due to curiosity in the DVD player, otherwise you will miss it for those who do not enjoy the romance style. You can decide whether to do it.
