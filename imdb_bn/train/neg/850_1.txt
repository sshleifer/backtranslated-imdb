This will be the most stupid film I have ever seen (spoilers forward)! First of all, the plot is stupid. Little boy is weird and they go to the hotel because his father is his caretaker. We have a gift to the child, "shining". This gift sometimes has something with nothing to do without the kid cooling down. Eventually the movie gets more annoying and annoying until people become crazy. He is a rape victim to kill the kid and his wife because ... well, she feels it. Why would he do it? Suddenly we see a naked woman in the tub. The man kissed him and realized that he was kissing a dead body, which is absolutely hateful. Somehow a black man enters the hotel and is stuck with the ax. Then the child and the woman take the black people and leave the father, who died in Hypothermia minutes. Most movies are not the complete waste of time, but it falls in that section correctly. The music is broken, characters are authentic (in addition to Jack Nicholson, who is a good actor), the plot explodes and fits the inverted description, the last is very predictable, the story is slow, tedious and annoying. This movie is highly overrated. Enjoy this movie in all movies. I'm surprised it has got so high ratings in IMDB.
