I love science fiction, I am fascinated by the Egyptian mythology and I appreciate the digital animation. I've figured out these three concerts in a movie will be least enjoyable. I could not have been more wrong: the story (or actually there was a lack of it) was completely unclear and lacking imagination - the imagination is usually the biggest element in the story of a science fiction. Dialogue and acting is even worse than an average porn movie even Especially, Thomas Creschmann termed 'bad performance' as a new meaning. Bad acting did not have such a big problem, but 'director' Bilal did not take yourself so seriously; Like all the lines, they are supposed to be a poet, it seems Billila really thinks he has made a part of the art here. Well, there is no art or poem found in this part of the jungle, just hypocrisy! This guy should really have to make a comic, because he failed in all possible accounts as a director. The worst is the most horrific digital animation, which is so ugly that it is actually looking at this film physically painful experience. Graphics are so fake that they look at Van Helsing's Verubovs as live actors! And since half the letters are CGI-animated, this is a problem that CGI-influences are so fake. If the Egyptians actually exist, then Bilal's dead man, as he portrays in this helplessly bad movie, will ridicule him for a terrible retaliation.
