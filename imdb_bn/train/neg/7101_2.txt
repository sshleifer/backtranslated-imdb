I would have given this picture a zero in ten, but I would give it a couple. The reason that Shahrukh Khan is seen in the film, which is not really a reason. The last thing is that the Queen appeared in this film and a smile with Kamal I love the Queen a lot and she has a great actress that has the respect. I did not enjoy why I kissed Kamal, but there is no big deal for him. However, this film is enough to make bedroom scenes visible, actually speaking about this movie. It's good or bad, I think it's a completely trash movie that makes me java. I'm a great critic, you can see my other 250+ review by clicking on my name, I have a great taste. The movie is not entertaining, it's a matter, and if this movie seems to be a big hit, then why does this movie have no morale? It's a pretentious movie that is not a true story and it stinks. Kamal, this actress makes me sick by watching kissing, how people can not kiss.
