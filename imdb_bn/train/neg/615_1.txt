I would say, I usually like the scary movie that I have never seen ... however, it was kind to my cow's taste. I used gory, gut wrenching kind ... but this particular movie was lame. Acting was terrible (still a rogue (no pun intended) one-liners was clever). And its seagull, Scherco Slayer was even worse! Yes, perhaps, when it came first, there was a huge gap between it and people liked it. But when movies such as The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose are released, such films, like Scarcro movies, seem like kids. If you want to pass the movie only for a time, choose it! Special effects are fatted as hex. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can see where it comes. This will remind you of the "Chicken Boy" movie. Independent movie rock. Most of the time. So if you are afraid of killing people with Kokakov, or 2 fears in the seagulls, these movies will be for you.
