I'm easily entertained. I enjoyed "Hot Shots" and "The Naked Song" and most of them were seagulls, even when most people thought they were helpless. I've even managed to enjoy the most Pauly Shore movie. I have seen that there is only one movie that I can honestly say was bad ... and it was. I've been watching this for a while, but sitting in the theater, I think, "It's a movie movie, why did I see it?" It's just the only movie I can not recommend.
