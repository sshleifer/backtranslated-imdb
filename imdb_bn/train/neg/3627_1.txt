I do not have much for classic films. Cats like Patan, Going My Way, Haun Greene My Valley, The Godfather, Casablanca, Anne Hall, Win Win, Lawrence of Arabic, and Citizen Kane are like me. Anyway, I'll watch a movie about 3,469 times, when one of the Parisians viewed it as the most luxurious suite in the chairs. If I did the next, I could probably sleep all the time. <br /> <br /> Color direction and music did not interest me, Garshwin or non-Garcin. Dancing and singing can get to sleep. There is no rain in the dialogue 'rain Basically, this movie is boring. The only movie I ever slept while watching was the Boycott Cassidy and Sundance Kid. But you can not blame me. I just slept in just 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> 1 star / 10 (Very bad we can not give zero.)
