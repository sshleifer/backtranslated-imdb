I'm stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has. Friends would not say that the best 'sitcom' is not as great as others did. Who knows if Courtney Cox Arquette, David Schweimer, Matthew Perry, Lisa Cudro, Jennifer Anthon and Matt Le Blanc do not face it for the cast, then who knows whether the program will last until it stays? I am very doubtful that. Although the series was like progress, the friends became more progressive, hairy and annoying, that I could not care less about characters - among which the most rowdy in TV history - or their sufferings, or sleeping with someone. And sometimes the first four seasons from the fun went from being fun. Even so, even after all these listed Hollywood actors, I was not even bothered for protection. The text of friends became obscure that I had lost interest in this show from the 6th season and lasted for the last, it is not at least saying that. <br /> <br /> What was annoying, though it continued for ten seasons, although some of my favorite shows continued for only three seasons and finally it was canceled and the wind stopped for good. The program was supposed to be closed immediately if the program wanted big salaries. Indeed, the series was as frustrating, it was the show that was bigger than the actors, but not the other. <br /> <br /> When it ended in 2004, I was very relieved to see behind this sitcom. Now, the talk of a friend reunion show coming to our TV screen soon. And yet, I'm not waiting for it for one.
