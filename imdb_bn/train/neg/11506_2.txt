The story of this film is quite bad, which can happen in real life. I do not understand when they show me this bad movie. I have some reasons because it was bad. 1. If Madonna is rich and she can do whatever she wants, why does she love those bad people? 2. How is the story script so weak? He is so rich, he can do whatever he wants, but it is very impossible that his husband could not dare to divorce. <br /> <br /> The words that I love you do not mean anything in this movie.
