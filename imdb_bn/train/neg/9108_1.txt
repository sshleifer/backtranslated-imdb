This so-called Prikel is made in a bad version only with a good version of Dangerous Liasons. Plot is identical as most scripts. I closed the book, and I liked the first movie, but I will not be disturbed in the third movie. Among the two main characters of the prick, the uninterrupted banner was completely anticipated and a pair, and ... I just could not put how bad the movie was. If you do not want to take my word for it, just watch it and you'll see what you mean. If you read a review that says 'If you like the first one you will love the second' because the only reason that it is the same movie! Although the plot is not even good. They took a lot of lines from the first film, it is difficult to know which of the difficult movies you are watching.
