Unless you are a student of Green Film, who wants to see everything, this film is a waste of your time and money and not a big disappointment, but it will also make you angry outside of belief. Tell a story to say somewhere inside, but Hopkins decided to conceal it and decided to encode under randomly unheard of unhealthy layers of random audio video microcots, which would make viewers' patience become thinner after a very short period of time. <br /> <br /> Why? Like Hopkins, someone will choose the heaviest, the most difficult and highly volatile project, like the first script, the first score and the third movie, by any assumption. Maybe he had played in his mind for so long until it became, not as soon as it was, even for himself. As a result, it proves that he does not have enough experience or skills to achieve the expected results. <br /> <br /> There was also 90% more consent to name names of even strangers, even the strangers and luncheon films, even two unknown filmmakers, 95% fewer characters and 99% more storyflow. <br /> <br /> You have noticed the elder Anthony, but unfortunately missed some light years. Please keep acting, you are an infinite monster in that section and nobody can ask you anything else, even yourself!
