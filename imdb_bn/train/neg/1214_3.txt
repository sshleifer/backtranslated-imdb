A friend once asked me to read a screen that was liked by a movie studio. To say I wanted to read it was one of the most inactive and insipid scripts was a brave understatement. But I never said to him. Why? Since such a world where movies such as "Washing Out Out" can be green, and attracting Oscar-winning star like Kim Basing, a screenplay lacking character, content and general sense does not guarantee that it will not sell it. <<br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> < br /> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br / > <br/> Every glut is valid from poor dialogue and bad acting from the logic jaw dropping, but Basing is such an interesting actress and promise is not promising. Here are some things that hit me: <br /> <br /> 1) I do not think how much we think his husband is having a quarrel, the house is a problem with the toy. Since children have been victimized for child abuse after selecting them? <br /> <br /> 2) Apart from Hollywood, different gangs are rare, where they are usually the only nationally balanced group on screen. <br /> <br /> 3) The picture is stupid. But I am sitting in the countless "thrillers" where women are portrayed as helpless, helpless predators of women's misery. Fool or not, I saw a woman refreshing to see her painful best girl. <br /> <br /> 4) Finally I love! <br /> <br /> 5) Although a previous reviewer made this phrase, I really believe this movie should be reconsidered "DoD's Red Toolbox".
