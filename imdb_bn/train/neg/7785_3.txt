I do not know it's a silent movie. I'm not taking care of silent movies - gentle humor, stirring and movies etc. I'm sure the low score features I've set it to. I did not see any interest in this story and was popped to me before it was like chapter 8, I cast it on the screen. Maybe this Cognition Feed Appeal? A thing missing was a zombie scene and a brain replacement. I took two people on Friday night and there were 6 people in the whole theater. Isabella Rossellini describes this film - a delightful aspect of the film. No one commented on how much it enjoyed to enjoy it and praised the unusual method to tell this story. I can not recommend this movie.
