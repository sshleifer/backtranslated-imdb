Fans of animal feature films will have to endure a lot of horror movies recently. Blood Sage shamefully disciplines food bark barking bark bark barking bark Crocodiles were particularly successful because we had already struggled on our way through the crazy 'crocodile' (driven by depressing Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is each bit as bad as these other films ?? Above that ?? It likes to make too much exaggeration. The saline-crocodile feels 90 years old, 30 feet long (!) And kills it for fun! During this movie, he amuses himself by consuming a bunch of stupid surfer-dudes and dudettes that came to search the new thrills through surfing in the shark-collector area. The only beautiful aspect of this picture is the tropical position. Although it is completely inappropriate settings for such a movie, but the legend and nature looks extraordinary. Each other direction is simply crushing. Although quite a bit of Gore, it seems all fake and ridiculous. Painful to hear the conversation! You do not believe these actors have some lines! I'm supposed to be a mentally resort group of surfers but I hope for their own request that they are not stupid! At the beginning of the film, one of the characters is referred to as 'mechanical toy' but at least 10 times less than the white white shark of Spirinberg. The visual effects of 'Blood Surf' failed to influence amateur and genocide. I will not say too much about acting because it is secondary to such flicks. Girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs are delightfully moving away from the animal when bounce. You have a right guess: Blood surf is a very bad movie. So bad it gets fun again. But 'funny' for any other reason than James Hicks
