I see many people who love this movie. To me it was a movie entitled 101, and the person failed in class. The film was very much expected from the end of the video graphera, from Lindsay Price. I'm looking to see it going somewhere. <br /> <br /> First we have a widow. Clive # 1 Movie / TV Always Kill Parents, if the boy is a girl, or a child, then the single father can scream his dead wife and come out completely from her material to take care of her child. From my 3 people, 2 1/2 father. These movies are usually dramas and comedy TV shows. <br /> <br /> Clich # 2 When a pushing girl holds a video camera in her hand, she plays a big part in the movie. And always have the solution, or if the person is the arm of the aircraft, then <br /> <br /> Clich # 3 If the person with the ill person is foreign, then he has to be Latino. And they will be illegal. There are apparently no valid Latino and illegal European citizens, if no IRA material is involved. <br /> <br /> Cliche # 4 says that Latino must be highly educated in his country. In this case he was a professor who earned 200 rupees per month. And said that highly educated latino now does not work on his head as a brain and the wind leaps to the side of the head. <br /> <br /> Clich # 5 The crime is not really criminal. Crime but an accident. But in this case, when he crossed the border force there, he had lost his sense of humor, and now he has kept his own daughter in danger by taking him to the border with vain inquiries. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> No one tried to run for a crime, but some poor little kids That is why children's parents are forced to play a large part of the movie, and the person who accidentally kills the child can make a laughable contact with the parents. <br /> <br /> Give me the name of the movie # 7, which is not a police vet in a police cinema and they meet with a ruku. Even if they are detective killers, then the police will be the most experienced police. Sev7n and copy cats and laws and orders come directly to mind. And the outer inner garre has the heart of gold though vet <br /> <br /> # 8 Go and go to some unemployed Soya Star. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Hassel is unable to get out of the IMO papers and when she was on the live line line as a Marti, she went from left to right to open her mouth. It used to get me sick in the sea. He may now like the land, but he still can not work. <br /> <br /> The film can be more insightful if it does not meet the clich√©s. I do not think that the movie can be expensive and requires the brain to be good. But it was just bad. <br /> <br /> *** Spinner **** Now I'm not going to waste till the end. Oh hack I will do because I think it's humanity that will allow a person to spend time, they will not come back to this movie. This includes Cliche # 6 and # 7. No one has ever seen a movie before you see what's coming. The father even eventually made a fig tree mistake from the police and fired the scary gentleman, who suddenly got very upset. You thought that the poor man was innocent by the movie and he accidentally shot him. When he does not Now that little girl was brought with her for the little girl. Guess what will happen to him? Times up, he ended up living with the family whose family was killed by !! Come on! He is the replacement child because you all know that's going to happen !! That's why he did not go with Lindi Price Career. <br /> <br /> This movie was insulted as much as I was concerned about. Because the film could find so many ways and went down, but it decided to slap a clinch. Two big stars, two little girls, I was very good and Lindsay Price was the character of the boring, but she did what she could do with her. My suggestion is to take a vice and peek your head with instead of looking at this drip
