I'm glad some people like this, but I hate this picture. It was a very good idea for a story line, but where it ended. It was badly written, worked badly and was badly created. It had some interesting plot points, but they were dropped very quickly, the authors should understand what to put and extend in these bits, why they were kidnapped, and false drops. Instead, "what's up?", They tell you after 5 seconds. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about this movie, and I have stayed from the beginning. I just wanted to finish it. <br /> <br /> If you want to suspect or twists that were ultimately guessed, go and hire bad guys or keep up with the best ideas.
