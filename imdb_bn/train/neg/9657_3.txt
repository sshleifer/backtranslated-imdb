1) I'm not an expert on arms, but I can still see the difference between US Army soldiers between WWI and WWII. In the film we can see armed people with "M1Garand" (discovered in 1932!), It is not "1903 Springfield" (Urdu "silent death"), which makes use of it private until WWII. Difference - M1 loads can load 1.5 times more ammunition and can load up to 3 times the fire rate! M1 was semi-automatic, Springfield needs to be reloaded after every shot. A little difference?! 2) The German army borrowed from the 1940s also. Especially - helmets. At the end of WWI there are notable picks at the top of German helmets, we do not even see one in the film. And if we search a little extra in archives - how true is this "true story"? I wonder, how much a movie director can look for in the "real" cheap promotion.
