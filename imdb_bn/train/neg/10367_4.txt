This movie was poorly written, bad acting and very expected. It was a very low budget and I did not understand why it was not released and went straight to the video. Even the camps were not fun, it was a complete disaster and I hope to get back 1-1 / 2 hours! The colors were scary, with a big hole in it, allowing you to run a Mac truck through them. <br /> <br /> <br /> This plot itself was acting like a girl that she was not physically capable - what expanded! Leave this movie and see something good in horror scenes. Just think about any movie that is better than it. <br /> <br /> ejames6342
