This movie was so bad, I could not believe I was seeing it. Instructions, edits, production, and scripts seem to be all-inclusive though they do not know so much about filmmakers who have been done by junior high school students. No sense flow was made in any kind of sense. Large emotional moments and climaxes (initially between Bath and Las Vegas, Naomi Watts) and character relationships (such as the early indication) do not come completely from anywhere and are not set up to make it happier. And effectively create the film. The letters are sadly adopted, which makes it difficult for us to establish a connection with them. Acting, surprisingly, not completely bad, but the terrible writing canceled out of relatively credible acting. The film plays particularly like Bad TV Western / Epic, and sadly it reduces an impressive (true) story that it tries to say. I've read many reviews that make this issue as important for Australia. It's all very good, but only because Naked Kelly is an important Australian historical icon because the movie does not look good. Nobody is saying that the issue is not good, just the quality of the film. Pearl Harbor was an important historical event for Americans, but this does not mean that I'm going to protect the film and say it was good because it was still bad. A failure around, though Heath and Orlando are beautiful to look at.
