Note to all the indicators: Long is not necessarily good. This movie is incredibly long. But not good. The scenes were way too far out of the way, way, way, way, way out. Sex scenes were unnecessary, and often very long. The film was edited for 2 hours and 10 minutes or it could be exceptional, but it became so annoying that I could only give it 2 to 10. It is less than the average. <br /> <br /> Some other problems also exist in this marathon. <br /> <br /> 1) Ralph Fianes plays a complete family tree. The grandfather does not see anything like the grandfather who played, but grandfather, father and son (who gradually gives us unexpected voices) are all with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality Ralph Fiennes Nobody thinks that each of these children looks like a clone of the last, even though each photo of them is turned around. This is a minor, but it would not have been so annoying if the film was not 3 weeks long. <br /> <br /> 2) No news in Germany was crying even for the longest time. The Jews are spellbound and sent off to be ridiculous. Some words might have gotten them and probably the thought of trying to run probably has been discussed. The uncle of France certainly sent the warning carefully to try. <br /> <br /> 3) Love stories in this movie are completely wrong. You are always spending the time talking about this thing and the development of the relationship between the main characters is very minimal. Suddenly ... people love and almost unmarried ... married. Then there are children. Then we forgot about drawing things for 6 centuries and developing relationships. It did not get so stuck in the 2 hour movie again, but with time we did not give anything. <br /> <br /> 4) The last one was bad. I do not want to hide it for somebody, but you do not like it ... unless you are unhappy. <br /> <br /> The director / writer should be tortured to see this bloated garbage. On a weekly basis, I mean endless loop, oh they're the same thing. I think Robert Redford has done anything for this movie, that means I think Istanbul Szabo will then be modeling his carrier career. The long drawn film that completely destroys any substance in the film. 'Horse Whisperer', and Sunshine Overview. <br /> <br /> Sunshine, the perfect title. If you see the sun shining, it may probably go away after dark.
