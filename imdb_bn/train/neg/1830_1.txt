This is the worst movie I ever seen. I'm not kidding The next time it comes, I will always run into a wall of my head. I have to be more enjoyable to sit in a compromise room about why my brain is rash than trying to make it through my movie again. <br /> <br /> I hope Black and Steven will not work together. A project again this is bad. They both were good comedians, so I was shocked at this strange. <br /> <br /> If they do it again, I will make sure that they decide not to do it. The folks that fronted the money, a ton will be lost. Not really - because the special effects (all 2 of them) were terrible.
