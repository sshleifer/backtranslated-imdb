In contrast to most comments about "Syriya" in the IMDB website, I and my family saw this movie ruining the entire waste of time and space in the home DVD. <br /> <br /> The movie was based on a script whose author was far clever. Instead of telling a complicated story in an intelligent and clear way, it was assumed that the audience threw a great and clear view of the 30-second storyline with a dozen or so "story-lines" to engage each other with great and clear views Made for No, sir, it's not. What can be done for a great philosophy is that of total transparency, precision, plots and storylines - and characters - which are a start, middle and end. This is <br /> <br /> Egg-rich experience of a Chinese restaurant like this - such as Film Presentation - Extremist and Extremist. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the silent TV and DVD presentations of the British film of 1940 and 1950, whose authors, directors, and actors knew the meaning of saying, storytelling, and acting clearly. <br /> <br /> This is a DVD that will not be sitting through this family again.
