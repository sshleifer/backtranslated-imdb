How can 16 of the 4 voters give this picture 10? How can more than half of the voters give it 7 or more? Who is voting here? I can only guess kids initially - very young kids The fact is that in this way a bad movie. The story is stupid; Acting is hard to think even acting; Characters are characterless; And the dialogue is terrible. I saw this in a rainy afternoon on the sci-fi channel. The tragic incident is that it is rebel again, I recommend you instead read a book.
