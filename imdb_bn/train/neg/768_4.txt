I agree with most of the Colombo fans that this film was an unnecessary change in the format. Columbo is a unique police with overwhelming police approach. This movie looks like a restoration of some of the other common detective dramas from the past. And that boring point, because Colombo is not a common detective. <br /> <br /> This picture has two parts that made me compelling. First of all, I do not understand the title of this movie. It's confusing. Perhaps a good title is "Vanishing Bride" or something similar. Secondly, the Columbo submits the reason (at least to the witnesses) why they hide a part of the evidence without proving them. <br /> <br /> I do not betray, just frustrated. I'm glad Peter Falk went back to normal Colombo. <br /> <br />
