I picked this DVD at Dollar Store. The DVD was 2 for the $ 1 rack, but it was Michael Madison, I thought I never saw this movie, so I bought it. <br /> <br /> I must say that I did not. T like the movie. The film played more like a documentary or advertisement for religion than any other. I have seen that the use of the Director's flashbacks did not add a storyline for me. <br /> <br /> I will not throw it like another commenter, but it may be a while before I consider seeing this movie. Who knows, since it was the first debut of Michael Madison's film, perhaps in the future it might have some archives worth it.
