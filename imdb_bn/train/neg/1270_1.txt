In general, a well-known 'hero' we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story does not work, and I did not feel like Agatha's mistake. Cast is not good, actors create too much harmful and stupid gestures, clothing is so clear and clear that everything (even Arab clothes) is fake and for serious audiences, who think this movie is double, the mystery drama can be seen as a comedy instead. Playing Hercules Puerto is an excellent act of the actors but nothing fantastic. In the scene, said before, looking for the perfect and fake. The mystery of murder, though the story is not funny, but 45+ women in the Iraqi desert know who a cruel and naughty boy is about to die? 'Hunting' is not preferred.
