No one has read the script. This year will be some of the worst writing and directions. Three great actors, Paul Jemati, Rachel Weisz, and Miranda Richardson could not pull this one. Nearly two-thirds of the gamatti eyes say, I can not believe I signed the agreement. It's the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's really really bad Christmas movie list. Not enough lines, but what can be said? All right, the movie can not move with Von's con man manipulation, his character is simply a vague person, which you can not get past. It just seems to be an incredible walk, anyone who is able to get one.
