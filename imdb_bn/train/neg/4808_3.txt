This movie has started because this religion of this lazy Wales led to a frustrating role (they could not achieve a person who saw and acted more like a satanist) was not involved in this film. But since, Coventry receives a new member and stabs a doll that is similar to someone and has a Miscarage of it. The woman who was pregnant and her husband moved to a place called Lilith, and the woman warned her to see pictures of her sister or to call her and warn her to stay away from her and warn her not to use her power. There he will die. After sitting in a strange city, the couple discovered that all the residents are making fools and she fears her neighbors and friends and fears. Then the strange thing began to happen, since the lady discovered a funeral on such a hill that suddenly saw turmoil (which was unclear) as well as seeing the little boy in Ososon Wells in the Plegroude, asked the boy that he was helping to get him back. Life. The lady tries to escape from the city soon enough, but only to find herself by her inhabitants and power and to ignore the soul that tries to warn her. This film is OK, it has a sensation moment, but it actually did a lot better than Osson.
