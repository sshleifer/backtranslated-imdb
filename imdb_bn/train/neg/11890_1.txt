For the first time I saw the movie cover and the expanded photography, I thought this guy, this friend of 'Squares' would be like 6 feet or 6 feet 2in. <br /> <br /> Not 5 feet long. No, it's his fault. <br /> <br /> In any rating, I have started a cool night movie in Tuxson, deck with the best cigar on the second story and roll it out. At that time my wife was an affair and some mountains were going down for me, so I needed a good diversion. But, like the movie was bad ... I also enjoyed it with a mortar bottle, I can admit. <br /> <br /> True, I have seen this movie many times. It always makes me feel better !! It is not that it 'tried very hard' to cool or 'so close' to mark it for an action film. This is awesome. And then really stupid. Then again terrible. It is best to be the best when it comes to a slow-motion scene. How nice!! I did not feel safe in my life. Warm and very happy I was saved in gasoline due to low production in the summer month ... Anyone <br /> <br /> <br /> This instruction was not 'unknown', and there was a need for dancers and continuation of the war, or again the dancer and Firm up, the word was off, did not hit you, it's just going, another way. The 'locals' of that village were rather out of town 'off cou', which do not seem to follow very well, even looking at camera lenses. Some things like a deer of head lights smile, laugh and laugh. <br /> <br /> I feel bad because 'Colombo' I have a good heart and caring attitude for the people of my country as well as our people. <br /> <br /> "Butter Island" is very neutral and incredible. Even still I like it a lot. I hate it now X-wife, but I love it! The funny thing is, when I like movies or even 'love' I still am quite discriminatory. After all, I like Franco. So it's there. <br /> <br /> <br /> If you like to be genuinely kicked in a few hours with the addition of this movie, then directly select Video-B movies or 'Bad' movies for collection of your video library, if You can find it, 'The Big Sweet' (1991), with Robert Jarra you know the big guy from 'Tongo and Cash'. 'The Big Suite', a bombshell with a real plot plot and so long acting, it can be 'crutches' and at the end of the 'Big Suit' I think they went out of the money because they had a picture of Cast and it was Let the fire be set and it will burn during the credit. -Good fun <br /> <br /> But all are not as good as Barretta Island, it's '1' and the overall rating is 'Awful' for horror-like B movies. I'm waiting for a sikel, maybe 'Revenge of Bertaa in Montgomam' (Franco Mexican took leave and then got sick in water, declares war with water) or 'Battle powder war' where he will be defeated, is a big drug lord in his country and chemically gene -Bugger and a hybrid super bug (insect) that will be reproduced and thrown into the cocaine fields and which one is eaten It will send it through Bay and Bug, it is a chemical reaction which becomes sugar coconut to crushed sugar. Then another series he will have to rescue young people from the addiction of excess sugar, and so on. He can authorize a major tooth paste company and partly get projects funding with product placement in partly on the project. Right? (*)
