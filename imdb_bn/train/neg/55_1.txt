Just two movies I give 1/10, this is stinker and "man who foamed the world." In the early 80's, when I was in high school, I think the protocol looks at a theater. The script is insulting someone (including a high school student) with intelligence. Anyone getting it shot into my butt completely lost with "mountainous" jokes. Goldie Haone is supposed to be charming but comes across as vapid and moronic. Then there is an objectionable stereotype about the Arabs, then Goldy wins over everyone drowning in the public. Acting was terrible, along with golf haun. I will not be able to see another movie until I released him. Everyone says I love you If you do not want to make any effort to write the playplay, this is a movie made for you. Worst
