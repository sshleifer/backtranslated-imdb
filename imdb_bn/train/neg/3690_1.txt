Dad - Rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life. This movie caused him to fall. It is released with great popularity but is badly crashed, and its producers and distributors suffer serious financial losses. Rajinikanth had to pay compensation for his personal losses. Shortly after his release, he tried to join politics but unfortunately failed. It's a very bad movie with terrible acting, bad quality makeup and a graceful screenplay. Throughout the film, Rajinikanth is like a man suffering from some diseases. I am one of those unfortunate souls who saw the father, the first show in the theater on the first day. The audience was so annoyed that many of them left the theater before exchange. Sorry, I will not recommend this to anyone.
