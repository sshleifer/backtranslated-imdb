Actually, this is basically the same movie. And they did not even get the schedule for the schedule. Although it was deliberate or not careful due to laziness. On the other hand, this thing is the real buzz. It is also not a worthy movie. I have seen this bogeman as the second feature of the so-called disk. I thought my head would explode, and I'm telling you to run as far as the opposite of this thing, if you should be cursed with the misfortune of getting together on its way. It should come with a warning label: Alert - If your IQ is around it can drop several points. I do not doubt that this thing is 0/10
