I hired this movie on another night because my girlfriend or I have never seen it, even though we have heard from a mutual friend how "great" it was. <br /> <br /> Now I am quite conservative in my opinion, but I knew it would be quite generous for those who managed it. Before starting the film, I will play the popular liberal sympathizer with the people of Michael Douglas, and his opponent as a studio will be conservative rival. But I was wondering where political statements would start and end. <br /> <br /> Well, the plot was tough: the academy was a lobbyist. All right, this is potentially considered to be fantastic recreational, plots were unique. But then the movie turned into a generous infomercial. The picture has become more about gun control and environmental problems than the relationship between President and Sydney (Annette Benning). <br /> <br /> There were many ridiculous places in this movie: 1) Character Sydney plays this one who is a "near" six lobbyist figure. Has he got more flights? He constantly looked disorganized and scared in everything. Very few are "near". I can not "sell" a sale, and sell a glass of water to a man he thirsty. Secondly, is something more ridiculous than Wing's fanatic right than Richard Dreyfuss? This is Hollywood's most generous person and he is playing some right wing ideologue. Give me a break. I like how to take his conservative character and make him as sinful as possible. <br /> <br /> 3) The last lecture was just ridiculous. The line about "I'm a proud card carrying ACLU" was a joke on the line. First, a President can never accept something like this, it is an active member of an exaggerated group. Second, why not even bring something like that. You cut off half the half of the movable or conservative movie running. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot was great and unique. I was a good choice as the president of Michael Douglas. But the movie went from "Cinema" to Left Wing Political Statement, so the film failed. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
