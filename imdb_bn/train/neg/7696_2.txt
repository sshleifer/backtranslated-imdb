Yes, fool! I just finished watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Much color, too much unnecessary "Adsense" in a story, too much stupid characters (I think they wanted to get comic relief, but I just wanted to cry) ... all too much. Shame to hide divine stories from such "Arbian Knights". With a little bit of kid-friendly, both bad and bad, I do not think it can hold ten minutes for more than five minutes. The princess is lovely, but must be confronted, because the actress does not know to carry a role. The rest of the rest of the rest is even worse ... our "bad guy" is really bad. Shame that "good guy" is not good. The only light in this dark, David Carabin, who unfortunately goes deeper into his level with this, but at least puts his actor / "warrior" skills above. I'm still sorry to see something like him, but I'm glad that I had something to look around, so thanks to David. Just for that, I gave this 2 stars to this Firefox ... I will give more for that, but the final score in the whole movie will be. The rest is so bad, I want to, perhaps, grade it, but there's no grade lover here, then 1 here, and I think that will be too much.
