This movie was written and directed very badly and I fell asleep for 30 minutes through the movie. Junkies in the movie are fanciful and even though the plot is interesting in some way, but it is far and away, some ridiculous. If you are aged 11 or over, you will ignore the writing in the movie and be frustrated, but if you are 10 or younger then it is a movie that will draw your attention and be surprised with all the stunts (which I can not add) and You wish some fighters. Casting in this film was not very good, and the music was very frustrating because it was trying to create excitement but it did not fit properly. On the scale of 1-10 (10 awesome, 1 awesome) acting in this film 4. Brenda's song is a genre in the comedy, but her performance was more ridiculous in more serious scenes with such a movie. When he created some of his "fight", I started laughing loudly. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the instruction, for example, in which part of his enemy has become the person, which is with the terrible villain, how his voices become dark and evil, I think incredibly stupid and how Wendy's (Brenda Song) The teacher was possessed by all his teacher devotees at school, that was quite ridiculous. So it's all worth enriching, a frustrating movie, but if you're 10 or younger, then OK.
