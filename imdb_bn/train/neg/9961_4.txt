Amelia and Michael are a married couple that is cheating on each other. Amelier has a long-term lover in hospital and Michael has appointed a prostitute who does not satisfy her. Two smither with their unbeliever but manage to connect with each other at the end. <br /> <br /> There is not much to short about this short. The direction is straightforward and forward dramatic, which is good, acting cordial, but the story leaves little bit to be desired. Why, okay, are we worried about these two people? It's hard to see how this story goes out of the story of any other betrayal, except that it is far more dangerous and its money is not searched (welcome change at a speed). <br /> <br /> I do not know, it is possible that I will not be associated with these stories because I have never experienced them. But I noticed that blocking these descriptions is usually the same, that is, the couple are talking together while talking to the eye while pretending to be submerged in newspapers. Excellent things about small movies are they want to do more than provide more room, and I want to take a different look. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
