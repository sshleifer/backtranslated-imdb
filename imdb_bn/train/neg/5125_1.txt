As a young man I heard good things about this movie. Then I saw it. The acting was not good. It's forgiving. This is not a message: Your life will change to Jesus and everything will change - you will deal better, create amazing cats, disrespect, start a touchdown, and even create playoffs. Because Jesus magically turns terrible underlying weaknesses among all-American athletes. Coach coach to explain coach, why did coach say? But wait, do all that. You'll get a brand new truck, raise $ 6000, and you and your wife struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. Then you will win the state championship because it is more than 12 yards and less than the wind before going 12 yards in case of a weakness - because "God wanted to make it." Then you will win the state championship again next year. If this group did not want to follow Jesus, they would not have been an intimate thing. <br /> <br /> Here's what I've taken from the movie: God can do what he wants to do. It wants to do - and it makes our life better, easier and more enjoyable. He liked his favorite team and helped win the games. Which Bible is based on this story? I want to say goodbye to St. Stephen that he knew the key to living this safe life before he died. Someone made this movie before killing 10 of the 11 apostles to follow Jesus. It will save them all so much trouble.
