Vendor was great with a million dollar hotel. I do not know how he came with this movie! The concept of giving situation after the Spot 11 and the views of the American Society are optimistic, it makes 2 out of 10. But this is not a movie. This is a great idea (West-east conflict). Important things are going on in the Middle East and it has been issued on the screen of an MAC * with the fingers of American girls, which in reality is stupid (because they are unaware of the incident). Characters are not good size And most importantly, the idea given with religion is interesting to me. Lana said in the last scene, just calm down and try to listen. And the background music says "... I will pray". The fact is not about religion. But it ends. If you want to see the truth close your eyes and pray. The light is already burning on the truth. It does not want anyone to see it. ps: "My house is not a place. It is a man who receives 10 out of 10 words. But after the making of this film it was damaged. (However, as the mentioned "somebody" below, America's best youth is not very good, they are simply "poor" and "hopeless" who have signed up for the army for better piccakes!
