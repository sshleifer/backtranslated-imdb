* Includes Splers * <br /> <br /> With a title like "bleed", you know that creative juices are not running much while imagining this puppy. The film is your basic run-of-mill-cum-budget slasher movie. Oh sure, it tries to be creative with the premises of "Kill Club", but we learn that it was just a joke. Okay, the original plot for those who really care about these issues is the city's new girl who started dating her colleagues. He invited him to the circle of his friends, and in a group, they told him that they had a "murderer club" and they killed people, raped them. Well, we learned it was a joke, but our heroine was not there before killing a lady in a parking garage. Now, the "member" of Mordad Club is going to die one by one. Oh, and bad boys have won and the movie is over. At that time, you will not really care about. <br /> <br /> In the past observation, this movie does not have any ideas in the first 10 or so minutes. At the beginning of the film, motivation of murder was never explained. I used to say it was a way for the director to pad out the film, but there are deleted scenes in the DVD! I'm sure why anyone wants to see more than the length of the "bleed" feature, but apparently the people behind the DVD seem to be more clamoring. In the box, it is said to have Easter eggs, but why do not I want to waste my time looking for extra in this movie is beyond me. <br /> <br /> I hope a bad movie, and the "blades" in that block will be distributed. Although it was not a funny bad movie. Everyone looks good in movies, and there are plenty of nudity, but acting is just awful. My favorite favorite is that person who has ended up being a murderer ... I think he seems funny and ridiculous, but he's coming just as a tool. I think the movie is the funest moment, when our heroine kills the girl in a parking garage, deadly, helplessly. Heroine pushes women to the parking garage cement pole, and the woman thinks she just hits the item, and she opens a mask of blood and "dead". <br /> <br /> Pros are a complex, creative process, check "bleed" for those who are thinking of making movies. It will change your mind, and you can create a movie to get any hacks. <br /> <br /> Do not waste your time or money.
