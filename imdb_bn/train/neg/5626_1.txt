Catch this movie in a Sunday tube. I thought it was so bad I looked on IMDb what others thought it was. I was not amazed at the amount of foolish people this fluff enjoyed. I was frustrated when I looked at the comments to read the Hatered Brick category and saw that there was none of them. I was shocked at this; I always hate, as if they always hate the movie, how good it is. However, this movie creates ruthlessly by frustrated people and I proudly say that I hate this movie! I know why I hate this movie in detail, but only to show more respect than this film.
