A murder high school lyric animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge. <br /> <br /> This movie really bothered me. It has a great looking monster, has some good low budget effects, few things are good with the atmosphere but the bad conducts the short circuit. I started to move half way forward and then follow the chapters from the DVD. <br /> <br /> A lot of problems with this movie. Cast off first shows thirty and still they are estimated to be from high school. You do not believe anything to go as you get the results. Scarecrow, that's not too much when looking great. He said that stupid one liners and funny is a method designed to be awesome then awesome. Is it a comedy or a horror movie? It's a problem that sets the dialog between a liners and up. It seems like sending more clich√© than the heartwarming horror movie. I think this film was created for very narrow audiences, the horror fans wanted to ridicule it instead of embracing it. <br /> <br /> A movie to avoid it despite the good showing giant. Even if you choose this for Dargah Bin for five KJ, you are paying a lot. Avoid <br /> <br />
