As a huge fan or cracker series, I have been waiting 7 years for the next addition. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> His duties visit to North Island became a victim of the killing. <br /> <br /> What I like about this episode is a very convenient way of establishing how a murderer can be established and how to be fitted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> />
