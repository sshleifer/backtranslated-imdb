I believe Shakespeare is what I read beautifully. I think she (women) protest too much. The whole thing came to me as the writer was trying to please himself! He has written several times the unreasonable literature (written from the same period but not connected to the Bible), but at the top of my head I can think at least three references that lend the historical accuracy of the events in the Bible. Anyone can skew the data and prove their loved ones but it is not true. Changes in customs, changes the word over time (English and German where it very clearly shows a common route) does nothing remain the same, it is always growing and changing. There are many different translations in the Bible, but the King James version is considered best for any research. In the King James version, you will notice specific words written in italics. These words have been added by translators and can be omitted and the average of the whole verse change. The writings around Christ were written without spaces, without any spacing, without paragraphs and numerical verses. These texts look like a long word and translators add all of the above. For example, how would you read it: Why do you read God as if it were somewhere or do you read God is here? The same string of letters has two different meanings. Translation Original Quote Many Bible scholars use 'lexicon' to help them with translation because they provide a word for word translation from the original Alec, Greek or Hebrew, which was originally written in the Scriptures. It is also interesting to remember that when translated into symbolic reasoning you can prove that God exists but you can not prove that he does not exist! Lastly, I just love them in their thoughts that they are so smart that they are worthy of judging the Almighty. Talk about ego! Keep away the soapbox, God Bless Maegi
