*** Spokela *** *** SPIRIER *** If anyone can review the movie based on premiere, someone may think that you are watching an average animal based horror flick. The plot as follows. A group of documentary filmmakers go on an island to film a documentary about surfing through sharks or blood surfing. (I live in South Africa, so it is released as "Blood Surf.") It seems that there is some interesting idea behind it, if it is searched more, but could have developed some films. However, in this case the blood surfing part is minimal because of the fact that their documentary is rather interrupted by large salt-water crocodiles. <br /> <br /> The script is terrible. This incident happens frequently in the movie when someone is eaten by crocodile, a good example of this, does not seem to blame. Anyone who was killed in the film was the victim of only one scene, but the dialogue in this movie became ridiculous due to its suspicious nature. Another thing really annoying about this picture is that they introduced characters that are completely irrelevant to the film. They introduce a bunch of pirates, who can only be seen to add another 10 minutes for a tiny movie. <br /> <br /> The actress can be considered moderate. Perhaps it was much more impressive if they did not have such terrible scripts to work from them. After all, I do not have a person who has a terrible impact on me. Every single person started to be a watered down caricature and in this way, none of these actors made any kind of impact on me. <br /> <br /> The chicken itself is considered to be huge, just 31 feet high and this feeling of size is illustrated by the obvious net of a crocodile provided to us in the film. At the end of the film, the crocodile's death is so ridiculous and fraud that it turns one's stomach. With the huge tears of travel, the hero of the movie declares that he has a plan that falls under a hill and is buried in the bottom of the hill fortunately to put himself in the spide. <Br /> <br /> Finally, I would say that it should be seen to believe how bad it might be for you. Probably seems to be like a good idea of ​​a terrible script and a great feeling of low budget which served to create a truly awful movie.
