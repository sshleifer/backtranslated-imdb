There have been many movies featuring Bigfoot, which are not the best, but at least they have a stupid charm. Sasquatch hunters are not even going for it. It's just a crashing bore. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Some abnormally large bones of the big butterfly have been discovered in this region and Since the apps are not natural to start with non-natural scientific operations in North America. Enough to be sure, they soon discovered a complete grave ground full of skeletal remains of these cosmic sway-like creatures. I think we all know what will happen to those who are annoyed with the old cemetery in the movies. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is to add their gear, walk through the jungle, stop the rest, search through a few more alternate steps through the woods, and discuss long-term searches on the road, even more high standards Talking about, looking for a team member who has disappeared, even more hiking through the jungle, Yala digging through random thiorijim, and that day they gathered around a Campfire talk a little work. When Saskatchev looks at it, it moves around in the dark and roams around and wanders around and chooses one at a time (works in a blaze and you miss the fashion and the real killings stop). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> People try to get around somewhere just around night and do scary things around the night. I said if I said, I did not use the forward forward buttons to speed up this scene. <br /> <br /> To do a lot of things, like all other characters in the film, and lacking an individual personality, to make them self-styled. It looks like a shagger version of King Kong, which is painfully obvious during the giant scenes of the obstacle, which is not all bad except scenes using CGI instead of a Bigfoot cloth. One part of me can not help but it seems that even a part of computer effects is also used to bring Bigfoot back to life. If a single movie is a monster, I believe that life should only be lived through the situation, it is Bigfoot. <br /> <br /> This is a film that does not have a place like this. This is really a prize, which stretches to create an image of the length of the feature without disturbing people to add all the elements to create a suitable movie.
