If it is based on real life relationships, Miss Cortin and Mr. As Levinson's intermediary, I'm glad that I personally do not know. It is painfully slow and both the characters across the film accept silly sticks when the theme gets on the ground. Many stupid scenes with stupid people are not for a comedy.
