This is the first sigel I saw (except for Jafar's return) and I really thought that it would be close to the roots. I was very frustrated. <br /> <br /> The story was originally the first script with some extra characters, and the situation was changing around. There are a daughter of Ariel and Eric, who are not satisfied on the land of Melody. She wants to be a mermaid. However, Arrell saved his daughter from her daughter because she wanted to protect her- and when Melie came out she became angry and angry. And then she decides to escape, and she becomes a mermaid. So she is swimming happily, and Ariel finds her to find out - as a mermaid. <br /> <br /> The story is not written very badly, but the situation and the repetitions of the first film are inevitable. And Melody is fairly boring, and the film adds to the almost unbearable issue. <br /> <br /> There are also complete loads of two new characters among them. Try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa-not too bad as the characters themselves! The songs leave much to be very desired, they do not have the same magical power as the original song. The animation was obviously not a complete load job-in some parts it is jumpy, and many speculations are not used for character movement. <br /> <br /> Another suggestion - Try to forget about Ariel's main character while watching this movie. Beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager 'all grown up', an annoying wife and mother, and her trademark red hair are all tied up. If you have never seen the original, it can be seen better - you have nothing to compare it to. However, in the end, it may be worse- it's not as bad as other sequels, like Syndrala II. But it's not the same league as the original. But if you do not have anything else to do with your collection, Disney will lose their old fans if they do so.
