I have 2 words for you. Sean Bean She is the only suitable presence in this film. But do not even see this movie. Although he is the main villain as well, you do not want to waste your time. <br /> <br /> I'm not worried about characters (in fact, without a little boy) and in reality, star love lovers do not die when they end together. The film does not care about me or believes that these people care about each other. I read several "classic" novels in the movie and this movie did not want me to read the book. The story seems so annoying. But I can go ahead and try to break the story of my head. <br /> <br /> Stay away from Lorna Doon. Larna playing actress also had sensual and sensitivity and she was much better at that. Sharp, Harty Hornblower, and E See Pride and Prizudis novels Or miniseries like Forsyte Saga Do not bother with Lorna Doone, check them out.
