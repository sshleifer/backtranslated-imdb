Avoid this o'clock at all costs. Bad scripts, bad directions, bad acting, bad editing, bad words and bad music To get the idea? This movie tries to taste western, it is not. It tries to be hard-core, it's not. It tries to present a new look in an old series, it does not. Actors try the best there, and my heart goes to them. But it is becoming difficult to work with such insane things. To me it's the first look of a "new-born film school that will fire the world". Freshman movie makers often bite more or more who can chew them in their budgets. The best thing they can do is take a few steps ahead, review what is possible, and then work in their limited budget next time.
