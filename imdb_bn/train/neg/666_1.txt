I have seen this trailer and I think my god is real for this film, who wants to watch this movie and at the same time I thought, my daughter friend took me back and said, "We will see this movie". ..I said I was going for about 5 minutes and I tried to highlight a brave face and enjoy the cheap scary but there was none of them. It should be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no impact on the director. No viewpoint is used in the same times again and he does not build the mystery. Perhaps the cast is probably called the collapse of the tremendous run. The first 40 minutes was the most annoying girgli giggles and bad music to see the script, I did not have any character development. <br /> <br /> Plot OK ... there was no plot that was originally I know that we will be terrorizing a high school group with a stock round serial killer, that's brilliant! Hmmm was what you hoped to disappoint Australian soap opera, that the main character Blondie deity dam he bothered me. His longest line was of course half-sentence, and whenever he was in the camera, he was just dragging the expression of another rude face. <br /> <br /> Listen to me if you have any taste in movies. This, and if you like me and do not like a loved one then I wish you good luck, probably a smugle in an iPod or magazine. Can not believe this image is made!
