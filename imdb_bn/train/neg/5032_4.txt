This movie was found in Saif-Fi 50-pack for one of my friends for Christmas. It is similar to the first Gogila film, and American actors like that film were inserted for any real reason. An interesting issue of inserted scenes is that there is a rock-war tension between the United States and Russia. Like gadijela, gamers are awakened by global nuclear explosions and militants, giving close attention to Tokyo, because no big giant film is complete until Tokyo is cut. All in all, this is a OK movie. The scenes of gamers, especially tolli scenes are quite spectacular and special effects were quite beautiful at that time. If you like the Japanese monster giant movie, you really will get a kick out of this. I gave it 4 out of 10. If I had seen the Japanese version, it probably got a 5.
