After watching many of "Next Action Star", reality TV EPS Tivo tapped this shocking-terrible trip for me. For some strange reason - and I just blamed myself - I saw the whole thing, hopefully the whole film will be * unique * After so much publicity with Joel Silver's "Midas Touch" campaign, he can be sure that he picked up his Twitter word. <br /> <br /> First, the only release of the whole film was Billy Jane, and even she could not get out of scrapshot writing. Not to say that Jane's performance hates about 2/3 of the way because he can not see what the look is more than the alphabet. <br /> <br /> He can not blame him here. Written, quite a bit, sucked. Let us take ideas from "night race," "enemy of the state", "terminator," "midnight run" and any bad gambling film and can only reshare it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Mother of a one-note, Shaw plays very well, plays good joke, but struggles with the film shoulder shoulders. Quite obviously, we do not think that we live or die through the middle path, because the cigarette even fails to provide the reason for the likes of the audience. His stupid, but lucky routine becomes old because it is not basically an issue for the character. <br /> <br /> But the Cajun wood, the dream of the toughest Korean van Rick de Groot. Does Howard Fine really claim to be the Terminator for the first half of the film? I do not think so. I hope to quote him. His character "performance" can only be compared to the dramatic depths of Freddy Cot Fingers, although not nearly as well. The camera loves him in dark, galaxy limousine, but in the dark light of day his emotions strengthen all the energy outside the screen. Jane Bara showed more normal life than five minutes in the corner of Corinne's showing in any part of her screen. <br /> <br /> Finally, there is a wonderful look for a good lead in a great cast of foxes, but this one does not have to be left alone. It was a very easy job for her. "Next Action Star" co-star Jerd Eliot can not have a good fortune with some more dynamic characters, but it's hard to tell Jeff Welch's lenge script. Before injuring yourself and anyone else, someone would have to take Welch's IMA away. And finally, Van Ryck de Groot was simply outclassed and way out of his reach for the whole verse like this. <br /> <br /> Joel Silver should be ashamed.
