There are no scripts to start when you expect, and so the director can not do that. Heike and Farrell, and Donaldson and Kierkeen are good actors, there is nothing to say or react to them. Even the earthquake was very poor. And I do not know how closely the film follows the novel, but the two Jewish girls are not seen anywhere, Arturo has a nice, warm heart, but there are no stereotypes in any quantity. And he threw Kathilah into the desert, instead of returning to the LAA for a wonderful Catholic cemetery where he could bring his flowers at least once. Poorly And L.A. The set is made ridiculously graphical. Anything good? His apartment felt real, curtains, sound, windows in the windows. And Donaldson is always great. Since the dead body of the body or the night of the living dead, which came from it.
