Outfitted in the director, chains and leather, Friday night the SF Frameline Film Festival warned the audience that we were about a "experimental" film. Experimental? Release the video camera on the back seat of the car, roll the tape and edit all the pointless drags in the eyesight. A messy pastiche road show manqu√© that starts somewhere and the audience takes no place. The unnecessary violence that opens the film has spanned more than the Castro Theater. I would also leave, but my cine-friend needed to travel around and even last to see the work of poor work. The audience was thinned enough while coming to light. Taped worship. Professor Professor Dr. Avoid this photo!
