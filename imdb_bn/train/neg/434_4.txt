Already his first claim, the will is always artificial, totally misguided. <br /> <br /> When one of Jehovah's Witnesses is denied his own documentary in movies ?? Or something for that matter - it's time to get their own. Although much more intelligent, Paris Hilton (I know it is not very difficult), but the face of GJK is far more intelligent than that, just different types. He integrates bad to both his professional world: psychology and philosophy. Notorious for providing expert B * LLS for convenience in both fields. *** In a way to create uncompromising incompetent policies, to adopt a large amount of effort, without haste start or end, and to combine ideas almost randomly, a semantic can just love a mother towel. Example: There are three main Marx brothers, so what is a "great" concept of connecting them with three levels of human consciousness, ID, ego and super-ego? I am surprised that he did not play a clip from "snoopight" and created a similarity between seven darfaces and the seven layers of garnah (Moslem Hem). It's like the "number 23" of the Shutter: Play with a lot of numbers and you can come up with any kind of Kakammy theory, even with the death of Princess Dyer, linking the ancient Greeks. <br /> <br />, TipGTC has an entertainment element: Intelligent analyzes can be a lot of fun, because of a delusional lunatic sounds like a hole-in-the-fly crazy voice. "Kaku nest" or any other madhouse drama, why can you stay in Giza for more than 2 hours? It's like watching a fun train debris. Confession, he is almost fun at one or two events. <br /> <br /> I have always been deceived by those who have tried to chemically encourage filmmaking in higher intellectual social science. Much of the crap movies like "birds" think so much, so many of these credits, probably his fat creator has smile in his grave. The raw fact is that there are zero intellectual values ​​in a large number of movies and some have some intelligence, they do not need a collapsed philosopher to draw a map for an understanding ?? Unless one is completely stupid Jijak sees the level and level layers in the wildest films. In these days, halusinogenic drugs in Slovenia should be rather popular and cheaper ... <br /> <br /> When Jizek "Sycho" showed the bathtub hole in the shower scene, I thought he was saying something about the galactic black holes; They how they extract life out of star as they suck the bathtub cavity with genetic layers blood. Or perhaps he said how the hole represents the leg's cells, rather than blood, it flows instead of it (such as menstrual), it represents any kind of "clever (jizky) mockery". As you say, the real ridicule is that if Hitco really thought so much in each scene (and script), his movies were often unreasonable, extroverted crap. Showing how easy it can be to improve the point of this bathtub hole element "hidden, deep meaning". And when you add GJK's fiction to philosophy and psychology, like these backpack decorations, these verses are placed at the top of this element, then you will get a vague quarrel that is immediately illiterate - that can be easily printed and disrespected. With the cleansing of bloody bathroom with "Satisfaction of work, good work done" by Brazilian Atheny Parkinson, Gizk has presented some strange ideas. Do not be laughing ... Not a hitter nor a "psycho" writer could never adopt the idea that the pakinas might be doing well - cleaning bloody toilets - when they give the idea / direction the scene. Talk about speaking words in the face of one (dead), but in relation to misinterpretation of what the director was saying <br /> <br /> <br /> I like the first thoughts of Djokovic Tarkovsky's awesome "Solaris", but after that <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "I just want to play all day!" The reasoning is its rule, and is not supposed to be raped - at least not openly - like her. He thinks logic, proof, common sense, and as the enemy or mere throwing toy; Ideas should be avoided, fit the last-goal or simply be destroyed. Jizzake LSD-Triped Hippie, and all her favorite movies are her own personal "2001" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I was surprised that de Palma did not feature more specifically; The other hairdresser to write the unread script. A field day with the famous "Lost Highway" of Jinkake Lynch <br /> <br /> This comment by GJK is that the audience easily accepts Von Tier's "Ground Breaking" physical setup to create "Dogwil". I snicker <br /> <br /> However, GJK does not create things to go with him, he is also prone to "bloody" obviously. Like all "social scientists" (an oxymoron), he has his intense "observation" in clear language (if full of kisses) and occasionally covers language blankets. Above all, sociology works precisely the same way: It is our belief that we are listening to something new when we actually know what we already know, but it is said in an intelligent way - which fools more respectful listeners. <br /> <br /> I was half-expected for white yarn men's men, suddenly appeared from somewhere and there was a loonie whip to him in the suit ... <br /> Slavoj Zizek: As soon as a stalker near a kids park You <br /> <br /> http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Fedor8/150_worst_cases_of_nepotism/
