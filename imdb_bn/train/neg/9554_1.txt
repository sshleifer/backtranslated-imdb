This is the worst, and I sometimes saw the worst computer-based movie. The whole plot is full of fools and idiots completely. <br /> <br /> I said, <br /> <br /> The person in this movie can actually talk to the computer. Now you probably think it should be a cool cool hi-tech computer, but it also has other poor and weaker computers, which also do not have graphic interface. <br /> <br /> The main idea of ​​how the "super" computer overloads it connects through the computer game is really stupid. My mobile phone will stop the lights for energy conservation, but apparently this talent computer can not determine whether to deal with national security threats or use its resources to load computer games. <br /> <br /> There is something bad about anything but I do not have time for this. <br /> <br /> I believe that someone can actually record the movie stupidly
