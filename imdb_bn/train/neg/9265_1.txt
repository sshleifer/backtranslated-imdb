After hearing Harvey Burner's second commentary and enjoying it, I wondered that he was behind the whole part of this trash. It's really like a bad tv movie, when you have flu and are very sick to reach the distance, you can see the middle of that day. I think in front of Michael Lerner, I can describe Les Miserbable as a high school cast, which is open to my face in disbelief. And then my face going up and down because I had so many smiles. Terrible I do not know why I must write the minimum ten lines, I made my point briefly, there is nothing clever about these modern words.
