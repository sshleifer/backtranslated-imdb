There is no way in the world that you care about these characters. A group of reduced-grade middle-class groups, a group of children take some medicines and close and argue with each other. I only watched it on TV and I did not think that it was a 'film', more post-'This life 'is the loyalty which is not really any resonance or proper drama. Unfortunately this kind of material will be commissioned for unfortunately, irrelevant middle-class "lifestyle" shit that takes itself very seriously. It's got David Baddiel and out of that bird's "cold feet", you know what to expect. There was a lot about it in 2000, it was especially British maleise ... "Are they educated and doing medicines? Friends, but with disastrous and barbarous relationships? Great words!" Such nongrasses, and post-gay Richie comedy-gangster staff ... dark days. If you have a taste, it will push you towards violence.
