This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I am 64 years old and a football fan. I went expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes, I started thinking how such a bad film (especially acting) could be achieved in a theater. Almost halfway through, I screamed to my husband that it was terrible and he interpreted the events behind the movie. Although I was a little distraught (and can see if someone is not a Christian then it could be very bad), while being promoted at the movie theater, it was not a big deal. However, it was a big deal to bring such a predictive and unrealistic behavior and, above all, under the quality of acting. This is a suitable movie for a church tour but will be shown in a church auditorium, not in a theater. Do i go to church Yes I want to go to church when I attend a movie? No Will I recommend this movie? Absolutely not !!!
