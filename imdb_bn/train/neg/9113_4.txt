They were just as likely for this movie and they were completely flat. Among the first cruel objectives, we are surprised how the main characters are becoming and how they work. There are almost no character development in this prequel. This is actually a very sad story but this picture did nothing for me. They go out of the good writing instead of unknown f-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and does not explain anything. The text was just terrible. Another thing to annoy me was that they were used on 3 leases of the same lines. Such as "down boy", or kiss scenes, and a few others I can not remember. I was not impressed by Robin's performance, but I did a great job. The only thing that has matched this film
