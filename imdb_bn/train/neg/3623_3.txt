(Ur: blood castle or demo scram) <br /> <br /> * Explosives * <br /> <br /> It was a drive-in feature, co-build with Velvet Vampire. A Spanish-Italian co-production where many women in the village are murdered, at the same time, a local counting named Eynos is seen on the horse's horse, behind him with his 'man-eating' dog. <br /> <br /> The inhabitants of the city have already suspected that he is one of the back and burn his fortress. The beginning of the massacre was the eldest brother of Count Yanos, Count Egoor Dalmar was burnt heavily in the Lab accident and <br /> <br /> <br /> <br examines him in his examination. Yanos agreed to hire him in place of his brother, and they simultaneously searched sources for the dead cell. Yawos wants to resurrect the fattened corpse of Igaro <br /> <br /> However, of course, Igor is still alive (though severely burned) and in the village women are being beaten and beaten. We see an impressive face around it has appeared in different parts of the movie, so we know that he is still alive, the whole thing looks very little. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Retritic DVD is taken from VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. There is also no additional extra except a scratchier trailer. Although it's a nice, obscure Spanish castle and good atmospheric, but I find it fairly annoying and anticipated, no tension or mystery, whatever. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
