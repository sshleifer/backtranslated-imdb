The Blue Monkey is actually mentioned in the film, but in no way does it create any possible conjecture. At one stage, some children are walking through a deep level, searching for them. <br /> <br /> They start discussing what they can find there and one of them (girl) says they find a blue monkey. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is. The complete dissonance of the story, the only sad connection to the title, and any idea why he thinks he will find blue monkeys at the foundation of a hospital. <br /> <br /> I'm feeling embarrassed to remember it but there is a feeling in somebody's mind!
