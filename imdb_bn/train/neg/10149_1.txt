I can not believe that Steven Segel's career is so low that he has been reduced to making the fourth-highest-grossing film with 5th-rate secondary actors. I saw this ongoing expectation that he would have to be thrown out of some people's whip. If a single judo chip is used in shoulder blades, then the opponent can be pulled out and the guy falls like a brick tone, something wrong. <br /> <br /> This film is incredible as a movie, even if you excuse the visuals and read this story as a novel, then you wonder why you picked up the book too. <br /> <br /> Steven Segal goes through the speed and feels like he is doing this because he is under obligation only. He does not show any effort and encouragement, and in some scenes he has not seen all. <br /> <br /> I hate to repeat the comments of other people, but for the cut scenes and the use of stock footage for the scene Flight Aircraft is unfortunate. The condition of the scenes spent is frustrating and the scenes seem to have been worse over time. Japrodder, who is being killed by President John F. Kennedy, is a steady and cleaner film. <br /> <br /> In my honest comments you are not talking about losing your time viewing this film, it is not on the work standards of the glimmer people or the exit wounds. I read a review that said the movie had a budget of $ 12 million (Segel was paid 5) and the film was still under the budget. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br />
