I love Seth green. His appearance on the Thatt 70 show is always to be seen, but last night, I want to remind that the show is needed for rebuilding. Four single young boys have inherited the New York City apartment that most of us will die. The grandmother must be a successor to have such place in the first place. So I think the need for reality should have been found out. However, the plot about four four friends getting this apartment was not credible. If I moved away from their parents, I'd be happy to give a lot of humor and dishonesty about setting up the show. It does not seem to be a lot of humor. I'm just looking at it because it won my night on Thursday night before Earl. I think they will go back, scrap this series, and start over. We need a series of more families involved. After fire, how did Seth and her friends set fire to their vulnerable parents and mothers? Danny Coleman's father and Christine Esther can play, mother and sick siblings can play. The list of possibilities with someone like Seth Green is endless and it enhances the network.
