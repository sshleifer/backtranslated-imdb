This movie proves that you can not judge a movie by the great cover of DVD cover. Show that you can learn more about the movie before this movie (or get it for someone on Christmas). At the beginning of this movie actually seems somewhat promising. Well, until you fill the letters. Pampin Jack (old man from the street) gives co-editors of the college a complete book with spellings, which he leaves in their annual ghost house (where the movie is performed). Then there are some drinks, war, and soft-core porn. Then it takes place an hour after the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, the hollywood's expected, unclear and a soft-core pornography are memorable. This film is probably best viewed with a group of friends who do not do anything good, because it is a good movie to make fun. And for the first time, it's really fun to predict the order of mortal man.
