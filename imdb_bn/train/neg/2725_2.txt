Chesty Gingo Tele Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a "bump up the border" of Mexico. He worked as a young immigrant Danny de la Paz (as Ben Romero) who wants to be Savessors' best person at his upcoming wedding. Savalas is difficult, but the boss Eddie Albert (as commander Mofat) may be difficult. What you need to stop the runner Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez) is tough. Alliances may be flux. <br /> <br /> If you find the possibility of commenting the word "Kozak" and "Oliver Douglas" as objectionable, you will need to clear the "border". If not, you will not get a belt for the "realistic" cow killer scene. Although it is not very valuable, Mr De La Paz and Sicilya Camacho (as Lina) steal the show. <br /> <br /> ** Border (1979) Tony Richardson ~ Telly Savalas, Danny De La Paz, Eddie Albert
