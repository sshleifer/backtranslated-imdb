This step reminds me of Tales from the Crypt Keeper. People have the same concept of what they deserve. I always think of them in a crypt story. The same goes for bad acting. Very bad acting. I enjoyed this movie that most people do not like it and I did not expect too much. Whenever I see a Steven King movie, I do not expect much because his films are horrific than the genius of his novels. I've read Shining and Kerry and they were fantastic books. I love how Keri played it like a true story and reports and a bunch of whole book reports and theories. It was very good. But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like movies. The cinema versions were very different after the end. I guess from those two novels that all of his novels have changed greatly and the end is always Chess. The worst I end up in the themed. So Chasey. I want to read the book to find out the real end. I recommend those who wish to compare everyone so that Steven King's novels see his movies in hand. And in that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book. I wish to do all of the novels I made in the movie. I'm sure that if they were made in movies then they were really good books ... and the screenplay became very bad.
