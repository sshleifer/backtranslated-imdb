An earlier critic said that the movie is not all bad. What?!?!?! The film is proud of child abuse. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in her, so let's get 5 out of 5 out of 5. Why not be full 10? Because the film was "angry" because the child's shock was "unrealistic" and the fattened friend was "boring". Critics of any of the reviews, in 1981, expressed a disapproval of an American film showing sexual intercourse with an older woman. I happened to catch this steaming bread of a movie while staying at a hotel in Showtime. To me, even if even a fat friend was a storm work and was worthy of an Oscar, I would still give the movie 1 star. The TV's Howard Hessman acted in the movie at the same time, as shown on the WKRP, especially the ridiculous. But do not take my word for it!
