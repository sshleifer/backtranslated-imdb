When I was a kid when I saw this movie in the theater and always thought of it as my first experience, it was knocked out with a good business with a horror movie. The commercial was great, but later I found out that it was the whole film (about 4) of every explosion or 'special effect' and even something that was not in the film. There were some types of aliens related plots, but as long as I think the aliens actually did not actually appear. It was obviously about creating a cheap movie mobile phone designed to hate a person. I ended my days in the absence of that world, when I found out bad bad movies were found there who had bad people there.
