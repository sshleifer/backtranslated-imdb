I quote Oedipius Rex because it's such a tragic incident that this movie has been made! <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! Like most humorous people of IMWA, I am disappointed with the Uwe bowlers! <br /> <br /> Photos of Uwe Boll such as Postal and tunnel rats are extremely bad and therefore recreational. But honestly, this movie was just awesome. I hated it so much that if I could do it I would like to give it a zero star rating. The story is just shit! It plots in four parts of the picture and then in the middle, which is just tropical terribly brutally killing scenes! Eventually it ended with a "Villan Winner Finish" which is perfectly acceptable, but could have been happier than ever! <br /> <br /> I'm not against Uwe Bowl (as I said earlier) or I'm not against a violent movie! I love f ** king fiance movie! I'm a Sau movie, hostel cinema, Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, 28 movies, dog soldiers, my bloody valentines, leftist last house, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, Sam Pacinpah, even even Canal FÃ¡ ** King Holocaust ! But this! OMFG !!! <br /> <br /> It's just cruel, wicked and pervert! And look at the movies I listed! If I like Canceral Holocaust and it does not, then it should be bad! Uwe, do not go all the dark again! When you're light-hearted, you just like Ed Wood. This was just a terrible experience! After seeing this I feel terrible! Do not see <br /> <br /> !!!! Avoid all costs !!!!!
