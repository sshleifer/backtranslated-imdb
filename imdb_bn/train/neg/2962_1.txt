Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. So Hype Goldberg can do the movie. But hoops and dinosaurs? <br /> <br /> After the first 20 minutes of "Theodore Rex", I reached a conclusion: The movie is bad. In spite of being evil, rogue, wicked, and obscure for the audience Nothing bad is made by this accident; This is a visual equivalent of the torture chamber. First of all, Hoopi does not make a good action film (see if you think I'm lying, but look "deadly beauty"), but the filmmaker Don 't care - he is here again a tough cop. <br /> <br /> One million police girls saw this week? Well, here's one million and number one, Pal. <br /> <br /> Spielberg's TV shows do not like beautiful, human-animated dinosaurs from them? Very bad, another one here and he is a policeman! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> Stahl, Roundtree) is a movie that is stuck in a tax-off-like movie? <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> you present a signal. Serious <br /> <br /> <br /> No one, nor the one. And if they really make a signal in "Theodore Rex", then Hollywood should be asked to attack the foam rubber dinosaurs in the entire ankle. <br /> <br /> Now I want to see it.
