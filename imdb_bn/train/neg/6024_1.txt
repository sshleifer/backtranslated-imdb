I watched this movie for about 30 minutes, finally I became ill with this movie getting sick. Soundtrack, the so-called 'Plot', and every actor. They all think they are the main part of the movie and are shouting "Notice me!" Repeatedly The bad guy is playing his bad guy and you say things like bad guys, if you are not quite caught. Good people are brave and noble things just in case you do not know if he was not the good guy. And O Lord, plane scene. "My Husband is hungry! O my God! It is impossible that he can stand on his feet or walk or go to something else, he will definitely miss it!" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but to speak the truth, he woke up and he was scared even before looking at the terrible terror.) <br /> <br /> A religious girl, I lost this printed film I want to apologize to the world. <br /> <br /> and I like my 30 minutes ago.
