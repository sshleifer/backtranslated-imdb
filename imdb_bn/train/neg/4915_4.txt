One of the previous critics wrote that there is no middle ground for the opinion of love; One likes it or hate it. But there seems to be an extraordinary distribution of opinions on the scale of 1 to 10. This movie has 4 ratings for me. There are some nice scenes and places and Ray Mills does an excellent job as Oliver's father. But the film did not do particularly compulsory to tell her story, and the story was not so unique to me, at least not sure about philosophy. I can be a bit wet, but I tend to avoid movies with Ryan O'Brien - I have not seen Barry Lyndon yet - because most of them, but not all, my presence is not destroyed for me. The only exception is hats up, Doc ?, which is perfect underwriting for Barbara Streisand's Goffball hero - and, eventually, he takes a shot in the love story for good measure! McGrath and O'Ill have been embracing their lines instead of working them. <br /> <br /> This movie is notable at the beginning of a great career: it was Tommy Lee Jones's first film.
