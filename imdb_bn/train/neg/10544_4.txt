When childhood memories tell you that it was a scary movie; Touch it and go whether you should rethink it. However, I feel a scared scene involving a perky person and a cool villain played by Jeff Caber. <br /> <br /> "First strength" is not a very good movie, sorry to say. It is full of a copy of the clich√©s and a very poor script which can be run through a truck (it helps in running a story with unlimited "Twist" features). Lou Diamond Phillips is a very confident bad ass cop who has sent the body serial killer to the gas chamber only to discover that he himself has suffered the loss of Satan and now with the power of every weak psychologist there is also the power of the resurrection. She comes across. Very poorly researcher helps through this mix. <br /> <br /> Ahhh, it's trash. But remember such as enjoyable, especially if you remember it. It's still quite good to watch that scene with me as a kid and a homeless person. Here are some kind of logic; Forget it, just about every measure is thrown for good measurement and you end with a cross between the Steven Segal Action Flick and the Giant Flick of 70. And who said the world here was a good idea to lead Laume Diamond Phillips? Not saying that he is not a believer but he is doing his best and I have not had any problem with the man, it seems there are many critics here. Tracy Griffith as a mental, less well said. But as a good killer; Always like that actor. <br /> <br /> "First strength" works hard days and requires a "brain switch off" order after what may be right. The beer will probably increase the viewing experience and the next time I spin the film, it must be loaded. All in all; Somewhat guilty pleasure for nostalgic fans who are afraid of a good but easily kids as well. See "near you, boy friend"!
