- A movie crew is shooting a horror movie in an old, supposed cursed house where for years, seven have gone mysteriously. One of the crew finds an old book of spellings and it seems that it is useful for some shows in their film. It is advisable that book spells are better written than scripts that are used. But after reading the book, suddenly there came life in the graveyard. Now cast and crew are facing real danger. <br /> <br /> - IMDb listed the running time of 90 minutes. Nothing happened for the first 60 minutes. The movie is spent much time in the film. Are we scared for the shooting that they are shooting? We already know that their movie is not "real". These fears just do not work. <br /> <br /> - There are very few things to enjoy about seven Corps House. The acting is oppressive. Most of these "actors" will have a primary schooling problem. Score terrible. This is a very memorable and no environment in the 70's television series. The atmosphere is not going to say, at the end of the film, in a few moments, there is no one to talk. All of the character logic is but existence. Even in a movie, you expect characters to behave in a certain way. Here, I do not think that a scene where a character chooses the most miraculous avenues available to them. And finally, the first 60 minutes of that movie I've already mentioned. Are you saying? <br /> <br /> - I did not give any low rates to seven Corps House due to the fact that the film (probably accidentally) worked. My two favorite starts and ends. The opening title sequence represents the death of seven previous owners and may be the highlight of the film. And, what is the last few scenes (a ringing induction) key to the huge crews of movie crew's Junky Menezes? Overall though, at the moment it is not enough to make a good movie.
