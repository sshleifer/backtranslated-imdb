This Hamlet is made for the entire seratam MST 3000 episode. I'm not Shakespeare's fan, but I do not believe that he'd like to go slowly and slowly slowly and gradually slowly, because one of the hardest films to find is the number of hamlets listed. Like this one is quite annoying though. It has black and white, slow pacing, and short scenery. The actors are very dubbed so that does not help. This is an MS-3000 3000 I can not sit in a room just as I can play with Hamlet.
