Animation is excellent in this fantasy of Peter and Wolf, but in the 29th minute, the film is asleep asleep. It should have been called "Peter and the Snellels", because everything came to snap speed. I did not see the film in one room - I had to see it for 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture. <br /> <br /> Save yourself 30 minutes - do not see this picture - and thank you. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the Oscar nomination committee saw only the first few minutes of nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner of the best animated short (short!) Category, the voters will have to sit down the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and in the future certainly there is no way to get closer to the winner.
