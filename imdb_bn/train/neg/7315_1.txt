Ok let's get right to the dot. We have five recent college grads (f must be majored in the word) going outside a holiday camping trip. They ran for someone who needed help, but instead of helping him, they decided to burn him. A nice bunch of people Later on, some of them started to get sick - they would be in the water in the cabin they live in. Neighbors seem to be okay. Oh well, when things start to get really bad, they turn off one of them instead of getting help (by the way the neighbor tries to do it). Some local people do not take a choice of them. Until the truck broke, they left behind a single high speed ramp through wood for many miles. Ten minutes later he looked in the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get a mystery). Another type of surgery in the cabin feels some turmoil in the brain, so he hides in the cave to stop this cave. Then he decided to return to the cabin next day, believing it could be a kind of temple. She is giddy with the survival that she had survived (she must think it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is so fond of some friendly police officer. Another couple decides to sex when the meat eating bug is doing its magic, and then women realize that they have to wash their feet (taking shivers heavily on the skin with shaving cream). Anyway, you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These five people do not want to be friends. I was rooting for meat eating bacteria. Other characters were also somewhat ridiculous but completely unlike. Good life is lost in ninety minutes here.
