This result A part of the trash film that is not eligible to be categorized as a movie, it's just a film band of stuff in the movie, which does not give any sense. Returning to actors, which is available only seems to be a bunch of friends who think they will get a small amount of money together and try to create a movie that will be a terrific horror movie. Well this is a great horror, however, not having a film. There are lots of terrible acting in "Hobgoblins", but the bad guy named Bad Richard, who is a very weak way for those who are weak and even rooted too. Well, when you throw a bunch of friends and try to make the film scary, it's going to be less budget than shoe, not less. Oh well at least the MST3K version was pleasing. But it's still a horror film, which it all deserves to be bashing. 9 for MST version
