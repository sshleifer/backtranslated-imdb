I bought a DVD of this movie for my girlfriend, who shared the same name as a ghost girl in this movie and enjoyed unusual movies. The film was shot entirely on the video, so it has a special PBS appearance. Special effects are looking for Phoenie, but there are some scary moments in the movie which jumped on our seats. There is a special effective fear involved in the statue of a Virgin Mary. However, acting bad, the "plot" scene is long and very annoying, and I will tell you what I have done to have no sources what happened. If you get the movie, rent it, if you bought it, please make sure that you pay less than $ 5.
