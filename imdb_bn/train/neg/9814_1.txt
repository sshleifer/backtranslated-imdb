This kind of movie that you have regretted in your VCR. This is the version of "Stephen Kingdom" film "Missy (1990)" off some strange bad rip. I do not understand how the movie got 5.2 points, because there is no story, and when the movie finally ended, I was released. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie should be released as a small movie instead of spending much of the same thing. And as every bad movie, everything happens at the end of the movie within 10-15 minutes. So, before you decide to watch this movie, do not forget to do something new in your remote control battery, because you are fast moving forward ... do not worry, you will not miss any important thing.
