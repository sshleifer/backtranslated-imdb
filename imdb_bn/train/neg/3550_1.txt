I am running a group to stop the exploitation of comedians and I've spent the past 2 months listening to the horror stories from the comedians recently, who tried to scrutinize for the "latest comic standings". If they do not have any good agents, they will not get the chance to play more than 80% of their audiences, who can show someone who has their talent been rejected before returning! If they make it an audition, I am told that if it is "determined" then it is "predefined". So what TV viewers see is not the best comics in the US <br /> <br /> If they make a comic show, most of them will not get IMDB credits. I know this because I've been credited for all the 6 seasons of "last comic standing" and I do not pay for the producers to do the job. It's really an insult. A month ago, I asked, "the latest comic standing 7" on Facebook is why the producers are not giving IMDB credits and their Facebook pages are banned! I'm not a comedian, so I do not have this personal partner. I just want people to know the truth. I do not like to see anyone being exploited and so I'm helping the Comedians. Cambodians are exploited in HBO, BET, Tivon and other cable networks, but NBC is a major three networks. So they should be in charge to let this exploitation happen. <br /> <br /> Please watch this video in Comedy: Who is the victim: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMb4-hyet_Y
