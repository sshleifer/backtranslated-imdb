This is a problem with television movies, when there is nothing else to watch. I somehow sucked really bad movies. <br /> <br /> But this one was fairly watchable. The idea of ​​being the only remaining left on the earth after a comet, then makes me smile almost out to find zombies. And for this reason I gave this image 2 instead of 1. The story was stupid ... but the way you laugh laughing (very stupid> funny). <br /> <br /> I think I saw it because the guy from Star Trek was the leader. I was astonished to see him as a young man ... and he had any funny character.
