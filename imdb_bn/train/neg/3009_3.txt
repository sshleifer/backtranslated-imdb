The song that crawls on my head Not the greatest song, but it's 80's. This film is a lead singer who "threatened" when he sang his girlfriend backing vocals on his band in connection with the murder. The lead singer Huss is the name Billy "I" (yes, right) has died two years later, and his band has returned for the concert, only the backup singer is the lead singer of this period. Billy shes his stalks and finally imagines things that are wrong with him and think of killing all these people and making the girl fear and making people around him. He finally went to a virgin and decided to dig his grave if he is still there. He sees that he is dead but still see and hear his voice. At the end of the film we found the reason for all these reasons, Billy is a brother John (OK) and John admits that he was jealous for his brother and he killed them to return to all of them. Blame his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize him because he is crazy about him. The last too cheezy and played very long and wooden. But .... I like it anyway. I see it for the song. I wish it was.
