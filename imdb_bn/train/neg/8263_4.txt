'Mozo' is a fiftieth century London, the world of growing rockers, surrendering to violence and homosexuality. 'Mozo' often uses a technique for shooting in the 1950s that emphasizes physical differences for our time, but represents the conversation in highly exaggerated fashion. Though people actually say such things outside of the movie, I have no idea, but today no film has been made and using such style-based languages ​​set in contemporary times. It seems that writers of the 1950s have been working in the context of a common shorthand for the past, which is, in fact, a very remote country; And therefore the story is universal, rather specific, the pressure on. There is a strong performance among Mozo's Ian Hart and Eden Gilan and Ian Brenner's boring people, who are still struggling to build a post-trajectory career; But think like a piece of time, a modern film is unconsciously formed into an old idiom. Rather dull, actually.
