I was willing to go with the intention of the original _Cruel ._ It went along with the plot and one of my favorite stories is true of the characters. However, this film was, in my opinion, a continuous Rehash with essentially the lines of the same story and any transparent character choices. I honestly do not care what happened to any of them. The most powerful part of the original story (Les Leones, not CI) characters and their interaction, not the events themselves. Before reading the IMDB, I was not clear that this film was called an estimation, in particular the title contained a number "2", but I hope for a sequel, but then it was determined that it must be a partner part. After all, I must say that this film is just like a soft pornographic version of Les Leonon. I was not impressed.
