Let me be really clear about this movie. I did not see this movie because of the plot, I see it for a sexually explicit scene. It is said that this film is so terrible God that I flip to see a religious body of Tasize (Mandy Schaffer) and show the extreme joy of seeing me in a plot of disaster. <br /> <br /> The first scene of the movie of Spoiler Alert makes me hesitant. You have portrayed a woman with Lakeside, pure joy and neutral, then comes to a beautiful girl and asks if she can draw beside her. When they end, they showed each other ... and when the woman draws a veneer, she faces the lecture fanning. What kind of sculble director would this kind of mistake? And in the other scene, Trasy killed his teacher's lover and then he swims, and no police in the city suspects him. I mean heluboo? Mandy does not wear a gladden? Its finger prints are all on Allah Almighty Boat !! Then, whenever Mandy is around, it becomes the worst, there is a "cool" word that sounds like a cat on her bed. This is a real sad Rosanna Arquette's this movie. I'm really sorry for this super low budget soft-porn star no brainer. For the same movie Jurgen Prokov, who also made the film unhappy. All, 2/10
