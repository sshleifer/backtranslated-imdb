I was surprised to see some reviews of this photo. The only place that seems to be true is RottenTomatoes.com. This picture is awful. The plot is very lazy. It's not scary. Those who believe that Sarah Michelle Geller is growing up because this is how it should be forgotten. This film is more like Dark Water, except this is a much more expected and slow motion. I was extremely disappointed with this photo. Do not fear me and do not care about me. Let's face it, such a plot has been executed at this stage. The dead are trying to communicate with the survivors - dragonfly, hat lease benath, ghost story, dark water, darkness, changing etc. I think that nowadays there are only Japanese and Koreans to write original horror films. Such films out of Hollywood are not respected to the audience, sophisticated exercises for money laundering. They're just slowing down
