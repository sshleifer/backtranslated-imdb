I know there was a problem with the Casper van Diem as the character of Chen. I should know. Words can not describe, nor do they justify how terrible this movie is. But please try to describe it to me: terrible acting, terrible dialogue, a little bit of the situation and you get this feeling that you are going to force - Trinity is eating trust and propendanda from the broadcast network. A weak attempt to show Hollywood is that a movie can be entertaining and deep, religious messages are connected to it. They sadly failed. It was mostly the worst movie I saw.
