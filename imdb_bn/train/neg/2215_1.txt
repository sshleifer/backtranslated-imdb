This tragedy of this woman was that her former ex-boyfriend might have thought she was dead, but actually her scientist made a spell on her to bring him back to this truly cute shark. Kind of like beauty and seed. It is probably a Bollywood dance scene and probably some singers may use candlesticks, but instead there are some beautiful grape trees. They make this girl really radioactive, so she gives herself to the whole film through sharks instead of scratches. The scientist is a good father who tries to reunite his harmful shark son with the woman involved, even he arranges for them to make sex time personal, but this woman is actually a shallow graduate and a shark-guy is a ugly, icky monster and Do not want to do anything with her. She gave up the love! Because it was just a shark! I thought it was so tragic that he had to kiss him and he would be restored and they would live happily ever after, but this is not such a movie.
