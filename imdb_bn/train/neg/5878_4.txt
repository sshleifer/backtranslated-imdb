The front cover says "our time, for our time". <br /> <br /> I had read this illustrated version of Hamlet directly by seeing the version of Kenneth Branhgh and it was a really frustrating experience. <BR> <br /> This version takes different views from different aspects of the game with sex; An interesting interaction between a very gay homosexual and Hamlet and Oophila. I think for a time (60's) it was a very good version of Hamlet but could not compare with the full version of Branaghg. <br /> <br /> Just a note ... I have found the video on my local video store in Australia) and if I actually buy a thing that's a Keneth Branagh DVD looking for. Tell me if anyone knows.
