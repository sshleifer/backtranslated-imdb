** Speaker ** <br /> <br /> This is a BAD movie. Seriously Acting absolutely terrible, FX is dreadfull and down intriguing plot. But hey, so bad that his fun! The script is so enjoyable that its enjoyable! You just have to cringe and laugh like "I guess you think that you're crying." Women flash their breasts at Crocodile. That's the reason I come because of her bad! So terrible joke that they are funny! But after a while the film became just as shaky. I really started to fall asleep Although believe me, the stoching of plastic crochet feet on the plates and the constant strokes of the crock laces make you laugh for a long time. Although I want to say that it was a cool part when the cross had trapped the couple and hanged from there for a while. Hehehehe Munnham movie, which will be nominated for MSST 3 line !!
