I love a good fight film and I have been "there, that works" category. So I want to think of my review as a correct one (IMHO). Watching this movie on DVD, I can safely say that it was a shield of trash. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, work experience can be a barrier, so I'm a little cold. But when the trailer wheel was closed in the beginning, it seemed to me that this image would be an expected nod ... I was right. <br /> <br /> <br /> There was no logic for the EOD scene. I was just rebel against most of the army team on either side of the command wire or remote trigger. So much time I had left my head scratching all the time. Then when you think that the stories of the hummies are going, then they have gone out of their own driving around the desert. One of the most valuable resources of the theater on a jolly bumping in some Sas Wannabe contractors is one. <br /> <br /> The sniper scene was just so ridiculous. It's just made in no sense and want me to switch there and then. Then I tried to stretch it out for my patience to stretch it. It started with "right" and quickly moved to the mountain. If you have a Brit accent, you've got a shot, but if you are part of the EOD team, then suddenly you were a great shot and saved it. Yet, as you think it is not extended to a story, it is extended for a prolonged period. You are just looking left and asking why it did not end? <br /> <br /> Then we had a warm view where they hit each other laughing ... Another scene where you wanted to finish it. <br /> <br /> <br /> Then my life said very slowly, the main star went outside to look out for someone. This will be the most ridiculous scenario I've ever seen. It all argued and resisted the ability to write a good story ... It was stupid and terrible. I still can not understand why they waste time. Then, seeing him just mess with a busy street coming back to the camp, I laughing around the floor with a smile. Pure comedy :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> I thought it was going to be a stupid unreasonable EOD scene, but then it was trying to do something different, moving to the tunes. But as soon as I tried it, he killed me. All I wanted wanted to end it. It was a messy set of stupid scenes of stupid, stupid, mixed in a batch of action (ish) scenes. <br /> <br /> I have no way to recommend this. Maybe my work experience should understand the benefits of compromise but even naive this should not be realized. The only stupid thing in this film is the high IMDb rating ... which should definitely be 24 by the Box Office PR who use this website as a way to make everyone feel better. Sorry guys ... this is not just! <br /> <br /> is not recommended ... it will give birth only to you.
