"Smoky and The Bandit" was not exactly Shakespeare, but then someone wanted to be it. It was a slapstick to decrease, but it has the brain. It was a very smart script with a specific character and a fun wrap-up. People came out of laughter theater. This is what "Hooper" is available. There is no reason to smile. If it is respected to the Hollywood stuntman, it shows lazily lazyly showing nothing but bad scenes of them, and an inconsistent car-jumps I've ever seen. It all looks defective, almost badly-filmed. The poor Sally Field (the girlfriend who wanders on her right way) does not have her solo or smart line ("If you do that jump I will not be back here") her weak role. Bart Reynolds looks at the camera and the bed, but the joke is such a listener who is sitting with "Hooper". * ****
