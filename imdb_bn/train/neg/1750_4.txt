Preeraheran's Hira Ferry was a beautiful situation comedy, but this film was actually a short story, but it is funny but unreasonable <br /> <br /> Although they are not a true story, it does manage a good flow, though it is not a good one <br /> <br /> There are two funny scenes from the first half, where Akshay and John one day call for lunch and on the other hand when Parsha enters <br /> <br /> <br /> The first half Slowly annoying but in the second half <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, playing stages but it is funny but the picture suddenly disappears <br /> <br /> Directions are fine music <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar Its part is excel, which has now become its second skin, but it is <br/> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Sometimes there are so many and painful, Nargis, Daisies and Nitu (only moments Neetu is now), but very often the good times manaja Joshi's okay.
