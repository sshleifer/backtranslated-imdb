This picture is judged by some as classic - I do not know why. It's a scary point horrible. The only saving grace with this movie is to provide chess lines which are so embarrassing that they have no choice but to laugh at you. <br /> <br /> There are some good songs and good dances. Film, but so what! There is no plot, it is set with no changes visible in a theater, and Michael Douglas is depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to see this picture because he said, I will not believe how bad a movie is! She was right. Generally, this film with this horror, I would recommend that people should not see it, but in this case I think people should do this, since it has all the bad films you saw in the point of view.
