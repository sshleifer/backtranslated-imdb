Now Ch (2008) has finished its relatively small Australian movie run (after publishing 1 screen in 62 seconds after Sydney), I can shamelessly join Steven Soderbergh on both hosts of "At the Movies" to utilize. <Br /> <br /> This is usually a film director who is happy to change his style / subject, but Sodberg's most recent stinker, The Girlfriend Experience (2009), was also missing a story, so descriptive (and edited?) Suddenly Soderberg's main challenge Wonderful, business-20-year-old afterwards. He was probably not very good at the story, he just hid it in "pure" projects. <br /> <br /> None of these says that this current is almost a failure. As David Stratton warned, "Cheer's two parts do not even complete". <br /> <br /> Only Epic Biopic, Che (2008) rarely qualifies as a feature film! It certainly does not have any footing, so in addition to emphasizing its irrational final resolution history, Soderberg's 4.5 hour long distance just goes away. <br /> <br /> Also mentioned about Margaret Pomeranz, more forgiving duo of Australia's movie, Soderbergh's repetitive waste (HD Digital storage): "You're in wood ... you're in wood ... you're in woods. .. ". I am very surprised that Soderberg is not giving us another 25 hours in two parts, because he has left a great part of Che's "revolutionary" life! <br /> <br /> For the biology of an important but notorious historical personality, if sodgerberg is deliberately humiliated, his deliberately humiliated <br /> 1. Never give up the story of the challenge; <br /> <br /> impossibly with irreversible film length repeat sheer dullard; <br /> <br /> ignoring both true hindsight and a story of events; <br /> <br /> 4. Sometime a concept, or developing a character; <br /> <br /> 5. Remaining claustrophobically episodic; <br /> <br /> 6. In the appropriate context for the scene ignored - we get thrown into interrupted timeshifts; <br /> <br /> 7. Confused by all linguistically linguistically (even Spanish-speakers would be confused with incompatible exposition in English); And <br /> <br /> 8. pointlessly whitewashing its main theme at one level. Why, this late phase? T-shirt franchise has been successful! <br /> <br /> Our clustrophobia concept is based entirely on the script of Guevara's memoirs due to Peter Bookman and Benjamin Vander Vane. So, like a poor student, who reads only one of his assigned assignments for his appointment, the sodergerg product is very limited from the point of view. <br /> <br /> The audience is kept in the same intelligent knowledge, views and situations. "Revolutionists", but that does not express our sympathy. Instead, it emphasizes us that "Ah, Soderberg tried to do the same to Latina Farmers as its audience". But this is the same uneducated Latino farmer who sold good doctors to his enemies. Why do Soderbergh think of our equation with them, and keep us mentally confined? <br/> <br /> Part 2 is more chronicological than Part 1, but it literally makes her repetitive Bush-annoying, anguished with anguish, and the lack of variety or character array. There is no chance to grow like a person in the struggle to educate Deloore's own weakly trained soldiers. The challenge is the only interesting thing, that Che sometimes works with deeply unconscious "revolutionaries", some of whom lack the self-control around local farmers or food. We certainly did not get any insight because of a strategic analysis like the guerrilla rebellion, as it was. <br /> <br /> The incentive count of Part 2 remains horribly spiritual: again, telegraph or nothing relevant. That's how Fidel Castro's (Damian Bichir) scenes are unexpected and annoying. Any selected events are minimally and Latino-centered, Part 1 interviews were corrupted by the president of the Bolivian Corruption (Joakim de Almeida) and US government officials, with the commitment of CIA interference (!) To time-relocation meetings. <br /> <br /> "Wood" of Part 2 and night blue filter makes the audience excited until they go out. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Delto's many non-American Latinoos did not have the feeling of disappointment, a true, vague history of Che's exploitation in their own country. When foreign governments still do not provide free news to their people - for any reason - how can a popular American indie producer hugging ("I may not be able to read or write, but I am uneducated!" - CF. Inspector General (1949)) in their own local films The obvious negligence of the film and the general simplicity of the whole thing strongly indicates that it only achieves the understanding of low-intelligent WHO Split Little English. If they did, they could already read Thames on the subject and criticize the relevant social problems among themselves - the lessons learned in history should be as much as possible <br /> <br /> Such insights still need the needs of society - and the rest of Central and South America Uneducated latino - yet Che (2008) failed to deliver wildly. Soderbergh buries his lead because he is descriptive. Why I was forced to choose Sadarbarg for this project deliberately by Bensio delto. At the age of 44, Guevara had a great disappointment: I was going to see this picture, but the director bravely looted it. Australia's author David Struton, 03 October 2009) saw that Part 1 was "disrespectful", Part 2 actually "goes faster", "describes the final campaign in Bolivia" which "describes". .. almost helplessly slowly and wasted. " Che: The Guerrilla Ur Part 2 is certainly not a travelogue for Bolivia, it is painting painting painting and aristocracy. The entire second half was released only through the ridiculous humor and dramatic - yet sad - capture the film's subject and execute execution. <br /> <br /> The rest of this great movie is just confusing, annoying misery - for Soderbergh's film, shockingly, all costs will be avoided. Those who know only a shiny about this subject are bound to break their hearts. (2/10)
