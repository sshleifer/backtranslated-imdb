John Carradine, John Ireland and Fheyth Durguru, who have seen the best days of good film in good films, have gathered together for this grade G horror movie about the life of imitation industry in this mysterious palace. <br /> <br /> It was good for Kar Carine to work on anything that happened in the last two decades of his career, in that case it was good to work and it was good to get the tasks you did. With his wonderful golden voice, Caradine was always in great need for a horror film and at least the discrimination did not happen in the scene he saw. He plays an old Gothic Manlan caretaker who has been nominated by film director John Ireland for his latest budget slasher film. It even got a cemetery, but with a missing occupant. Believing Domergue is Ireland's oldest star and young ingenue of Carol Wales. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes or so most of the cast air is dead that are dead already dead. The script is so inconsistent, I'm still trying to find the point. I will not waste it on any gray matter.
