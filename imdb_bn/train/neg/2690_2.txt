Hey, if you find it very exciting to draw a little more than an hour and find color, then I would recommend it. If you like cheap B-movies like me, it's good for a goggle! Otherwise, I do not advise you to rent, I will wait until the tube is available at round 4 in the free access channel of your cable / satellite provider. After almost two years after the flash, the band playing this soundtrack on the street, and they could survive badly just like the reviews of two small cities found on them. So if you are good to watch again but it is good to see how good it will be if you do not see the good budget movie.
