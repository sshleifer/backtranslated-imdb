So at the beginning of this movie I had low expectations, but it failed to meet them even. Although there were some interesting parts, even one or two began to laugh aloud, I would say it was very good that the film was very good. Funny jokes were unexpected and very fast, we were sitting there "WTF is right?" In addition, there were a few jokes that just dragged on and over and over. The part where he fell down the mountain was yawning me. Also, the editing was really lacking. There was some poor scene transfer, but that seems to be the style of nowadays. It laughs me, but I will not see it again, and I'm very happy that I waited for the rental. Give it a chance, you can enjoy it, but you do not feel like a 40-year-old virgin, or superbood.
