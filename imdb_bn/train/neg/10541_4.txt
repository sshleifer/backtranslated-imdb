I wrote a few notes on the first lightning, 1990's serial killer UPP hellfish of Lumbe Diamond Phillips ... ... <br /> 1) Lou Diamond Phillips was recently accused of beating his wife and could spend time in prison . I hope he can get away from Armanine's prison style: One of the convictions of this film is that his assassin has a $ 4500 designer overcott, $ 7300 designer silk suit, and $ 3500 / Los Angeles watching Messi Van der Roi with Bachelor's PAD Loft <br /> <br /> 2) The leading lady Tracy Phillips is the skin of fine porcelain skin, red hair flowing, which always brightens the torch and even amazing breasts. Sadly, by the second half of the film, designer Silk Pulov, she is still in her dust while preparing for her devotion to the devil. At least in the 1970's, our fraudulent killers made their victims unexpected before fleeing with them, even though imagination had to say something to spare. Occupational psychologist living in Los Angeles can afford condoms worth $ 4 million in Mulholland Drive to Los Angeles. A scene that will decide on Brad Pitt that he hates it. In fact, the condominium used in this film looks similar to David Lynch's Mulhalandal DR. It was a good idea to be a comedian's successful film director. In front of the only professional psychology outside of this movie, I am providing prison sentence for jail fraud. <br /> <br /> 4) I forget her name but the villain in this movie is amazing, and her best phrase "Phantom Movie" can be found in the "It's going to be like", "Lady!" 2. From Crispowar. <br /> <br /> The bottom of the main metropolitan cities is the huge VAT of acid siming that will explode in a big fire if someone throws the lip in Jeeppo, causing everyone to have the main public water park plant. The idea of ​​smokers around the water is not expected, but the symptoms of smoking are plastered on them. And since the gypco lighterers need to be filled with light liquids which are often leaked out and can be absorbed by clothing, your $ 7300 Gucci silk case pocket-carrying concept tells me to be more dangerous. Stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least, and one of the fun things to look at is that you are not seeing special effects on computer assistants but risk real life and organs to contribute to actual stuntspoles. A film that earned almost universal BOMB ratings from critics during the War of Liberation. The satanists of the movie always amazed me: Here is a person who has tapped into some Luciferian bids for power, and instead of using it to enrich itself or fashion models, it is free to associate sex with them. Make some useful, instead the bags are women and their people have been kept out of apartments. Here, a man who speaks inappropriately, can fly and enter other people's body - and yet he forces Star Laum Diamond Phillips with a common boxing fight in conjunction with the film, but his feelings like having Arnold Schwarzenegger or Apollo He is sure to win that <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> As long as you refuse to take it seriously, you will find it interesting. <br /> <br /> 4/10
