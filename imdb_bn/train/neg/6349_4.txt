Woody Allen has created the greatest comedy of all time, and I seriously say that Annie is the best movie ever, but if I really think about it, then perhaps one or two would probably be better, but it would be difficult. It is not as good as the Manhattan Murderer Mystery and Sweet and Lodown, but she was never fascinated before a movie like Melinda and Melinda. Not too tired and so miraculous, his movies are usually diverse and ridiculous but how it happened, is it still our good old woody? The plot runs out to four who are four friends with dinner together. One of the two plays and one of the other interesting stories that happened to his friend. It is about a young woman who exploded in a dinner party unexpected. We have never heard of everyone else because whether it will debate whether it will make a good comedy or a tragedy. We start to see two points. Both of these women named Melinda are having problems with the drug and her ex-husband. In the tragedy, he is an old family friend who has no objection to his old friend's front door, after trying to commit suicide. Comedy Hall of Melidara sank in a dinner party after 28 popping in the sleeping pile. Both incidents go into the winds of a wild cyclone, which sometimes does not fit in senses or together, or laugh once or twice more. Radha Mitchell and Will Ferrey have some excellent performances but they themselves can not fit together. They will not be able to stop drowning more than most of the other films this year.
