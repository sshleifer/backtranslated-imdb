The only thing that often pops in my head when I write this review, I will not get back that hour and a half !!! To indicate that I'm not just going out of the air, I will compare the cinema with the cube triangle (dense and hypercock ube) to other movies! The density was not great, but it was original and it was made for some technical flaws! Hypercube ube lost a signal basicity advantage but it came out looking quite sharp and I loved the story better than even the cube (the story was good)! But dense zero is not really equal to sh * t compared to its previous predecessors! The complete lack of good Fx, a very f * ck * d script and not only plain old bad acting is well combined! Example: Always in the movie time I was thinking it would be incredibly stupid ... if it could happen and then it could happen, so this is not very original! My suggestion: Do not lose that hour and a half that I lost !!!!!!!! Oh and I hope this movie crashes and burns !!!!!!!
