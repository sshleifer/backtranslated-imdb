I was absolutely moral in this movie. I mean, how would you feel if you left your wedding day for your cousin ??? I will be disappointed !! It is classified as a comedy but I found it interesting. I found it mostly cheap smile and took them out. I usually love Julie Style movies, but it's an exception. Jason Lee has played another disgraceful show, which again proves that class and decent ethics are not relevant in today's society. It was completely lacking in taste and I ignore movies like this. I understand that people will protect this movie and its morals because it's just a movie, but I'm still standing by my mark that this bad behavior should not be allowed on the screen. I'm not trying to say that if you enjoy this movie then you are a bad person, because everyone has its own opinion and parts of this movie were enjoyable, I'm just saying that in the real life, the people acting like this character was shameful.
