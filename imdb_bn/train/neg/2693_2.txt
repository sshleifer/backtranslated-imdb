<br /> <br /> Although the main actress Stringing is beautiful, this plot has become a cause of recognition for a little reason because there are many confusing details in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> Someone can believe that mid-age teenage school girls know very little about 30-year-olds who got upset by their virginity in the mid-1950s, but I doubt. <br /> <br /> Some people can believe that the young high school adolescents are confident and confident, because they communicate with their parents in complex social situations, but my experience is examined in the adult world, and the children behave very painful and unreasonable. Some people can believe that an experienced medical doctor does not know the acute drug in Straptomycin - the aromatic bacteria of busy earth germs - and it does not detect that some useless soft powder mesh, but I do not think so. </ br> <br /> Someone may believe that 30-year-old-age problems can get in and enter inside, a school is a public school ritch during social events and causes problems, but I think The school that is socially traditionally a protected environment and parents, chappals and school staff are very close to it. <br /> <br /> Five teenage friends, O O Babu Riba, have called themselves quadrupeds, on a final night. Perhaps an explanation was probably why five were four, but because it was not detailed, each reference distracts from each scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not true for me.
