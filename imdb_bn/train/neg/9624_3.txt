Possible this step was considered, the reality was frustrating. Although Jennifer Aniston of the movie is always happy to see, even she could not move around. Most of the work was expected. The joke was gentlely amusing plane. And the characters were not very interesting. I wanted to like this picture, but it never happened. Ben Stirler "There's something about Mary" was sunny. It seems he's just going through the speed. If they had to lift the plots from "friends", they should know that they were wrong. Toilet humor must be in the colate :-) <br /> <br /> Instead of "50 first dates" see.
