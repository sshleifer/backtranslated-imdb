0 * Christian Slater, They Reid, Stephen Dorf, Frank C. Turner, Matthew Walker, Will Sanderson. Managed by Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> The attempt to rebuild this game in an action-packed nail bitter based on video game director Uweb Bowl is not sadly successful. Instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made! Although he has got minor celebrities such as Christian Slater, his Red and Stephen Dorf, but his film lacks the essential principles that can be a film that is as good as a storyline, and some basic relativity to what is going on in the dark and in the light. The film revolves around and there is no creative control for the Uwe bow. And used on making monsters not to mention the bad CGI. Although they were good in cold look and feedings, a little hair. Verily this is one of the worst movies ever made. My final rating is 0/10.
