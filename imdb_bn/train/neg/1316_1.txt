Before finally being part of the group, Stan Lorl and Oliver Hardy had extensive (separate) film careers. For Oli's pre-stan films, he was billed on the screen as Bobby ... and in her adult life, Hardie was known as 'Babe' by her friends. With Bernard Dellfonte for music-hall Acton, England's Foreign Minister gave an interview to journalist John McCabe, in which he explained the source of this nickname: At the beginning of his acting career, Hardy received a cheek from a gay hair itch, Hardy's thick cheek (his face Over) and said, 'Excellent baby!' Hardie's colleagues started crying to him 'Bab', and stuck in the nickname. <br /> <br /> Hardy's pre-laurel work is a lot of fun - but his comedy role in support of Larry Saman and Chaplin Imitator Billy West is noteworthy. - His team work with Billy Rouge (K?), A low-budget shorts series for the Vime Comedy Film Company, is really scary. Hardy and Rouge have been given the screen name Plump and Run: The names are unpleasant to their own rights, but worse because the runge (even if smaller than Hardie) is not particularly a runte. Here's a look at Hardy Lorel in his first haul ranching films ... but without spit and radioactive little trouble. <br /> <br /> 'A lot of things', the most ordinary plant and the epic of the curtain, very strange ... and its conflict has become even more evident that this movie is the most ridiculous movie of 'That's My Wife', Lorel and Hardy. There is only one of them. Plumber (Hardy) Star Boarding owned by a star-tall land in a roaming-house. Route is the porter. Plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle John, whose fault he is expected to inherit. His uncle is coming to see him and is coming to meet Plump's wife and baby. There is only one problem: the plump does not have a wife and baby. He was lying to his uncle for a family people to think. Now, of course, Root hopes that Runt will seek wife and children in her short notice. Of course, the results are crushing. It would be nice if it was fantastic results, but they did not. The most funny humor is only empty crystals here, the characters push each other to the bathtub and set their arguments. <br /> <br /> The speakers are coming. Will the director Will Willie (who?) Does not show any tendency for camera framing: the actress who plays landlady, is significantly taller than Hardy, and Louis continuously sets her shot so that she heads out of the frame. This may be fun if put on purpose, but it is merely inefficient. At one stage of this bad comedy, there is a highly tasteless gog on the horizon as the Runt approaching a black londress. 'Surely they will not push to laugh,' I thought. But they do not. The runte steals the girl's black child and tries to close this band as the descendant of Plump. <br /> <br /> Somehow, Plum purchases a baby's ribs, but it still has no children. Uncle is coming to the stairs, a lot of concerted runt for childhood. This gog probably has worked with a dwarf, or even a genuine runner-size actor like Chester Conklin, but Billy's Rouge is less than the average height. A child in the house is not incapable or trustworthy, and the young man must be fully motivated to fall for him. Amazingly, he does! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The marriage was not happy, although Hardie's marital troubles never earned the proportion of the epic of Stan Lawrence. <br /> <br /> Only one thing in this movie has impressed me. Hardy has a very short flashback sequence with a bath smack reminding me about his seaside romance. There was still no standard film grammar to send Flashbacks in 1916: The image shown here is impressively and easy. Very bad this movie has no other qualifications. On Oliver Hardy's CV, 'One to a lot' is definitely a movie, and I will rate this movie only one point out of 10. Lorele and Hardie are a lot more fun than they are apart.
