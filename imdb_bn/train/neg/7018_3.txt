Completely forgettable. Especially because of acting poorly. I saw this first movie with Dais Shepard. After my surprise, he was around the end of the 90's. I thought he was a new actor, because his acting was so colorful. I could say the same about Liv Tyler. Although I saw him in other films well, he gave Claire Cooper a strange personality. Live is not an actress capable of enabling Dion Keaton as a fiery, mental personality, but it was quite strange to see her lines in its wonderful mode. It seems that there was not only good chemistry among actors, and I think Diane Keaton could understand that way. She is a superb actress, but this movie only takes a bit at the top. I think he wanted to get this movie as soon as possible. I will not blame him.
