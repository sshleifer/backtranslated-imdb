I hope the British character is the story of the actor and the beautiful photography of the 1950s and I hope this movie will be more entertaining. Unfortunately, I grabbed it for the wrong reasons - I could not believe how awful it was. I must have seen thousands of old films and are always ready to make allowances for their timings, but it was really hard. <br /> <br /> As one has pointed out, a big problem is that it does not seem to be what it wants: a gentle romantic comedy, a snapstick comedy or a musical. When I suddenly broke the song in 15 minutes by Jenny Carson, I got a little pale! It is not believable at any stage, the story itself or at any time, Daisy can never show any turmoil. Among other things excluded from credibility are as a songwriter of civilized Donald Synden (a writer for God!), He has actually called Diana Doras for a drunk and there is little interest in him (meaning Diana Doors! Come on!) And a song A funny scene in the publisher's office. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> I said, the way.
