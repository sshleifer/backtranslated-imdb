I can not believe Guillero del Toro and Kim Buckinger's favorite holes involved! This script is so poorly written and the director is so hard to find one-dimensional character in a film that is so weak (both by the same person). Dialogues are so long that these so-called thrillers enter the theater and smile among some fools. The setup is tricky, inviting you to invite you to see a Chilling Thriller and suddenly it becomes the most stupid torture film. Bussyger's character is so stupid, he really shouted to God, "Where are you?" So people can follow him, and then take a leak !!!! And then he apparently entered into the smallest wood in the world, that is, he runs in all places and murderers never keep an eye on him, and this happens in the middle of the night. It really makes me amazed, the best writers of Hollywood can discover that they spend millions of dollars making it.
