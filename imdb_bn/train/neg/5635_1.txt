I also like Duffo as an actor but really spend some hours in my life, I still can not believe I could see it completely. Was the movie really a point? And the finale, well, I was happy that I never paid to see this terrible continuous piece of film on the cruel plea! <br /> <br /> Did Dapho marry a wedding actress in this movie or see if she used to try to start her career, if she is so scared that it has failed? I hope I can post this movie, even if 1 person gives attention to my opinion and decides that they will see paint drying scenes but I think I did something good in the world. If I was the same Suggestions ...
