During the war of liberation at the beginning of 2000, this movie started the liberation war with liberation war. <br /> <br /> The picture looks like 70 but looks like a strange comedy for 2000 <br /> <br /> Some classic gems from the film: Paresh Rawal I do not understand his role or laugh : In the village, he is going to find his ground. The worst part when he understands Anil's hidden mystery, he kept his stomach secret, which grew up and considered him pregnant, when I remember my childhood my teacher I told the same funny alias !!!! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said, we have rejected Harisacha for the youth of Ravina Harishka, whereas power Aruna is playing son of Iran, who make the most serious mistake of both. <br /> <br /> Instructions are outdated, music is bad! <br /> <br /> Anil rigorously tries hard to see the very old and old role very young enough to still look good in the line of effort, Rabindra is very right. Harish bad power is terrible. Aruna is normal in the Iranian as Rajinikanth is right in a camio
