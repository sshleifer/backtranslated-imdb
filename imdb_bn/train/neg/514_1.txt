This is one of the most cruel, inexhaustible, unreasonable and stupid movies! Like everyone involved in this project, it does not try to create an interesting movie. It is nothing but the continuation of a tedious series of films trying to cash out for the success of Smoky and Bandit, which I think is their best film. For this waste of film stock, Bert Reynolds is not letting his actor sleeping in the whole movie, the Jim Nabars are wasted, the other actors are not too much, the car race is probably uninspired by the stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and more dust than the scenes of looking at the walls for two hours. And useless "Stroke S" is simply an extra movie with nothing unique or unique to it.
