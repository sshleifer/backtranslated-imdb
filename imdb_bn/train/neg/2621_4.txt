I do not have to bring a child below 8 years to see this. Dogs roam through hazardous machines and quarrel with dangerous machines, and laughing at some of the crew's horrifying hearings, they are completely more secretive for a small child. <br /> <br /> The live action gives a more harmful feeling than the cartoon version, and there are some people who think that transvestite is a lot of imaginary moments that can be thought of and furious. Kids <br /> <br /> <br /> I do not know what the Disney people thought, but the stories did not play in their normal level. Puppy is beautiful but this movie is the best spotty.
