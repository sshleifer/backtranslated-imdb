This movie is not suckered in the rent. It does not have to do anything to escape the death penalty despite the English title. I can not think of a good thing to say about movies. Poor performance, poor editing, poor direction ... ridiculous "plot", and the sound / music was so annoying, it does not come with a wonderful label. The only possible way to sit through this movie and enjoy it is its historical pity quality. They just do not have this bad movie anymore.
