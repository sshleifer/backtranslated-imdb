This image is so incredible; - The whole courtyard is Bunkum; The fact that a serial killer (vampire or otherwise) unexpectedly fly about and filmmakers could kill as many people is ridiculous of that fact. In the left lagosi movie you will not find the vampire's place. Most actors should be treated for dry absorption of so many wood actors. I'm waiting for the day when someone creates an exceptional movie from Steven King's novel (Exception, probably, by my stand). The film is mostly suffers from what Stephen King has done - "special effects", lack of money used for poor actors, insulting characterization and dialogue. This image is cheap, tacky and tries to do everything that fails.
