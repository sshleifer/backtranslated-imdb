*** Spinners *** Let's start this movie with "Good" - Cynthia Rothrak and Richard Norton's acting performance. The rest of the acting is awful (not supported by this unreasonable script). The worst criminal is Villen, Bento, head of the Crime Syndicate of Asia (played by Tumbuian of France). I laughed laughing laughing at my head and laughed and laughed and said to me, terrible performance. Patrick Muldun was not very good, and his "This was a hostile takeover" line (which left the title of this movie) was distributed as badly as it could. There is no other major character, but another actor / actress has separated himself in this film. We come to the next plot. This is what you must know, which you must know: The original "anger and honor", Cynthia Rothrak, who played Chris Fairchild, was a teacher in the inner city. Now, he's a CIA. The agent (or it was another government agency - sorry, but I did not remember that this picture was so bad). Hmmm ... I can imagine that the CIA The application was like the process. Interview: Do you have a job experience in the past? Chris: I was a teacher. Interview: OK You're renting! I can only give it a "2" because of a slightly better performance and a nice plot to the end (although we know that Tommy (Muldoon) will be caught in a secret villa).
