We all know that Hollywood changes almost historical events for our enjoyment, and 44 minutes is one of the hollywood movies. For example, the robbers of the bank started shooting at the LAPD and never returned to the bank, but still in the movie we returned them twice! Another example is the number of LAPD officers who shot at the end of the film, far from the truth! However, Hollywood's bloody should be tired so that they add more blood and throat. Some events were mixed and most of the lead actors played different people, but why did this blog always complain about this work? I think the only sad part is that I have seen a few hour long documentary about the North Hollywood shootout in TLC, which was so good!
