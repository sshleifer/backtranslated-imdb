This movie is so bad, you almost feel it contaminated. In fact, when it is finished, there is a strong feeling of relief, you can get the cassette back on the reissender and bring it back to the RUSH video rental shop before polluting the rest of your video. I joked when we hired it that it was like a movie where William Heart would "phone" her performance. I mean that he will not try very hard. But see, in this large picture, visible bill heart is actually a phone! Our perception of this animosity was the only pleasure we received from this confusing mess. Cinematography and editing are furious and intelligent, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is simply audible. There is very little similarity with "Folling Down", but the film has a brave story-line, great writing and acting and an engaging soundtrack. "Malicious Man" is a bit like the old European tourist trap, and it's like driving along some unfamiliar back roads in an unknown country, where you keep the windshield in the night without the language after the fog. Do you get pictures Do not get this one.
