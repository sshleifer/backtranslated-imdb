First of all, there are some good things about this film, but it is a combination of all the clich√© slash material in a teen film. In the advertisement of this movie, I saw that Dennis Richards is in, but he is a poor actress and people are not good at trying to find him. That has to do with that movie). And that's what they all give? Perhaps it is part of the character, but as I said, acting ... even though the writing is good. You know who it is across the movie, and you can predict what's going to happen around, but not in an irritating way. I believe it's probably the book based on the plot line, probably better, but next time I will read books to find out compared to this watch.
