If the initial story is not so big, you can not really go away. Dopi is the only basis of the cyberbase required. <br /> <br /> Script Bloss'. There is not a lot to do with the actors. Set-cut costs are cut in the desert. This is a trademark if the background is desert, but there is no budget for the movie. <br /> <br /> Okay if there is a budget deficit. "Solarbabbis" and "Champions of Blood" are examples of suitable work for any job. But cameraman seems to be tearing out their tweaks for buying a sandwich together, this movie looks like this. Again, forgiving only if the story is not easily sucked. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is the biggest crime: it does not end! It simply ends so that it is a commercial break from the rest of the movie. But the rest do not come. Just curious <br /> <br /> Just bad.
