My friends and I hired it from Blockbuster because we saw the names of the visitors in the box. This movie is a barbarity. I hope he will play a negative role in his CV. <br /> <br /> "The plot" was lost and defective, the acting was mostly dry and unbearable. Make no sense in the movie. An alien parasite species, which has infected humans, has made films with much better script than that, for example, body graduation and faculty attacks. <br /> <br /> If you have ever seen this movie unfortunate, I would suggest you burn it. <br /> <br /> This makes it a great movie as a horror movie, when there is no use of fear, suspicion, pride, terrorism or a common horror movie. I do not know the tricks, but if you still want to see this movie myself, I think you have lots of sugar in it, so you can see some parts of it funny.
