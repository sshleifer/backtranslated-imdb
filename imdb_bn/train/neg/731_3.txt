Michael Hathorn (Gordon Curry) is a witness to his mother's brutal assassination and witness to the suicide of her father Marty (John Fedel). Twenty years later, Mike gathered a group of his friends in his family cabin for a Halloween party. When the guests confess their worst fears and play a game that confronts them ... Mike tries to call his late father's soul. Soon it was discovered that Mourti's soul lives in a wooden cabin of India. The statue comes to life and the blood bath starts. <br /> <br /> Most F / X is not very convincing and the film takes a cheap teen slash theme. Strong story acting horribly. Note members are: Kelly Benson, Philip Rhys, Emmanuelle Waghier, Bayern Chief-Moon and experienced actress Betsy Palmer.
