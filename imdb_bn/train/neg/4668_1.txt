Potential movies External links, set in the 19th century, failed to produce. Magnificent names like Maggie Smith, Albert Finney, and many others did not cause the film's failure. However, the film was over, apologized for the plot line and it was broken into continuation. A rich girl and a poor boy bring together by a common story, beauty (or lack of it) and humiliation by love and destruction, there is a mother's initial death and a tangible side of a missing father. Father, a sick man who played Phoenie, tortured his life even during his daughter's life. She believes that the lack of goodness of her daughter will be marred by her marriage under her social status and destroying her fate. The actors tried to save how the story was left. Destroy and destroy a Washington Square in a black hole, sadly watch those valuable time. I give this movie 1 instead of 0, for the actor's efforts completely. Protect yourself, keep Washington Square clean.
