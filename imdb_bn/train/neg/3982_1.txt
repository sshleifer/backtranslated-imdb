Please do not see this movie for God's love! The time wasted, plots are expected, such as romantic scenery. Trying to build too much with very little, this film and its evil prediction villain is just hair. Characters do not develop, and most of the pictures are shot with a shot in Rome, which is much more interesting than actual movies. Above that, acting is an insult. I know everyone tries to find their niche, but it's really a disaster. I do not believe anyone has actually paid millions of pounds to keep this movie on screen. Do not waste money or time in this movie, instead see your grandmother or something suitable.
