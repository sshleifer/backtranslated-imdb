When I look back at my college days at the University of Ohio, there will always be an event that I remember with memorable memories. Channel 23Ou's local access channel and for the last few years, mostly played what they were sent. It included a number of DIY movies from a guy microwaving marble pips, and then their images were scanned in a version of Macbeth, a version of the 8th grade, who apparently only learned squibs. <br /> <br /> But the King, in my opinion, was on the channel 23 line-up midnight skater. The first time I saw around 2 I was supposed to be studying Or sleeping Or watching the regular TV. But not all that for pussies. My roommate and I saw the midnight skater, and when it was complete, I do not think any of us believed that a movie happened. But sure enough, after some, it was a few nights later, and we came to see that this movie actually existed. <br /> <br /> I could take away what I was terrible, but it makes life worth living that kind of terrible kind. The plot is distracted, the act is terrible, everything is animated, but by God, if others are watching with you, it is impossible not to see it impossible For the first time, you got to hear "Guts" by Chuck Pahhnunk. You have heard it, you are despicable and shaken, but after five minutes, you want to and desire someone else you just endure to bear the horrible horror experience. <br /> <br /> Long story short, midnight skater, makes all of his epic errors, makes fun at some very late nights. Plus, I'd like to have a theme-to-mid-night skater. Anyone wrote it and sang it. Sweet God I love that song.
