I saw this movie last night and was a little disappointed. "Time events" were very close. At the beginning of the film, Dada commented on how he felt during the 9-11 strike to this grandson and his friends. This movie was supposed to be held in 1994. Also, one of the granddaughters was wearing an Eagles Donovan McNab Jersey. She was not even drafted as yet. The story line was good, but the events of the time frame and reality were so far away that it considered cinema as Chess. My boyfriend is a warm reader of WWII books and memories. I hope this movie is going to be good. There was so much acting. The dog was beautiful. But the way this movie was executed, I'm glad that I paid only 4 dollars to pay for $ 50, it was taking me to a theater to see. I hope that anyone reading this, I understand that there was no dissatisfaction with those who were in war, but the incident and time frame should have been a little over-guarded.
