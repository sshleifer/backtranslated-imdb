It's incredible! Fidnani (he was a ghost) was the most well-known director of the world. This movie stole Leon's original title "You Walk!" But tell the annoying story of the Pinkerton agent against the killer "Testa de Ferro" (unlikely Gordon Mitchell, a stuntman). This pelicula depicted in Lazio's favorite landscapes is all poor and crazy. The stories are bad and crazy at the same time. Fitani was not able and ingenuos at the same time. Some crazy strange things happened in this story (such as the discussion of Sheriff's house and the baroque look of the Boeing Cassidy !!! ?? ?? ?? Yes, indeed the Butcher Cassidy, who is depicted as stupid). Italian television, one of the most award-winning actors of Renzo Araboir's unexpected complex, miracle plot, bad acting and presence of a lung. Ah, of course, Claus Kinsky. Yes, great and terrible, but I'm sure he was only for money to play with the iron horses) 2 out of 10 but ... do not miss it!
