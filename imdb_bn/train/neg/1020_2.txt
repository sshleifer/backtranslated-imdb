Enter the movie for a second second, so we can better understand the movie you are using here. <br /> <br /> Edison is one of the stupid films where the bad guy and his gangsters shot good people in the back of the walls and pillars shot 50,000 bullets, shouting them, and finally to face the good person and kill him. Instead ... ... rather than ruining this guy so much sorrow .... instead of walking and POP! ..... what will you do? Bad guy ... he talks to him. He holds the good man and talks to him while gunning for him. There is nothing to talk to them! Shoot him! Shout him now! But she talks with him anyway. Oh other things Finally, a newspaper says, "Pulitzer Prize Winner Star is right here" or at the top of any page on paper, when it is printed for the first time. So how fast does hezzy win for a Pulitzer for that fast? Yes, do you know those stupid movies? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> A large number of places To suggest to his girlfriend at the night club, and the last line "duck" was not something like a lethal surgery that was never made ... and when Justin Timberlake is talking, he shouts and fools, The only bright spot was an insane Dylan McDermott, who is doing "best from Denzel" in the rhythm of the best training day. <br /> <br /> Oh yes, then what about the movie? Here's something to say about Scandal involving the fictional special single police force of the city, Edison, "Frat (I swear I'm not making this thing), which was considered to be an obvious game of SWAT, however, some smell of little journalism super singer-son Justin Timberflake By the FRAT 2 secret police involved in fatal kidnapping after a murder, and he went scurrying off looking for a story, his boss' (flame Go) on the way of faith when they are both big and sinister unlike what they both thought.Half of the training course was completed with a short training day like Blood Peliken. The pacing was slow and closed, the script was horrific and the acting was extremely vague It ran out everywhere without it. People fall down and you forget them. It's hard to write any kind of review for this because the movie has finished my brain second ... there is no falsehood, do not waste your time!
