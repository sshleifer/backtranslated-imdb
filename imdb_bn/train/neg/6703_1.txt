I've noticed that this image has been subjected to many insults. It probably acquired some of them, but it was not bad. Well, I'll be honest: I do not want to see this picture again. It was a bad film. But I do not hate this picture, it tried to tell a story. As a play, this film can actually work very well. I think that when filmmakers make it, they will come down on a road (if they want to be a comedy they should add more fun bit). With a rewrite, it can be a great film. But like the mockery, it did not work in its present form - many scenes were not suitable in the context of the plot: For example, the robbery scene makes sense in the story. Yet, it was never the worst independent film ever - is it the Worst 10 Worst? That's controversial.
