This movie is so funny it's so funny. It has identified Scott Kochula as a coach, but it is not important, big players who play the 1st base. At first he must be at least 75 years old, yet he can still play the small league baseball, secondly, until he is able to walk, start the film in Outfield. Coach Bekulla brilliantly mentions him as saying that when he tries to run, he is in the same place for a long time in the same place. At the end of Bakula film shows a more brilliant coaching technique (SPOILER), he told his star player "Downtown" to run the home run, clearly "Downtown" saw it as a good step. He hit the home-run and won the game for his team, the film's chief's class, a small league squad playing Twin. Now Royals manager Tony Musa became skilled as a coach like Bakullet and used to tell everyone his batsmen had to run at home, but Royals never lost a game.
