... I had to walk in the first film. And it was Cast and pre-screen crew (I was not involved, I'm quick to add). I made it through the first hour, so I guess I was just worthy to comment, but that was my limit. <br /> <br /> Like other opinions here, how to get it through any type of QA. The worst compilation of conversations, woodworking, horror casting, all wrapped together without plots. <br /> <br /> Tara Fitzgerard's cast was a bit diverse, almost comic. He received the worst Russian accent in the history of the film. <br /> <br /> I gave up screening, directors and producers were drinking in the bar outside the movie. They probably can not sit through it again. <br /> <br />
