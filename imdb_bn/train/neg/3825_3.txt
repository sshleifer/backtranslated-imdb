I saw this movie at the end of the week and I was always impressed with the beauty and polish of church-produced films, but I was frustrated that this person has become so small, informing the members and passing out many unanswered questions to the investigators. <Br /> <br /> This image is 70 minutes Vintet's life in Joseph Smith's life. This is not true biopic because there is no real consistent description. Most of the episodes are doing well for Yusuf, playing baseball, roaming and laughing with the children, often at slow speed. What a wonderful man, just like a man, was Joseph, huh? Look at him out of rugs for his wife Emma. Well, how do the fork for his 33 plural wives? Regardless of the creation of polygamy whatever. <br /> <br /> It gives very little information, and critical thoughts surprise the audience members why Yusuf is getting satisfied and being a bird, why he is being thrown into jail and why the crowd Wants to kill The last episode of the film must surely travel to Jorge and Herram's Carthage Prison (facing the true United Nations facing Noveau's door). But why no reference is ever made about me. About Smith, Novo Expositor suppresses the newspaper and his press command is destroyed for the publication of polygamous secrets. The audience is left to wonder or more neutral persecution of the Church. There are allegations of sedition for calling martial law against Yusuf and calling on Noavo militia. <br /> <br /> I do not expect the prospect of this film produced by Richard Bushman's recent biography, Rock Stone Rolling, but I was amazed at how surprising and materially presented actually. <br /> <br /> And worse, what was presented was often wrong. Two examples jump over me. First, translation of Mormon books This image reads Joseph on his right-hand golden plate of the two-ring bundle, which is actually hidden from the plates far from the site. It is well known that Joseph hired his hat with a hat in his stomach and translated it with his hat. The second mistake happened in Carthage Prison, where the crowd surrounded the horse. The history of the Church states that Joseph had six shooters and even clashed the window before closing some rounds and giving mesennial signal of distress (eg report in Times and Season). <br /> <br /> When filming the reality of the gunfire, film makers broke the mood of the heart created, but without exception, they were unfaithful to history and failed to really show Joseph: with guns easy and able to defend itself. In fact, Joseph's impression of the film was that Joseph was a wonderful man, but a milestone that hits, jumps into prison, and eventually kills cold blood. He was far from that; Joseph was a disciplined and determined person who endured many hardships and struggles, among which he believed. See the movie <br /> <br />, but it is known that it is cotton candy. Then Smith, get your flesh and potatoes to read a copy of Rachel Stone's Bushman Biography <br /> <br /> PS: There are no credits for churches produced, but stylish eyes can find two familiar faces. Like Rick Messi, Joseph Smyth, Sir and Bruce Neubold, who is loved by Thomas on the belief of Christ, here he plays Cranky Methodist minister, who fails to show Christian love to the young man after the truth.
