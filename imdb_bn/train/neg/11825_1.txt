This film is one of the best novels of all time, a great mobile phone by George Eliot of Silas Maranor. Do not see it at the beginning of the movie, at the end of it, only a credit is called "The proposal of Silas Maranar". Recommended? It was nothing but a complete hole in all the essential elements of the story: <br /> <br /> A sad and sad old man, an artist, poor and lonely, all his money was stolen. One night the child wanders in his house because his mother is dying out in the snow. The man took him and one day brought him to the local squire (or the wealthy politician here) to demand his child's acceptance. This is the one who gave birth to a child a year ago. After the war, the child seems to be in custody. <br /> <br /> The story of this and all other aspects of the film is the same. In only one I can find a difference. Silas Mariner's missile was - but perhaps it has put Mr. Martin's acting powers far away. There is some carrot concoction on her (perhaps she would show her younger, but in reality she would show him more strongly)! There is a sense of humorous joke that this offbeat comedian can not prevent bringing the story in which there is no part of it and just refrain from the story's depth. When the child wants to cry in court, he can only be happy with the person who has given birth to these years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If I were a trustee of George Eliot, I would emphasize rehabilitation. If I were Steve Martin, I would send profits to the estate or the poor. In short, it should be the owner of Silas Maranar - adapted by S. Martin. Or better yet deleted from the archives! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in this story - and I hope you - completely cancel it and see Sylse Muran. Or read the book! It's a great adaptation in the BBC's 1980s.
