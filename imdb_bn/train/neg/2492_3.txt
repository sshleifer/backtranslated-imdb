I think I've seen more bad movies, so I give it 3, but it's a struggle to remember what they can be! Perhaps the Xtro (nasty and dull) or perhaps the cripple (just plain dull), but it's a bad fight to remember something. It's hard to know where to start. Let's say it's a poor underwear, even a poor man's genie played in the cloud van Dam. The only freedom fighter Kasperson was watching Van Dienne - I was surprised by what happened after the Starships truppers. Yes, he was Johnny Rico, if you really want to know. <br /> <br /> Judging from this site, he is trapped in the TV movie hell .... Kaspers, more favorite ... please !! !!!!!!!!!! Aghghhhh, I've become just and half the modest movie known as Criminal Law ....... I'm really annoyed about the last 1.5 hours !!!
