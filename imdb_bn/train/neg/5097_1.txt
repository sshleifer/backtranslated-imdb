Unlike most other commentators, I hate this series deeply. <br /> <br /> It looks interesting with the mysterious alien and giant robots, and I hope to be the last episode. At the end of this, I still did not understand what the alien attacks were (perhaps I missed something, who knows?), And realized that I was sitting in 26 episodes which are mainly self-hatred of characters, selfishness and self-kindness. It actually flips through the alien / robot fights and this dark, gloomy-eyed-off scene where one or more characters can say "I hate you / you / hate" in 10-12 times in a row. <Br> <br /> I really do not see Shanji or Asuka (two of the main characters) or see the change. (In that case I can not see any other character growing or growing.) I wanted to kill them and told them to take a bloody life during their first episode and the feelings in the last feeling were not changed. Shinji is truly helpless despair, which makes people angry instead of charity, and Asuka is such a scary consciousness- I want to see all the time that I wanted to break the TV screen. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate, and often tell it veeeeeeeery. <br /> <br /> I am a big fan of anim√© and manga otherwise, and I dislike a lot before. I have read that the series creator / writer writes this to depression and I can believe; It makes me sad to see it. What is the goal of this series? I'm honestly asking. Is it designed to distract and annoy visitors? And if you are suffering from depression, why not write a book or biography about it instead of mixing it with Alliance and May Cha? This Alien War Plot, so far as I can say, can not reach anywhere. Finally, since how many people do not really love the fascinating help by claiming the love of this patchwork of death plots, how many of them really think it is good and what they say is because it has been said.
