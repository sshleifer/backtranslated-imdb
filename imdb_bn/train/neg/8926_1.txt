It came out for the first time in the 1970s when I saw "Maya Brunizzi". At that time I was healthy at 20 years of age, who liked movies and really loved Rakel Welsh. On top of it, I read the novel Gore Bhadal based on it and it was very interesting. I saw an image on a local drive and about halfway path, I was bewildered to launch my car's motor, so maybe I would die in monoxide poisoning and would not see this ship in any other movie. It was not "smart" or "trendy", it was rough and sloppy. All actors were tone deaf and the director was not the slightest idea what he was doing. Maestro's Casting movie is one of the worst casting choices in history. Here is a critic, his role was to do nothing with the movie or book. His character in the book beat the sex of the young stud, which would never do for the legendary Miss West. Oh no, the conspiracy has changed so she beat her with sex, a 77 year old woman who sees her age every day. I could go, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> BlueTu
