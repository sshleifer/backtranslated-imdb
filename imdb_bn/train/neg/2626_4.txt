I watched this film a couple of years ago in a group tradition of the Far Forward Film Festival, where we will rent a bunch of B-movies and vote for the worst. <br /> <br /> We saw it on that night <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> < br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Personally, however, I will not recommend extra substance ... this movie will release your own sign. <br /> <br /> It has an impression on me that I actually hand over a copy of myself for several years. <br /> <br /> A good choice if you are setting out to look bad movies. This one is fun, and I have to remember the bounce music ...
