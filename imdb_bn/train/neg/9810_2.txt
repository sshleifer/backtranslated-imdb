It is difficult to criticize this movie because I dislike the story, and no good acting does not save it. Think of "raising the Arizona" with an average line. Acting is portable, but Jennifer Tilly is always in the top (still not enough to make it a great camping film), "Unfortunate" and a satirical DMV activist coming somewhere. The rest of the cast is constantly stressed due to the pressure of their parts or the complete vain exercise, they always have sharpness disintegration. The film is a real depressed few hours Daryl Hannah has spent most of the movie and is crying very hard. I could not tell you how it ended but I went out, sorry.
