Robert Freillen's 'Spide Gonzalez' was the second cartoon featuring Robert McChommon's Cat-Tales to Two to feature the title character. The cartoon has quickly been a ugly little creature with a big gold beard, but the famous design by its second appearance has already been passed. Despite the significantly more handsome appearance, do not quickly develop into a lot of characters. A big hat, a tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent does not create a classic character, and it almost all went well for it. Yet, Kaki's little mouse proved to be very popular and in the studio's next few real-world movies, many shorts starred. These swift shorts were faster than later torture, where they were often associated with (but rather curious) Duffy Duck, they still leave a lot to be desired, usually depending on speculative gags depending on the same type of formula. In this self-titled episode, Spidi was appointed to steal cheese from other factory locals, which would be protected by Sylhet cats. Although he brought extra stars of a star on the cartoon, but the role of Sylvester here can be easily met by any other ordinary cartoon cat. His personality is removed by being forced into his prospect. Followers undemanding role. It was always a problem with the TV cartoons, but thanks to a furious opponent quickly because of his disgusting curiosity and the unclear impossibility of his capture. The poor Old Sylvester will be forced to appear beside Spidy for many years. Despite its excellent features followed by a fantastic basic formula and featuring short smiles, 'Quick Gonzalez' won an Oscar and was born a thoroughly incompetent star.
