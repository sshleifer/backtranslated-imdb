My brother loves this shoe, let's make it straight. I agree with people I'm copying from the lab's lab and fairly strange parents. <br /> <br /> I never liked rough peculiar parents, that means, some things make me laugh, but most of the time it's not annoying and tricky. Same way I think about Johnny Test. Except, nothing that shows makes me smile. Gags are so stupid and unshorn, and tell you the truth, probably it's me, but kids do not dress like that! Yes, I think Jonny's hair is great, but Simon! <br /> <br /> and Dexter's Lab, which was one of my favorite shows and I still do not think anything to see it. Which makes me weird and Johnny Test shames the shame that makes the most of the show! <br /> <br /> Another thing. The Dog Is. So. Annoying He is more robust and obnoxious than Johnny! And homosexual? What cheating! I hate the dog and I hope he will die, because it will be better to see the bad whip in the show and to see the kids, and choose a gay accent. <br /> <br /> Unless you want to burn your eyes in the fire and want to fry your brain in this brain, do not see it!
