If I could give it a zero, I'd change my mind and instead give it a -10. There is definitely no movie plot, which is a terrible movie, which can not be understood. Just swing Please do not waste your money on this one. Pleaseee !!! If true story of the real zodiac killer is actually portrayed, the film could have done so well, but nips, I did not feel a bit uncomfortable watching it. Benefit yourself and rent some classic movies instead, it's good to see a movie that you've already seen 3-4 times see this bad watch! I do not understand why people are annoyed to make such a good movie when they do not know that it will not work well. Russian killer should be called 'Barriac killer'!
