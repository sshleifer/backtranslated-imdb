The first mistake you made in making a movie title is that there is no budget for the actual zombie FX to use "living dead". Sure, this was a low budget gambling flick - really low budget. I had a film school project on it. Amateur actors and amateur effects <br /> <br /> It was not really bad to be considered above, and it presents an interesting twist in zombie style. If you are going to get an "R" for violence, you can give some good shot to attack our children. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> I said shooting of many bullets is going on and no police is watching the scene!
