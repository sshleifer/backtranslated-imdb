Marlon Brando lost interest in acting while acting. His performance as "Sweden" is the worst of his career, and it's exactly what he wants. She does not overact it. Instead, she simply works in a wicked fashion and pokes fun at her embarrassing gargantuan girth. The climbing scene above the Brando toilet stall is probably the worst, funny moment in cinematic history. We saw him walking around the toilet, it is hard to believe that we see the same actor who has played the designer named St√§tkarker, On Waterfront and The Godfather. <br /> <br /> The real question I guess is why Marlon behaved in this way in the following years. Was he sick of movie business? Has he made himself completely and stupid? I suppose we do not know. But how this picture works as a fascinating study for everyone about bad acting. <br /> <br /> On that note, see fellow actor Donald Switterland because he is struggling to supply his line, embarrassing himself to agree to participate in this travesty.
