You all know the "Hamlet" story. I do. <br /> <br /> The word "not to be or should not be" is beaten in the ground (not the speech itself), so that it is not very interesting at times (in fact, it was not cool to start with). Actually, I found a good but exaggerated game "Hamlet". This is not the best of Shakespeare: "Julius Caesar" and "Romeo and Juliet" are ten times better, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Othello" are not much behind. "Macbeth (ruin your table, close its drawer, fix the cake, OW!)" It's not bad. There is something better than Shakespeare. <br /> <br /> I will not really comment more on the movie, but I will cut off the terrible MST3 episode. <br /> <br / OK . . Mike and Bots won a card game, to choose the film. . . To say "Hamlet", Pearl sent them, Jadad Jad. . . And ready for the most annoying psi fi episode of MST3 (accept that I did not see any CC). <br /> <br /> This episode is "horrific", because it is not really a movie but rather random, divided-together scenes (I reminded Mike's line from "the war of the future": "Maybe it is short, uncontrollable A musician of movies "), the SOL crew is much better off a better many better cracks The same thing can not be said here. <br /> <br /> Reflats fall flat, host segments (naturally) are the best medieval and when the movie (which is not bad) is actually better (I mean, as a quality movie, not as a camp, "Prince of the heavens "Like this) you know that the show must definitely be worse than its MST3K version. I laugh (last time I saw it was a few months ago), oh, probably eight or nine times. I tried and tried to triad - but I just could not. Just a little line, such as "Hail Queen Dilbert's Boss!" (And when it's the most fun line of the episode, well, Ahm) - And occasionally, I mean every ten minutes or maybe - maybe I even chocolate. The second time I tried to see it, I did not think a few jokes before, and just gave up 40 minutes before. <br /> <br /> The picture is not awesome; This is a German version of Hamlet. The actor is good enough, and even if Dubbing is not the best, it is not the reason to hate this movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are four stars in "Hamlet"! Three, yes for three MST version 3. PS <br /> Why, why is MST 3!
