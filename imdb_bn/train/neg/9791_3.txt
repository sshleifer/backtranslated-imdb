Basically this is about a couple who want to take a second child. They meet a mouse (Stewart) in the receiving company and they decide to take him. If you think it's stupid, hold it down, because it's getting worse. <br /> <br /> Stewart came to his new home, where he was treated like a child's child. (Leave me!) Rest is quite normal clichés, family problems, big "brothers" to jealousy, and finally all problems are solved and they all are "happy family". Annoying and thus defeated, it is shown in the most intelligent and irrational way. <br /> <br /> I do not know if the director believes that he is creative with the Christian mouse, or he was just trying to fill in a few minutes, but he just upgraded the cliché to hate from the boring. <br /> <br /> Why do not I give 3 and no zero? Because of the family cats, Stuart loves her as a "brother." And because of some funny gigs, where Stuart uses his small size well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I believe the film will work well if: a. Stuart was not a PET and a "sibling". B. Stewart kept the cat in an interesting gigabyte trying to ride, and gave up boring clichés that did not match anything else.
