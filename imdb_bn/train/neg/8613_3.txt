I almost exploded in tears watching this movie. Not to be laughing, but from the memories of a great Rodney Denferrfeld movie. Kandi was the first and stole the movie, Eiji Mani was at her best, and with the classic masterpiece of Back to School 80 Then there was Ladybug and it started to show. The poor Rodney was getting old (Valy Sparks came out of Ladybugs but did not say much). <br /> <br /> My 5 wife played Rodney Monte (a name that she easily had on her name). He is a rich (not always) man who loves women and does not marry like him. Well now he has inherited a huge piece of land and the land was driven by Amir, so he heirs 5 wives. It sounds like a great idea for a Dangerfield movie. The problem is everything. The script is so poor that the Rodney camera seems to have its one liners and all the side characters have nothing to do. The film looks like there are some really poor stunt sequences in the video which are not clearly called Rodney. Andrew Diese Clay plays a gangster who thinks he is going to say F word (which should be marked as R but it works as PG) and Jerry Stiller has a wonderful 2-minute camio. Do not make mistakes, sometimes I laugh at some of the Rodney Joker, but the poor people are getting old and very slowly. We can see his joke coming from miles. And this movie is done by PC which did not work in the 1990s, thanks to the awesome 70s and 80's Rodney.
