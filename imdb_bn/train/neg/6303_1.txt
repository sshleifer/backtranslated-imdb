I had high hopes for this photo. I feel attractive in love. I found acting, even though stuck through it, Helena Bonham Carter, saving strangers. I was optimistic that my time would be spent on spending time, but in the end, I was surprised that why they were annoyed to do this thing. Maybe George Orwell's version has the cost of sending messages. If this image achieves something, it has inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I believe his story may be frustrating as this adaptation. If the filmmaker's message is "valuable to the living standard," they have succeeded. I will recommend this film to no one; I lost 101 minutes of my life.
