It is very sad that Lucian Pintilli does not stop filming. They get worse every time. Nike and Flow (2003) touches a depression in the camera. It is unfortunate that most of the films made in Romania will be sent to the worst of their overseas films (eg the Chicago International Film Festival). This film is a waste of time and money without plots, performances, or scripts. Score: 10 out of 0.02
