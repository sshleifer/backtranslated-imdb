First of all, I will not tell you why I hired this movie, I'm still confused myself ... <br /> <br /> Air rage like a movie where I saw air hijack The plane is an important person, and the hijacker is looking to retaliate. Sadly, some methods have already been used in other movies to stop hijackers. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Glorified on the cover, the film is actually less than the lesser than Kumar Ojas, who is surprisingly 'surprised' by five hijackers who naturally came to pursue them. For the rest of the cast, the person I knew was Steve Hitner, which is usually known as Kane Bunia from "SafeField". <br /> <br /> I do not forget to exclude my favorite part, when the hijacker closes the door of the patty pocket, closes the door ... brilliant. <br /> <br /> <br /> The script - immune. It reached a stage where I could say something, which I felt was a stupid comment, and it would be the next line in the movie. <br /> <br /> For special effects ... I only lost my TV and VCR electricity for 100 minutes on this particular special movie. <br /> <br /> and title - The film is held in DID Air. But less than the stellar performance, the only anger of the film was the audience. <br /> <br /> So, if you fall into the movie then it's bad. Save yourself, do not select this.
