This movie is called Toranas, a Gladiator, who is brought back from the dead, to gather Tiranas, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. Tyrannus, we learn about an hour later, Demonicus is called. It adds a lot of depth to the plainplay and questions about identity, psychology and our perceptions about ourselves. <br /> <br /> The Terranas Spirit completes the body of a college and lists his short work (killing some people and repeating repetitive phrases in Latin). He used a magic main control helmet to do this, which the boy of the college deliberately kept on his head, and then lifted it on several points in the film and kept it behind. <br /> <br /> Maria wears a poor man's fairy, Willian Scott, and Tyrnus Rollerball gloves that performs oral sex. Tyrannus has its own green backlighting for any reason, and apparently has been sitting next to the CGI fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. <br /> <br /> <br /> This movie is empty and will hit you. See it.
