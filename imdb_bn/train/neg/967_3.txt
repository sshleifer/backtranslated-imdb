In 1988, Paperhouse was called "Awesome movie of thoughtful people". Wow, you can say, sign me up. This thing is a mess. It plays a young actress, whose 1 to 2 Till g Headley has a bad British accent and there are no stories with no coolness, thrills or spills. <br /> <br /> Even the interesting psychology-o'clock <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> What you get is not particularly awful, art house or even a decent after school special. After two hours I found myself ... where my two hours went. <br /> <br /> This aspect has become obscure and I want it to be even incensed ... something interesting ... I think the producer was in lithium. <br /> <br /> The world is boring even in a dream. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
