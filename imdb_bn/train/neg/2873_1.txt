This movie shows a pretty brunette named Daniel Petty. She is stunning in green eyes, and the first few scenes and the last scene. He is the only thing about this movie which is not boring. She can not be as an actress in the future, because such a movie is an offensive disaster that kills the carriers. <br /> <br /> There is absolutely nothing to suggest about the movie itself. This is not a good horror movie, or a good fake journalism report, or is not done remotely. There is no skill in producing it. It's like a bad student film. The horror elements of the story do not make you sick, it's really bad that it makes you sick. I would give ZERO stars in this movie.
