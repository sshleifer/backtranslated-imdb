Very stupid movie, stupid one liners and filled with Jewish references. It was a serious movie but was not taken seriously. A familiar film plot ... being in the wrong place at the wrong time. A shocking mistress, Kim Bassinger involved. Very robotic and very regimented. I've noticed that Al Pacino's acting ability is undoubtedly going to come. Problems with Problems, but Passino is more troublesome than the horrific Atlanta accent. Loss control should fix this damage in a film. OK my one liners are bad, but this film is not as bad as ones. This movie is not only annoying but also as a rebellion. Usually a rebel movie is watchable for the wrong reasons. This movie is unwanted. I manage to sit through this. Plot, if written a bit better, could possibly pull out the thriller from the dellmums, perhaps by slightly better acting and terrifying mistress and even eliminating fig jokes. What we have kept is a completely silent film which ensures that it was drilled in our head that Eli Wurman was Jewish. All the good Jews are an embarrassment everywhere.
