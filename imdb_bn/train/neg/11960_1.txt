I really got sick to see the same Scratch story garbage after retirement from Asian horror films. However, I recently received more and more in the absorption flicks, and so decided to give them another opportunity. My first port was a highly rated 'Visitor Question' by Takashi Mike, the director of Kolkata. I've already seen the audition, and when I do not like it, I rate it as one of the more advanced modern Asian horror movies. So, I went into this with doubtful expectations; And unfortunately, not only found annoying. I think this movie is really cute and it went up to my head, but it seems like it was just a collection of violent and ugly scenes with little or no solidarity between them. Any comparison compared to the work done by Luis Bonuel and David Lynch, the more condemned I am, the more condemned. All Miike has made a film here; Around it, any intelligence has been applied by provoked fans, which means frustrating to find something out. My headache sets in about 10 minutes (no father had sexual relations with her daughter for some reason), and till the end of the film it did not decrease; At least twenty hours later, or it would seem so. Do not make me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies, and actually actively seek out the most notorious movie; But it can be violent, but it is vain and annoying and I have never enjoyed it one month. Takashi Mickey may have a lot of fans, but I'm not really one of them; And I certainly hope that at the last moment I will be in contact with one of her films.
