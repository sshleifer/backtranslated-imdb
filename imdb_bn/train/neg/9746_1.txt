I remember this picture, in 1970 for a week in Barcelona (Spain) exhibition. Although it may seem unbelievable, and I can not give any explanation for this, the film was screened in a theater ... art films and great quality (ie, Bergman, Racenais, Malel, Bunuel, and Projected Man). . Some people have seen it (thankfully people, no doubt) and any reference to this very annoying SF movie is not available in Peter Nicholas Science Fiction Encyclopedia, or the original novel is available about the author. Highly indicative. I think, after all these years, a story, a lot of special effects that seem to be a ridiculous effect, and not. It seems that in some countries running time is 90 mm And another 77 minutes. Well, pain means a little more.
