There should be a rule that explicitly mentions that films like Resident Evil should be created as the spirit of the game, which is not the motive of blowing up everything possible. RA was a surviving horror game and had a great influence on it, yet Paul W. B. Anderson was able to create it as any other video game movie. The only resident in the dark is the same spirit as the Evil, so it is expected that the director will be able to keep a part of the brain that can create a horror movie and not an action movie. Instead, Dark in the Dark just proves that movies are not expected for video games. <br /> <br /> This plot is obviously not acceptable, it is a lot of trouble with the movie. The film begins, which can be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be, after one minute, the audience cautions and hits the mediator of the rest. Then there is something about an orphan, some handicrafts, an ancient tribe, some bureaucracy and some demons, all of which are so awkward together that visitors can not follow what is happening. The characters go inside and out of the plot like candy, making huge builds up in some meaningless deaths. Basically, I realize that some monsters have been released, and Edward Carnaby (Slaughter) has some links with them because they failed on some of his or her orphanages due to some operations. He finds an Artefact involving monsters and it is a former girlfriend anthropologist (Reed), it certainly operates managed with sex for no good reason. Then, from nowhere, all hell breaks, and the pair ends with a military team led by some asshole commander (Dorff), who obviously have mutual hatred for the carnibah. <br /> <br /> It's all ridiculous, and because I do not really understand it is not because it's complicated and awake, but it does not really leave any room to care for. Instead, I highly recommend that if you see this movie, then bring a transit or a thing when your plot moves you to get confused. <br /> <br /> The movie's action scene with a plot would be as terrible as it would bring up a little, right? Too bad, this movie has been created like any of the ruins, quickly enough to open a cop of a chicken. This is not an action game, based on a horror game, it is especially annoying. <br /> <br /> The first step behind the cronies from any taxi was the worst, and the rest is not that great either. Scratch looks a bit cooler, although they all take away the effects when turned into powder. There are visible cooling guns that are the only source of lip fire for change and the camera is involved with fast panning from zooming and crack addiction heads. It is an aggressive attack of all kinds of fraud that keeps the kids at night <br /> <br /> I want to call the actors to accept and do anything for them. Slater is important for the whole film but nothing, though it seems to be more talented than him. Dorf also has the same truth, though he has a genius in spite of having some talent (something that has happened to him). Reid is a lot, it should be, background sex appeal, whenever it tries to work it is a disaster (as incredibly bad scientist is at the beginning). <br /> <br /> All, this is a movie that concerns me about future video game movies. If they ruin such attitude, Samos Aran is killing Middle-Eastern through a one-47 and Tommy Vareseti is fighting with Alien's Squadron before it is a matter of time. Resident living in front of Evil, but it is not worth the second chance, because I do not think how terrible it might be to forget this movie. It's soft, weird and unexciting. This movie is equivalent to diarrhea; It's all throwing together, nothing really fits and, ultimately, you're just glad to end it. <br /> <br /> Total: 4%
