When my wife and I decided to watch this movie, we thought it could not fail. I love Billy Crystal, my wife loves Julia Roberts, and we all said that they liked it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The Crystal character is very diminutive and very low for movies. Sure, he cracks some good joke, but as a character he does nothing but take place. <br /> <br /> and poor Julia Roberts. In the past, he plays as a strong deliberate, self-reliant woman. This flashing, he seems to be completely suppressed and had very little fire. This is not Julia Roberts that my wife is watching. <br /> <br /> If I find a good thing, then it should be Christopher Walken. Now that entertainment But, like Billy Crystal, rarely his characters are shown. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a very low price laughing at night, then watch it. But if you are looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your movie. No one on top of it.
