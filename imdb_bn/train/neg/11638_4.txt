"Black of the Sacred, Blood of the Dead" The third schedule of the Gabrielle Knight Games, a series of adventure games about The BreadWise Author / Unusual Detective, Gabriel Knight. Gabriel and his companion Grace are said to have asked Albany Prince James to investigate a series of so-called mysterious attacks, "Night Visitors". The son of Prince James is abducted, following the night viewers to Gabriel Renez le Chateau, where he started to combine a mystery related to the Holy Grail. <br /> <br /> Despite the marketing, this game is not about the vampire. Vampires have a token presence in the game, but in phases, at the command center, such as "Fathers of the Suns" or inside Veruvoos, Voodoo Hoffo is within. Gabriel and Grace did not make any effort to uncover the true nature of the vampire, or to try to search the vampires. Although vampires kill three while playing, their victims are randomly selected and they have nothing to do with the main plot. <br /> <br /> The first two Gabriel Night installments were related to the fabled relationship with the Gabrials. Through this relationship, the player can not help but express sympathy to the villain, and in this way villain transforms into a human and becomes less than a monster. However, the "blood of the Holy Spirit", the only interaction with Gabriel's villain is through a single, Chesi interview, which does nothing to support the player to tolerate Wilhelm. <br /> <br /> This mystery of Gabriel and Grace is fairly vain. Gabriel spent time spending time searching for a Treasure Hunter Tour group member in his hotel, but he did not reveal anything more than red hiring. Grace Renees spent the time searching for the secret of Le Chateau, but all his studies have been rendered irrelevant by the presence of a confusing mate who can answer this mystery for hundreds of years. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Contrary to the colleague and his pole --- the leader of the vampire --- the unreliable. Guides indicate the mystery of Renee Le Chateau in daily daylight and Grace (and not Treasure Group of other Treasure Group) hopes to find them. However, instead of risking the abducted child for 48 hours, he could reveal the mystery to Grace on the first day. And finally, he only tells the mystery behind the mystery in its entirety. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, scrambled leaders failed to achieve the goal of hundreds of plans, because he wanted to abstain from work for two days. Child abduction The only reason for the delay of his action is that he wants to enjoy his victory. <br /> <br /> If this game focuses entirely on the holy grill, then the game is even better. Abductions and vampires should be excluded, should be replaced with a competition against the Vatican to expose the mystery of Rene Le Chateau. Since Gabriel was often portrayed as Catholic more than once, there were many opportunities for the development of this conflict character. <br /> <br /> Finally, this game was a disappointment in the series, despite a better interface and in the series. Team Curry returned as Gabriel Knight's voice.
