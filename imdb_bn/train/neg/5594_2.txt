When you see this question, you have to ask yourself, "What was the point?" This movie was nothing but complete confusion with an hour and half confusion (the actor is not going to use the word) and a script you could say was not present. <br /> <br /> One thing that made me humorously about this picture was that it was "written in Victorian story" which means there was a script in that part of the story. There was no dialogue in the entire Victorian section, and only a girl and a man shot against him was created. Making that part as movie as script as a camera at a train station. <br /> <br /> Okay, time for the story. It does not start with the person sitting on a chair once it starts out. Oh blocking, who needs you? He came to his house in this newspaper and actually requested the story about these dead girls. So he started off the story of the Victorian bar. And here's how the scene goes (Guy and girl are in a field. The beautiful song begins) (The man shows the girl) (The girl looks at the man) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This real estate agent shows them and when I say the dialogue is weird, I mean , If it is a dancer, it will travel during Makarena. No character in this movie is preferable. The model is incredibly annoying, Victorian folks are not talking, and the story telling guy has an empty personality onion. So finally kill all the girls. And by killing, I mean offscreen of drugs. Ooh Have you shown one death? And by the death I put her face up until they mean makeup makeup? Awesome. <br /> <br /> This guy is making me fooling this story too. He said because he saw it. but how? There was no one in the apartment! No door was closed outside the door, windows were connected with fire escape, which was very bad to do, how did he see it all? Oh plot holes We love you so that the movie ends with Newsweeman, "I think you made it, you're wasting our time", although he requested her in the first interview. Anyway. This movie was stupid, dull, and made no sense with many plot holes. I could go on and on this movie, but I do not see the need. I'd rather spend some time in my time something expensive. Something like bright. "Hells Threshold" includes purgatory with 2 more models. 10 out.
