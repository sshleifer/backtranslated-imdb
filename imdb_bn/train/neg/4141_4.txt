Well ... the movie was a fun watch. The original issue of this film is actually against its masterpieces which follow the myths of most vampires. Like the vampire that walks in the sunlight. Although there are parts that make you enjoy the way to make society a movie. A scene where a purple hit was shouting "Oh this pain ... it's really stuck." Looks like the scene is missing, but you will use it later. And there are random dreams sequenes that really do not help with the plot. Come to think about it, do not really understand, but I just got a bunch of friends and saw it twice to get the full effect. Come to think that the war scenes were scary, and the jumbo was just fun to watch. Gradually I write more about this as I like this movie more. But you know, all you can do is list the Schindlers but it does not expect to have a fun watch.
