It was thought to be the main task of the Open Source community, something that could focus on the media around the world and notify that we do not trap marketing with our options to create fine work with open source tools. After downloading the basic version (hard-fan here in the dial-up mode here) I finally got my first graduation in here. The media player, the mpewer classic and the Winmap failed to open it in my XP box, and then totem, zine and caffeine failed to open it on my suspected server. Mplayer managed to run flawlessly. If ordinary users do not even open it, work hard to spread the word about it ... <br /> <br /> Movies. Beautiful soundtracks, superb lighting, efficient casual camera work and flawless texturing. Everything looked real. And then move two main characters .... and lecture ... and the movie died for me. Everything is fluid and fully alive except for the combination of lip and the actual animation of two main characters (without the use of dance scenes). The two main characters were so bad that sometimes I was thinking that there is no game in the market at any given time, less than the realism that is less than the cut-scene. <br /> <br /> any frame of the movie is fantastic .. as a frame, and the actors are not moving, if things are great. I'm really not recommending this to anyone so I am very happy. I'll ruin my reputation. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the final fantasy was a more follow-up and intelligent designed plot. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The tragedy that is sitting right on the screen.
