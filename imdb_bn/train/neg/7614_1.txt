It can sometimes be one of the worst movies to produce it. <br /> <br /> 1. The most exciting part starts, where the man is walking ... and walking ... and walking (spoiler). Walking is about 15 minutes. How? <br /> <br /> There is not much mention of brightness, and on almost the same day they even shoot night scenes. <br /> <br /> The acting was horrible. Looks like they've found a community theater (in Mexico) ... and then those who went away took them away. <br /> <br /> Please do not rent this movie, to love everything sacred. If you know who you own it, ask forgiveness for them. The director will be punished by the war crimes tribunal to blow the people.
