The main character Lans Burton is murdered and gets in heaven before his time. When Heaven learns of error, he will be given only the body of the rich and old white artist Wellington. <br /> <br /> A black-white man's old black man is still behaving like a black black man. If you see it done by an old white actor. In this movie, I remind myself several times: "Chris Rock is supposed to be an old white guy". <br /> <br /> The whole idea is not to play as objective: "delusion" is not well sent and love stories are not all credible. You're going to see Chris Rock playing a young black guy, because the old white man wants to see everyone only show in small scenes, this is a challenge for the audience "suspension suspension".
