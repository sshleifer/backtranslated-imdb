So completely I found this documentary strange and really vain. I know it's got awards and things, but I personally do not enjoy it too much. There was no comedy or play for being interested, just a series of Weird and their works. Something different from people, which is not a bad thing, it did not have a good effect on me. I was totally bored by this movie, my creative writing teacher is no crime. The whole film's circus theme was quite cool but I did not find it, and Robotics and Singh Timing is definitely not my thing. The green animal things were clean, I really liked the many colors of the garden color, but how do these four connections work? It does not make much sense to me that anyone will make a movie about it. But if you could enjoy you in stuff like this Who am I standing in your way? I'm just forewarning about potential troubles.
