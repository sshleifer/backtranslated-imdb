For the first time I saw this movie, when it was "lost in translation". But in some way Bill Murray Morgan Freeman's acting turned into a wonderful black man, Scarlett Johansson Paz Wagga, and starring Curson in California, Japan. Instead of meaningful conversations and silence, we got excited in translation, we got meaningless insult of 10 items that make it annoying. Instead of translating, rather than impressive and spontaneous characters, we get letters that have no form about them. How is a character that can wear a hundred dollar T-shirt and is never inside a target department store, how can he advise a working class woman to prepare for a job interview as an administrative assistant? It does not seem to stop him. If he does not give advice to his clothes, he is telling what he should eat. The most annoying part of the movie for me was that they were quick to make an appointment, and yet letters are finding time to run another, it will wash the car, block it in the barbie, or just near the list of 10 items or things that they Likes and hates. I said, "Have you not said to stay somewhere? Did you say that what hack is doing? One minute ago you were really late, now you are eating roast beef and thinking about your life!" Unless I saw this movie, I never realized how to "insist on myself", but I think this movie is doing it exactly the same way and unnecessarily. Is the conversation irreverent and dishonest? With the exception, I felt sorry for both the actors to sign in on this project.
