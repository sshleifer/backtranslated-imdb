Trust me, this is a movie that you want to avoid and it comes from a huge Denzel Washington fan. The frustrating part is that it is 1/3 of a large movie The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of establishing a new relationship between the letter and the girl given for the Crime and its protection. The trailer of this movie is mentioned by everyone abducting. So, when I say nothing, after the kidnapping, the film becomes almost inappropriate. The audience was literally vomited by what the director was trying to accomplish, what he succeeded. Following fast, unexpected and sticky cut Crissy follow the next culprits for the next half an hour. These cuts are so uninteresting and annoying that what they do makes you shiver from the story. I am sure the director thought that this illogical way of presenting this story signaled a change in character of the character and instructed to follow a different movie. Well, she was right. The movie that followed was raucous and dissatisfied. The result is a disappointing end, which also destroys the quality of the first forty minutes of the film.
