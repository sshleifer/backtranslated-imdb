I'm back from this free screening, and this is the worst movie of this year in "Osama Witch Project" which I saw this year, even worse than "Catwoman" - which decided to stop itself as a fiction at least. <br /> <br /> A "movie crew" of "Tape of September", "Documentary Journalist" walks in Afghanistan - although not preparing for the trip, terms and oh yeah, their psychological and ridiculous distortions prevent Osama bin Laden on 11 September For the filmmaker's leader to take revenge for his wife's death <br /> <br /> They made eight tapes on their trips, which now "register" their travels and they must endeavor to kill a terrorist leader. (Eight tape, with gratitude at the end of everything, which is convenient for "documentary".) <br /> <br /> Psychological, stupid character - who has given long, prominent speech probably learned by "McGuivar" - for his or her own life He does not remember the innocent crew's life because he is more in trouble than a series of folly accidental series. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> If you want someone to bring them on their way to the journey, then they will call all their killers <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> "Tapes 4 "," I started shooting for the film crew for the terrorists.
