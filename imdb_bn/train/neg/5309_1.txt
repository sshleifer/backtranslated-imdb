I saw the movie on the wire one night and could not believe how bad it was. I usually enjoy bad movies, but it was such a rebel that it was not even entertaining. Some of the highlights of this movie are unreasonable music which is always going on throughout the movie, the violent special effects (when they are shot with a laser gun, they become neon green and immediately disconnected) and hateful acts. Actually, I think the show is stolen. I did not recognize any film actor, and I hope no one else will see them. Overall, I suggest renting this movie (if you find it, I can not imagine a video store carrying this garbage) so that you can learn to appreciate the quality movies by watching this trash.
