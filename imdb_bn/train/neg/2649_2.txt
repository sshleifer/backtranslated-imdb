My wife and I started looking at this movie with the expectation. It looked warm and touch. It's a good start; But soon afterwards, after a while became annoying and obviously stupid. It is so bad that we stopped it, it was bad work and honesty, we did not understand or understand why and how they could set up with this woman! After singing rude and acting wackos and cleaning you have lost sympathy for her. I had his promise. And, of course, like most movies and TV series made in Hollywood, we need to throw a token to the "gay" character! This movie was boring. I was expecting more than the Diet Keaton!
