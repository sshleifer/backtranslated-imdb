After the world's mouth was closed, the big stars returned to a small town with the drug problem of drug dealers and the body of the Federal Agent. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The problem is that Chris Klein as a former action hero. He is not bad, but he is not as credible as anyone who is taking it as a really solid person. I said that he is not bad, he is just wrong for the story behind him. The problem here is the combination of scripts that are not really funny and sometimes seem to be artificial and the direction that comes from the passageway. There is no life to set up things. As a director if there was a list of shots and that went by the list. It makes for an unnecessary film. And even though the film often flows towards life, as in the final exhibition of the film's ending That sequence works, but because the previous part of the film drained a lot of its power. <br /> <br /> I can not really recommend the film. A shot price if you're a fan of actors or a huge fan of independent movies in all its forms, but otherwise it's just a disappointment.
