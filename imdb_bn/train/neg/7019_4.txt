After watching the film Smith's poster, I knew that I was going to live a life of helpless movie experiences that would give me my eyes. However, I felt somewhat optimistic because this was a strong cast of the movie which I thought was going to retrieve the movie. Unfortunately it did not happen. Samar is a horror movie, but it is not inactive. What I can say about it is the best. <br /> <br /> The same person from the license to the wide, which explains anything else that they have the talent for writing movies) is cheap and expected humorous. Actually, I did not laugh at seeing this movie. He was involved in a lot of garbage (like I said the monstrous tyranny and executioner), some people might think that Diane Keaton is being stopped from his career. However, it is impossible to forget about outstanding performances for me. He has brought the previo to us for decades, Annie Hole or Baby Boom. In films like On Smith, she tries her best about her performance, but her character is so horribly written that she can not do anything with her. Dax Shepherd I have had a good influence with my firmness in acting in babimama and idiasi movies. However, he does what he can with his character. Mike White has made a good effort, but he has not reached too far. He is a very talented screenwriter (as he has shown in the film) The Good Girl and School of Rock, so I want to see that he was one of the screenrights of this movie, instead of just acting on it. Levi Tyler was suffering from the same situation as before: > <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
