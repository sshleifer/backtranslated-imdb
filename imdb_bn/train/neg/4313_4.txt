Like last year, I did not manage to sit through the whole thing. OK, so Chris Rock as the host was a good choice because he was vaguely compelling. Or not, the total bore out of the total to be packed in the theater, he was not least at the top 10 most annoying. On the other hand, many of the top ten were presenters. I did not know that the whole thing was done by Autocu (though I knew it was a script) but it really feels good that the actor unable to insert the expression, look away from the coup and get lost on the simple words (Natalie Portman? If there is no director, he gone). The night of fashion dresses and annoying lectures was long and tedious, Beyonce Knowles picked up some good songs and there were very few decent acceptable lectures and clips. Adam Sandler got the worst presenter award. <br /> <br /> To help me write this review, I want to thank my mother, my father, my lawyer and my pedicewist who believe in me, and I want to point out I have a high metabolism and of course I am a For months it was not hungry for myself. I'm not crying ... thanks.
