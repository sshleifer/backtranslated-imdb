OK, I can not think seriously anything worse than PR series. There are many bad things in life ... traitors, liars, etc. But, seriously, power rangers have been below this list. Can you think of something more stupid than five to six teenagers (who do not work like normal ones), which can dance in different colors with similar benefits so that you can tell them Apple? Fans, have you ever joined an actual person who has been struggling against the psychological wall and almost got up immediately and struggled without being hurt? Power Rangers are for five-year-old boys, and believe me, I did not like this event at the age of five. <br /> <br /> I think you can call Dino Thunder an exception. Like teens and teenagers, ACT and Tommy Oliver actually work like a teacher, not a teacher. It's tragic, though it's a fight, I do not hate Dino Thunder. <br /> <br /> Many people say power rangers are shit, but I do not want to. It will be an insult to crap. So face it, five-year-old boys, electricity rangers garbage.
