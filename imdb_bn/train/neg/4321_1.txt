This was the big Christmas movie I've ever seen. I take my two small children to see this. It was the most dark, the most inferior plot - the family had no money, the mother lost her job, the father was killed in the bank, the bank robber stole the family car with both the kids and after high speed charges, the bridge closed and the river drowned. Mom left alone alone. No surprise that his Christmas spririt has gone. Christmas angels do not rescue children drowning, and Santa does not bring back the dead fathers! I had messages for sending these kids. Not saying to them that there is no Santa than to display a movie like them !!
