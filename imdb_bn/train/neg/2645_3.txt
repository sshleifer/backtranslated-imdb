Nelson Eddie and Jeanette McDonald's final pair are basically a full muffin. The script is poor and badly presented. There is no life in the film. Eddie and McDonald would be better than making a safe concert for their final pairing. There is nothing wrong with their singer, that this just overcooked everything else in Turkey.
