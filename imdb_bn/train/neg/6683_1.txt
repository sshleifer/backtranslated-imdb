I am glad that people at IMDB have been able to understand what type of trend has been read in this movie. I was suspected to be a comedy, but it seems like to be a dark and serious melodrama, I was not sure. For a comedy, it is surprisingly even in the case of humorous things - the comedy "packing" is finally up to the end, which ensures that the whole film is indeed a stupid time. It's hard to describe exactly how hazing is really amateur. Was that the idea of ​​anyone involved in this movie? Indeed, valuable observers can look at the scary disbelief on the screen and see how terrible it is.
