Sorry i miss something I went out early? The first ten minutes of unusual (and untrue!) Stories seemed to me "going to be this classic", but all the hills were down from here! The performance was brilliant, how wonderful was William H. Messi's price and I became better and better than every movie I see. But it could never connect. I was waiting for a big moment where all the stories were gathering together and then suddenly it rained ?? The author would say, "I am deeply moved how do I combine these stories together ... .yes that I will only bog down". I like cute movies, I like the weird movie but it was just weird and annoying. 4/10
