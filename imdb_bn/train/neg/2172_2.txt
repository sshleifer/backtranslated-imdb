Below the barrel, strangely, and effectively miraculously created by Rike Wardr. This image follows the right plot as the Filipino movie striker and is far worse! Bad acting, dialogue, impact, dubbing, pacing, verb sequence ... the list continues. In the early 80's, Italy's Road Warrior Rip-Offs made dozens, some good, some bad. This is the worst, no competition. Only the mood of the movie was completely silent and unfortunate, it takes more than one time. At the beginning of the film 1 (one) was in good cheezing order, and a man was a cool shot of a grenade blast. But everything else about this movie is very important! To make a real post-nick fun, follow a copy of ENDGAME, after the fall of the new era, or instead of getting SSC from Bronx. They are much more enjoyable than this garbage.
