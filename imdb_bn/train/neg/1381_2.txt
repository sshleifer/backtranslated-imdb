The light speaker is here. I'm spoiling this movie so that you can save the problem. <br /> <br /> One of the two sections of Jet Li's movie is read: Shawlin period films and films have been established in modern day Hong Kong, which revolve around Tridad or Tr√©id. Each section has its best and worst film. 'Twin Warriors' is the best Jet Li's Shaolin Flickr era, when The Evil Cult "its worst. In the recent past 'Feast of Legend' is the best 'modern era' in the movie Jat Lee. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> In exile, her 'new life' she is a pacifist librarian. The group was a hit when his old tenant, Jet Li is determined to stop them firmly. He secreted his identity from the police (and public) as a bookmaker, as well as a very ruthless cordless cardboard mask to conceal his former comrades' secret secret. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was dubbed, and that's terrific. Why did Lee win and hold his colleague of his library hostage? Have a love story among them? Why does the police chief take care of the real identity of Black Mask? Plot is just plain BAD. Superhero is bad on sugar, it is bad in the sense that the letters do not improve properly, it is worse among the interactions of its character, with all the half-explanated stories topped up. I have lost interest quickly. <br /> <br /> and the way on top of the martial arts sequence. Large amounts of blood and gore (plenty isolated parts of the body), explosions, and Matrix-style martial arts phikasosa film contains suparahiumyana. Unfortunately this movie is the best and only the selling point. If you are on a mission to Jet Li imapasobala style movie "Black Mask," delivers a bhijilyanta superhero would like to see it played. It is a true disappointment for the fans of Jet Li for the rest of us. This is a movie where Jett Lee can never be a Jet Li: He did not even have the opportunity to attract us with his charisma, and did not have the opportunity to impress us with his impressive but realistic martial arts expertise. /> <br /> Normally a film to me and countless <br Ozzy for a Chinese nakaphaphapha osabornera enough, sadly, "Black Mask," proved to be no exception to this rule. In fact, this movie is competing, the way he dressed, her long straight hair and trademark round sunglasses osabarnera Ozzy looks like a modern and older. But there is not enough screen to make the villain quickly. I think Awami opinion was deliberate! Along with the look of the villain, he ran a hidden in a satanic looking race. Ozzy Osbourne's villain could have been so much more than the geikic! If only writer, director, or anyone is disturbed for developing and developing the role of villain in the film, then <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> After Lethal Arms 4, and I I'm happy to stay away from it now. It may have ruined my entire idea as a whole martial artist and actor in the case of Jale Lea. If you want to see Jett Lee at his worst time, hire 'black mask' and 'the evil cast' and make it a double feature or a horror as both deliberately and strangers. Otherwise it takes that to use Jet Li's talent, and there are semi-well thought and potential plots. 3/9 stars.
