This movie is a 90 minute romance concert with a short period of stupidity and complete frustration. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br> /> <br /> This is completely unwatchable from the beginning. This movie should be called Ramon Fever. Everyone seems to like them in this movie. There is no plot available in this membrane. As far as teen comedies go, you are scraping the bottom of barrels with this one.
