Another horror flick which is a cave ball to fight a crazy and want to take his supernatural sidekick? Yes, but from Canada it gives this feeling slightly different. The "brain" problematic teenager Jim Majelewski is being treated to a leader whose leader turns out to be a worship leader of a big ugly "brain". Jim can stop him? I guess the neighboring neighbors have accomplished all the work done, so they have at least one ridiculous horror film making. But still, they probably want to be known for taking care of national health. <br /> <br /> The bad guy had his brain. Why do people make this movie?
