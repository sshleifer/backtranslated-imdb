It is clear that this movie was designed to appeal to Chuck Falque, which I have been doing quite a lot and enjoyed most. However, this is a very annoying endeavor for Gitar to become the next Meg Ryan (who gets annoyed like hell on his right side). Her performance was overdone and it seems that she was overwhelming compared to her colleagues who were discouraged in their role. There was a budget suitable for settings, actors and a decent story line, this film could be more. My wife and I both agreed that it was finally 'Mukuk', because the film ended at a painful embarrassing height! Later luck, hopefully, the sticks in the kind of film that Miss Graham is related to his helle.
