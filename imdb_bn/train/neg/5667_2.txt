Before renting this DVD from Netfix, I tested the IMDB, it took me several hours in my life. When I see that a film director wrote it, I really doubt it. In this case, according to the credit, the same person "writter and director" - unfortunately, this product is an indication of overall quality. There were some interesting moments (e.g., Judy Tennata's scene reminds Judy-Ismake of her first comedy routines), which led me to rate these two stars instead of one. However, those moments were very few and far away ... and I almost did not see them because in the beginning this sequence was almost impossible for me, it is not condemnable in the violence. I acknowledge that I went back again to look at that part so that I could miss something that I saw the whole thing once. No, even though I was at least recognized that the letters would become important later. The "spinning camera" technique was overused and basically vain. I talked to the TV screen myself: "What?!?" Or "For Righteousness, Meet It!" Not recommended.
