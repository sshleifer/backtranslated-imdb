"A movie of Ulie Lomel" does not fill me with hope, but I must admit that ZidHKiller will be submerged under my lowest expectation. Young filmmakers have the latest trends in using digital video for their initial projects, which are good and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without costing them to expensive movie stock. However, these young filmmakers focused on the concept of filtering out the whole film so that it would appear more qualitatively similar to celluloid. The effect is not perfect, but it helps. Unfiltered digital video really works only for "mockumentary" styles, it never looks like something other than video. There is a fundamental problem with ZODIAC Killer. Seeing the film, one day's soap opera looks like a murderer. It does not seem like watching a movie. Lampal is not a young film maker? He ought to know well. He is certainly impossible to generate awesome (or even suspense!) On the video This man has been instructed from the sixties for the love of God! He can be the only director who fails to improve his career in the 40-year career. He is lucky, he wrote the script! So you can expect strong steps that are meaningless, illogical behavior, and at least one of the most ugly plot elements that make you unhappy. Please miss this image. You'll thank me later.
