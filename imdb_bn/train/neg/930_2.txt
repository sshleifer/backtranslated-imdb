Some children are walking on the mountain, and they go into a big tunnel and discover some old mammified gladiators. He kept the helmet of Gladiator and spent the other film killing all other hikers. <br /> <br /> This matter is so stupid, it is shocking. Here is a short list that does not give any sense: <br /> <br /> 1) A man and a girl stay in their tents and they think they hear something outside. The guy goes out to investigate and finds another hiker outside. Then he listens to his girlfriend, so they come back to the tent again - the next morning? He was just 50 feet away! <br /> <br /> 2) Then these two dondheds hear another girl screaming (what, 100 feet away?), but do not investigate because they fear that they will be lost. <br /> <br /> 3) Another man and a girl are roaming around, and with their 10th scene, the girl tells the person that the circumstances do not have to address the protocol as her professor. I mean, what? First off, it's just a stupid thing to say, secondly that he was together called his professor in the first nine scenes. <br /> <br /> 4) An injured girl attacks Demonicus and she was stopped to stop him, telling him that the part of his gladiator training was to injure him without killing him. Um, yes, we noticed that he was injured and not dead because he was standing up. But thanks for that information. <br /> <br /> 5) A girl is locked in the Demonicas layer, and when someone tries to free her, she instead asks this person to go and get help. Um, look, fool, if he releases you, which takes about 5 seconds, then there will be no need to get help. <br /> <br /> And it just keeps going. The entire middle of the movie is spent with two idiots lost in idiots, then they fight, then they dig a tent and their friends scream, then they continue to spin a bit more. It's just so violent boring and the point that I turned halfway through the DVD. <br /> <br /> None of these characters are sympathetic, especially on screen times. When Demoncus personally saw me, he laughs loudly - he sees a child in Halloween dresses, thinks his face is bad. She runs, or I would say gay scampers like her. Special effects are comedic, acting is mostly awkward, and nothing understands. <br /> <br /> Overall, this idea may create a compelling cam film if they make more time and effort. It is releasing from ridiculous dialogue, creating characters with genuine personalities, there is some kind of logical flow of action, and even Demonicus has made a female character in the sexy gladiator props. But not, instead we get this foolish fool statue that will give birth to death.
