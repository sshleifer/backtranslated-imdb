Pokemon movie was a terrible film. Contrary to the first, this is not a good movie. The graphics were good but the story was flat and no real drama was created in it. The interaction between the first one letter was modest. Broke subtraction and adding trace were bad. Tracy does not really have a lot to say or do, and offers no comic relief opposite the brook. The only good point you've seen is that the fog actually becomes a jell around and it's entertaining to call his first boyfriend as his girlfriend. Overall, this film is not worth renting and the small film did nothing for me or my wife. And we think ourselves pokemon fans. Well, maybe next one would be better. Geo is worse
