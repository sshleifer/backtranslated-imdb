I was surprised to wonder that this movie got so good ratings, when I saw it and tested it on IMDB. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I have seen so many bad movies. It looks like a good movie at the beginning, but when I came to surgery I could not believe how bad it was. Destroy everything in this voice-over! Just imagine that you're open like him and then listen to what he's saying. I saw the movie in Germany so I did not know what I said in English, but "yes, it does not hurt" .... what is this? Tell yourself "think about something else" and then forget about your girlfriend thinking about your pain ... Fool. And his mother ... how does he do that? Someone came to tell him, his son had died in the surgery (what he expected). Plus he found some letters of Jessica Albas bags. Plus that "he knows in the hospital" stuff ... and then it takes his "one second" to find it out? what happened? ^^ Ending, why police are killing them? The patient died in the surgery, all that happened. That drunk doctor does not know anything else ... and then they bust even all of them, even the girlfriend ??? Why ??? I think that despite all the things that Kristisen has done bad, it does not really count me ... the mistakes and idiots I have written above are the problems. I saw this picture with some friends and we were all very frustrated ... as I said, one of the worst movies I have ever seen ... just do not see it;)
