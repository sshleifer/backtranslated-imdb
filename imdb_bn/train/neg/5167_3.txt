I rate this movie with three pillars, only girls have to scream, girls knew that if the performers were good, then the movie could have been better, the pair was right, I believe they were bad, but the big and the younger brother, they sucked really bad , They seem to have read the script instead of acting them .... spoiler: Why are they blood clots why they are blood concrete? Vampires can not drink frozen blood, the sister of the movie says that she should drink while she is alive ... but then when they are going to another house, they take frozen blood. It was a huge waste, and it made me crazy cage, how wonderful I was this film, how much awards the movie was, and this movie was f * *** IS ** !!!!
