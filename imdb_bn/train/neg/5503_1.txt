I grew up to watch the original TV series in 60 seconds and one thing I can tell you directly, there is no comparison. This picture was completely ridiculous with a flying case alive. A martian that adopts different shapes A small child who has created such a special effect On the contrary, basically, the letters developed and the viewers created a feeling for Team and Uncle Martin. The only brightness of this movie, yes, was actually there, when Ron Wallston finally ended. He used to wear dark glasses and made reference to the residence for 30 years on this planet as a tribute to the TV series. But even the real aunt Martin could not save this turkey.
