First Power (1990) is a horror film that came out in the late '80s or in the early 90's of horror films created inexpensively. I found this photo very annoying but some parts are found very ridiculous. This film is so funny and lack of credibility that it is not funny. In comparison to the instant trial system, Texas looks relatively weak. Lou Diamond Phillips plays this role on his head (he plays a tough high) and Tracy Griffith (Melanie's more interesting sister) played a psychic. Do not waste your time with this one because it's bad. What a minute, I take it back. This movie makes a great party film. Look at the non packing switchblade cruciform, he has the most beautiful legs that I've ever seen in a nun, which was not in a Jesus Franco nonploitation flick. Yo! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> It was DTV. A few years later, for her "research" till then. <br /> <br /> Do not recommend if you are not disappointed.
