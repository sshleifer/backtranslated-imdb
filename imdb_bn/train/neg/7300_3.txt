This photo is about a group of five friends who hire a wooden cabin. One of the friends catches a terrible meat eating virus. Suddenly, friends hate each other and try to protect themselves from infection. <br /> <br /> "Cabin Fover" is a horror movie. For one, it tries to be many styles at once. Is it supposed to be a scary movie with a tribute, a slash, a black comedy, or an unexpected comedy? Nobody can say that. The first and a second change have a serious view, it turns out to be fun. When the film tries to be funny, humor is quite soft after the end. I loved the last lot. <br /> <br /> Finally, I was quite frustrated and disgusted. Violence is worth scinging, looking away from the screens of scared ones. Tone changes in every scene, sometimes fun, sometimes scary, and sometimes quite random. In fact, you see a girl doing karate at slo speed. We are supposed to get from that? These same girl characters will bite one. That was supposed to be funny? I do not know. <br /> <br /> Some performance was good, and many were quite amateur. I do not care for most of the characters. I like the plot but are executed. As a horror movie, I do not know what it is trying to do. I could not find it funny, tense, or scary. In the end, you are indifferent, thinking, "What have I been through?" Unfortunately, you did not know the answer to that question.
